Fortunately, help is on the way. In July of last year, President Trump nominated Chip Campbell to serve in Tennessee's Middle District and Tommy Parker to serve in the Western I was pleased to see the President select such qualified individuals, and I thank him and his counsel, Don McGahn, for working with us throughout this process. I was equally pleased to see the Senate Judiciary Committee approve both nominations by voice vote last And it is easy to see why Tennesseans are excited about these nominees, too.  Chip Campbell is a graduate of the U.Naval Academy and the University of Alabama School of Before attending law school, Mr.Campbell[[Page S89]]served as a naval flight officer in the U.Marine He began his career in private practice with Maynard, Cooper & Gale in Birmingham, before moving and joining the Nashville firm of Riley, Warnock & Today he is a partner at Frost Brown Todd in Nashville, where he chairs the competition law section of the business litigation practice group.

But today's votes are a good start.  Chip Campbell and Tommy Parker will be assets to the Federal bench, and Tennessee is fortunate to have such well-qualified nominees. These are men of good character and good temperament, and today I encourage my colleagues to support their nominations.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Portman). Under the previous order, all postcloture time is considered expired.  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the Campbell nomination?

This week, President Trump highlighted rural America when he addressed the American Farm Bureau Federation's national convention, making him the first President to do so since George H.Bush in 1992.  In his address, President Trump pledged to work with Congress to pass the farm bill on time, critical legislation that supports our farmers. I am a proud member of the House Agriculture Committee, and we have already been hard at work crafting this year's legislation.  The President also signed an executive order expanding access to rural broadband. In today's world, broadband is not a luxury; it is critical and a necessity. My constituents need accessible, affordable rural broadband in their homes, schools, and businesses. It is critical for economic development.  President Trump is implementing concrete solutions to make a difference for my constituents in rural Georgia as well as Americans across this Together with the Trump administration and my colleagues in Congress, I will continue my hard work to ensure that rural America is never forgotten.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-11-pt1-PgH163-2.txt,2239,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2018.0,11.0,January

Mr.Speaker, the underlying bill and the USA RIGHTS amendment present a stark choice.[[Page H157]]  The underlying bill allows the government to warrantlessly collect an astounding volume of Americans' communications, makes no material reforms to the collection and use of that data against Americans, and explicitly allows even more surveillance than the law currently permits.  In contrast, USA RIGHTS allows the government to conduct broad foreign surveillance and share intelligence throughout the relevant agencies, but it also adds protections to prevent the erosion of Americans' Fourth Amendment rights.  These are two very different options, Mr.Speaker, but for all of us who care about civil liberties, who believe the United States can protect itself without retiring the Fourth Amendment, and who believe Congress has an independent obligation to protect the Constitution, the choice is clear: support the USA RIGHTS amendment.

157,topic-id,881,"Mr.President, when we were debating the tax relief law--the tax reduction law, the tax cut law--Republicans predicted that it would be very good for the people of our country. Democrats like Nancy Pelosi predicted that it would be ``Armageddon.'' She said it would be the ``end of the world.'' Well, that was just last month, and it is already very clear to me that we have won the argument. People across the country are seeing the benefits. Thanks to this Republican tax relief law, Nancy Pelosi is seeing that hard-working Americans have actually won as a result of this law being passed.  Businesses around the country have begun turning those tax cuts into higher wages for many workers. Almost every day there is another business announcement about bonuses of more than $1,000 for workers. We are seeing it for hundreds of thousands of workers at businesses all across the country. They are raising wages and also investing millions of dollars back into the workers who make the companies so productive for our country.  Democrats are just wrong about tax reform. I am hearing it at home as I visit with people and stop in the drugstore and the grocery store around the State of They are saying: Look, anybody who does the math sees that it is a good deal for them. It doubled the standard deduction, lowered the rates, and raised the child tax credit. All of these things have been very, very helpful, certainly, to people in my State of  It is interesting listening to Democrats because they think they have great ideas, and they are just proven wrong about the facts. One of the ones I want to talk about today is something that the Senator from Vermont has been talking about with regard to healthcare. He has essentially wanted to scrap the U.healthcare system and replace it with a government-run system.  As he said, the current system under ObamaCare is the most bureaucratic, inefficient, and expensive system in the world. He often points to a single-payer system--sort of what they have right now in Great Of course, who would be paying for that? That would be the American taxpayers dealing with the incredible expenses of a program like that.  I want to point out what is actually happening today in Great Britain, in the system that the Senator from Vermont--the father of an American single-payer plan, one that a number of Democrats have signed on to--where the authorities in Great Britain just told hospitals to cancel 50,000 operations in January and to put them off until next month because they are just too busy doing other things. So scheduled operations were canceled. Now, these are surgeries for things like cataracts, knee replacements, and hip replacements.  Facilities are turning away all but the most urgent cases in need of care. They are closing outpatient clinics. Why? Because it is winter, and it is flu season, and the British healthcare system, based on a single-payer, taxpayer-run system, is not prepared to deal with the needs of the people of that country.  So hospitals across the country of Great Britain have canceled surgeries that have been planned and for which people had decided to take off time from work to have done according to their schedules. Forget it; they have been delayed.  One doctor in England actually said that they are seeing, in his words, ``third-world conditions''--third world conditions, describing the British healthcare system today. This was an[[Page S32]]Army doctor who did three tours at a field hospital in Afghanistan, somebody who knows what third-world conditions are truly like.  An article in the British newspaper the Guardian, out yesterday, said: ``Hospitals are reporting growing chaos''--growing chaos--``with a spike in winter flu leaving frail patients facing 12-hour waits, and some units are running out of corridor space''--corridor space.  Now, that is what the situation is like in British hospitals right now, today. It turns out it happened before in Great Last winter, they had a similar problem with too many sick people and not enough options for care. Back then, the British Red Cross called the situation a ``humanitarian crisis.''  In today's New York Times--this morning's edition, page 9--talking about the British healthcare system and the problems with it, the chief executive of the National Health Service in England, Simon Stevens, in a speech to Parliament, recently said: ``The N.H.waiting list will grow to five million people'' coming down the line--grow to 5 million people. How would the American people like to be one of 5 million people waiting to get an appointment, waiting for an operation, in the waiting line? That is what Senator Sanders and the Democrats who propose this government-run system are talking about for our country.  The scenes unfolding across hospitals in Britain--and I will describe one that is outline and written about today in the New York It says:       Tuesday night, the emergency ward at Kingston Hospital in      southwestern London looked more like an airport lounge than a      hospital, with patients sprawled out in the waiting room.       ``There's no real system or order; it's a jungle in here,''      said Nancy Harper, who had accompanied her 87-year-old      grandmother, who was lying down and complaining of      excruciating pain in her lower back.       ``It's been more than five hours,'' ",CREC-2018-01-04-pt1-PgS29-2.txt,1881,SUPPORTING THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE OF IRAN TO FREE EXPRESSION,2018.0,4.0,January

785,topic-id,691,"Madam President, when we were debating the tax relief law at the end of last year, it was a very familiar debate in many ways.  Republicans came to the floor with facts and figures on how much extra money people were going to see in their pockets and their paychecks. Democrats came to the floor with the same old tired line that you always hear them talk about--the millionaires and billionaires.  Republicans pointed out economic studies that showed that workers right now pay more than 70 percent of the cost of corporate taxes. We talked about a study by the Tax Foundation that predicted that if we passed the tax relief bill, the average family would actually see a gain of about $2,600 a year in their after-tax income. It was partly because of getting the tax cut and partly because their employers would then pass on much of the tax cut in higher wages. Democrats didn't believe it. They said that only rich people would benefit and that businesses would never share their tax savings with the workers. The Democratic leader said that ``tax cuts like these benefit the wealthy and the powerful to the exclusion of the middle class.''  Here we are. It is the month after we passed the tax relief bill, the tax reduction bill, and the tax simplification bill, and the question is, Who was right? The very day the tax bill passed in Congress, AT&T came out and said it was giving its workers a bonus. It said that 200,000 hard-working employees were going to get an extra $1,000 each directly because of the new tax relief, tax reduction, tax cut bill. The Tax Foundation predicted that they would eventually get an extra $2,600, and these people are already getting $1,000 each on day one.  That has opened the floodgates to other companies doing the exact same thing and employees around the country experiencing the exact same thing. Businesses started sharing the tax savings with rank-and-file, middle-class workers, and it started on day one--not just the wealthy and the powerful, as Senator Schumer has predicted. Over 120 companies have said they are raising wages, giving out bonuses, and investing in their workers because of the tax law. It adds up to over $980 million--$980 million in the pockets of hard-working men and women around the country. How many people are seeing that? By last count, almost 1 million hard-working Americans--over 970,000 hard-working Americans have already gotten the good news.  There is more good news coming every day, with more announcements today. It is exactly what Republicans said would happen. It is happening for people who work at banks, who work at insurance companies, who work at airlines. It is happening for people who work at big companies, such as AT&T, Visa, and Comcast, but it is also happening for people who work at smaller companies, such as a winery in California and an aviation company in These are businesses and people in communities who are important parts of their communities and doing important jobs. The employees work hard, and now they are getting a share of the relief the Republicans had predicted they would get all along. And they are not just getting cash bonuses. There is a bank in Massachusetts called Berkshire Hills They announced last week that the people working there will be getting a $1,000 bonus and will also see the minimum wage raised to $15 an hour.  More is being invested in employee development and training programs. When you invest more in employee development and training programs, that means people are going to have additional skills that make them even more productive, better at their jobs, and qualify for even higher wages.  This bank in Massachusetts is also contributing an extra $2 million to its charitable efforts, including scholarships. That helps improve the communities where the workers live and where they raise their families.  Democrats said it is not going to happen. It has happened. It is happening every day. They said that businesses would keep the money for themselves. That is not what we are seeing all across the country.

Multiple generations of patients benefited from Howard's caring and compassionate approach to medicine. From Willson's perspective, being entrusted to care for his neighbors was the highest compliment he could receive.  While Howard Willson made his greatest impact in Wyoming, he was born in the small town of Spring Lake, After completing his undergraduate degree from Florida State University, he was commissioned as an officer in the U.Air Howard then attended medical school at the University of Florida and graduated in 1965. After graduation from medical school, he completed his internship at the U.Air Force Hospital at Andrews Air Force In total, Willson served in the Air Force for 10 years, eventually rising to the rank of captain.  Over the next several years, Willson practiced medicine in Florida, where he served as an active member of the medical community. Then in 1976, he decided to make the move to Wyoming, a decision that has benefited the people of our State ever since. Howard began his practice in the town of Basin and eventually moved to Once he arrived in Wyoming, Howard not only became a valued doctor, but also an energetic member of the community.  He quickly became active in his county's medical society and in the Wyoming Medical Society, eventually becoming president of the Wyoming Medical Society in 1986. In addition, he was an active leader of the medical staff of two different Wyoming hospitals, South Big Horn County Hospital and Hot Springs County Memorial  In addition to his active medical practice, Willson was passionate about training the next generation of Wyoming healthcare providers. In particular, Howard wanted to introduce medical students to the joys and rewards of working in rural communities. This is why he was an active preceptor in the Wyoming Family Practice program for over 20 years.  To this day, medical students in Wyoming are benefiting from Willson's passion for medical education. This is because he was vital in bringing the WWAMI medical education program to Folks in Wyoming are now very familiar with this program, which allows students from Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho to attend medical school at the University of Wyoming joined this unique and highly effective program in 1996. As Professor Joe Steiner, former dean of the University of Wyoming's College of Health Sciences, said, ``Howard Willson was instrumental in bringing WWAMI to He was also a strong supporter of all health care professions and was eager to share his knowledge with students.''  Aside from teaching, Willson was passionate about improving the quality of healthcare received by Wyoming patients. He served as medical director of Mountain-Pacific Quality Health Foundation-This organization is dedicated to working with Medicare to lower the cost and improve the quality of healthcare. In particular, Howard understood that achieving this goal meant serving as a partner with providers and healthcare facilities. It was through this work that virtually all the patients in Wyoming were helped by Howard's work, even though they never knew it.  Finally, Howard knew the importance of public health in helping keep folks well. He served as the public health officer for Hot Springs County, starting in 2004. It was only with deep regret that the board of commissioners accepted his resignation in 2016. These folks knew what an impact Willson had made on their community.  Outside of medicine, Howard was always involved in the local communities in which he lived. The Governor of Wyoming appointed Howard to the University of Wyoming's board of trustees. He served the university with distinction from 2003 to 2015. Simply put, all the students of the University of Wyoming benefited from Howard's passion for making sure that everyone in our state could get a great education.  Clearly Howard Willson is one of the most accomplished doctors in the history of I can think of no person more deserving of being our State's Physician of the  In closing, I would like to congratulate Howard, his wife, Belenda, and their six children on this most well-deserved achievement.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-11-pt1-PgS166-2.txt,1881,RAPID DNA ACT OF 2017,2018.0,11.0,January

Specifically, this bill provides an avenue for third-party testing of innovative technology screening capabilities to enhance airport security. The testing program authorized under this act shall include evaluating the performance of detecting explosives and other prohibited items.

However, the standards in place are generally broad, leaving potential vulnerabilities through inconsistencies with international partners.

224,topic-id,534,"Mr.Speaker, Friday, the Trump administration declared war on State legalization of marijuana as they come out on the wrong side of history and the American public.  The Obama administration recognized that the vast voter-driven movement to legalize marijuana at the State level was something that couldn't be stopped and, in fact, that the Federal Government shouldn't interfere. Their Justice Department issued guidance, known as the Cole amendment, that, as long as these voter-approved State legalization efforts were enforced rigorously and thoughtfully, the Federal Government wouldn't interfere with what the voters wanted.  Friday, Sessions and the Trump administration overruled that guidance and declared open war on the part of 93 U.attorneys to feel free to interfere with what local voters have decided.  This is strongly opposed by the American public. Over 60 percent in poll after poll show that Americans favor legalization of marijuana. When it deals with medical marijuana, that percentage is over 90 percent. We have seen State after State, approve medical marijuana including Florida, with a 71 percent ``yes'' vote in November of 2016.  If the question is, regardless of how you feel about marijuana, should the Federal Government interfere with what the voters have decided, three out of four voters say the Federal Government should keep their hands off it.  Luckily, at least as far as medical marijuana is concerned, they are protected from interference by the Justice Department because of the amendment that I have authored with my friend Dana It is in the continuing resolution. It needs to be in any long-term funding bill. In fact, we should embrace an amendment by our colleague Tom McClintock from California, that would expand those protections to any State legal marijuana activity.  The Justice Department is not just on the wrong side of history and the American public, they are missing a chance to cure the damage caused by selective and cruel enforcement of marijuana laws. We are still arresting tens of thousands--mostly young men of color, especially African-American men--for something the majority of Americans now think should be legal.  We miss a chance to win the war against opioid death and addiction. In States that have medical marijuana--surprise--there are fewer pills prescribed. The longer the States have had medical marijuana, the lower the overdose deaths. In California, which has had medical marijuana the longest, there are a third fewer opioid deaths. We are missing an opportunity to build on that.  We are missing the opportunity to increase the hundreds of millions of dollars that are now going to the State tax coffers to deal with education and addiction and law enforcement through State legal efforts and away from the drug cartels and the black market. Indeed, if we clean up this mess, we will have billions of dollars to devote to public purposes and further undermine the strength of drug cartels that use the black market to fund their efforts.  It is past time that Congress steps up and fixes this mess.  The good news is this reckless action by the Trump administration and Jeff Sessions will accelerate the time that we support what State and local governments should do: rationalize our cannabis policy and stop this ineffective, failed prohibition.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-09-pt1-PgH21-4.txt,99,DIRECTING THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO DEVELOP A STRATEGY TO REGAIN,2018.0,9.0,January
666,topic-id,693,"Mr.Speaker, one of the phrases one often hears is, ``I hate to say I told you so.'' And it is delivered with a feigned sincerity, but usually people actually like to say, ``I told you so.''  I must confess that I have some of those feelings myself, as repeatedly during the few hours the Ways and Means Committee met, rushing through the massive tax cut, the largest transfer of wealth in our Nation's history, which will be paid for on the backs of our children and grandchildren with increased debt and benefiting people who in the main don't need it--I said at the time that each week after this bill passed, if it did, we would have a series of embarrassing stories about mistakes and oversight and special interest provisions that were stuck into it.  Well, actually, the fact is that that was somewhat understated because we are seeing, literally, every day people understand what was tucked in the bill: mistakes, oversight, and special interest provisions.  For example, there is a provision in the bill that was, we were told, designed to help small craft brewers. That is important to me and the people I represent, and there is broad support for minor provisions that would be able to help them by reducing their tax liability. But the provision that ended up in the final bill has massive opportunities to benefit large producers--a little bit for small craft brewers, but for large, international distillers, an opportunity to reconfigure how they do business to take advantage of multiple opportunities for that tax break.  There was an article yesterday talking about how the tax rate for American companies that manufacture overseas, the tax on that activity will be half as much as if they were manufacturing in the United States, providing an incentive to offshore jobs at a time when most of us would like to make sure that it is, here at home, at least, a level playing field, not to disadvantage people manufacturing here at home.  And, of course, there is another story in today's Wall Street Journal, ``Tax Law's Effect Fuels Farm Outcry,'' because there was a provision inserted in the bill that would give farmers a more lucrative deduction when they sell agricultural products directly to farm cooperatives. There is a story about one gentleman in there who felt that this could put him out of business. It is going to sting large agribusinesses like Cargill and Archer Daniels The new provision could reshape parts of the agriculture economy and sharply reduce many farmers' taxes as well as scrambling these individual businesses.  John Power, a North Dakota accountant who was the accountant for the small grain operator who is going to be hammered, said: ``It is kind of hard to imagine they intended to make farming tax free. Fixing it becomes difficult because they don't think it's something that can be fixed with regulation.''  There are a variety of these provisions that are a result of not following what we call ``regular order,'' without having hearings on the provision, of allowing lobbyists and staff to be able to draft the bill on the fly without having members of the committee--not just Democrats, but Republicans--fully know what was in it. That is legislative malpractice. It is one of the reasons why, despite giving over $3 trillion of tax cuts, the bill remains unpopular.  Americans are nervous about increasing our national debt over $2 trillion, and they know that the benefits for average citizens are going to go away in a few years and some are actually going to see tax increases, but the benefits for the top 1 percent and the largest corporations are permanent.  People know that it is not fair, that it is unnecessary, and that it is going to have more and more problems here, not just in States like mine where citizens are no longer going to be able to fully deduct their State and local taxes, property taxes, resulting in significant inequity, in scrambling property values, not just in Oregon, but it is across the country where people are going to be facing these problems.[[Page H86]]                            ____________________",CREC-2018-01-10-pt1-PgH85-4.txt,99,TAIWAN TRAVEL ACT,2018.0,10.0,January

156,topic-id,1538,"Mr.President, I am here to talk about our fellow Americans in Puerto Even as the Northeast is gripped by a storm of impressive proportions, Puerto Rico is still recovering from the hurricane that hit that island 106 days ago.  I visited Puerto Rico with my friend and colleague, Senator Murphy, yesterday and the day before, to bring back to my colleagues a fact-based report on how the recovery effort is going and how ample Federal support has been.  I come to the floor today furious and frustrated. The people of Puerto Rico have a right to be furious, as well, because they have been denied the basic help and relief that this great Nation--the greatest in the history of the world--owes to all  Let there be no doubt that the people of Puerto Rico are our fellow They have fought in our wars. They have come to the mainland and gone back, contributing to our communities, as well as theirs.  They are in our communities in Connecticut, which has the highest concentration of people from Puerto Rico and their descendants of any State in the country. We are proud of the Puerto Ricans in Connecticut and of the Puerto Rican families and people who are coming from the mainland in an exodus unmatched in recent history.  The reason for that out-migration is that Puerto Rico is in the midst of a humanitarian and economic crisis. Let me repeat that. Puerto Rico is in a humanitarian and economic crisis 106 days after Hurricane  It is still in triage. Half of the population lacks reliable electricity. Almost half lacks drinkable, healthy water. The tourist industry--the lifeblood of its economy--is shrinking and struggling. About half the hotels still are not open, and the unemployment rate is well above 10 percent--double the rate of unemployment here on the mainland. Housing continues to be a major problem. Of the homes that need temporary relief, only half of them have been provided the blue tarps because they have not been delivered.  I want to pay tribute to the first responders, the Corps of Engineers, and FEMA workers, as well as the National Guard from Connecticut and elsewhere who are on the ground serving and sacrificing for their fellow They lack the support they need in resources and commitment from the administration and from this Resources and support have been denied them because of a lack of will, not a lack of money.  Many of the schools there are shuttered, and students have been denied the privilege to continue their education. The healthcare system of the island is still in shambles. Primary care is struggling to recover because of the lack of electricity. A doctor's office simply cannot run without electricity, nor can manufacturing plants be operated without a reliable source of power.  In restoring power, the Corps of Engineers has provided generators in places where formerly there were plants actually producing power. Generators are a temporary source of power, not a reliable permanent source. Transmission is still down in many parts of the country.  To add insult to injury, Puerto Rico is stuck with a tax as a result of the action of this Congress and the administration--a tax imposed only on manufacturing in foreign countries. Puerto Rico is treated as a foreign country for purposes of the 12.5 percent tax on certain manufacturers. That is simply unconscionable. Manufacturing plants will soon be facing the decision of whether to stay or go, and many of them will go, adding to the unemployment situation there.  It is heartbreaking and gut-wrenching to visit this island and to walk in a neighborhood, as Senator Murphy and I did on Wednesday night, and find darkness after the sun goes down--total darkness, except for a few isolated lights here and there. How can students study? How can parents care for children?  On that Tuesday night, we walked through a neighborhood in downtown San Juan that was dark because of the lack of electricity. There simply are not enough generators for every home to have one. Generators, themselves, are only a stopgap source of power.  The human faces and voices are gripping and riveting from the suffering[[Page S31]]that people in Puerto Rico--our fellow Americans--still endure. The lack of Federal commitment and response is shameful and disgraceful.  There are steps that we must take immediately. In the short-term relief package that is coming to us from the House of Representatives, we must make sure that some of that aid--a significant proportion--is specifically targeted to Puerto The number requested by the Governor is $94 billion. It is a number that is fully and amply supported by fact. The total package coming from the House is only $81 billion, and it is supposed to cover expenses in Florida and Texas as well as Puerto Rico and the Virgin So that number has to be vastly increased. Longer term, there must be a change in the Tax Code to eliminate that 12.5 or 13 percent tax that discriminates against Puerto Rico as if it were a foreign country and as if the residents in Puerto Rico were citizens of another country. They are  The Medicaid formula must be changed so that it is fair to Puerto The 20 percent commitment that now goes to Puerto Rico, unlike other States, must be increased so as to treat Puerto Rico, in fact, as if it were a State and so that it is given an adequate match.  These kinds of commonsense steps must be the beginning of more than just repair and more than just rebuilding. It must be a full recovery with a vision for the future.  I have proposed, with Senator Sanders and others of our colleagues, a Marshall Plan for Puerto That is the kind of commitment that is necessary. The $150 billion includes not only the $94 billion that is necessary to repair and recover right away but a longer term plan to enable the island to be back on its feet financially, to recover from the near bankruptcy that it is enduring, to able its institutions to function fully, and to permit its healthcare system to rely on electricity from plants that are powered in an economic and environmentally friendly way.  There is, sadly, the hint also of potential corruption in the Whitefish contract that now has been withdrawn and in the Bronze Star contract for tarps that is under review. Investigations must be concluded quickly and thoroughly so that we are assured that Federal dollars are being used honestly and effectively.  We must make a commitment to use the island's natural advantages. Electricity is essential. It is not a luxury, not a convenience. It is vital. It is the lifeblood of that island economically and humanly. One of the island's great advantages is its sunlight. Solar has to be used more effectively and widely as a source of power.  My hope is that we can make this disaster relief program a Marshall Plan-like program for the island in the long term with bipartisan support.  There is nothing political about a neighborhood in darkness, about children unable to go to school, about health facilities closed, electricity lacking, and water undrinkable. These are basic needs that we have an obligation to come together on both sides of the aisle and meet.  I hope that we will do so and that we will match the resilience and resolve that I saw in meeting with Governor Rossello and all of his team. The island's residents and FEMA and other Federal workers were also there.  Governor Rossello has provided the kind of courage and commitment that are necessary to lead his people in this time of challenge. We must match the courage and strength of the residents on the island with equal resolve here that we will meet the needs of our fellow Americans and that we will keep our commitment, as we do always in times of crisis, to rebuild and to recommit and make sure that we leave no one there behind.  I am proud that we are working with Governor After meeting with him yesterday and after meeting with him in the wake of the hurricane when I first visited--I had the privilege of flying over the island, and I saw the devastation, with whole villages destroyed, houses and community centers completely razed--progress has been made. Governor Rossello is to be commended for his continuing perseverance, as well as the people of Puerto Rico in their resolve and resilience, but we must now do our part and match that resilience and resolve with a true commitment that we will leave no American behind and keep faith with the people of Puerto  I am proud that many in the Puerto Rican community in Connecticut have shared their stories with me, and I look forward to returning to them this weekend and sharing my stories with them of their families and their friends on that island.

521,topic-id,1442,"Mr.President, every day in America--the greatest Nation in the history of the world--children, young women, and teenagers are sold for sex. That is not a proud fact about America, but it is the stark reality. Every day in America, young women, children, and teenagers are trafficked, in large part because they are advertised now on the internet, in the open, visibly, and obviously. Even though code words may be used and sometimes doctored photographs, they are sold for sex because the traffickers are able to do so using the internet. We are here to stop it. We are here today to stop the trafficking and, most importantly, to stop the advertising.  In support of a measure, known as the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, SESTA, we have a strong bipartisan coalition. This bill is about as bipartisan as any bill is. I have worked on this legislation together with my colleague and friend, Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, from the very beginning. We have been joined in this effort by two Democrats and two Republicans--Senators McCaskill, Heitkamp, Cornyn, and We are passionate about this effort, and so are our colleagues who have joined us, because it is about those victims--those children, teenagers, and young women--who are sold for sex, who are trafficked on the internet. We want to give those victims a voice and a day in court, a right of action, a defense against this absolutely heinous, atrocious, inhumane crime. It is a crime and it can be prosecuted, but the victims deserve a day in court and a voice as well. That is the fundamental, core purpose of this legislation. It is about the victims.  We have been joined in this effort by advocates for those victims--sex trafficking survivors themselves and a diligent, bipartisan coalition of colleagues. In fact, more than 60 of our colleagues have joined this as cosponsors. We are now at a critical milestone for this bill. We have reached a point of momentum that makes this bill unstoppable if those survivors are to be heard and heeded, and I urge my colleagues to do exactly that. SESTA is really the product of stakeholder consensus. It has the support of every major human trafficking organization, of law enforcement, and of all of the major tech companies.  In essence, SESTA would clarify that section 230 of the Communications Decency Act was never intended to protect websites that facilitate sex trafficking, and it would ensure that those survivors get their day in court. It stands in stark contrast to a measure in the House of Representatives that has been approved by the relevant committee there, which would fail in that effort. Websites that knowingly facilitate sex trafficking should be afforded no protection under the Communications Decency They should be given no harbor or implicit approval, which is what the legislation now does. The House bill, unfortunately, would fail to give those survivors and victims their day in court and the voice that they so desperately need.  Senator Portman and I--and I am proud to be joined with him today on the floor--have championed this cause as a result of what we have seen and heard. In fact, in going back almost a decade, when I was attorney general for the State of Connecticut, I saw firsthand the way that websites can knowingly facilitate sex trafficking. I saw firsthand how challenging it was for law enforcement to develop cases against sex traffickers and employ anti-trafficking laws given the constraints on their resources, especially when those sex traffickers were able to use the internet to reach their customers. My experience in combating sex trafficking as attorney general at the State level led me, in my working with Senator Portman, to co-launch and co-chair the Senate Caucus to End Human Trafficking so as to help find solutions to this problem and others around the world whereby children and teenagers and others are sex-trafficked and victimized.  As the State attorney general, I concluded that facilitating sex trafficking must face repercussions. I was joined by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which reported and has since reported the numbers. For example, there has been an 846-percent increase in reports of suspected child sex trafficking from 2010 to 2015--a spike it found to be ``directly correlated to the increased use of the internet to sell children for sex.'' We have heard of some of those instances, of some of the histories and the stories of these young people.  In 2012, a 15-year-old girl ran away from home. Over the next 2 years, pimps trafficked her for sex through these ads. As a result, she was raped over 1,000 times while she was moved from one site to another with the aid of the internet. In 2010, another 15-year-old girl ran away from a residential program. A pimp began to traffic her for sex by posting online ads. As a result, she was raped 900 times over the next 2 years.  These two young women and a third mustered the courage to tell their stories and to bring a lawsuit against backpage.com, which is the website that has profited most prominently from these online ads. These advertisements graphically emphasized the survivors' and victims' youth and other characteristics in trafficking them for sex. Yet the courts, understandably and perhaps rightly, have held that backpage.com and these internet sites generally have no legal responsibility. The First Circuit Court of Appeals found that backpage.com was immune from civil liability because of section 230 of the Communications Decency  Websites that facilitate sex trafficking unconscionably and intolerably are now immune from legal action by survivors. That is unacceptable in No matter how terrible the harm they cause, no matter how horrific the consequences to these young people, they are protected by a shield from moral and legal responsibility. In a sense, these women were victimized as much by backpage.com and the internet as they were by the pimps who more directly sold them.  Senator Portman and I, through SESTA, would implement three key reforms: 1, allow victims of sex trafficking to seek justice against websites that knowingly facilitate their victimization; 2, clarify that it is illegal to knowingly facilitate a violation of the Federal sex trafficking laws; and 3, enable State law enforcement officials, not just the Federal Department of Justice, to take action against individuals or businesses that violate Federal sex trafficking laws.  If websites are not knowingly facilitating sex trafficking, they should have nothing to fear from the law. If[[Page S86]]websites are doing their best to avoid facilitating sex trafficking, they have no worry about their liability. Yet, if they knowingly facilitate, they ought to face survivors and victims in court, and they ought to acknowledge and recognize their legal and moral responsibilities.  I want to be very blunt with my colleagues here about the House bill because my feeling is that we owe it to those survivors and victims to give them not just nice words and rhetoric but real rights. Congress must not only pass an online sex trafficking law; it must pass real sex trafficking internet protection. Unfortunately, the House Judiciary Committee recently passed legislation that fails to accomplish that goal.  My colleagues should not be fooled--the House bill is in no way an adequate alternative to It is, unfortunately, completely insufficient in protecting survivors and victims and giving them that day in court and that voice they now lack. The difference between the House and Senate bills is stark and clear, like night and day. The Senate bill gives victims of trafficking their day in court. The House bill does not give a single survivor or victim access to justice. It fails to open the courthouse doors; it leaves them shut. In fact, it may even deny victims and survivors their right to file legal action. The Senate bill has the support of every major human trafficking organization, as well as of all of the major stakeholders. The House bill is supported by none--zero--no major group. In fact, 47 organizations and more than a dozen survivors and family members recently sent a letter that calls for the House bill, as it is presently written, to be rejected.  I strongly urge my colleagues to join this bipartisan group of more than 60 of us who are supporting SESTA to help pass this essential legislation as soon as possible. We owe it to those survivors and victims. We owe it to ourselves. We owe it to  I am proud to yield to my friend and colleague who has joined in this effort and has been such a steadfast champion, Senator  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2018-01-09-pt1-PgS85-2.txt,2076,SUPPORTING THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE OF IRAN TO FREE EXPRESSION,2018.0,9.0,January

545,topic-id,1660,"Mr.Buchwald wrote a satirical list of tactics Republicans were using to keep Americans from focusing on the Watergate scandal. The list is eerily familiar. The tactics being employed by the Trump supporters today ring of those same tactics used in Buchwald suggests focusing on accusations made against prominent Democrats or individuals who had accused Richard Nixon of wrongdoing. He suggests attacking the media. He suggests saying: ``The Democrats are sore because they lost.'' He suggests deflecting blame to a ``bunch of eager kids''--perhaps sounding like the reference to ``coffee boys'' today--and saying that this investigation is ``bad for the dollar,'' much like bad for America abroad.  I am very confident--and I want to emphasize this point very emphatically--that the special counsel will be in no way distracted from his investigation and his team will be undeterred by these tactics. But the American people should not be distracted or deterred either and, equally important, the Judiciary Committee, the U.Senate, and the Congress as a whole has a duty here that is, in fact, vulnerable to that same distraction. We must persevere.  What our Republican colleagues are doing at this point is indicated by a recent New York Times article. The article describes President Trump's efforts to persuade congressional allies to drop their investigations, and it says:       Another Republican Senator said Mr.Trump had not urged him      to help bring the Russia inquiry to a halt. Instead, the      Senator said, the President nudged him to begin an      investigation into Hillary Clinton's connection with the      intelligence-gathering firm Fusion GPS, which produced a      dossier of allegations about Mr.Trump's ties to  The goal was to stop the investigation of Russian meddling, but the implication in the article is that the President knew he could achieve that goal as effectively, or at least more practically, by distracting from those investigations, diverting resources to other issues, and muddying the waters for the American people. That is the playbook from 1973 that is referenced by Art Buchwald in his 1973 column.  Here is the danger: Distractions are dangerous, and efforts to discredit law enforcement are equally perilous. Those efforts have included not only the urging for an investigation of Uranium One and Fusion GPS but also attacks on the integrity of some members of the FBI and the FBI as a whole and attacks on individual members of the special counsel's team, on the team as a whole, and on Robert Mueller himself. The effort plainly is to discredit the investigation before it reaches a potentially incriminating conclusion and to stop the investigation, but if not stop it, at least to demean its credibility before charges are brought.  It is standard operating procedure. We know as prosecutors. The distinguished Senator from Rhode Island and I served as U.attorneys and then attorneys general for our We know going into the courtroom that we can expect to be attacked and that our teams can be expected to be attacked. That is what defense lawyers do. That is what they do because they hope to demean and discredit and dismantle the credibility of prosecutors before the jury in the courtroom. Here, the courtroom is not a court of law but the court of public opinion. Our Republican friends have launched that preemptive strike, methodically and meticulously, just as the special counsel is engaging in his investigation methodically and meticulously.  Now, I referred to Republican colleagues, and I believe strongly and passionately that many, if not most, of our Republican colleagues share our zeal for the rule of law and for a just outcome to this investigation. The reason is very simple. The Russian attack on our democracy imperils not just this administration and not just one election. It imperils our democracy as a whole. The meddling in our elections was perhaps done to advance the Trump candidacy in 2016, but it can be used against the Trump candidacy in 2020. It can be used against another Republican candidate in that year. It could be used in 2018 against other candidates for Congress or for State election.  My Republican colleagues have been as eloquent as any of us in defining that threat because there is no doubt in the intelligence community that it is a threat, that the Russians did interfere, and that they sought to advance the Trump candidacy. Whether there was an impact and what the impact was may never be known, but the effort is clear. It involved a massive campaign of disinformation, propaganda, cyber attack, and other means. That is what the FBI learned was happening, not as a result of Christopher Steele but from sources within the Trump campaign, including George Papadopoulos, and from other intelligence sources, and that is what we must make sure is known to the American public. We must make sure that anyone who aided the Russians pays a price and that the Russians themselves pay a price, because if there is no price, it will be done with impunity again.  So there should be--and I believe there is--bipartisan apprehension about that threat to our Nation's security. That is the reason that the Judiciary Committee's investigation, along with the special counsel, is so important, because our purview includes obstruction of justice and the integrity of the Department of Any interference politically with the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling must be prevented in the future as well. Only the Judiciary Committee can frame and craft legislation that will help to protect the  Senator Whitehouse and I, and Senator Feinstein and others on the committee, will be proposing such legislation based on what we know so far. It is legislation that essentially protects the rule of law against such efforts to obstruct justice and politically interfere.  The intelligence community's conclusions about Russian meddling did not rely on the credibility of Glenn Simpson or Christopher The two guilty pleas and convictions that the special counsel has already secured do not rely on the credibility of Simpson or Without fear of contradiction, I can predict that additional convictions and indictments will be based on fact and law, not on the credibility of Simpson and The conclusions reached by Simpson, Steele, or anybody else are relevant only insofar as they are supported and backed and proved by facts and consistent with relevant law.  Now, in fact, as we know, Christopher Steele tried to blow the whistle on the He brought to the FBI's attention information that he thought was relevant to protecting the United States of America against Russian interference. As my colleague Senator Whitehouse has outlined in detail, the FBI already knew of it and courteously heard from Christopher Steele and later interviewed him.  The effort to undermine the credibility of the FBI by pointing to Christopher Steele completely misses the mark. In fact, I am deeply disappointed that the first major action by our Republican colleagues on the Judiciary Committee was aimed at someone who reported wrongdoing, not committed it, and it was done without any cooperation or even consultation with Democratic colleagues. It is really a betrayal of the spirit that I think should characterize this very serious investigation, because it should be bipartisan.  My hope is that these distractions, dangerous as they are, will, in fact, not divert either our committee or the special counsel. The pace of our committee's investigation--again, to be very blunt--has been shamefully slow. I hope that its pace will quicken and that it will intensify and that there will be hearings in public with witnesses under oath and subpoenas of documents. I have said it repeatedly. I hope we will use those tools because only by relying on our powers to investigate effectively and comprehensively will we protect the goals of upholding integrity and justice.  As for the special counsel and our law enforcement community, I think they should know that we support them and that we will protect the special counsel against political interference. That is why there is legislation I have proposed, along with my[[Page S100]]colleague Senator Whitehouse and others. It is bipartisan legislation. I thank Senators Tillis and Graham, as well as Senators Coons and Booker, for joining in this legislation. That legislation has already had a hearing. It should be voted to the floor and passed by the Congress so that there is no question that the special counsel will be protected against interference or firing.  As that investigation moves closer to the Oval Office, as it tightens its grip on members of the administration, there will be increasing threats and efforts to intimidate. The FBI and the Department of Justice, as well as the special counsel, have a well-earned reputation for integrity and zeal. It is part of our rule of law that a law is enforced. Enforcement of a law depends on thorough and independent investigations that are pursued without fear or favor, without efforts to distract or demean. This body, the U.Congress, has an obligation to support those kinds of values. They are uniquely American values. They are the underpinning of all of our laws, all that we hold dear, and all that we celebrate in this body and in this country.  My hope is that we will be part of the effort to avoid politicizing the pursuit of justice. Politicization of the pursuit of justice diverts energy and attention away from credible criminal investigations. It sends a message to this President and future Presidents--and everybody who occupies any office--that there are no repercussions for diverting and distracting and for the ploys and rabbit holes that may be used to squander resources or undermine credibility.  Republicans and Democrats alike should join in the effort to preserve the rule of law. My hope is that we will and will do so without delay because every day that passes when these kinds of false, baseless, and biased innuendos and rumors are raised and given credence is a day that undermines those values that we hold dear.

Deporting Dreamers would be cruel and irrational, inhumane, and, very simply, repugnant to basic American values.  Just think of Jonathan Gonzalez-He is a college student at Southern Connecticut State I had the privilege of meeting him in His story has stuck with me. His story haunts me when I think of the moral imperative of this Nation to pass the Dream  Jonathan was born in He came to this country when he was just 4 years old. The United States is home for him. It is the only country he has ever known. He received a full scholarship to attend Southern Connecticut[[Page S133]]State University, and he is set to graduate this spring with an honors degree in economics and math.  His dream is to attend law school, but due to the uncertainty surrounding DACA, he has decided to delay applying, knowing he will be unable to receive scholarships without his DACA status. He could attend, but he can't pay for it with scholarships unless he has that DACA status.  Jonathan first became compelled to speak up and tell his story after his father was deported, and they were unable to even say goodbye. Despite his own struggles, Jonathan is a passionate advocate for his community, and he actively works for Connecticut Students for a That organization, Connecticut Students for a Dream, is a group of students who help empower and advocate on behalf of other undocumented students. In fact, today, Jonathan is in DC to help ensure that the voices of students are, in fact, heard. Jonathan is a volunteer peer mentor through that organization because he is so passionate about raising graduation rates and ensuring that all students like himself have the support they need to succeed.  During his senior year, Jonathan has been interning at an immigration law firm, and he is glad to be helping others gain legal status in this country. The irony is not lost on him--and should not be lost on us--that he, himself, could face deportation this year. If Jonathan is not permitted to stay--if Congress does not act and he loses his DACA protection--Connecticut and this Nation will be the losers. Connecticut and this Nation will lose an educated and compassionate public service-minded individual who gives back to his community, to his fellow students, and to our He is just one example of the estimated 10,000 like him in Connecticut--and at least 700,000 around the country--who could lose their status in March if Congress fails to act now.  Very simply, we have an obligation to do our job and provide permanent status and a path to citizenship for the The hopeful news is, there is broad bipartisan support for affording the Dreamers protection against mass, draconian deportation. Our challenge is to make sure that what we do here reflects that broad bipartisan support in this Chamber and around the country because America knows it has made a promise. It made a promise to those Dreamers, and great countries do not break promises.  Last night, a Federal district court issued a preliminary injunction ordering DHS--the Department of Homeland Security--to resume accepting renewal applications. Once again, the courts have served as a bulwark for basic rights under rule of law, but this reprieve is no final remedy. We must redouble our determination to protect these young people from draconian, mass deportation--a continuing threat as long as President Trump refuses to reverse his cruel, unconscionable policy.  A Federal judge has struck down President Trump's order as unconstitutional, but a Dream Act is no less necessary today than it was yesterday. Congress should waste no time in swiftly passing clean legislation--a clean Dream Act to protect these young people.  When DACA was adopted in 2012, it changed the lives of young people like It opened new vistas. It provided Dreamers with the opportunity to get driver's licenses, to attend college, to become productive members of our economy.  Importantly, when DACA was adopted, we made that promise to these young people. We promised that if they came forward and provided the United States of America with information, some of the most personal information any of us have--information about their addresses, employment, dates of birth, their families--we would not use that information against them. They had a place here under They had rights--moral, if not legal. That promise is now about to be broken.  Great countries keep those promises. The United States is the greatest country in the history of the world. It should not be breaking promises to innocent young men and women who know only this country, who believe in the American dream, who believe in America's promises, who believed those promises when they offered that information and now are relying on the good faith of The rescission of DACA threatens to tear apart families, destroy lives, create disarray, and derail futures. We are a country that is better than this rescission. We are a country that keeps promises, and Congress must now act to protect these young people.  DACA protections are set to expire in 2 months. Already, tens of thousands of DACA recipients are estimated to have lost their protection from removal. The longer Congress takes to act, the longer these young people, who were promised the American dream, continue with anguish, with targets on their backs.  Continued waiting means instability to the job market because companies are forced to hire replacements for DACA recipients and train new workers in anticipation of the March deadline. It could mean a massive ejection of qualified, hard-working people vital to our economy.  This kind of massive deportation by plane, by boat, by car, by foot would be unprecedented. We have never seen anything like it before. As I have said repeatedly, this kind of mass, draconian deportation would be a humanitarian nightmare, a betrayal of  If Congress fails to pass the Dream Act, we will lose nearly $500 billion over the next 10 years. Let me repeat. We will lose $500 billion over the next 10 years. We will lose $25 billion in Medicare and Social Security taxes alone. In my home State of Connecticut, we stand to lose $300 million in economic benefits a year.  Now is the time to abandon the myth that the Dreamers work on the sidelines of American society. They are part of the fabric of this Their lives are woven into the great tapestry of They drive our economy. They give back to our communities.  The administration has thrown a ticking time bomb into their lives, but it is also a ticking time bomb in this We have the power to defuse it. In doing so, we can give hope to hundreds of thousands of members of our society and reaffirm the greatness of our country. At stake is nothing less than the character of our country, and that is why there is such bipartisan support for the Dream Act, as evidenced yesterday in the Cabinet Room when the President met with Members of the Congress on both sides of the aisle.  In the Dreamers, we see ourselves. We see relatives who came to this country years ago, many of them as teenagers. My father fled Germany at 17 years old with nothing more than the shirt on his back, speaking no English, knowing virtually no one here. Like him, they believe in America's promise, America's dream, and we should believe in the  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

176,topic-id,1810,"Mr.President, I have two topics I want to speak about today; one is  There is no question that Iran is the principal state sponsor of terrorism in the world. Both the Obama administration and the Trump administration have without hesitation made that point. The Iranian regime provides money and it provides material support for groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah and a host of other terrorist groups. They have threatened to wipe out Israel, one of our closest allies. Their threat is to frankly wipe Israel off the map. And they have systematically trampled on the fundamental freedoms that all people everywhere would want to have. They have done that by taking those freedoms away from their own citizens and those human rights away from their own citizens.  In recent days, we have seen what happens after a decade of that kind of corruption and oppression. Protesters began a week ago to protest. It was, by all accounts, unexpected by the previous protest groups, by the military, or by the government. It spread to at least 50 cities, where brave people wanting to stand up--and in the streets began standing up by the thousands--to protest a government that denies them their rights, a government that has impoverished their country while it funnels billions of dollars to terrorists across the Middle East and across the world.  Where did those dollars come from? Unfortunately, too many of those dollars came from us.  I came to the floor, to this spot, nearly 2 years ago to ask that same question about where that money came from, after the Obama administration paid Iran what amounted to $1.7 billion in what appeared to be a ransom for the release of five American hostages. At the time it was explained: Well, this is just money that we have had for a long time, which was part of an economic agreement, a foreign military sale that we have held on to. It turned out that the story was not true. We later learned that $400 million of that payment was delivered in pallets of cash that came off an airplane. The pallets were stacked high with cash. And, on top of the $100 billion in sanction relief, we had another stack of billions of dollars in just straight cash--the sanctions relief, under the terribly thought-out Iranian nuclear deal, and the cash to apparently grease the skids so that agreement and others could happen.  We have heard of other things in recent days where the administration turned its back on bad things that were happening in order to see that the Iranian deal was going to go through. Now, if the Iranian deal had been a good deal, that would have been one thing, but to turn your back on bad things so that another bad thing can happen is even worse.  So where is this money going? Protesters have seen that the money that we delivered to them and the sanctions relief that we delivered to them didn't go to them and didn't go to their economy. It continued to finance terror around the world and war in other countries.  The State Department, once again, in their assessment said:       Iran remained the foremost state sponsor of terrorism in      2016 as groups supported by Iran maintained their capability      to threaten U.interests and allies. The Iranian Islamic      Revolutionary Guard Corps--Qods Force, along with Iranian      partners, allies, and proxies, continued to play a      destabilizing role in military conflicts in Iraq, Syria, and       Those assessments always come about a year late, after you have had time to assess the previous year. I have no doubt that the same assessment for 2016 will also be the assessment for the year we just ended--2017.  Frankly, the Iranian people are tired of it. They are angry. They are putting their lives on the line to protest.  The response of the Iranian Government has been predictable. First of all, they blame others for creating these problems. They said that we were agitating those freedom fighters in their country, those freedom protesters. They censored access to the social media. They have cracked down by arresting hundreds of people. The reports are that at least 20 people have been killed.  It is clear that their behavior hasn't changed; the hope that the Iranian deal would somehow bring the long sought-after moderates in the current government to the forefront has not happened. We should support the Iranian people.  I join the administration in expressing my support for the men and women, young and old, and the courage that they have demonstrated as they stand up and try to achieve the greatness of that country, with its long heritage and its incredible assets in location and in resources, which they should be able to achieve; they just have not been allowed to do that.  The last time this happened, our country was very quiet. This time, our government is speaking up. Hopefully, others will join in. The European countries have more economic impact in Iran than we do, and there is a good reason for that. We have been very thoughtful of wanting to support this regime. They have not. It is time for them to speak up as well.  So I join the administration, I join the President, and I encourage friends of freedom around the world to not let this moment pass again--to not, one more time, act as if nothing has happened, and that, somehow, this is exactly what the Iranian Government says it is, because it is almost never what the Iranian Government says it is. We wish for those who care about freedom to stand up and defend and encourage those who are seeking a greater freedom.[[Page S43]]                               FEMA Decision  Mr.President, the other issue I want to speak about today very briefly is that I want to commend the administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency for a decision they just made. That decision was to make houses of worship eligible for Federal disaster aid. This is in line with legislation that I introduced in September of last year. Senator Gillibrand and I introduced this legislation after the impact of Hurricane Sandy on houses of worship.  FEMA's Public Assistance Program provides financial grants for the repair, reconstruction, and replacement of private nonprofit facilities--private nonprofit facilities. However, until yesterday, houses of worship were ineligible for FEMA public assistance grants.  As we saw last year, houses of worship--churches, synagogues, mosques, and other places--are critical institutions within communities. They help feed people in need and, in trying to respond to disaster, they provide comfort and shelter during those disasters. FEMA not only did the right thing by making houses of worship eligible for disaster assistance, it did what our Constitution demands.  According to FEMA officials, the change in policy was prompted by the Supreme Court's ruling in the case of Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, v. We have a provision in our constitution which I argued against and other Missouri elected officials filed amicus briefs against where we said our constitution was wrong in finding that religious, not-for-profit organizations couldn't be eligible for State programs simply because they were religious. That is not what the U.Constitution says. It is not what the Supreme Court determined State constitutions have a right to do.  So FEMA has taken an important step. I think it is equally important now that we make this policy permanent law. It is the right thing to do. It deserves to be permanently the right thing to do. I am hoping that we see the legislation that I have introduced and that many have cosponsored in whatever is the next supplemental disaster funding. Money is going to be spent. Let's go ahead and properly authorize it, as the Supreme Court said we had every right to do and as FEMA has decided that it is the right thing to do.  We are in a new year. We have new challenges. One of the goals we have is to be sure that we move forward in strengthening our economy, to help those responding to disasters and expanding opportunities for hard-working families. We have done that with regulatory reform, with judges who will determine what the law says, and with a tax bill where people will soon see in their paycheck that it is actually all about hard-working families.  I have an editorial from the Joplin Globe today. A tornado struck a community in 2011, and over 100 people were killed. According to the Joplin Globe editorial--just to remind me of the numbers--some 28 churches were either destroyed or damaged by the tornado that came through A significant number were totally destroyed. I have been to a number of those buildings that have been replaced, but they were replaced without any of the kind of assistance that other not-for-profits would have had.  The Joplin Globe editorial ends with this:       Floods, fires, tornadoes and hurricanes don't treat      churches differently. Neither should  Again, I congratulate FEMA for the decision they made on this topic.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the Joplin Globe editorial be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                        [From the Joplin Globe]                    Our View: FEMA Aid for Churches       During Joplin's 2011 tornado, some 28 churches were either      destroyed or damaged. But those that were still standing      quickly opened doors and became centers for those left      homeless after this national disaster.       That's why we applaud the Federal Emergency Management      Agency's announcement that houses of worship are eligible for      FEMA Public Assistance program grants, which provide funding      for the repair, reconstruction or replacement of private      nonprofit sites.       That's thanks to U.Roy Blunt, R-Mo., who introduced      the legislation in September to make houses of worship      permanently eligible for disaster assistance. Claire      McCaskill, the Democrat from Missouri, also added her name to      the bill in a show of bipartisan support.       Both Blunt and McCaskill, in statements put out on      Wednesday, recognize the value churches can play in      disasters.       ``I'm glad to see FEMA do the right thing by ensuring      houses of worship are eligible for disaster aid on the same      terms as other nonprofits,'' Blunt said. ``As we saw again      last year, houses of worship serve a vital role during      disasters, providing shelter, food and other services for      families who need it the most.''       Previously, houses of worship were ineligible for FEMA      Public Assistance program grants. FEMA's announcement on      Wednesday means that churches, synagogues or mosques affected      by disasters declared on or after 23, 2017, and for      applications for assistance that were pending with FEMA as of      23, 2017, are eligible for assistance.       Blunt's right. Legislation is still needed to ensure houses      of worship remain eligible for disaster assistance under      federal law on a permanent basis. Floods, fires, tornadoes      and hurricanes don't treat churches differently. Neither      should  ",CREC-2018-01-04-pt1-PgS35-2.txt,1464,RUSSIA INVESTIGATION,2018.0,4.0,January

1045,topic-id,1531,"Mr.President, I am here today with my colleague Senator Capito to talk about something that is getting a lot of attention but needs even more attention from this Congress, which is the opioid epidemic--the epidemic the President has rightly called a crisis, and he then turned to Congress and said: Find the money to solve the problem. We have been doing a substantial amount of that, but I think we see a clear desire here and in all of our States to find a better solution.  This is an issue that has hit every town in America, small and large, I believe. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over 40,000 people died from an opioid overdose. This is a fraction of the people who had an opioid overdose. These are the people who died from an opioid overdose in 2016, 40,000 people; over 90 Americans every single day. It was a 28-percent increase over 2015 and a dramatic increase over where we were just 10 years before.  Opioid overdoses now surpass car accidents as the 1 accidental cause of death in the country. Both of our States and our surrounding States, I think almost every one of them, have had more overdose deaths in 2016--and an increased number, I think, in 2017--than car accident deaths. The Centers for Disease Control estimates the economic burden of this epidemic is almost $80 billion a year.  We have just gone through a tax discussion, an economic growth discussion. When we were talking about billions of dollars, seldom were we talking about $80 billion to do something with or to stop doing something with, but the economic cost of all of this--lost productivity, addiction, the crime related to that addiction--the CDC says $78.5 billion a year is now the cost.  We are both appropriators. The members of the Appropriations Committee have looked at this carefully. Our colleagues have had a chance to confront this issue in our committee head-on. We brought bills to the floor that have passed and made a big difference in a[[Page S147]]short period of time. Over the past 2 years, not counting what we hope to do this year, the committee has increased opioid funding by over $900 million, nearly a 200-percent increase for the Department of Health and Human Services--more money for justice, more money for the Department of Veterans  This funding is focused on developing alternatives for pain management, giving our State, Federal, and local law enforcement partners the tools they need to combat opioid trafficking, ensuring first responders we are working to see that there are better ways to respond with opioid reversal.  One of the things we have seen recently is that opioids of all kinds are now laced with new drugs like fentanyl, and you don't even know what you are taking. Narcan, the former way to deal with this and still the most effective way to deal with this--you think you have dealt with a problem, and the dose is so strong, the same person in just a few minutes lapses back into another seizure, attack, that has often been fatal. Even though people are there and the traditional way to respond is there, it isn't enough for what is going on now.  One thing you would have to tell anybody doing this is, it is unlikely you have any real idea what you are putting into your system. What you think was a narcotic high the day before could easily kill you the next day. We have been looking for better ways to monitor programs so prescriptions in West Virginia and Missouri--they are both States where, in some counties, the number of prescriptions people have been walking into the pharmacist with are just ridiculous.  The committee that funds the Department of Health and Human Services--that is the committee we are both on--in the last 2 years, we have increased funding by 1,300 percent, $745 million--13 times more than we were spending just 2 years ago. We have given grants to States, in ways we haven't before, to look at specific State needs and ideas they have to deal with this and then share. We have looked at increasing Federal surveillance on how prescriptions are being written, how drug stores are becoming the conduit, and how many substances are coming through the mail to find new ways to determine whether this is reasonable in the area these drugs are going into. We have looked at ways to increase the tools necessary to communities and first responders. We are talking right now to the National Institutes of Health about what they can do on a number of fronts. One is to work with the pharmaceutical companies themselves to develop alternatives to the kind of pain management we have had.  Also, let me say on that front, we have gone through a period where doctors and hospitals were too often graded on whether people had any pain or not as opposed to whether they had pain they didn't understand, pain that was unacceptable. More and more people ought to be saying, as opposed to taking this potentially addictive drug, give me a dose that is not as addictive, and maybe I am still more achy than I would be otherwise, more pain than I would have otherwise, but I understand it and am aware of it, and I am not in some cloud of no pain but not much of anything else in terms of real quality of life.  We are looking at how we can work with these companies for pain management. I have talked to the pharmaceutical companies. I think it is time for them to step up, maybe in partnership with NIH, so there is some Federal money to encourage more private sector money to find alternatives that are less addictive and better understood, to find more effective and affordable ways to respond. Just the amount of money in the first responders' kits around the country, and local governments paying for the Narcan, the more expensive injectable treatment--we need to look for ways where that can be more available and in a way that local governments have a better way to deal with this.  This needs to be dealt with locally. The first responder is going to be a local person. If you are a fire department that also has first responders, your department is three times more likely to go on an overdose call than they are to go to a fire. That is where we are in this situation today.  In trying to figure out what the impact really is at home--as we all are trying to do--I had a meeting not too long ago with medical professionals, with State officials, with emergency responders, in Springfield, MO, to talk about how we deal with prevention, treatment, and recovery. We talked about the critical partnership between local, State, and Federal law enforcement and the dangers the first responders themselves face. Sometimes what people are putting into their system is so powerful and so addictive that walking into the room or touching the clothing becomes a potentially great danger for the person who is there to help you. I talked to doctors and hospitals about the challenges they face in prescribing less habit-forming pain medications and how patients are still not fully aware of the danger of dealing with pain if you overdo it as you are dealing with pain.  I talked to one person who talked about his daughter who had just gone to the dentist and got pain medicine and had no sense that the pain medicine could be addictive and she should stop taking it when it had done its job, whether or not it was when the last pill was gone.  Then, of course, there is a new issue of underprescribing. Nobody likes to go back to the pharmacy twice to get the same prescription they just got a few days ago, but giving people more pills than they need to take themselves or have them sit in the medicine cabinet doesn't make any sense.  In our State, there are large urban areas, but it also has a lot of small and remote communities and, frankly, rural communities have been hit particularly hard by this crisis. Certainly, West Virginia is a State that understands this. There has been no more vigorous advocate for funding and new ways to solve this problem than Senator I am glad to be here with her today as we talk about this issue.  I can assure the people we work for that this is a top priority. It has been a top priority for over 3 years now. The first 2 years showed dramatic increases in the willingness we had to deal with this and the breadth of how we deal with it, and that is one reason we need to move on and get this funding bill, which should have been done by October 1, done right now. As we get a new number to deal with, one of our priorities will be the opioid epidemic, and one of the leaders in that discussion will be the Senator from West Virginia, ",CREC-2018-01-11-pt1-PgS145-3.txt,1464,FUNDING THE GOVERNMENT,2018.0,11.0,January

174,topic-id,3418,"Mr.President, I rise today because earlier on this day, the Trump administration and Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded the Justice Department's policy known as the Cole memo.  The Cole memo is a policy issued under the Obama administration instructing prosecutors to shift away[[Page S40]]from a focus on nonviolent marijuana crimes and toward more serious crimes that threaten our communities. This memo was a critical step and a move in the right direction, undoing some of the catastrophic damage that has been caused by the failed War on It was a step forward for the Federal Government in mending our broken drug policies that have so hurt our Nation in so many ways. I believe it was a step forward that the vast majority of Americans who believe the War on Drugs failed agree with. It was a step forward that improved Americans' safety, saved money, and better aligned our laws with our most fundamental values of fairness, equality, and justice. Yet, today, Attorney General Jeff Sessions has instructed the Department of Justice to not just double down on failed policy but to turn back the clock and undermine the well-being of our country.  The policy change actually goes against what Jeff Sessions promised elected officials in this body before his confirmation. We already heard from the other Cory in the Senate--Republican Senator Cory Gardner--that he had a commitment from the Attorney General before his confirmation that this is not what he would do.  This is an attack on our most sacred ideals and the very purpose of the Department of Justice, which is to protect Americans, to elevate ideals of justice, and to do right by people. It is a failure of this administration, which said--our President said during his campaign that he would honor what States are doing. It is a betrayal by our Attorney General, who gave a commitment to at least one Republican Member of this body. But most significantly, it will hurt It ignores the fact that there is a growing bipartisan consensus that the War on Drugs has failed. It sacrifices our critical, urgently needed resources in our communities, violating our values and destroying families, and has failed to make us safer.  Let me walk through those four points one by one--first, this massive waste of public resources that are urgently needed in other areas. In the last four decades in this country, we have spent so much on these policies at the same time that we are disinvesting from public education, from our public colleges, disinvesting from investments and innovation, investments in science and research. Yet we have spent trillions of dollars on this failed War on  We have created a nation that says we are the land of the free, but we are the incarceration nation on the planet One out of every four incarcerated people on this planet is imprisoned here in the United States of One out of every three incarcerated women on the planet is incarcerated right here in the United States of  Between the time of 1990 and 2005, we have devoted so much of our resources to building new prisons. During that time, we were building a new prison in the United States every 10 days to keep up with the massive amount of people who were being driven into our prisons. One new prison was being built every 10 days as our infrastructure and our roads and bridges crumbled.  We have sidelined the resources of our law enforcement officials. I know this, having been a former mayor. The precious time, resources, and energy of our law enforcement officials have been sidelined, redirecting them to marijuana enforcement, and for what?  At a time when we have real issues to deal with in our country, such as a drug epidemic; at a time when people cannot afford treatment and when there are waiting lists for treatment because we don't have the resources to deal with this opioid epidemic, we are instead using our resources to enforce marijuana laws.  The Centers for Disease Control, the CDC, reported last year that 91 Americans die every single day from the opioid epidemic in this country. Meanwhile, according to FBI data from 2014, one American is arrested every single minute for marijuana possession--one American every minute for marijuana possession. That is about 1,700 Americans being arrested every day for marijuana possession, using police resources, resources to put people in jail, to hold them, to feed them, court resources. All that can be used better and invested in our society to deal with the ravages of the opioid epidemic. Police resources that could be used to chase after violent offenders are instead being used for marijuana possession. It is somehow crazy that we think we can arrest our way out of a problem.  Doubling down on these failed efforts makes no sense. It is a massive waste of our precious resources as a society.  2, it is also perpetuating injustice in our country. We believe that everyone in this Nation should have equal justice under the law. Those are the words written on the Supreme But we know this War on Drugs has not been a War on Drugs, it has been a war on people--and not all people but certain people, the most vulnerable people. It has been a war on people, a war on mentally ill people. It has been a war on people of color.  The unequal application of marijuana laws has created a justice system where outcomes are often more dependent upon race and class than dependent upon guilt or innocence. In privileged communities and places all across this country, marijuana is being used with little fear of consequences and openly spoken about and joked about with little understanding of the painful fact that the War on Drugs in America has scarcely affected their lives but the War on Drugs, because of the unequal application of the laws, is affecting people in other communities.  I have seen this personally. I went to Stanford and to Yale, and I watched drug use being done openly--marijuana use. There are no FBI investigations, no sting operations set up to go after the privileged in this country.  There are people in this body who openly admit to using marijuana with no consequence. But if you are poor or vulnerable in the United States of America, they are coming after you, and there will be consequences. I have had countless conversations with elected officials about their own personal drug use because it is outrageous to me, this outrageous hypocrisy that they could flaunt drug rules while poor people and people of color suffer as a result of our marijuana laws.  The facts are clear. The disproportionate enforcement of marijuana laws has helped to create a system of massive injustice in our country, and it is obvious. There is no difference in America between Blacks and Whites using marijuana, no difference between Blacks and Whites selling marijuana. Blacks are 3.7 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than a White person is. This is a targeting of certain communities, a targeting of low-income people who are having their lives devastated by this unequal application of the law. Jeff Sessions' announcement today will make the problem worse.  People don't understand what it means to have a felony conviction for marijuana possession. Most people have no understanding that this is a lifetime sentence in It not only affects the individual's ability to get a job, you can't get a Pell grant if you have a felony conviction for marijuana usage, which many people in this body have done. You can't get a business license with a felony conviction for marijuana. You can't get food stamps. You can't get public housing.  It devastates individuals economically, but it devastates their families as well. It destroys the lives of children when suddenly the earner in their family, who is guilty of no more a serious crime than some of my colleagues--suddenly they have to pick up the pieces after one of their parents is sent away to prison. Missing 1 or 2 days of work often means losing your job, not being able to make your car payment or rental payment. We know that for children, where their father is in prison, they are more than five times more likely than their peers to be expelled or suspended from school.  This marijuana enforcement is devastating families--the fundamental building blocks of communities--and it is devastating communities. These laws weaken our overall economic health. One study found that if it weren't for the mass incarceration explosion as a result of the War on Drugs, the poverty rate in this country would be 20 percent lower.  We have a self-inflicted wound by wasting the resources--police resources and financial resources--of this country, and we have another self-inflicted wound by destroying families and communities economically.[[Page S41]]  It also has hurt our safety as a country. There are communities all across this Nation that worry about the safety of their children, the safety of their families, and the safety of their neighborhoods. By taking these critical resources away from law enforcement, this is a sacrifice of our efforts to make communities safe and strong.  In 2016, more Americans were arrested for marijuana possession than for all violent crimes combined. How many unsolved murders are there? How many unsolved assaults? How much violence and crime should our police be investigating as opposed to dealing with marijuana prohibition? We have fewer police resources, fewer officers. We have occupied our prisons with more marijuana arrests than for rape, murder, aggravated assault, or even the unsolved robberies alone in our country because we are spending our precious police resources on marijuana prohibition. Our history shows this is true.  Historians now attest to the complete and utter failure of another prohibition in this country, which is the prohibition of alcohol. It arguably made people less safe. It led to more drinking and was a blow to our economy and the ability of our officers to do their job. It was even a blow to officers' safety and security.  If we are serious about making our communities safer or stronger, families more secure, we should be focusing on how to undo the catastrophic damage of marijuana prohibition, not double down on it.  I say all of this as someone who ran a police department in It was under my authority as mayor. My officers would talk about the churn of people they arrested again and again on nonviolent charges--which, by the way, many of our law enforcement officers may have engaged in and people in positions of authority, like Senators and Presidents, have done themselves, deepening the distrust between officers and the community.  I saw firsthand how the disproportionate enforcement of our drug laws made communities of mine overcriminalized and underprotected--overcriminalizing possession of marijuana and underprotecting them on serious crimes.  This is an issue which I know too personally. I have seen this from walking privileged and elite communities like universities or here in Washington, and I know it because I may be the only Senator who, when I go home, I go home to an inner-city community. I go home to a community where my census track is about $14,000 per household. I love my neighborhood. I love my community. I love my neighbors, but it is outrageous to me that communities like mine and all over this country have seen the vicious impact of the War on Drugs, while other communities--elite communities--can brag and joke about their marijuana usage.  I am proud that I spent most of my adult life working with the people of Newark, NJ--a city that is rich with culture, that is rich with art, that is rich with civic engagement--but I know, from Camden to Paterson, to Passaic, to Newark, there are communities like mine that, every single day, are getting the devastating blow of this prohibition--this war on marijuana.  I see the anguish people feel about the unjustness and the unfairness of it all and having lives upended for getting caught with small amounts of marijuana. I have seen countless people who couldn't find a job or a decent place to live to support their families.  I will never forget, as a city councilman in Newark, waiting in line at the A guy came over and told me the story that he was issued a uniform. He finally had a job that had a pension. He could support his family and move out of a bad neighborhood into a better one. He was so excited. They ran his record, and 18 years earlier he had a nonviolent, marijuana-related charge, and they took it all away from him. Think about that comparison to the highest office in the land, where marijuana users have occupied with no consequence--the hypocrisy of it all.  These aren't just a few people. These are hundreds of thousands of Americans who are bearing the brunt of nonviolent charges for marijuana. They have had their lives destroyed. They have that lifetime sentence of, time and time again, having to check a box about a marijuana arrest, having their uniforms taken away, opportunities closed.  I have seen how these laws make us less safe. When are we going to get back to this understanding that we--all of us as Americans--put our hand on our heart and we make a pledge; we swear an oath that we will be a nation of liberty and justice, not for the privileged, not for the elite, but we will be a nation of liberty and justice for all.  Countless people have talked about equal justice under the law. They have talked about these ideals and principles from this floor. They talked about it in the suffrage movement. They talked about it in the civil rights movement. It goes all the way back to slavery. Frederick Douglass, on the 24th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, made a statement that was as true then as it is now. He said:       Where justice is denied, where poverty is enforced, where      ignorance prevails, and where any one class is made to feel      that society is an organized conspiracy to oppress, rob      and degrade them, neither persons nor property will be      safe.  Well, this is the War on This is the marijuana prohibition. It has been a systematic oppression of poor people in our country. It has destroyed and devastated individuals, families, communities, and cities. It has bled our national treasure. It has filled our jails to the point where we had to build more and more of them. It has taken away resources from investing in drug treatment or education, which we know not only drives down drug use but empowers people economically.  This is the War on This is the war on marijuana. Attorney General Sessions' policy rescission today will only make these problems worse, at a time that the majority of the American public agrees with me--agrees that this prohibition must end. The majority of the American people understand that this policy makes our communities less safe, wastes taxpayers' money, makes it more difficult for police officers to do their jobs, and ultimately hurts the struggling folks at the bottom of the economic ladder most. It disproportionately affects Black and Brown They are the ones who are bearing the brunt of our failure to get rid of this prohibition.  Let's be clear about what this setback is. The American people know the War on Drugs has failed. They want change. Republicans and Democrats and Independents in States all across our country are making change at their legislature, at the ballot box--voting in a repeal of these awful, unfair, wasteful policies all across this country. In red States and blue States, Americans are marching, are standing up, and are fighting to change these laws.  We know States that have legalized marijuana have seen a massive increase in revenue and decreased rates of serious crime. Crime is going down in those communities. They have been able to put more resources to use to address urgent public needs like education and infrastructure.  In Colorado, arrest rates have decreased and State revenue has increased. Washington State has seen a 10-percent decrease in violent crime over the 3-year period following legalization.  It is time for Congress to step up to the plate. It is time for us to once again live up to our oath. It is time for us once again to fight to make our country a place of liberty and justice for all.  I know right now Attorney General Jeff Sessions and President Trump are standing squarely on the wrong side of history. I know what our ancestors have taught us about the arc of the moral universe bending toward justice. I know this is not a matter of if but a matter of when we will have sane marijuana policies in this country and end the prohibition that is destroying neighborhoods. I know these things.  How long will people suffer? How long will we waste resources? How long will we make ourselves less safe? How long? This fight is more than about a substance--a plant. It is more. It is about the soul of our It is about our ideals. It is about justice. It is about justice for veterans who rely on medical marijuana to treat their They fought for us, they stood for us, and now, according to Jeff Sessions, with the use of medical marijuana to deal with their PTSD, they are criminals.  That is not the America I believe in. It is about justice for the man who has[[Page S42]]a criminal record for doing something that three out of four Presidents have done--who now can't get a job, can't get a business license, and can't move his family to a better home.  This is not justice. This is not the America I know we are. This is about the mother I stood next to with her child who had Dravet syndrome--who fell into seizure after seizure multiple times a day--who was a marijuana refugee, leaving a State that didn't end prohibition to go to a State that had medical marijuana laws. According to Jeff Sessions, she is a criminal.  This is not our This is not the land of truth and justice to treat a parent like that--like a criminal. This is about families and communities that too long have been fractured by the inaction of this body to address the overcriminalization of our country. This is about the very values people fight for and stand for. This is about who we will be. We cannot fall into this Nation where the privileged and the elite have certain laws and the poor and the struggling have others.  What Jeff Sessions did today is unconscionable, unacceptable, and I will fight against it because when I go home, I see the communities in struggle. I can't turn my head and not understand that there are millions of Americans who are hurting from this decades-long War on  This is a self-inflicted wound that goes deep to the bone of our country. It undermines our health and well-being, and too many suffer because of it. We have to fight. I feel this sense of hopefulness because around this country, Democrats and Republicans on the State level are making changes. They are marching forward. They are undoing past wrongs. I feel a sense of hope and promise, and even though today we were delivered a painful blow by our Federal Government to cast a shadow against every American citizen who is using medical marijuana--every American citizen who is doing things Senators have done--I still know that truth will go marching on. I still know we are a nation of justice. I know we are better than this, and I know what our future holds.  I ask my colleagues to reject this action by the Attorney General, to speak out against this devastating reality. There are Senators here who represent States where the people have spoken. It is now time we speak for the people. It is now time we speak for our country's ideals. It is now time we don't just speak the words of our pledge but we make this country, in truth, a nation of liberty and justice for all.  Thank you.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

It is going to be a great game.                   Fort Smith, Arkansas, Bicentennial  Mr.President, I rise today to recognize the bicentennial of Fort Smith,  On Christmas Day in 1817, Army troops established a western frontier military post on the confluence of the Arkansas and Poteau MAJ Stephen Long named it Fort Smith, after GEN Thomas Smith, commander of the U.Army rifle regiment.  To recognize the significant milestone, the community is organizing a year-long celebration that highlights its rich history, its citizens, and its future. While Fort Smith was abandoned by 1824, the community that sprung up around it continued to grow and played a unique role in westward expansion and the preservation of law and order in our developing  Judge Isaac Parker paved the way for bringing order to Indian Territory, and[[Page S30]]great lawmen like Deputy U.Marshal Bass Reeves helped lay the foundation that shaped Fort Smith's role in the history of the U.Marshals Reeves was one of the most well-respected lawmen of all time. To recognize his efforts, the Bass Reeves Legacy Initiative raised money to honor him with a monument in the community's downtown.  Reeves' career is well documented, as are the stories of Fort Smith during this period. In 1968, Charles Portis depicted Fort Smith's role in taming the West in his book ``True Grit,'' which portrays a teenage girl's efforts to avenge her father's death with a U.Marshal by her side.  The bond between the community and the U.Marshals Service is strong and continues today, as Fort Smith will be the home of the future U.Marshals Museum scheduled to open in 2019. Part of its collection will include a gun and badge that belonged to Bass  The national historic site and other organizations have done an exceptional job of keeping the community's history alive. Promoting its history in this way will also have positive benefits for the future. Fort Smith is a city with an incredible story to tell in its faith communities, its schools, its industries, its arts, and its culture.  The community is marking its bicentennial with events throughout the year that include an attempt to break the world record for a lip dub video at the Old Fort Days Rodeo Parade and the city's first fort building competition for kids.  I was pleased to contribute to the time capsule, and I am looking forward to seeing many old friends at our high school reunion. A lot has changed since my days at Northside High School as a Grizzly, but the steadfast resilience and spirit of the citizens of Fort Smith have remained.  I am proud to be a native of Fort Smith and look forward to the events during this year-long celebration. It is home to a growing university, new medical school, and vibrant new industries.  I know Fort Smith is starting the 21st century on a solid foundation. We have much to celebrate from the past, but even more to look forward to in the future. We are forever grateful to the men and women who have encouraged the community's progress and implemented their ideas to shape the city for the next generation.  Jerry Stewart is one such leader, who led a life dedicated to public service. He had a successful career as a pulmonologist and served as CEO of Cooper Clinic, leading the growth and development of one of the region's top medical care providers. After his retirement, he helped underserved patients at the Good Samaritan Clinic in River Valley Primary  He was well respected in the medical community and admired for his influence beyond the walls of the clinic. His influence was felt across the community as a leader in civic organizations and community boards, including serving on the Fort Smith Public School Board and as chairman of the board for the Fort Smith Chamber of Commerce and the Fort Smith United Truly, the list goes on and on.  Stewart passed away December 26, but his legacy will live on. I appreciated and valued his friendship and, like so many others, will greatly miss him.  Fort Smith was blessed with Stewart's leadership and his guidance. It continues to be fortunate to have talented leaders with a vision and dedication to make this great city even better.  Congratulations to the members of the 200th anniversary committee for all of their hard work in planning to celebrate 200 years of Fort Smith history.

789,topic-id,572,"Mr.President, I rise to highlight the positive impacts our historic tax reform law will have on the agricultural community.  Agriculture is Arkansas' largest industry by far, adding $16 billion to our economy every year and accounting for approximately one in every six jobs. We are the top rice-producing State in the Nation, 2 in the Nation in broiler chicken production, and the third largest producer of catfish in the United We could also clothe and shelter ourselves from fiber grown in Arkansas, as we are the third in the Nation in cotton production and the fifth largest softwood lumber-producing You could keep going down the list, and you would find Arkansas as one of the Nation's top 10 producers of a number of agricultural commodities.  Clearly, ensuring that Washington helps create an economic environment that allows the agricultural industry to thrive is extremely important to my home State of When President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law, his signature provided much needed tax relief to America's farmers. More than 94 percent of farms are organized as passthrough businesses, which means they are impacted by the same tax provisions as individual filers. Lower tax rates across the board and a 20-percent deduction from their taxable income means immediate savings, which can be reinvested to help grow their operations.  Ninety seven percent of the farms in Arkansas are family owned, and the vast majority of them will now be exempt from the estate tax--the death tax. This is a big deal. It will help keep those farms and ranches in the family for generations to come.  Finally, farmers and ranchers will be able to expense 100 percent of their capital investments, such as equipment, over the next 4 years. In his address to the Farm Bureau earlier this week, the President called this the ``sleeper'' in the bill. He is right. People don't realize and there hasn't been enough talk about how beneficial this provision will be for our family-run agricultural operations. The substance of the President's Farm Bureau speech tilted heavily toward our efforts to bring stability and predictability to the economy.  As we have witnessed over the course of the previous administration, uncertainty is devastating to our economy. There are few industries that are inherently more affected by uncertainty than agriculture. This is why we have taken steps to eliminate some of the punitive, needless regulations that create uncertainty for our farmers and our ranchers.  It is also why my colleagues and I on the Agriculture Committee, under the steadfast leadership of Chairman Roberts, are working hard to reauthorize the farm bill. Programs are authorized by the farm bill that are absolutely vital to farmers, ranchers, and consumers. These programs will provide more certainty in rural America to address the challenges ahead. Finally, it is why we took great care to ensure that the agricultural industry will see the benefits of tax reform. Establishing a tax code that works for our farmers and ranchers, as opposed to against them, is vital to their ability to plan for the future and invigorate our rural communities.  I am proud of our efforts to pass this landmark tax reform law, and I am[[Page S124]]confident it will have lasting, positive effects for our economy.  With that, I yield back.

Children's Health Insurance Program  Mr.President, it has been 100 days since this Congress allowed the Children's Health Insurance Program to expire. Congress did nothing in September, October, November, and December, and now we are more than a week into January--100 days of anxiety for parents, 100 days of wondering if their kids will be kicked off their coverage, 100 days of worrying if they will be able to afford their child's prescriptions or worrying whether they can take them to the doctor if they get the flu.  Members of Congress--new Members, such as Senators Smith and Jones, Members like Senator Hatch, who has been here for 40 years, and all of us--have healthcare paid for by taxpayers.  We remember the discussion of the tax bill written down the hall in the office of Majority Leader The Senate found plenty of time in December to pass a massive handout for corporations. The Presiding Officer, the Senator from Florida, has since questioned whether too much of this bill went to corporate interests. More than 80 percent of the tax cut bill went to the richest 1 percent.  In addition, we know it was a massive handout for corporations that sent jobs overseas. We are going to see more companies shut down in Mansfield, Lima, Zanesville, Chillicothe, Portsmouth, and in big cities like Columbus, Cleveland, and We are going to see more plants close and move overseas because this Senate and the House passed a tax bill that encourages more corporations to ship jobs overseas. All the while, this body couldn't be bothered to give families more than a short-term funding Band-Aid for CHIP, which experts have said will not even last the last 3 months they promised.  I applaud the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Florida, for his efforts to enlarge at least some of the tax bill to put more money into the pockets of working families, particularly low-income working families.

They are the sons and daughters of parents who don't have insurance not because they aren't working as hard or harder than we do, but they don't have insurance simply because their parents happen to work at a job where they are not provided insurance.  There are 209,000 Ohio children who rely on CHIP, a program that has been bipartisan for 20 years. It was without controversy in the past. Families in some States already got letters last year and early this year warning them that their children could lose their healthcare.  Think about these families. The parents of some of these millions of children around the country come home from work, working in a $10-an-hour job, not making a lot of money. They are working every bit as hard as we do. They go to the mailbox and see a letter from their State government. I will read one of these letters, a copy of which went to tens of thousands of parents: Because Congress has not acted yet, we need to let you know there is a chance that the CHIP Program may have to be shut down. In other words, there is a chance that your children's health insurance will be cut off.  Remember, this is because of the inaction in this body. This is because Senators, who have insurance paid for by taxpayers, would rather vote for tax cuts, would rather do whatever we do all day instead of renewing the Children's Health Insurance  This letter goes on: If Congress does not renew Federal funds for CHIP in time, you will get another letter in January telling you your benefits will end.  So first, it is a warning. Some parents got this warning right around They are already struggling financially. They are not giving their children nearly as much as they want for Christmas because they are making $8, $10, or $12 an hour. They are just trying to stay above water. They are just trying to raise their kids. They get a letter like this at Christmastime saying: If Congress doesn't act, there is really bad news; your kids are going to lose their insurance. Then the same letter says: If Congress doesn't act, in January you will get another letter saying your insurance is cut off.  It is already an expensive time of year. There is record cold in Several of our grandchildren live in Columbus, one of them in Croix, and two in Providence, When a number of our grandchildren were around, it was too cold to go outside. It was that kind of winter in The day after Christmas, temperatures dropped to single digits for 5, 6, or 7 days running. Families are paying more for their heating bill. At Christmastime, of course, it is more expensive. Now their government adds to this list of worries.  How do they plan their budget for this year if they don't know whether or not they will have to shell out thousands of dollars more for care for their kids? Remember, 9 million children are at risk because of Republican inaction.  Senator Portman, my Republican colleague from Ohio, and I and almost every other Senator on the Finance Committee voted to move forward on CHIP, to renew it for these 9 million children for 5 years. That was a good thing. It passed out of committee, but Senator McConnell, for whatever reason, didn't think this was important enough to actually put it on the floor, move on it, and get it to the  I have no idea if the President will sign it. I don't think he knows much about the Children's Health Insurance Program, but I assume his advisers will say that it is probably a good idea to sign it. But he hasn't had a chance to sign it because the majority leader doesn't think this bill is important enough--that these 9 million children are important enough--that Congress should take action.  These are often families with two working parents. They might make $8, $10, or $12 an hour, but they are working in jobs where they are not lucky enough to have health insurance. They work for companies or many for small businesses that, for whatever reason, can't afford it. Whatever the reason, they are working for companies that don't offer health insurance coverage[[Page S101]]for their families, or they are families with children with special needs.  I have introduced to my colleagues before Crystal This is Crystal's son Noble, a first-grader in Dublin, OH, a small, prosperous suburb west and northwest of  I met Crystal and Noble last year, when they made the trip from Ohio to Washington to talk to Members of Congress about Crystal's life is not easy because she is taking care of a child with a disability whom she so clearly and dearly loves. I could see, watching Noble, how much he loves his mother and how important they are to each other.  Noble was born with a rare genetic disorder. He needs three therapy sessions every week. He gets daily hormone injections. His medications cost $1,500 a month. I talked to Crystal when she visited. I talked to her again. We talked about how she and her family are scared to death about what will happen to them if Congress doesn't save  This is not difficult. Congress has renewed it every year for 20 years. It is bipartisan. It has never had much of any opposition. There are a lot of people like Noble's mother. Crystal said CHIP is ``the difference between living a middle class lifestyle, or being part of the poverty line.''  Congress had time to hand out massive permanent tax cuts to the richest Americans and the biggest corporations that send job overseas, but it could only manage to scrape together just a little short-term 3 months of funding for these families.  It is really what is wrong with this city. Folks here listen too much to the lobbyists. I remember--and the Presiding Officer remembers, too--seeing the stream of lobbyists from drug companies, from insurance companies, from the big banks, and from the oil industry, in and out of Senator McConnell's office, writing a tax bill. We remember that from just a couple of months ago. But for some reason, Crystal and Noble couldn't get in that line--the line of lobbyists asking for huge tax breaks, saving billions of dollars for their employers while these lobbyists are paid very well. But, frankly, there was nobody having the political wherewithal to convince the majority leader that we ought to move on the CHIP bill.  Healthcare for our kids shouldn't be controversial. It never was until this recent Senate and until this recent President was sworn in. It shouldn't be partisan. It should be easy. It is a program created 20 years ago. It was bipartisan. It has always been bipartisan. It still has bipartisan support today, except that the Speaker of the House down the hall and the majority leader a little closer to us just simply don't want to pass it.  We passed the CHIP extension out of the Finance It is ready to go. Republican leaders could put it on the floor today, and it would pass. I am guessing that it would pass with no more than 5 or 10 ``no'' votes.  I want my colleagues to explain to Noble's mother Crystal and to explain to other mothers and fathers like her why corporate tax cuts are more important than their children's health.  This is about whose side you are on. Do we work for the corporations that send our jobs overseas, do we work for those companies that line up hungrily for tax breaks, or do we work for families who just want the peace of mind so they can take their kids to the doctor?  It is past time for folks in Congress, with taxpayer-funded healthcare, to do their jobs and extend I don't want more families to get a letter like this from their capital city, from the Department of Welfare or the Department of Job and Family Services, whatever it is in each community in each I don't want any more parents to go to the mailbox, to open this letter, and to have that fear and anxiety hit them in their gut, thinking: Oh, my God, my children's health insurance may be canceled.

428,topic-id,570,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.Garrett) for organizing this in support of those protesters in It is the ongoing protests that started late last month in Iran that are significant not just for their people, but also for the world.  While these protests started because of a dire economic situation in Iran, with upwards of 40 percent of its youth unemployed, it has grown to be a nationwide movement that is about much more than just the economy.  Over the past couple of weeks, we have seen the Iranian people flood the streets in favor of fundamental freedoms, economic opportunity, and a government that represents their interests, not Hezbollah's. There are even reports of people chanting, ``We don't want an Islamic Republic,'' or, ``We will die, but we will take Iran back.''  This has been a long time coming. A State Department report in 2016 found that Iran is the top state sponsor of terrorism in the whole world. Whether it is providing financial support to Hezbollah or providing arms to Islamic rebel groups in Yemen, the Iranian Government's priorities are obviously more focused on wreaking international havoc than they are on addressing the pressing issues within their own country.  And while we are talking about issues with Iran, the protesters are pleading for fundamental freedoms. For example, married women aren't even allowed to travel outside the country without permission from their husbands. They also risk being put in jail or even to death if they take off their hijab in public.  But brave women throughout Iran have been unmasking themselves during the last couple of weeks in protest. To many in our country, this may seem insignificant, but videos of these women and their courage have been shared millions and millions of times around the globe.  Mr.Speaker, those who dislike President Trump have criticized his approach to foreign policy, but these same people fail to praise his strong defense for freedom when it comes to  As soon as the protests started, President Trump put out a statement that said the Iranian people are hungry for food and for freedom. He also said that it is time for a change, and I couldn't agree with him more.  This is the opposite of the Obama administration that preached moral authority and, yet, sided with the corrupt Iranian regime and the corrupt Iranian Government when anti-regime protesters took to the streets back in 2009.  So now that President Trump has proven his credibility on the global stage by siding with the protesters, the question is: Now, where do we go from here?  Well, Mr.Speaker, first we should increase the sanctions on the Iranian Government in response to their crackdown on protesters for freedom in recent weeks.  President Trump should also strongly consider pulling out of the nuclear deal that was struck by President Obama in 2015.                              {time}  1730  We have already seen the Iranian Government break parts of the agreement, and we should have a zero tolerance for these breaks because the consequences are just too grave.  Mr.Speaker, the people of Iran are bravely speaking out against their government and they are calling for change. For the United States to continue to be a shining example of freedom and liberty, we must continue to vocalize our support for these protesters in Iran and make sure that they know that we have their back.

1046,topic-id,1481,"Mr.President, I wish to thank Senator Blunt from the great State of Missouri for his leadership on this issue. He chairs the subcommittee that is very pivotal--the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services--and has moved forward so aggressively to up the funding in this area. We have the pedal to the metal now.  As he said, when we are moving and coming to a final spending bill, this has to be a top priority for us. It is absolutely critical. I am really pleased to be on the subcommittee, but I want to thank him for--I know he works diligently with NIH, which holds big promise. We are always looking for solutions. Can we treat ourselves out of this? Can we law enforce ourselves out of this? Can we prevent ourselves out of this? I think we can do all of those. We have to have a component of research that looks at the alternatives to pain medications and pain management.  The current bill we have looked at is $816 million for programs to combat opioid abuse issues, and that is a 440-percent increase from the previous year.  I am going to go through this. It might sound a little mundane and detail-oriented, but people say: That is great to ``up'' the amount of money that you are spending, but where are you really spending this money?  The Senator from Missouri, Mr.Blunt, mentioned that it has to be done locally, and there is a lot of emphasis on where these dollars are going.  Some of them are going, of course, to the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for prevention issues, which is critical, while $50 million is going to our community health centers. In States such as Alaska, West Virginia, and Missouri, community health centers are seeing hundreds of[[Page S148]]thousands--millions--of people every day and many more who are dealing with mental health and substance abuse. SAMHSA oversees the mental health grants that go to our States, and there is $15 million for a new SAMHSA program for opioid prevention. We have our drug-free communities program, which works well in my It is a total grassroots-up, bottom-up, when you get everybody from your local county or public health and others in the room to try to solve this issue. Then again, there are some block grant programs to our community health centers along with the funding to This is a broad-based look at where the funding is going.  We have an opportunity here in the next several weeks to ``up'' that funding, to make sure that the national priority that we feel, as Senators from States that are highly affected, is reflected in our funding. I believe that with Senator Blunt's leadership on the subcommittee and with other members on the subcommittee, that is something we are going to be doing.  I happen to chair the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee, which appropriates the money for the high-intensity drug task forces. Our State has over 22 counties that are in that. Is that a branding that you really want--that you are a high-intensity drug trafficking area? Not really. What that does is coordinate Federal, State, and local resources to help meet the challenge and face what a difficult problem you have. I work with funding on that, with the drug-free communities, and also with the President's Office of National Drug Control We have done a lot, and we have pushed for resources.  The Senator mentioned resources for our first responders. He mentioned how dangerous it is. There have been local stories about our first responders who have just touched fentanyl--just touched it--and have gone into overdose situations. We were at the White House yesterday and were talking, and the President mentioned drug-sniffing dogs that have had reactions to fentanyl. So this is a very lethal substance. Actually, I saw in the statistics for West Virginia that more of the recent overdose deaths are attributable to fentanyl than to heroin itself, and that is rising. We need the money for enforcement, prevention, treatment and recovery, and more resources for research, and I have mentioned how critical that research will be.  Nationwide, we had over 63,000 drug overdose deaths in 2016, and a number of these were attributed to heroin and fentanyl. In my State of West Virginia, we had the highest deaths per 100,000 for overdoses. I would like to say it is happening somewhere in which maybe we would have predicted that it would happen, but it is happening everywhere. It is happening to the children of friends of mine.  Ryan Brown, a young man in West Virginia, lost his life. He had a loving home, loving parents, and had been through treatment. He just couldn't fight it. He went back and injected himself with a lethal dose. He died in a very public place too. It was very tragic. To his credit, his parents have taken up the mantle for Ryan to try to get more treatment centers in the State of West I thank them for that.  We were just at the White House--Republicans and Democrats--for the President to sign the INTERDICT I sponsored that bill with Senator Rubio, Senator Markey, and Senator What it does is help give our Customs and Border Patrol folks the ability to detect fentanyl when it is coming in. We know it is coming in from across our borders, principally from China, maybe China through We need to equip our Border Patrol agents to be able to stop that--interdict the flow of that lethal substance.  Just this week, The Hill newspaper published an op-ed about the Martinsburg Martinsburg is in West Virginia, in the Eastern Everybody needs to visit They have an innovative police-school-community partnership that is spearheaded by the Martinsburg Police Department, the Berkeley County Schools, and Shepherd University, along with the Washington/Baltimore This is a comprehensive strategy of intervention and treatment for families to help prevent the beginning of the addiction to opioids.  In December, I attended the kickoff of the Bridge of Hope Fund, and I want to highlight what some of the local communities are doing in my State to try to get a comprehensive spectrum of solutions. This is a new scholarship program that was developed by Fruth Pharmacy, which is a locally-owned, family-owned pharmacy, that will allow people who have completed addiction recovery programs to get a jump-start on their college educations and career training.  The founders of the program started it because they wanted to encourage people who have reclaimed their lives and been successful to be able to get back into the mainstream. We know one of the roadblocks to recovery is getting back into the work environment--to be able to get a job. Many of these young folks who are in this position have already burned through their education grants and their availability of Pell grants. So this Bridge of Hope scholarship is an organic, from-the-ground-up scholarship program for those who have been through treatment.  We had a young man who talked about his road to recovery and how important getting his education and getting back on his feet was. We need more everywhere. I think that is essential to all of us. We have to prioritize our Federal funding for States like mine that have been the hardest hit by the opioid epidemic.  I see my colleague from New Hampshire here. Both of us have joined together on the Targeted Opioid Formula Act so that those of us who have high statistics and greater need are able to have those funds more squarely targeted toward us for prevention and treatment.  There are a lot of good ideas out there. There are a lot of things going on, but there is a lot of tragedy around all of us. I would say to the folks in the gallery and certainly to everybody on the floor that you probably know a family or you probably know a community or you probably know somebody who has been hard hit by this. It is absolutely crushingly sad, heartbreaking, because it is preventable. It is something on which we can have an impact. If we don't, we are going to lose another generation.  I have great fears that we are going to look back on this moment in time and think we didn't do enough. So I think, with Senator Blunt's help and the help of others, particularly with Senator Blunt's chairing the Appropriations Committee, this is the direction in which we need to go. We need to have more targeted funding so those local resources can be creative in order to stop the scourge, to handle the scourge, and to educate the next generation as to how devastating this could be if one were to ever begin to go down this road.

It is how Russia has interfered not just here in the United States but in  I want to start with the statement that this is not a partisan report. Yes, I commissioned it as the Democratic ranking member because decisions had to be made early in 2017 on the allocation of resources. I know the Presiding Officer knows, I worked very closely with Senator Corker on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and throughout the development of this report, I have kept Senator Corker informed.  The work of this report has relied upon the work of many Members of the Senate on both sides of the aisle. In fact, I think the Presiding Officer will recall the work we did--Democrats and Republicans--in the passing of legislation in 2017 that held Russia accountable for its maligned activities. I was proud that I had the strong cooperation and support and leadership in developing that legislation from Senator McCain, Senator Graham, and Senator Rubio, who contributed greatly to the enactment of that legislation, and on the Democratic side, Senator Menendez, Senator Shaheen, and Senator Durbin.[[Page S155]]  This report is the accumulation of a year's work. It had professionalism and dedication and patriotism of the very talented staff at the Senate Foreign Relations I want to acknowledge that because I know all of us recognize that our staffs are critically important to the work we do in the  Damian Murphy was our captain on this project. He was the one who provided the leadership to make sure we had a thorough report, that we had an accurate report, and that our recommendations would be tailored to make our Nation more secure. Terrell Henry provided incredible help throughout the entire year. Laura Carey was an instrumental part of getting this done. Megan Barkley helped us with making sure all of the sources were properly cited.  I also want to acknowledge my Democratic staff leader, Jessica Lewis, who really was the one who decided early that we could get this done and encouraged me to move forward.  Lastly, this report has received considerable attention since I released it yesterday--considerable attention--because this is the first comprehensive report that has been authored that deals with Russia's maligned activities, which are global in nature. Sean Bartlett was capable of making sure this story would be heard. I thank him for his professional work in the way we were able to get this report circulated.  Following the 2016 elections, I thought it was important that we shed more light on the Russian Government's efforts to interfere in democracies beyond our own. Anyone who thinks the threat posed by Russia is limited to hacking emails or the American election in 2016 is missing the real story, and that is what this report shows.  We wanted to describe the scale and scope of this threat to make the American people aware that the Russian Government's interference in the 2016 elections are part of a pattern of behavior and warn that Russia could attack again in 2018 and 2020. The Kremlin is a learning organization, and they are constantly perfecting and improving their techniques.  This report is the first government report to lay out in detail exactly how the Russians operate. Mr.Putin employs an asymmetric arsenal that includes not just military invasions--and they do use their military--but cyber attacks, disinformation and propaganda, and support for fringe political groups. They have employed the weaponization of energy resources. They have a network of organized crime, and they have a system that is fueled by corruption.  This threat existed long before President Trump and will remain following his tenure, unless he takes steps and we take steps to address it.  Our report examines how the Russian Government has sought to interfere in 19 countries across Many lessons are to be learned from our allies in Europe that have shown his behavior can be deterred. While many in the executive branch understand the threat and have taken steps to address Mr.Putin's asymmetric arsenal, Presidential leadership has been absent. Never before has a U.President so clearly ignored such a grave and growing threat to our national security, and without Presidential leadership, the United States will remain uncoordinated in its response.  The Washington Post reported in December that the National Security Council has not had a meeting on countering malign Russian influence--more than a year after the intelligence community assessment that Russia interfered in our elections.  Mr.Putin's rise to power in 1999 was cynical and opportunistic. He capitalized on a war in Chechnya and apartment bombings in Moscow to shore up his image as a strong hand that could steady the country after the rocky 1990s.  To do so, this former KGB officer emboldened his security services to play an outsized, criminal role in running the state. Mr.Putin's regime used violence to stop those who opposed him in and outside of Russia, cheated his way through the Olympics, and, through his security services' connections with organized crime and money laundering, has emboldened cyber theft and racketeering that has real-world implications for U.companies and citizens.  Mr.Putin developed his techniques first at home against his own people. In Russia, he repressed independent civil society, journalists, and political opposition, while manipulating cultural and religious influences, the media and information space, and a corrupt crony capitalist system to shore up his own regime.  The tools in Mr.Putin's asymmetric arsenal are drawn from a Soviet playbook but updated with new technologies. These include propaganda and disinformation, cultivating political fringe, religious and cultural groups as influencers, and weaponizing crime and corruption as a system of governance.  In Europe, Mr.Putin's Russia has invaded countries, attempted coups, cut off countries from energy in the middle of winter, temporarily crippled governments with cyber attacks, created a whole new way to exponentially spread fake news using bots and trolls, and used dirty money as a weapon to attempt to buy candidates and political parties. The report illustrates these events in more detail in the 19 countries across  The international response to the Kremlin's arsenal has been a patchwork. Some European countries have shored up their democracies in ways the United States has yet to do, in a strategic, whole-of-government fashion. Europe's experience with Russia's meddling shows it can be deterred, and the United States must take steps to deter Russia now, as laid out in the report's recommendations.  The report helps us to understand why Mr.Putin is doing this. He is doing this because that is all he has. Russia's economy is faltering. It has a limited military capacity. It doesn't have many friends around the world. Its economy is about 7 percent the size of the U.economy--ranks 12 in the world. It is smaller than Italy or South Korea or Canada, but we have to acknowledge he has had success with the use of these tools, with the use of these weapons.  He has accumulated, by reported sources, more than tens of billions of dollars of stolen wealth. He has a propaganda machine that has been able to make him popular at home and accomplish many of his objectives in other countries. He has slowed down Serbia's integration into the EU and Ukraine and Georgia's ability to join NATO because of Russia's troops located in its countries.  The report highlights the lessons we have learned from our It is interesting, the Europeans understood this risk before we did and took action. The Brexit campaign in the UK, Russia was clearly engaged in it. Prime Minister May has made a resolute public statement that Russia's meddling is unacceptable and will be countered.  France looked at what happened in 2016 in the U.elections, and they took steps. The Macron campaign was subject to cyber attacks with emails from President Macron during the campaign. They were released shortly before the runoff election, but France was prepared, and they were able to counter that. The French Government worked with independent media and political parties to expose and blunt the dissemination of fake news.  In Germany, we saw the famous ``Lisa case'' that was fabricated by Russian-sponsored news outlets in order to incite the Russian-German community for an anti-migrant-type protest. The German Government bolstered democratic cyber security capabilities, particularly after the 2015 hack of the Bundestag, and the Interior Minister proposed creating a Center of Defense Against Germany has acted.  In the Nordic countries, the states have largely adopted a whole-of-society approach, with an emphasis on education that teaches critical thinking and media literacy. They have a curriculum in their school for their schoolchildren to be able to differentiate between what is real and what is fake in the news.  In Lithuania, the government diversified its supplies of natural gas. All the Baltic governments have worked to integrate their electricity grids to reduce dependency on Russia for energy needs.  In Spain, the Spanish Government has investigated, exposed, and cut off significant money-laundering operations by Russia-based organized crime.[[Page S156]]  So what do we do about this? Russia has this plan to compromise our democratic institutions. What do we do about it? Well, the report spells out many, many recommendations. I am proud to say that many of these recommendations have been championed by Members on both sides of the aisle.  First, we call upon Presidential leadership. We need President Trump to acknowledge the threat and establish a high-level interagency fusion cell to coordinate all elements of U.policy on the Russian Government's malign influence operations. The President should present to Congress a comprehensive national strategy and work to get it implemented and funded.  Second, the U.Government needs to support democratic institution building and values abroad. We need stronger support for these programs. The United States should provide assistance to help bolster democratic institutions in European states.  Members of the U.Congress should conduct hearings and use their platform to make democracy and human rights an essential part of their agenda. I am proud of the work we have done in the Senate Foreign Relations Working with Senator Corker, we have highlighted human rights throughout the year, but we need to do more. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has recommended to the full Senate that we pass legislation so we can start evaluating every country and its ability to fight corruption, patterned after the ``Trafficking in Persons Report'' on human trafficking. We need to get that bill enacted into law.  Third, we need to expose and freeze Kremlin-linked dirty money. We should declassify any intelligence related to Mr.Putin's personal corruption and cut off Mr.Putin and his inner circle from the international financial system. We know that the elite class in Russia does not want to hold their money in rubles; they want dollars. We have to deny them that opportunity. They also would like visas to visit the United States; they don't want to be stuck in Those sanctions have an impact, and we need to make sure they are enforced.  Fourth, we need to create a ``state hybrid threat actors'' designation and impose a sanctions regime. The United States should designate countries that employ malign influence operations to assault democracies as ``state hybrid threat actors.'' Those designated would fall under a preemptive escalating sanctions regime that would be applied whenever the state uses weapons like cyber attacks to interfere with a democratic election or disrupt a country's vital infrastructure. We need to make it clear that, yes, we want relations with all countries, constructive relations, but if they are going to use these weapons against our democratic institutions, we need to be prepared to increase our sanctions against these countries.  Quite frankly, what we must understand is the importance of democracy against what Mr.Putin is trying to do.  Fifth, we have to defend the United States and Europe against foreign funding that erodes democracy. We need to pass legislation to require full disclosure of shell company owners and improve transparency for funding of political parties, campaigns, and advocacy groups. We have bipartisan legislation to do that. Let's get that passed. We know that shell companies are shielding illegal funds. Let's make sure that Russia's game plan is not funded through shell companies that are located here.  Sixth, we need U.leadership to build global cyber defenses and norms and to establish a rapid reaction team to defend allies under attack. We should push NATO to consider the implications of a cyber attack within the context of article V and our ability to defend each other. We should also lead an effort to establish an international treaty on the use of cyber tools in peacetime, modeled on the international arms control treaties.  Lastly, we need to hold social media companies accountable. Government should mandate transparency for funding political advertisements. This is the new way of communications. We have to catch up with technology in our laws. We require traditional advertisers to disclose all this information, but we have left social media alone because we didn't know about it when we passed these laws. We have to make sure that we have full laws on disclosure. Companies should conduct audits on possible Kremlin-supported meddling in European elections over the past several years. Companies should establish civil society advisory councils and work with civil society and government to promote media literacy.  That is just a sampling of some of the recommendations that are in this report. It is pretty comprehensive, but I think it does give us a game plan to understand that we can protect our national security, and we must.  Following the end to World War II, the United States led the world in constructing the liberal international order, underpinned by democratic institutions, shared values, and accepted norms. It protects our shared security, advances our interests, and expands our prosperity. Yet the defense of that system of institutions and democratic principles is anathema to Mr.Putin, who seeks to protect little more than his power and wealth. It is therefore up to the United States and our allies to engage in a coordinated effort to counter the Kremlin's assaults on democracy in Europe, the United States, and around the world.  In closing, we must take care to point out that there is a distinction between Mr.Putin's corrupt regime and the people of Russia, who have been some of his most frequent victims. Many Russian citizens strive for a more transparent and accountable government that operates under the democratic rule of law, and we hope for better relations in the future with a Russian Government that reflects these values. We applaud the courage we saw very recently from the protesters in Russia, who stood up against Mr.Putin because they want basic freedom in their country.  I remember very clearly that when we passed the Magnitsky law that holds those who violated the basic human rights, in Russia, of Sergei Magnitsky, who was just doing his job as a lawyer--that they would be denied our banking system and denied the ability to travel to this country--when that bill was enacted, it was the people who were protesting against the government who said: That law passed by the U.Congress was the most pro-Russian bill passed by the U.We stand with the people of  I am also the ranking Democrat in the U.Helsinki I have worked for the Helsinki Commission for a long time. The Helsinki Commission includes all the countries of Europe and the former Soviet Union, the United States, and All countries had signed on to the Helsinki Final It talks about basic democratic principles, and it gives each member state the right to challenge the activities of every other member state.  We have an obligation to call out what Mr.Putin is doing because it is not only against our national security interests; it is not only hurting the people of Russia; it is against the commitments Russia made in the Organization for Security and Co-operation in  The United States must work with our allies to build defenses against Mr.Putin's asymmetric arsenal and strengthen international norms and values to deter such malign behavior by Russia or any other country.  I stand ready to work with all of my colleagues to protect our national security interests and to recognize the threat that Mr.Putin poses to our democratic institutions. I look forward to a day when we can truly have a better relationship with Russia because they stop this assault on democratic institutions in Europe, the United States, or anywhere in the world.

169,topic-id,1197,"Mr.President, Republicans just passed the largest tax reform package in 30-something years, and middle America will go home in February with bigger paychecks than they did--I say in February because it will not take that long for the IRS to update their software. They will go home with more money in their pockets.  If there has been a theme in the Trump administration, it is that they want those working Americans, those middle-class Americans, to do better under this President than they did in the previous 8 years. That tax reform package is part of that, and I am amazed that my Democratic colleagues objected to it. They objected to middle-class Americans having more money in their pockets, in their take-home pay, for no other reason, I think, than to resist President                 Offshore Oil and Gas Leasing Proposal  Mr.President, what I am about to speak about speaks to better jobs and better wages for working Americans, for those middle-class families.  This afternoon, the U.Department of the Interior released the Trump administration's draft proposed program for offshore oil and gas leasing. This proposal would mean more affordable energy made right here in the United States of That is good news for American workers and families. I commend President Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke for their commitment to supporting American workers and making America energy dominant.  For decades, past administrations have handcuffed American energy manufacturers by restricting offshore leases to the western and central Gulf of You could only drill there, not elsewhere. Past plans left 90 percent of U.offshore resources off limits to energy producers and in the process said no to thousands of good-paying American jobs and billions of dollars in offshore investments--when I say ``offshore,'' I mean off the American shore[[Page S37]]but creating jobs here in the United States of  The Trump administration's proposal rejects the status quo and puts American workers and families first. It would open areas with significant oil and gas potential--areas off the coast of Alaska and the Atlantic and Pacific and portions of the eastern Gulf of  What are the ramifications of this? According to one study, opening the eastern Gulf of Mexico would create nearly 230,000 new American jobs by 2035. It would bring roughly $115 billion of investment to the United Federal, State, and local governments would collect an additional $70 billion in tax revenue by 2035, not because rates are going up--rates have now gone down--but, rather, people are making more money, and because they are making more money at lower rates, Federal, State, and local tax receipts continue to increase. American energy production would be boosted by about 1 million barrels of oil, making our country more secure.  Let's take a look at the State-by-State job increases from these lease sales. Florida gets the biggest gain of all--87,000 new jobs by 2035. Texas would add 62,000. My home State of Louisiana would add 31,000 new jobs. Alabama would add 21,000; Mississippi, 12,000; and the rest of United States, 15,000 new jobs.  I know some of my colleagues across the aisle, including my Democratic colleague from Florida, have expressed concerns about this energy production plan's impact on fishing and military training in the Gulf of Let's remember that oil and gas manufacturers have coexisted with other activities for decades. I share my colleagues' interest in protecting our communities, businesses, and the environment. The reality is that these goals are not mutually exclusive, especially on the gulf coast.  Let me use Louisiana as an example. According to NOAA, Louisiana has 4 of the 10 top ports in the country by volume and value of seafood landed. In 2016, two Louisiana ports alone received 670 million pounds of seafood landed in the gulf. This is in addition to the oil and gas production off of our coast. Together with Texas, our two States accounted for half of U.shrimp landings.  NOAA also reports that roughly half of the jobs in commercial and recreational fishing in the gulf exist in States where there is also oil and gas production. Recreationally, gulf anglers accounted for 33 percent of fishing trips, which equals 39 percent of the total U.catch.  Of course, more than 85 percent of recreational landings were in inland estuaries or State territorial waters. Most of the oil and gas activity we are discussing today is in deeper, Federal waters many miles away.  Again, the gulf coast is a working coast, and it has been proven over the decades that multiple industries can successfully coexist.  When my colleague from Florida brought up his concerns about potential conflicts with the Department of Defense operations in the Gulf of Mexico, I took that very seriously. Ensuring that our military is equipped to train and test is vitally important. However, it is simply not true that the eastern Gulf of Mexico must be completely free of energy production in order for the military to conduct operations. Our military's own testing data from the last 5 years makes that very clear. This map shows all the Department of Defense testing done in the last 5 years in the eastern Gulf of The Department of Defense used only 19 percent of the eastern Gulf of Mexico during the last 5 years. To put it differently, 81 percent of the gulf went untouched.  When you look even more closely at the space regularly used by our military, it becomes clear that this objection to energy production in the eastern gulf does not pass the smell test.  This is the Panhandle of Right here is the State of For those who are interested in it, the Florida-Alabama bar is right there, and this is where folks from Louisiana love to go and enjoy themselves.  This is, if you will, zoomed in on the last map and shows the spaces the military used for more than 14 days during that 5-year period. So over 5 years, these are the spaces it used for more than 14 days--not per year but over the 5 years. Only 0.5 percent of the eastern Gulf of Mexico was used by the Department of Defense for more than 14 days over the last 5 years--0.5 percent. That means that the Department of Defense regularly uses only 1 out of every 200 acres in the gulf.  I have met with both the Interior Department and the Defense Department and urged them to work together to ensure the best use of Federal waters. This data shows that it can be done.  I am confident that, under the Trump administration's proposal, we can provide thousands of Americans with good-paying jobs, boost our energy manufacturing and security, strengthen our economy, and do it in a way that is environmentally responsible and protects our communities.  I applaud today's announcements because it will make a true difference for our country and for the American people, the American worker who has not done well over the last 8 years but under this administration has begun to do well, and this is the next step in making sure that his and her future is as bright as it ever could be.

384,topic-id,805,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership on this.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of all three of these overwhelmingly bipartisan bills.  First, I would like to speak on H.535, the Taiwan Travel Act, a bill which I introduced this Congress along with my colleague, Congressman We appreciate his support on this and a lot of other issues in this Congress, Chairman Royce and other Members as well.  For close to 4 decades now, the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act has served as a cornerstone of U.S.-Taiwan relations, and together, with President Reagan's six assurances, we have maintained peace and stability and security in the Asia-Pacific region. However, there are still major steps that we can take to further strengthen the U.S.-Taiwan relationship.  I believe one of the most important improvements that we can make is to allow the President of Taiwan and other high-ranking officials, like Taiwan's foreign and defense ministers, to visit Washington, our Nation's Capital, something that is currently prohibited. This is our own self-imposed policy and it is outrageous. These restrictions are only carried out because of potential diplomatic retaliation from the PRC, from  Personally, I think restricting high-level visits by senior Taiwanese officials is not only insulting, but it is counterproductive.  We should be encouraging more direct dialogue with the democratically elected President of Taiwan and other highest elected officials.  We let the leaders of China, the PRC, come to Washington on a regular basis and we give them the highest honors, yet we shun the democratically elected leaders of our longtime ally,  We need to send a strong signal that the current approach to bilateral contacts and communications between the U.and Taiwan is outdated and it is time for it to go and be changed, and that is what this bill is all about.  If we seriously want to promote greater democracy in the region, we should be as supportive as possible to the countries that are actually practicing democracy, and that is what Taiwan does. It is a longtime ally of ours.  That is exactly why I introduced the Taiwan Travel Act along, again, with Congressman Sherman and Chairman Royce a year ago--January 13, 2017, to be exact.  This bill, which has broad, bipartisan support from a long list of cosponsors, states that our government should encourage visits between the U.and Taiwan at all levels.  Mr.Speaker, I would also like to quickly voice my support for H.3320, a bill championed by my friend and colleague, Chairman Ted This bill directs the Department of State to assist Taiwan in regaining observer status in the World Health Organization, Unfortunately, Taiwan has been excluded from participating in most of the really important international organizations, including the WHO, for almost 50 years now.  Many of my colleagues and I have advocated for years for Taiwan's meaningful participation in the WHO, much to the dismay of China, which has consistently thwarted these efforts.  Taiwan's exclusion from the WHO creates a dangerous and unnecessary gap in global health, especially considering the stellar health research and medical resources Taiwan has to offer.[[Page H59]]That is why H.3320 is so important. WHO membership for Taiwan is not only in the best interests of Taiwan, it is in the best interests of the rest of the world, including the United  Mr.Speaker, lastly, I want to voice my support for 676, Chairman Royce's and Ranking Member Engel's resolution supporting the rights of the people of Iran and condemning the Iranian regime for its crackdown on legitimate protesters. This is a commonsense measure.  The current regime in Iran has never respected human rights or the rule of law. The recent situation in Iran only underscores this reality.  I am pleased to see my colleagues quickly condemning the atrocities by that government this very day; however, I want to take this opportunity to stress the importance of remembering the big picture in It is a country, let's face it, that is being run by thugs. Not only do they perpetrate violence and marginalize their own people, they harbor, promote, and finance terrorism throughout the region. They threaten America and its allies. They continue to develop ballistic missiles, which we know that one day they would like to have tipped with nuclear devices. That could be a threat not just to our allies in the region, but the United  This most recent outbreak of civil unrest in the country should not be a surprise, considering the Iranian regime's ruthless tactics.  Mr.Speaker, I hope my colleagues join me in support of this measure also and take further steps to hold Iran accountable for both its domestic and international violations. I urge my colleagues to support all three of these measures.  Mr.Speaker, I again want to thank the gentlemen from California, Chairman Royce and Mr.Sherman, for their support on these and other measures.

It is a massive expansion of the government's ability to pry into the private lives of innocent people. If you need proof, just look at the bill's section 702 which is supposed to authorize spying on foreign adversaries, but it has emboldened some in law enforcement to collect and read private communications of American citizens without a warrant.  Instead of curbing these practices, 139 would codify and expand some of the most abusive of surveillance practices used in recent years, including ``abouts'' collection and backdoor searches.  There is no more important responsibility that we have than keeping the American people safe, but we have to do it in a way that is consistent with our values and our This bill undermines our values of privacy and freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures.

The resolution provides for consideration of 140, to amend the White Mountain Apache Tribe Water Rights Quantification Act of 2010 to clarify the use of amounts in the White Mountain Apache Tribe Settlement This bill also includes the text of 249, a bill to provide that the pueblo of Santa Clara may lease for 99 years certain restricted land; and H.986, the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act of 2017.

This language would allow Tribal governments to be excluded from requirements for employers under the National Labor Relations When President Franklin Roosevelt signed the NLRA into law in 1935, Congress wisely excluded governments, all governments, from the definition of ``employer.''  At the bill signing of the NLRA, President Roosevelt said: ``This Act defines, as a part of our substantive law, the right of self-organization of employees in industry for the purpose of collective bargaining, and provides methods by which the Government can safeguard that legal right.''  The President made clear in his speech at that time that the intent of the law is that it should apply only to workers in the private sector. Tribes are governments and should be treated as such. The intent of the law was and is clear: Tribal governments supervise the employees within their governments and enterprises, not the Federal  From 1935 until 2003, nearly seven decades, the National Labor Relations Board agreed and interpreted the statute in a way that did not apply to Indian Tribes because they were governments. In 2004, the NLRB abruptly changed course and, for the first time, held the act applicable to Indian The NLRB did this by highlighting the fact that the act did not expressly include Tribal governments among those excluded from the phrase ``employer.'' This is simply an egregious act of bureaucratic overreach.  Let me be clear. In this case, acting on its own, the NLRB expanded its jurisdiction. Neither the existing administration at the time nor Congress asked or ordered the NLRB to take this action.  The impacts of labor strife on Tribal governments and economies are more harmful than on other governments because there is no effective tax base in Tribal communities. Indian lands are held in trust by the United States and are not subject to taxation. The high unemployment rates and legal restrictions make income taxation an unfeasible option.  As a result, the businesses operated by Tribal governments, gaming operations, Tribal agriculture, energy and timber operations, and other Tribal government enterprise constitute the sole source of revenue that is used to fund essential government services for  This bill has drawn bipartisan support in our effort to reverse the decision of the In the 114th Congress, the same language passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 249-177.                              {time}  1400  This bill will strengthen Tribal sovereignty and correct this overreach, directing the NLRB to enforce the NLRA, National Labor Relations Act, as it was originally intended. In the end, Mr.Speaker, all we are doing here today with this bill is affirming what was Congress' original intent. The NLRA does not have jurisdiction over Tribal governments.

747,topic-id,1105,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, my good friend from Colorado covered a lot of ground, so let me try to respond to some of that area because a lot of it doesn't have a whole lot to do with the legislation until the final phase of his remarks.  In terms of CHIP, we actually agree. I think that's something--and, frankly, this House should be proud it passed a CHIP bill on a bipartisan basis months ago. Our real problem is the United States Senate simply hasn't produced legislation. It doesn't have to accept our legislation. It just needs to pass a CHIP bill so we can go to conference and bargain.  I am pleased that both sides, frankly, have worked to make sure that, when we have done extensions of government spending as we work through some of these knotty issues, we continue to fund I think the leadership on both sides of the aisle have been clear about that, and I think we will. But, again, it will be great when the Senate finally passes a bill or we make this part of a larger spending bill.[[Page H99]]  In terms of my friend's points about the Dream Act, I am honestly heartened at the discussion that took place at the White House yesterday. I think there is a genuine desire to come to an agreement on But the real issue there is border security in addition to legal status.  These folks, obviously, I think, deserve legal status; but you also have to fix the problem, and the problem is on the border. So the outline of the deal is there if people approach it in good faith on both sides of the aisle. I take the fact that we had leadership in both parties meeting with the President yesterday as a good sign in that regard.  In terms of the budget, we probably have at least some areas of agreement. My friend didn't vote for it, but it is worth noting, the House passed every single appropriations bill before the September 30 deadline. We have been waiting now for over 120 days for the United States Senate to just pass a single appropriations bill.  We are in discussions with them now, and I think at some point, when there is an agreement as to what the top line number is--and I think we might not be too far away from that--then we will be able to proceed. But again, this House has done its work. Just as it did on CHIP, it produced legislation on time, and it is prepared to sit down and negotiate with the Senate whenever the Senate decides it can get around to getting its job done.  In terms of the National Labor Relations Act, the Tribal sovereignty portion of this bill, let me point out a couple of things.  My friend does have an excellent record, honestly, in terms of support on Native American issues. This is just an issue where we disagree. There will be Republicans and Democrats who oppose this legislation. There will be Republicans and Democrats who support this legislation.  It is not really purely a partisan question at all, but it is worth noting, the Indian community is united on this issue. The National Congress of American Indians, over 150 Tribal organizations and individual Tribes have come and asked the Congress to correct this oversight.  The fact that this happened in the way it did, that is, the National Labor Relations Board acted on its own to extend its jurisdiction, had no instructions from Congress to do that, had no request from the administration to do that, they just decided they would do it all, that is my definition of a regulatory body run amuck.  For almost 70 years, the NLRB recognized that it did not have jurisdiction in this area and did not try and do it. This is a very new thing. It aroused opposition in Indian Country immediately.  Again, we don't apply these standards to any State government or any local government. We have lots of State governments and lots of local governments involved in activities that are not strictly governmental. They run municipal golf courses. They do water parks. None of these things are necessarily inherently government. They are not forced to comply with this. So we should extend to Tribal government, which we historically have done, the exact same status and rights in this regard as we do to State and local governments.  We would all be pretty upset if the Federal Government decided it would interject itself in this way into the affairs of any individual State or any of the individual localities that we represent.                              {time}  1415  Working for a public entity is different. You certainly have rights, but there are restrictions. You have certain rights, like the right to strike, that in most States and most localities do not exist. Tribes should have the same right to make those sorts of decisions for themselves. Again, they resent and have resented historically the violation of their sovereignty. In this case, a regulatory agency without the authority of this body and without the authority of the administration that existed at that time acted on its own.  What the Indian nations and Indian Country have come and asked is: Restore us the sovereignty that you historically accorded us.  That is all this legislation does.  The last point, my friend says this is unlikely to become law. I beg to disagree. Not only did this pass the House on a bipartisan vote in the last Congress, but this Congress it has been reported out of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs on a bipartisan vote. There is every reason to believe this. We will see what the administration does. But I suspect views change over 25 years, and I would hope the administration is supportive of this. As a matter of fact, as I recall, I think they issued a statement to that effect.  So, regardless, let's do our job. Let's continue to do the job we did in the last Congress when, on a bipartisan basis, Republicans and Democrats alike decided Tribal sovereignty was an important issue. We should work together to defend it and to expand it. In this case, we are working to reclaim something that a Federal agency took away, acting on its own, over a decade ago. So the solution to this is long overdue.  Mr.Speaker, I would certainly urge my friends to support the rule and, more importantly, the underlying legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.

751,topic-id,600,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Again, Mr.Speaker, I certainly respect my friend's right to bring up a subject that they think is important and is important, and it is appropriate that they use their time to do that.  I would remind them that there is a negotiation underway. I think the issue here is less about DACA probably and more about border security. The issues are naturally paired together. These young people came here through no fault of their own. They are not responsible for any sort of criminal act. But they were transported across a very porous border.  So to ensure that we are not here again doing the same thing again, strengthening that border at the same time that we provide legal status seems the appropriate thing to do. I suspect neither is achievable without the other linked together.  So I take it that the two sides are negotiating. I am not involved in those negotiations. I am not a member of the relevant committees, but I think the two sides are involved in that negotiation. My hope is that they come to an agreement and that we can have a large, bipartisan victory and a piece of legislation that we are all proud of. But I suspect it is going to take some give-and-take on each side to achieve that.  I do want to go back, though, to the principal underlying legislation here and ask my friends--many of whom, by the way, will support this legislation. There will be considerable Democratic support for this. But I would hope--and, again, I understand this is an issue of competing goods, but sovereignty is not something we should grant to States and localities and deny Indian  We should not have a double standard here. If we need to make changes across the entire Labor Relations Act, fair enough. I guess we should consider that. But we should not single out Tribes and make them subject to capricious, arbitrary, bureaucratic activity deciding on what their legal status is, what their rights are, and interfere with their ability to operate their own businesses, which are absolutely indispensable to supporting their governmental activities.  We do not give Tribes the power to tax. They can't tax their own land. They can't tax their own citizens. If they are not successful economically, they have to rely on the limited resources given by the Federal Government to do everything from protecting their citizens to providing healthcare for their citizens and to making sure that there is appropriate education for their citizens. They ought to be able to do what other governments do and earn money and run their own affairs.  We allow States to do that. We allow localities to do that. For almost 70 years, we allowed Indian Tribes to do that. Then we took it away from them. They are not even asking for something new. They are just asking for something that was taken from them, in terms of their authority and sovereignty, to be restored to them.  Mr.Speaker, again, I go back to urging the passage of the underlying legislation. I hope that we continue to work on these other issues that my friends have brought up. We are working on them in areas like CHIP, like the DACA question, and like the border security question.  But let's also take our time and pass this very important piece of legislation and restore to Indian Tribes what the National Labor Relations Board took away from them over a decade ago.

753,topic-id,529,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to respond to a couple of my friend's points.  Let me begin by disagreeing respectfully with my friend's assertion that people are having their rights stripped away.  The only people losing their rights here are Indian That is what happened when the NLRB did what it did. Without the direction of Congress or the administration, it decided on its own it would treat Indian Tribal governments different than it treated other governments. So it is those rights to the Tribal governments that we are busy trying to restore.  My friend, who, again, is very good on Indian issues, as a rule, and I understand the competing claims here. So I recognize the tension that is involved in that. But it is not as if Tribal governments don't have their own labor codes and their own standards. Frankly, those have to comply with American law.  Under the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1965, there is absolutely nothing that a Tribal government can do that would contravene the guaranteed rights in the United States Constitution for all  So to suggest that they are somehow violating the rights of American workers, I think, is to mischaracterize who they are and how they have acted. What they have said is, if we are sovereign, if the Federal Government says that State governments and local governments are allowed to regulate their own workforces, then Tribal governments are allowed to do the same.  I want to disagree also with my friend. There are lots of municipal golf courses in the United There are lots of municipal water slides. There are park systems. You can go to the State of Virginia and it happens to own the liquor business in the It has decided it is going to make that a State function. We don't regulate those employees.  So the idea that just because it is a money-making activity, that we then somehow treat it differently, we don't do that to any locality or any State in the country.  We just had an unelected Federal agency decide on its own it was going to do that to Indian It is not doing it to anybody else, just to I would submit that that is fundamentally unfair. Again, nobody's rights are taken away. Every American citizen has exactly the same right.  But if you were to go to work for the Federal Government, you don't have precisely the same rights you do in the private sector. The same thing is true here. If you choose to go to work for a Tribal government, you live within that regime. That regime has to comport with the Constitution and the laws of the United States, and you have not lost your action rights in Federal court if you think there is a violation.  So I think, frankly, this is a case that is crystal clear. You treat everybody the same way, every governmental unit the same way. That is all the Tribes are asking for.

756,topic-id,1778,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend, and I want to stress that, while we disagree on this, I appreciate his efforts in Native American issues. He has a record that, I think, is an excellent record overall. We just disagree very profoundly in this case.  I will say this: if you happened to just casually turn on the coverage of the debate at any point, you might wonder what we were debating about. In the course of the debate, we have talked about CHIP, we have talked about the DREAMers, we have talked about the budget, we have talked about We have spent a lot of time talking about a lot of different things other than the information at hand. I don't begrudge my friend. He feels very passionately about those areas.  It is interesting to me that, on the FISA issue, for instance, we will actually have a debate tomorrow. The amendment my friend supports will be in order tomorrow. We will have an opportunity to do that.  I think there are good faith efforts underway on both sides on the DACA issue and on the issue of FISA, particularly on the issue of the budget as well. Again, I wish this place worked a little differently. Sometimes deadlines are like alarm clocks here, but those things are underway.  What we are talking about today is also an effort that has been waged by Indian nations for over a dozen years to try and reclaim part of their sovereignty that was unjustly taken away from them.  I am going to disagree with my friend very profoundly. Nobody's rights have been taken away. Every American's rights are guaranteed by the Constitution of the United The Indian Civil Rights Act of 1965 makes it abundantly clear no Tribe can do anything in contravention and restrict the rights of  The only people who have lost rights in this whole discussion and episode have been Tribal governments who had their right to regulate their labor affairs, the same way we allow States and localities to do it, taken away from them.  It wasn't taken away from them by an act of this We never passed legislation. It wasn't taken away from this because the administration ordered some agency of the executive branch to do something. It was taken away because, acting in a rogue manner, the National Labor Relations Board, on its own, decided it would expand its legal authority.  Well, that is great. They may have a case to make. But that is not what they are supposed to do. They are supposed to operate within the authority Congress gives them. If they think they need a grant of additional authority, they come to Congress and ask for that grant of additional authority. They don't simply, on their own, decide they will willy-nilly violate the rights of a sovereign Native American nation. That is exactly what happened in this case. Frankly, the Tribes have been extraordinarily patient in pursuing the remedy to this.  I think we ought to, today, take the opportunity to rectify a wrong that an agency of the executive branch did without the consent of Congress or even without the consent of the President of the United States at the time and allow Tribes to reclaim the authority that they exercised for over 70 years.  If we think we need to do something different in that regard, that is a fair point to make. If we do, it needs to be the same for State governments and local governments. You don't single Tribes out of sovereign entities and impose something on them that doesn't apply to everybody else that is a sovereign of the United States of  Mr.Speaker, in closing, I encourage all Members to support the rule, but I recognize my friends probably will not, and that is fair enough. That is normal partisan debate.  But with 140, the House is taking steps to strengthen Tribal sovereignty. This body actually has a pretty good record. I worked with my friends across the aisle when we passed the Violence[[Page H103]]Against Women Act, which had a very important component giving Tribes back some of the jurisdiction that they needed to regulate domestic abuse and sexual assault on their own territory.                              {time}  1445  My friends were overwhelmingly supportive and helpful in that measure. It would not have happened without them, so I know in many cases we do agree. But in this case, under this bill, Tribal governments will be able to be excluded from the requirements for employers under the NLRA, just like State and local governments.  This legislation will reverse the bureaucratic overreach of the NLRB and clarify the law once and for all. This bill is a commonsense solution that will clarify the original intent of Congress that the NLRA does not have jurisdiction over Tribal governments.  I applaud my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for this work. We will actually have a split decision over this. There will certainly be some Republicans supporting my friend's position, but by and large, I think this House will do what it did the last time it considered this legislation, and that is, on a bipartisan basis, pass the law.  This time, given the action of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, we have every reason to believe the legislation will be picked up and sent to the President's desk, where I am confident it will be signed.  The material previously referred to by Mr.Polis is as follows:            An Amendment to 681 Offered by Mr.Polis       At the end of the resolution, add the following new      sections:       2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the      Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare      the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on      the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.     3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment      of status of certain individuals who are long-term United      States residents and who entered the United States as      children and for other purposes. The first reading of the      bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against      consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be      confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally      divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority      member of the Committee on the After general      debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the      five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in      the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of      the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report      the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been      adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered      on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without      intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or      without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and      reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then      on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately      after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of      rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further      consideration of the bill.       3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.3440.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution. . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

1091,topic-id,513,"Mr.President, today I wish to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the city of Sanford, Sanford was built with a spirit of determination and resiliency that still guides the community today, and this is a time to celebrate the generations of hard-working and caring people who have made it such a wonderful place to live, work, and raise families.  The year of Sanford's incorporation, 1768, was but one milestone in a long journey of progress, a journey that is inextricably linked to the history of our In 1661, British Army General William Phillips purchased large tracts of land from two chiefs of local Abenaki Tribes for his growing lumber business. Called Phillipstown, the lands remained largely uninhabited due to the ongoing conflict between England and France for control of the northern American  Hostilities in the region ceased in 1739, and the new community grew rapidly, reaching a population of 1,500 within just a few decades. At the time the town was incorporated in 1768, Maine was a province of Massachusetts, and the Governor of Massachusetts used the occasion to honor Peleg Sanford, stepson of William Phillips and former four-term British Governor for the State of Rhode  When the American Colonists fought for independence, Sanford stood with them. The city's cemeteries contain the headstones of 33 patriots who joined freedom's cause.  With the Mousam River providing power, Sanford was home to more than a dozen sawmills and gristmills. In the 1860s, Sanford truly became a city of industry when Thomas Goodall established a massive textile mill that produced everything from material for clothing to railroad car upholstery. Skilled textile workers poured into Sanford from Europe and French Canada, giving the city an international flavor that still exists today.  In the 1950s, the owners of Sanford's textile mills began moving operations to southern States, leaving behind thousands of jobless workers and vast, empty factories. Local business and community leaders responded with the energy and determination that defines the city, traveling throughout the country to entice new employers. Noting this remarkable effort, LIFE magazine called Sanford ``the town that refused to die.'' Today Sanford has a diversified industrial base, from textiles to technology.  Sanford is among Maine's oldest municipalities, but it also is Maine's newest city, having changed its charter from the town form of government to that of a city in 2013. It is also new in the sense of embracing the technology of the future through the construction of both the largest municipally owned broadband network in Maine for economic development and a 50-megawatt solar array for renewable energy generation. The new Academic and Career[[Page S166]]Technical High School that will open this summer reaffirms Sanford's commitment to education.  The celebration of Sanford's 250th anniversary is not merely about the passing of time. It is about human accomplishment. We celebrate the people who, for longer than America has been a nation, have pulled together, cared for one another, and built a great community. Thanks to those who came before, Sanford, ME, has a wonderful history. Thanks to those there today, it has a bright future.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-11-pt1-PgS165-5.txt,2121,NET NEUTRALITY,2018.0,11.0,January

Originally called Pleasant Mountain Ski Area, the facility opened with a rope tow on January 23, 1938. That day of celebration was preceded by many years of hard work by Bridgton's Lions Club and Chamber of Commerce, Bridgton Academy, the Pleasant Mountain Ski Club, and the local Civilian Conservation Corps to plan, raise money, and clear trails. With Maine's Western Mountains providing spectacular views of the Lakes Region and Mount Washington, Pleasant Mountain soon began attracting skiers from throughout New  Renamed Shawnee Peak in 1988, the ski area has long been a place of innovation, including the site of Maine's first T-bar and chairlift.

877,topic-id,581,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague from While I am not unappreciative of my colleague from California's comments, I do think we are at a place where we do need to move forward. If we succumb to the emotions of what is going on around us and don't stick to the facts, stick to what we are trying to get done, I think that we do that to our detriment. So I have great respect for my colleague and his opinions, but I personally believe that plays into the emotions of what is going on rather than the facts of what is going on. If we can, I believe we should just continue to push forward.  First, let me say that the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act is a bipartisan compromise bill that preserves the operational flexibility of section 702 while instituting key reforms to further protect U.personal privacy.  One of the major issues discussed over the past year has been NSA's ``abouts communication'' collection--a tortured title, but, nevertheless, we will stick with the phrase, ``abouts communication.'' So ``abouts communication'' collection takes place in NSA's upstream collection and, due to how the internet communications work, allows NSA to collect the communications that may reference a section 702 target's email address.  Despite what some of my colleagues may push in their propaganda, ``abouts'' collection does not collect names of targets, just selectors. Some of my colleagues also suggest that ``abouts communication'' is inherently in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the U. While the FISA court has raised concerns about ``abouts communication'' collections in the past, NSA has been able to conduct such collections with the approval of the FISA court. This type of collection is at issue today because it was the subject to a compliance incident in 2016. NSA self-reported a problem to the FISA court and decided to cease ``abouts communication'' collection until a fix could be implemented and demonstrated to the court. I would like to note that that type of self-reporting of compliance incidents is expected of the intelligence community elements and proves that oversight mechanisms are in place and that they work.  Other potential legislation, including the amendments to today's base bill, would seek to permanently end ``abouts communication'' collection. This is a shortsighted and a dangerous proposition that will limit the NSA's ability to identify threat networks in the future.  Rather than ending ``abouts communication'' collection, 139 strikes, I believe, that right balance. If NSA wants to reestablish ``abouts communication'' collection, NSA would first need to go back to court, convince the judge that it has satisfied the court's concerns. After achieving judicial approval that NSA has made the necessary technical changes, NSA would then brief congressional Intelligence and Judiciary Committees on how they plan to reinstitute this type of collection. Barring congressional action, NSA can then start ``abouts communication'' collection, 30 days after those briefings.  Some of our opponents to 139 claim that 30 days is not enough. To the folks that claim that 30 days is not enough, there is nothing stopping Congress from acting after that 30-day window. However, NSA should not be penalized and America's security should not be compromised and prevented from obtaining valuable foreign intelligence information that the FISA court has deemed consistent with the Fourth Amendment just because Congress can't pass legislation in 30 days.  This compromise of the bill that is on the floor today, I believe, is the right answer, and I hope my colleagues will support 139.

The estimated cost is $98.4 million.       This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and      national security of the United States by helping to improve      the security of a strategic partner. Mexico has been a strong      partner in combating organized crime and drug trafficking      organizations. The sale of these ship-based systems to Mexico      will significantly increase and strengthen its maritime      capabilities. Mexico intends to use these defense articles      and services to modernize its armed forces and expand its      existing naval and maritime support of national security      requirements and in its efforts to combat criminal      organizations.       Mexico intends to use the weapon systems on its Mexican      Navy Sigma 10514 Class ship. The systems will provide      enhanced capabilities in effective defense of critical sea      lanes. The proposed sale of these systems and support will      increase the Mexican Navy's maritime partnership potential      and align its capabilities with existing regional navies.      Mexico has not purchased these systems previously. Mexico      will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment into its      armed forces.

The      MK 54 LWT is an upgrade to the MK 46 The MK 54 LWT      contains new sonar, guidance and control systems with modern      technology. The new guidance and control system uses a      mixture of commercial-off-the-shelf and custom-built      electronics. The warhead, fuel tank, and propulsion system      from the MK 46 torpedo are re-used in the MK 54 configuration      with minor modifications. The MK 54 is highly effective      against modern diesel and nuclear submarines. It has advanced      logic that allows it to detect and prosecute threat      submarines operating in challenging littoral environments. It      is also effective in the presence of advanced countermeasures      that may be deployed by threat submarines. The assembled MK      54 torpedo and several of its individual components are      classified The MK 54 operational software is      classified as SECRET as is any hardware upon which the      software has been installed. Mexico has not requested nor      will it be provided the source code for the MK 54 operational      software. The MK 54 has a feature referred to as ``Memory      Scuttle'' that erases the operational software at the      conclusion of any exercise firing so that the software will      not be compromised if the torpedo is not recovered after the      exercise firing. Possession of MK 54 Torpedoes and associated      equipment should not lead to any vulnerability disclosures.       5. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain      knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the      information could be used to develop countermeasures or      equivalent systems which might reduce weapon system      effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with      similar or advanced capabilities.       6. A determination has been made that the Government of      Mexico can provide substantially the same degree of      protection for the sensitive technology being released as the      U.This proposed sale is necessary to the      furtherance of the U.foreign[[Page S104]]     policy and national security objectives outlined in the      Policy       7.

48,topic-id,2309,"Mr.President, many recall that Christmas came a little early this year--or, I should say, last month--as we delivered comprehensive tax reform to the American people--a historic overhaul of our Nation's Tax Code and the first since 1986, more than three decades. Since that time, the President has now signed the bill into law, and we have already begun to see signs of how tax reform is transforming the economic landscape across the country and making life better for American citizens.  The New York Times reports that job creators are eager for the tax cuts to take effect and that a wave of optimism is surging among them. That is their quote, the New York They report that businesses are ready to create jobs and raise wages. They will invest in new plants and equipment that will bolster economic growth, grow the economy, and help to create more jobs and improve take-home pay.  It is not just the New York Times that sees optimism spreading. There are plenty of real-world examples that illustrate that as well. One healthcare and home products company announced that in response to the tax bill, it would award all employees a $100 bonus for each year they have worked for the company. So if an employee has been at the company for 8 years, the average tenure, that would be an extra $800 in his or her pocket to fix their car, repair a water heater, or replace carpets in their living room.  Two telecom giants recently announced even larger bonuses for hundreds of thousands of their employees, raises of $1,000 each. Now, it may be that these companies are getting ahead of the game, because in a tight labor market, where unemployment rates are relatively low and where economic activity goes up, we know there is going to be more and more competition for good workers, and that means that employers are going to be required to pay more for those workers in that competition for workforce and labor. So it may be that these companies are a little bit ahead of the game, but I expect to see, whether it is done as these companies have done it or not, in a low unemployment rate scenario where there is more competition for workers because more economic activity is occurring, that more jobs are being created and that we are going to see all workers' take-home pay increase as a result.  These companies have also said that they plan to increase capital spending in response to the tax reform we passed last month. Some banks have said they will raise their minimum wage to $15 an hour and donate as much as $400 million to community and nonprofit organizations.  One major airline in my home State of Texas announced that it will give all full-time and part-time employees a $1,000 cash bonus and make $5 million in additional charitable donations. They have also said--because they believe there is going to be an increased number of people flying--that they are going to buy more jets, more planes to accommodate that increase in air travel. This is all good stuff when we are looking at getting the economy growing again and creating more jobs and better wages.  Finally, German economists recently released a study finding that the U.corporate tax rate will now sharply improve incentives for foreigners to invest in America--exactly what we wanted to happen. Of course, this will come at the expense of high-tax countries in So just think of it as their loss is our gain, but that is exactly why we felt it was necessary on a bipartisan basis to reduce what was effectively the highest business tax rate in the world, at 35 percent. That is why people like Barack Obama in 2011 called for us on a bipartisan basis to reduce that rate and to make it more competitive, and the Democratic leader, Senator Schumer, and others, and Republicans on our side of the aisle all agreed that this was the right policy. Well, now we are beginning to see that policy pay off as a result of the bill we passed in December, which was signed into law on December 22.  I would say that all these examples are pretty telltale signs that the optimism reported by the New York Times isn't fake news. It is real. Tax reform is changing the economic landscape, paychecks are growing, and job creators are responding in all sorts of positive ways. I think that is a terrific way for us to begin 2018.  Now, for all of us who worry about what is going to happen to our individual paycheck, the good news is that the IRS is now working hard to update its withholding guidance documents and, once it does, Texans and Americans, in general, will begin seeing larger paychecks, more take-home pay hopefully as early as  Well, that is the good news. That is what we were able to accomplish at the end of last year that will hopefully continue to pay dividends in terms of economic growth and take-home pay and more jobs, but we still have a lot of work to do.  Over the next few weeks, we have a very, very full plate. First and foremost is funding the Federal Government and avoiding a shutdown come January 19, when our stopgap continuing resolution expires. It is crucial that both sides come together to ensure that critical government functions are not held hostage to other demands. High on my list is to make sure that we continue to fund our national security and the Department of Defense and continue to pay our warfighters and make sure that they receive the training and equipment they need in order to keep our Nation safe. That is just one of the items, but it is my highest priority.  The second is close to it, and that is making sure we provide natural disaster relief. This last year, we saw what seemed to be an unprecedented array of natural disasters--from wildfires out West to historic rain events like Hurricane Harvey in Texas and Louisiana, and hurricanes in Florida, the Virgin Islands and, of course, Puerto I commend the House for passing the $81 billion disaster relief package last month, but with so many record-setting disasters this last year--first and foremost in my mind is Hurricane Harvey in Texas--we, in the Senate, need to take a little extra time to make sure that all of the varied competing interests are accommodated. In the coming weeks, I am going to continue to work with my colleagues to ensure that Texans whose homes, schools, roads, and workplaces were affected by the storm receive the help they deserve and so desperately need. We are not asking to be treated any better than anybody else, but we are not going to accept being treated worse.  We look forward to working together with our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico, in Florida, out West, and, of course, in Texas and Louisiana to make sure that we do our job and treat everybody exactly the same. The House bill is a useful starting point, but it is my hope that we can improve upon it and make sure Texas can fully recover and rebuild.  Third on my list of to-dos is an important national security program that most people may not have heard much about, which allows the Federal Government to obtain communications of foreign intelligence targets, which is set to expire on January 19. One of the technical advantages that the United States has over any other country in the world is our ability to listen to foreign actors and gather intelligence that will forearm our first responders and our national security apparatus, as well as others, to keep our Nation safe.  This particular law, which has been called the crown jewel of our national security by the Director of the FBI, is known as section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Amendments Act, an essential safeguard against terrorism and a valuable tool for gathering foreign intelligence, as I have said. We need to work quickly to ensure that it is reauthorized for a long term.  The fourth item on our to-do list is addressing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, or You will recall that back a few years ago now, President Obama decided to try to unilaterally issue an order providing work permits and legal status to roughly 800,000 children, now adults, who came with their parents illegally[[Page S11]]to the United While these are certainly the most sympathetic group of people whom we need to address--and I think we can, and we will in a compassionate and honest sort of way--I am grateful to President Trump for returning the fate of this program where it belongs--in the hands of That is after President Obama's DACA provisions failed in Federal court.  I am confident that both sides can come to an agreement regarding the legal status of these roughly 800,000 individuals who were brought to the country illegally while they were still quite young. That includes 124,000 DACA recipients in my State of Texas alone.  Many of these individuals make valuable contributions and should not be penalized for decisions made by their parents, the legal ramifications of which they could not at such a young age fully understand or consent to. But any such agreement must include corresponding measures regarding an enforcement of our immigration laws.  I think that one of the biggest tragedies in recent years in our country is that the American people have simply lost confidence in their government when it comes to securing the border and enforcing our immigration laws. I believe this provides an opportunity, not only for us to provide compassionate relief to the DACA recipients I mentioned a moment ago but to restore an enforcement of our immigration laws, including border security, the additional personnel, and the technology required in order for us to know who is coming into our country and why they are here and to make sure that they only do so by legal channels.  My hope is that our Democratic colleagues will abandon their threats to shut down the government and will engage with us in good faith, because we stand ready to talk to them and negotiate in good faith as well.  Finally, on my personal to-do list is my goal to pass the bill we call the Fix NICS Act as soon as possible. This is to fix the National Instant Criminal Background Check System that is checked by federally licensed firearms dealers when somebody goes into a store to buy a firearm--whether it is a shotgun to hunt, a pistol to defend themselves, a rifle for hunting, or for home defense. I think it is really important in the wake of Sutherland Springs for us to get this bill passed.  This is the bill I filed after those terrible shootings in Sutherland Springs, which resulted in the loss of 26 innocent lives, with about that same number injured as well. This tragedy was entirely preventable because the individual who committed that heinous act on that day was legally disqualified from purchasing a firearm by the fact that he was a convicted felon, he had been convicted of domestic violence, and he had been committed to a mental health institution. But none of that information was uploaded by the Air Force into the National Instant Criminal Background Check  What did he do when he went in to buy firearms? He simply lied, and he said he had no disqualifying event in his life like those I mentioned earlier--convicted felon, mental health institutionalization, and a domestic violence conviction. He simply lied about it. The background check system failed us and the people who were victims of that terrible day in Sutherland We need to get that fixed.  This is one of those rare times when folks who are ardent believers in the Second Amendment, as am I, and those who are perhaps less inclined to be enthusiastic about the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens can come together and say: Let's at least fix the current law. Let's make sure that if somebody is disqualified from buying a firearm, this National Instant Criminal Background Check System actually works.  I am delighted to say that Senator Murphy from Connecticut, Senator Feinstein from California, and Senator Schumer, the Democratic leader from New York, have joined me and Majority Leader McConnell and so many others on our side of the aisle to say that this is something we can and we should do. I simply cannot face the prospect of looking into the eyes of somebody who has lost a loved one as the result of a preventable mass shooting incident like we saw in Sutherland We have the ability here to pass legislation that will save lives and to prevent people who are legally disqualified from purchasing firearms from doing so.  All of these on this list are just a few of the challenges we face as a new year begins. I think these are things we can address on a bipartisan basis. I know we had some tough fights last year on healthcare and tax reform, and our Democratic colleagues seemed disinclined to help at all to work with us to pass those pieces of legislation. I am hoping that with this new year and, hopefully, the optimism that goes along with it, our colleagues will work with us in goodwill for all and a renewed determination to do what is right, not only for the folks we have the honor of representing but for our entire country.

172,topic-id,1805,"Mr.President, I know we are back, fresh from the holidays, at the start of a new year, and all of us are already thinking a lot and working hard on the tasks we have at hand. We have a lot to do, especially before the next continuing resolution expires on January 19.  But I don't want to make the mistake of failing to recount the good work we were able to accomplish on behalf of the American people in 2017 because, sometimes, in the hustle and bustle of life, we fail to acknowledge those things that we have actually been able to do, for which we ought to be grateful, and that our constituents need to know about. I would like to take just a few minutes to do exactly that because, unfortunately, in the hyperpolitical and hyperpolarized political environment we live in today--especially with the advent of social media--there are always some naysayers and pundits who want to offer their comments. One of the things I have noticed most about many of those naysayers and pundits when they comment on what is happening here in Washington is how little they know about the facts. The facts matter, and I want to offer those for the public's consideration now.  In January of last year, the Nation was quickly called to order following the inauguration of President One of his first actions was to nominate Neil Gorsuch to the U.Supreme I think most of us were astonished at the quality of this selection, many of us not being familiar with the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals on which Justice Gorsuch served in Denver,  Justice Gorsuch was quickly confirmed in April, and then we moved on to fill other judicial vacancies, which, of course, are the prerogative of the President to make that nomination and to then be confirmed with the advice and consent of the We, like the President, have made filling these judicial vacancies a priority.  The fact is, though, that the Senate is in the personnel business. In other words, our friends in the House of Representatives don't have to vote on confirmation of judges and other Presidential nominees, but we in the Senate have that responsibility. All told, we have confirmed 19 men and women to the Federal bench in 2017, setting a record for appellate judges confirmed during a President's first year in office. Two of them, Jim Ho and Don Willett, I am pleased to say, will serve from Texas on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals that sits in New These are exceptionally qualified nominees--and typical in that description of the types of people that President Trump has selected to serve in the Federal judiciary.  But our work wasn't just confined to confirming the President's nominees. After 8 years of overreach, hundreds of burdensome rules passed during the[[Page S39]]previous administration--many in the waning hours of President Obama's Presidency--were rolled back or suspended. I am glad Congress did its part, using the Congressional Review Act to roll back 15 harmful regulations last year. As much as anything, I think that has contributed to the soaring stock market, the increase in consumer confidence, and the extraordinary rebound of our economy.  As last summer began, we passed a bill funding Texas priorities. It funded things like the National Space Administration programs at Houston's Johnson Space Center, which will advance missions, hopefully back to the moon and eventually to We allowed through that funding to make sure that the Department of Homeland Security had what they needed to hire additional Border Patrol and agents at ports of entry to improve those checkpoints and to add immigration court judges too.  I remember thinking about Hurricane A friend of mine years ago asked the rhetorical question: Do you know what makes God laugh? Then he answered: When we make plans.  Hurricane Harvey is perhaps an example of that, because we were making other plans when we got this natural disaster known as Hurricane  Texas was pummeled with the most extreme rain event in the history of the United States, devastating more than 28,000 square miles along the coast. I, along with the entire Texas congressional delegation, helped secure roughly $30 billion for recovery efforts, but the thing I am most proud of is the way ordinary Texans responded to their neighbors in need. They weren't waiting around for Washington to act first. They wanted to act to help their neighbors, their community, and their  Recognizing we have the Presiding Officer from Louisiana, I just want to make special note of the Cajun Navy that came over from Louisiana to help rescue people off of their rooftops. That is part of what makes not only Texas and Louisiana great, but it is what makes America great, too, when people will come to the aid of their fellow  As Texans tore out sheetrock and molded carpet in their living rooms, Federal resources helped piece together the lives disrupted. Now we have to make sure we complete the task by delivering additional relief not only to Texas but to Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, as well as to those States devastated by the wildfires out The House having passed a substantial disaster relief bill and sent it over to us, I am hopeful that is something we will take up and pass very soon, perhaps as soon as January 19.  I spoke about natural disasters, but now let me turn to a manmade disaster. After the hurricane, Texas was dealt a second blow just 2 months later, when a man opened fire at a church in Sutherland Springs, With multiple convictions for domestic violence, a felony conviction, and a history of mental illness, this individual should never have been able to legally purchase a firearm because, under existing law, those conditions disqualify you from being able to purchase a firearm, if you are a convicted felon, convicted of domestic violence, or have a history of mental illness.  That is why, following this terrible disaster where 26 people were killed, I introduced the bipartisan Fix NICS Act--that is, Fix the National Instant Criminal Background Check System Act--to ensure existing laws are enforced and convicted felons don't exploit our background check system by lying and buying. I am going to continue to urge the passage of this important piece of legislation, which is, as I say, bipartisan, as it should be.  The fall of 2017 gave way to winter and soon came the flurries of snow not only here in Washington but back home in The week before Christmas, we completed comprehensive tax reform--a historic overhaul of the Tax Code and the first in more than three decades.  We said originally that our goals were threefold: One was to make the Tax Code simpler; the second was to make sure everybody in every tax bracket saw a decrease in their tax liability; and third was to make the American Tax Code competitive in the global economy. Until that point, we had the highest tax rate in the industrialized world, which caused companies to move or invest offshore and create jobs in other countries rather than the United States because we had the most burdensome tax in the industrialized world.  As I said, this bill--now law--reduces taxes in all income brackets and boosts the standard deduction and child tax credit. This means that only 1 out of 10 taxpayers will likely choose to itemize because they will actually benefit more from the standard deduction along with the child tax credit. It will allow businesses to add jobs, raise wages, and reinvest in the United States from overseas. For example, a family of four making the median income will see their taxes drop by more than $2,000--a reduction of nearly 58 percent.  Tax reform complements an economy that has already been truly unleashed under this administration. Just since January, the economy has added 1.7 million new jobs, and over the last two quarters, our economy has grown at more than 3 percent--as compared to an average of only 1.9 percent under the previous administration.  While not historic in the sense that the tax bill was historic, there is other legislation we passed with little fanfare but significant impact that I would like to mention.  One is a bill I championed called the PROTECT Our Children Act, which reauthorizes task forces to combat child exploitation online. The second I would like to mention is a bill that tackled elder abuse. A third, called the SAFER Act--which was signed today by the President--reauthorizes rape kit audits and prioritizes the training of pediatric nurses handling sexual assault cases.  I was shocked and chagrined a year or so ago to learn there could be as many as 400,000 untested rape kits either sitting in evidence lockers or in laboratories untested. Now, thanks to the Debbie Smith Act--named after a heroic woman who has championed the funding of Federal efforts to identify and test this backlog of rape kits--that number is far smaller today, but reauthorization of the SAFER Act is important to keep our commitment to victims of sexual assault that we will do everything in our power to help them identify their assailant and bring them to justice, and, at the same time, exonerate people who may be falsely accused because there is no DNA match.  Finally, other legislation I filed and has now been signed into law assists police departments in hiring military veterans. We know our police departments are always in need of good, highly qualified applicants for those important first responder jobs. Once signed by the President, it will streamline the process that Active-Duty personnel and reservist members go through to apply for their commercial driver's license.  We know it is a long and arduous process to apply for a commercial driver's license, so why not take our Active-Duty military who are soon to retire or our veterans and expedite their ability to qualify for a commercial driver's license when they leave the military?  As I said, these bills don't grab big headlines, but they chip away at problems and were passed on a bipartisan basis--which I think puts the lie to the canard that nothing ever gets done in  The job of men and women in Congress is to serve the people who elected us. This last year we made important strides, but our work is just beginning. As I said at the outset, there is much that lies ahead. Many Americans and many Texans are still knocking at the door of greater prosperity. I hope we will make it our New Year's resolution to open that door a little wider in 2018.  I yield the floor.

517,topic-id,1407,"Mr.President, just over 2 weeks ago, President Trump signed a historic tax reform bill into law. Some, not really knowing what was in the bill and people who were determined to find fault with it, were let's just say a little skeptical at first. They wondered what this whole thing was about and who would actually benefit. But now the verdict is starting to come in. Many folks are pleasantly surprised, for the first time in a while, knowing that Congress and Washington, DC, actually have produced something that will make their lives better. They are appreciative because they are seeing the immediate consequences. In response, more than 100 companies have announced they will give wage increases, they will increase their charitable contributions, and they will give bonuses to their employees. One million Americans are receiving money they previously didn't have, thanks to passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs  But it is not just about bonuses, of course. We expect that once the IRS updates its withholding tables, wages will rise, too, take-home pay will go up, and hopefully people will see that in their paychecks in As my colleague the junior Senator from Ohio wrote last week, ``With this tax reform, the proof will be in your paycheck.'' Families can spend that extra money any way they wish, of course. That is the point. They can spend it on projects long delayed. They can spend it on their kids. They can give it as an allowance or some modest compensation for chores performed or apply it to their kids' future education, or people may just figure out they want to save for a rainy day. The number is pretty shocking as far as how many Americans are living paycheck to paycheck and cannot sustain a $400 loss in income and make things work for them. So this will provide them, if they wish, a little bit of cushion for a rainy day. They can donate it to their house of worship. They can help a neighbor or a friend who has fallen on hard times.  In some places, we are learning that families will enjoy lower utility rates based on what gas and electric companies are doing for their residential customers in light of their new tax savings. In places such as Michigan, Montana, Minnesota, Kansas, Kentucky, South Dakota, and Arizona, the utility regulators in those States are looking at the tax reduction of those investor-owned utilities and how that will calculate into the rate of return that they are guaranteed under the law. But it looks to me as if it will be good news for consumers, that lower heating bills will be the result during the chilly times of the year and lower air-conditioning costs and other electricity costs when spring and summer come around. So it is encouraging to see this sort of perhaps unexpected consequence of tax reform but one that will directly benefit consumers.  This is real, it is significant, and it is like priming our economic pump--a little push here and a pull there because of tax reform, and all of a sudden, the entire engine of the American economy is chugging along and will soon be running at full speed.  In Texas, you can hear the economy humming along healthily, and we should listen. We should listen to the voices of the job creators like one in New Braunfels, which is between Austin and San It is called Rush Rush Enterprises specializes in commercial vehicles. It reported last month that it planned to give each of its 6,600 employees a $1,000 bonus after President Trump signed the tax reform into law--$1,000 each to 6,600 employees. The chief financial officer of Rush Enterprises talked about the additional savings the company would incur as a result of the reduction in its tax rate, which fell from 35 percent to 21 percent. He said:       You've got a choice. We could've kept it and stuffed it in      the company bank account or coffers, or we can share it with      the people. We chose to share it with the people because it's      the right thing to do.  Well, I couldn't be prouder of that demonstration of the great Texas spirit--employers paying it forward.  This gentleman went on to say that his company believes tax reform will be beneficial not only for his office and his employees but also for his community and for overall economic growth. To him, it is about the bigger picture.  New Braunfels, though, isn't the only place where companies are paying it forward. A telecom giant, AT&T, headquartered in Dallas, TX, and two prominent airlines--American Airlines and Southwest Airlines--have responded in similar fashion, offering large bonuses to hundreds of thousands of their employees and promising to make significant capital investments in the future and update their fleet of aircraft--all with the savings they will incur as a result of this Tax Cuts and Jobs  Meanwhile, a restaurant company that owns a chain of popular steakhouses in Texas and elsewhere has announced it will use its savings from lower rates--about $70 million--to improve customer service and to provide additional benefits to its employees. The restaurants will be spending a significant amount of money to make sure the dining experience is more worthwhile, hopefully providing not only jobs to the people who prepare the food but those who serve it and the vendors who sell it. Not only will this legislation have the effect of improving a waiter's and waitress' salary, but I think this demonstrates once again how the impact of tax reform is far-reaching, perhaps in ways we really didn't necessarily think about. But this is what happens when people get to keep more of the money they earn. They spend it in a way that improves their quality of life and improves their economic security.  In Texas, our economy hopefully will continue its steady ascent. In its annual economic freedom index, an organization called the Fraser Institute just ranked Texas as 2 in the country. I am not too happy about that. We don't like being 2 in anything. But we have been in the top five of this list for 11 straight years, and it has been because of our lower taxes, our fiscally conservative approach to spending, and our commonsense approach to regulation that makes it easier for investors and entrepreneurs to succeed. When they succeed, that means more jobs are created and people can do the work that provides them the means to support their family and improve their quality of life. We call that the Texas model. Although it is not particularly unique, you would think it would be common sense. But as they say, here in Washington, DC, common sense is not all that common.  Nationally, the situation is looking up, too, in part because the Trump administration shares this Texas approach. The U.economy added 2 million jobs in 2017, and unemployment is at a 17-year low. Consumer confidence is at an alltime high since it was first recorded--I believe it was about 16 years ago. Over the last two quarters, the economy has grown by more than 3 percent. That is up from roughly 1.9 percent during the previous administration. People are excited to see the economy continue to improve in 2018 thanks to tax cuts and other regulatory reform and a government that is no longer hostile to private business and job creation.  I am glad to hear how many positive steps have been taken over the past few weeks in response to tax reform, but it is early. As I pointed out, it has only been a couple of weeks. I look forward to hearing many more such stories in the days ahead.  I intend to spend this next year, when I travel around the State of Texas, looking for the small businesses and individuals who benefit from this[[Page S85]]important piece of historic legislation. I look forward to coming back to the floor of the Senate to continue to share the stories of this success. Letting people keep more of what they earn, having more take-home pay, improving their standard of living, and making the United States more competitive in the global economy--rather than seeing businesses and investment move overseas, let's see that come back home, which I think we will see in droves, and the American people will be better off for it.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-09-pt1-PgS84.txt,1692,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2018.0,9.0,January

770,topic-id,2232,"Mr.President, I admit I wasn't here during the entirety of the comments from our friend, and I saw his to-do list. The only thing missing from that to-do list was to fund our military--or at least I didn't see it on there. In all fairness, maybe he mentioned that in his comments.  We now have 9 days to reach an agreement to keep the government funded, to keep the lights on, to keep paying the salaries of our government employees, and, of course, to fund our military, which ought to be our 1 priority. If we think about things that government must do, funding our national defense is the only thing that we can do and that government can do. There are a lot of other things that government does that are optional or maybe things we would like to do, but funding our military is the 1 priority--or should be.  As the Senate majority leader mentioned earlier this week, our Democratic colleagues persist in the notion that we should only increase defense spending if we increase nondefense spending by the same amount. The parity that the minority leader and the other Democrats call for doesn't make any sense, though. It is apples and oranges. They act as though all government spending is exactly alike and enjoys or should enjoy the same priority, and that is just not true. We know that from our own family budgets or from a small business. There are things we must do, things we want to do, and things we will do if there is money left over. But our friends across the aisle, who are obstructing our ability to get to negotiated budget caps and fund our military, act as though all of that is the same, that must do, want to do, and what you will do if you have money left over--that those are all exactly the same, and that is just not the case. It is not the case in our family budgets, in our small business budgets, nor is it the case for the Federal budget. Not everything is a priority. But we do know that the 1 priority must be the safety and security of the American people by making sure our military is adequately funded.  The Budget Control Act signed into law in 2011 was what I would call a necessary evil. The Budget Control Act provided that we would have a bipartisan, bicameral negotiation and try to come up with a grand bargain.  That was what President Obama liked to talk about a lot--the grand bargain. But some people suggested that was kind of like a unicorn, something that people describe but no one has ever seen--a grand bargain. I wish it weren't true.  The Budget Control Act said that in the absence of a grand bargain, we would have budget caps or sequestration imposed on discretionary spending above certain levels. It proposed separate budget caps for defense and nondefense, and if the budget caps are exceeded, there is an automatic enforcement mechanism called sequestration which imposes across-the-board cuts, which I mentioned a moment ago.  The purpose of this sequestration--or these across-the-board cuts--is to do something in the absence of us doing what we should do; in other words, we should take it upon ourselves to figure out what the appropriate spending levels should be for defense and nondefense, and then we should act to appropriate that money. But this is basically a fail-safe mechanism, which operates as a result of our failure to deal with this in a proactive way, and it has hit our defense spending much, much harder than domestic spending.  As we know, neither our defense spending nor tax cuts are the cause of our deficits and debt. It is the 70 percent of spending that happens in the Federal Government on autopilot. It is the entitlements that have been going up well in excess of 5 percent a year and are causing instability and unpredictability in those important programs, such as Medicare and Social Security, but at the same time racking up huge deficits and debt that future generations are going to have to pay back. Somebody is going to have to pay it back, and it won't be the present generation because we won't be around then. It is simply immoral to continue to see this happen without trying to deal with it.  But back on the matter of the Pentagon, as one op-ed writer put it in the Washington Post last month--he said:       The Pentagon and the welfare state have been locked in      brutal combat for decades, and the Pentagon has gotten      clobbered. . . . Welfare programs--Social Security, Medicare,      food stamps and other benefits--dwarf defense spending.  In the 1950s and 1960s, defense spending was roughly 8 to 10 percent of our economy. In 2016, it was just 3 percent. That is a huge change.  James Clapper, the former Director of National Intelligence, said that in his 50 years in the intelligence community, he had never seen a more diverse array of threats confronting the United States around the world--never in his[[Page S117]]50 years of experience. So we are simply asking our military and our national security personnel to do too much with too little.  It is no surprise that Secretary of Defense James Mattis said last June that ``for all the heartache caused by the loss of our troops during [our] wars [abroad], no enemy in this field has done more to harm the readiness of our military than sequestration.''  More recently, General Mattis said that so far our continuing resolutions have not done even greater damage to our readiness thanks to certain additional or supplemental funding that we voted on. But at the same time, he soberly cautioned that there could be real impact--and it won't be positive, it will be negative--if the problem persists and if the Department of Defense doesn't have a real budget sometime this month.  His remarks echo that of practically every service chief. Together, their views mean we have to act. I don't know who else we would listen to if we are not going to listen to the Secretary of Defense and our service chiefs when it comes to national security because that is their job, and we ought to take their advice and heed their counsel.  Cuts in defense spending have real consequences. Much less money is available for training and necessary maintenance, for example. The length of deployments for our troops grows, and our soldiers are stretched thin. Our military is forced to operate beyond its normal capabilities.  The former Air Force Chief of Staff recently described the Air Force as the smallest, oldest equipped, and least ready force across the full spectrum of operations in our service history. Those are chilling remarks--or should be. More than half of all Marine Corps fixed and rotary-wing aircraft were unable to fly by the end of 2016. I have no doubt that we can turn that around very quickly if Congress were to step up to its responsibilities and adequately fund the military, but that is the status quo unless we act. The Navy fleet currently stands at 275 of the 350 ship requirement. Of our 58 Army brigade combat teams, only 3--3 out of 58--are ready for combat.  Our enemies shouldn't take any comfort in these numbers because, as I said, the United States always pulls together and Congress always acts when they see a national emergency. But it shouldn't take an emergency for us to do our job and to make sure that our military is adequately funded and is ready to fight. As General Brooks in Seoul, South Korea, said, their motto is ``ready to fight tonight.'' That is the kind of world we live in.  Last summer was the perfect example of why, when we draw attention to these numbers, we are not just blowing smoke. Operational accidents in the South Pacific exposed our readiness failures in a dramatic fashion and in a tragic fashion. Ten sailors died when the USS John McCain collided with a 600-foot merchant vessel off the coast of Seven sailors died when the Fitzgerald collided with another vessel off the coast of And the USS Lake Champlain collided with a boat near Korea--although thankfully that time no lives were lost. This ought to be a wake-up call to all of us.  Many have drawn credible correlations between these accidents that have taken the lives of our military servicemembers and our readiness failures, citing studies like the 2015 independent investigation by the Government Accountability That study determined that the Navy's mandate to keep ships afloat in the Pacific was shortchanging crew training and degrading the condition of our ships--in other words, additional readiness failures.  These accidents, by the way, are happening at the same time our national security threats are not going away, as General Clapper's comments would indicate.  We have seen North Korea continue to improve its nuclear and long-range ballistic missile capabilities beyond the estimates of our intelligence community--much faster--and detonate what is widely considered to be a hydrogen bomb recently.  We have seen large-scale protests in Iran--and I hope they continue--exposing the instability of a regime that continues to use its proxies to advance its aims throughout the broader Middle East; in other words, the 1 state sponsor of international terrorism--We ought to encourage the people of Iran to continue to rise up in protest and to change the regime there into one that does not prey on its neighbors in the region.  We have seen a growing China--something that more and more people are realizing is a threat. I know that when we deal with countries like China, frequently we deal with them in the commercial context where we see a business that hires people and we see investments here in the United But what we need to recognize is that they don't do business the way the United States does business. Sitting at the top of every company in China, in the board room of every Chinese company, is the Communist They operate on an all-of-government basis. And it is not just the government; it is also what we would consider the private sector. But, in truth, there is no private sector in China; it is all an arm of the government. It is posing a rising threat to American wages and labor as they erode our industrial base by stealing our technology. And because of loopholes in the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States--the so-called CFIUS process--they are now able to tailor financial arrangements through joint ventures and others in a way to capture our dual-purpose, cutting-edge technology. They then copy it in China and erode our defense industrial base here in the United States, along with the jobs that go with it. So it is a very real and present threat to American wages and workers. It is a threat to our intellectual property edge and the innovation that we are the best in the world at, but they are all too eager to steal it, copy it, and to harm the jobs and the investment in those businesses here in the United  Of course, when it comes to China, there is the threat to human rights in nondemocratic nations like Venezuela and Zimbabwe, which China often has no qualms supporting.  With this diverse array of dangers, we simply can't afford to straitjacket our military by arbitrarily cutting the amount of money we appropriate to fund it. But that is what is going to happen unless we act--and act quickly. The current continuing resolution expires on the 19th of this month.  The truth is, even if we are able to come up with negotiated budget caps for defense and nondefense spending, we are probably going to have to have a short-term continuing resolution to give the Appropriations Committees time to put that into bill text. In other words, we can't just snap our fingers once the decision has been made. It is going to take some time to actually put it on paper.  The bottom line is, if we want to return to having the strong military that we have always had, if we want to continue to lead in the world, if we want to continue to be a force for peace and stability, we have to maintain our military strength. That was the lesson we had to learn again during the last administration when we saw America retreat from its leadership in the world.  There are countries, tyrants, bullies, and dictators all too willing to fill the void left by American retreat, and one way we retreat is when we don't fund the readiness of our military, when we are not ``ready to fight tonight,'' as General Brooks has said, and we need to start with ending this cycle of continuing resolutions and defense sequestration.  So I come to the floor today to call on my colleagues from all across this Chamber, but specifically across the aisle, to quit holding our military hostage to other unrelated demands, and I urge this body to come together in agreement on new budget caps as soon as possible.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

This bill seeks to ensure that the DHS gets access to biometric and biographic data collected by the United States Government to carry out its counterterrorism efforts.  Since 9/11, the Democratic members of this committee have been committed to bolstering terrorism information sharing within our government. Today, terrorist threats are decentralized, spreading beyond al-Qaida, al Shabaab, and ISIL to a patchwork of small cells and lone wolves who stand ready to carry out violence to our country at their whim. Increasingly, this threat also includes homegrown violent extremists and domestic terrorists.  Ensuring that the DHS has access to biographic and biometric data on individuals associated with a terrorist organization is critical to comprehensive assessing of all forms of terrorism and threats to our government.  This legislation also requires that the DHS report on how the data is being received and utilized for screening and vetting purposes. This report will help Congress ensure that screening and vetting of travelers to the United States is conducted in a risk-based manner.

232,topic-id,796,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to talk about the national debt and our shared future. Our country has been on an unsustainable fiscal path, regardless of which party has been in power, and we all know this. As a result, our national debt is the largest it has ever been.  As of this week, the national debt is in excess of $20 trillion. This works out to be an average of $62,670 debt for every man, woman, and child in the United It is outrageous. It is a completely unacceptable amount of debt, and we have it because of irresponsible governing and a lack of political courage here in our Nation's  Sadly, this Congress has chosen to continue this irresponsible and unsustainable fiscal course. The tax cut legislation that Republicans rammed through the Congress last month will add $1.45 billion to our deficit over 10 years, estimated, and over $2.2 trillion to our national debt. We are going in the wrong direction.  But there is something I think that I have learned about this tax legislation last month, and that is that it seems that deficits matter under Democratic administrations, but under Republican administrations, deficits don't matter at all.  So when it comes to lifting our debt ceiling later this year, I would expect or hope to see every Republican who voted for the tax bill that adds $2.2 trillion to our deficit--our debt to vote to increase the debt ceiling, seeing as deficits no longer matter.  Let's think about this $2.2 trillion tax bill that will add to our debt. That is $2.2 trillion in additional moneys that our children will have to pay for unless we do something. We can be fiscally responsible, and we must be fiscally responsible. But to act to change this course, we must stop digging this hole bigger.  I had a farmer friend who once told me: Jim, I've got a theory about holes, and that is, once you find yourself in one, just stop digging. Sometimes you think if you dig harder and faster, you're going to get out of it. Just stop.  Mr.Speaker, this will be difficult, especially considering the opportunity we missed to put the Nation back on a fiscally responsible path with the tax reform effort last year. Yet there are important steps that we can take--and Congress should--to balance our budget and to keep it from getting worse, like the amendment proposed by Representative Stephanie Murphy from Florida, a balanced budget amendment.  We should also move to implement targeted reforms on government spending, both mandatory and discretionary spending, in ways that contribute to economic growth and invest in our future. It is tough work. It requires political courage and the willingness to reach across the aisle, for Democrats and Republicans to join hands and jump, in essence, on these tough decisions.  The last time we had such an opportunity to address the challenge was in March of 2012, when Congressman Jim Cooper from Tennessee presented a budget resolution similar to the recommendations under Simpson-That plan would have reduced the deficit over $4 trillion over a 10-year period.  Sadly, the political courage was in short supply then on that day, as it is now. There were 38 of us who were willing to support the plan. I was attacked by political groups on the left and on the right for taking such a vote, but that vote was the right thing to do and I was proud to take it.  Congress has a chance to do the right thing now. Congress has to come together. We need Democrats and Republicans to put our Nation's fiscal house back in order for the sake of all  The Blue Dog Coalition, of which I am a co-chair, has a long history of standing for fiscal responsibility, even when it was hard. Bridging the divide between Republicans and Democrats, both in Congress and this administration, is what we must do.  So as we are debating today how to put together the votes for the concurrent resolution to fund our Nation's budget for the rest of this year, let's think about this. Let's work together. What a novel concept.

230,topic-id,830,"Mr.Speaker, last October, President Trump loudly proclaimed that the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, was ``virtually dead.'' He said it was finished, it was gone. This was after the pummeling that this law had been taking over 2017 in the unsuccessful effort by the Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care  Again, last October was a critical moment, because enrollment was about to commence for 2018's policy year, and the Trump administration announced that they were going to cut in half the time that people would have an opportunity to go out and learn about rates, to talk to get enrollment help, and also to sign up for different plans. They also cut the marketing budget by 80 percent and eliminated funding for folks at the State level to actually provide face-to-face assistance. So it all looked pretty grim back in October in terms of what that would result in in terms of enrollment for 2018.  Well, as a famous resident from the State of Connecticut, Mark Twain, once infamously said: Rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated.  Yesterday, the Connecticut exchange, the Connecticut Access Health Exchange, announced their enrollment numbers for 2018. Rather than going down, even though they were only able to enroll people in half the time there was in 2016, and even though they had no budget in terms of trying to actually promote and advertise, their enrollment went up. It went up by 3 percent in terms of the number of people who signed up for Anthem Blue Cross plans, for ConnectiCare plans, and for Medicaid plans.  Again, it was done because of this amazing grassroots, organic effort by libraries, by community health centers, by human service agencies, by hospitals that went out and took on the task of getting the word out that, in fact, the Affordable Care Act was still alive and that people would have access to affordable health plans. Sure enough, it resulted in an increase in health plans.  Interestingly, the young invincibles, the young enrollees that everybody predicted were going to abandon the program because the enforcement of the mandate was going to be relaxed by the IRS actually had a very strong, healthy number.  Coming from a State that is known for its insurance history--it was the insurance capital of the world--the fact of the matter is that getting those young enrollees, those young members to sign up for these plans, in fact, portends well for 2019 and beyond.  This morning, The Hill newspaper reported that for ObamaCare insurers, actually, their financial prospects are looking much better for 2019 because the system has stabilized.  Now, again, there is still work that could be done. There is a bill, H.3748, a Medicare buy-in, which would allow people 50 and up to voluntarily sign up for Medicare, again, using subsidies if they qualify or paying the full cost, which would still be 40 percent less than the plans that are on exchanges throughout the country for people 50 and up. It would not affect the deficit, and, in fact, arguably, it would strengthen the Medicare trust fund because you would get a younger population into the Medicare  So there is work that we can do that is optional, voluntary, in terms of trying to provide more choices for individuals out there; but, clearly, what happened yesterday in Connecticut and throughout the country in terms of enrollment figures, that despite the active efforts by the Trump administration to undercut and sabotage this law, in fact, shows that the law has a life of its own, that, in fact, people are voting with their feet in terms of still trying to get access to the critical needs of every human being and every American, which is access to healthcare.  I want to particularly congratulate Lieutenant Governor Nancy Wyman, who spearheaded this effort in Connecticut and yesterday stated: This just shows how valuable the Affordable Care Act is to thousands of residents in Connecticut; also, Jim Wadleigh, the director of the exchange, who, again, was not distracted or demoralized by the comments coming out of the White House but still plunged forward and still persistently and determinedly went out and made sure that people got the real information, the real facts, the real news so that they could, in fact, take an opportunity to protect themselves and their families from the inevitable problems of sickness and accident, that every American and every Member of Congress enjoys through their health benefits, for every resident in the State of  It is time for us to stop the attack in terms of a program that has provided millions of Americans coverage and opportunity to healthcare. We should work together on bills like H.3748, a voluntary, deficit-neutral attempt to try and strengthen and provide cheaper alternatives for people 50 and up and small businesses.

Mr.Speaker, I want to take a few minutes to express my concern about the way the Government of Iran has trampled on the rights of its people to express their discontent with the current regime, which has resulted in at least 21 deaths and more than 450 arrests. It is, quite frankly, disturbing the way the Iranian Government has used its military might to show an unacceptable and a disproportionate amount of force to quell and to attempt to control protests.  Additionally, Iran's judiciary has disregarded the rights of protesters to express themselves and to peacefully assemble, by threatening harsh punishments. I have read reports that the[[Page H68]]government has blocked the Internet and social media services which, I believe, constitutes a violation of fundamental rights of free speech.  People in Iran are suffering. Their economy is stagnant, and their wages aren't keeping up with the costs of living. People are hungry, and they have grown weary of a radical and a corrupt regime set on sponsoring terrorism and pursuing an ill-advised plan for nuclear capabilities rather than focusing on improving the lives and stability of the people and their nation.  The people of Iran were hopeful that Iran would see some relief from the sanctions and would see economic improvement after their government entered into a deal in 2015 regarding its nuclear program. But because of widespread corruption and failed economic policies of Iran's Government, as well as its failure to live up to its commitments to the international community, Iran's people have only continued to suffer from poverty, high unemployment, and inflation.  It should be no surprise to the leadership of Iran that its people are calling for change because of its failure and poor leadership that have led the people to protest.  Mr.Speaker, I stand with those protesters in Iran who have lost faith in their increasingly failed government. They deserve a country that ensures their freedom to express disapproval. They deserve a government with equality and justice, to improve the lives of  Although Iran's Government may, by force, ultimately be successful in putting an end to these public protests, this dissatisfaction with the regime will continue.

I am grateful that Montana's attorney general, Tim Fox, has taken this issue head-on. In fact, Montana has had three times as many human trafficking cases in 2017 as we had in 2015--a threefold increase. Unfortunately, this number will likely continue to rise in the coming years, and online platforms are a driving force for it. Like so many things, the internet has tremendous power for good as well as for evil.  Having spent 12 years building a startup cloud computing business in my hometown of Bozeman--a business we grew to over 1,000 employees. We took the company public. This became a large, global business. I understand the power of the internet for good. But I also believe we must and can have better safeguards to protect our children, our families, and our neighbors from sex trafficking, while at the same time protecting innovation on the internet.  Unfortunately, a startup business--your business--has the potential to be used for terrible reasons without your awareness. Even more upsetting, it is also possible that online platforms do know that bad actors are using that platform and they do nothing about it.

536,topic-id,1144,"Mr.President, for the past decade, health policy, unfortunately, has proven to be one of the most bitterly partisan issues. It doesn't have to be this way.  I want to take a few minutes to discuss some health-related issues that Congress left unfinished before the holidays: providing relief from the medical device tax, reauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance Program, funding for community health centers, and doing more to address the opioid crisis. Each has strong bipartisan support and could provide help to our constituents now.  First, many of us, on both sides of the aisle, agree on the need to provide relief from the medical device tax, which went back into effect on January 1. The medical device tax is one of these issues that leaves most Hoosiers scratching their heads. First adopted as part of the Affordable Care Act, the device tax was one of the few issues Republicans and Democrats agreed needed to be fixed, and in 2015, with bipartisan support, President Obama enacted a 2-year suspension of the tax.  The argument was really pretty simple. The medical device tax was making it harder for innovative companies to invest in the research and development of new technologies, and, in the process, we were stifling job creation. If there was a question as to whether this was the case, the last 2 years provided evidence. When we agreed to suspend the tax in 2016 and 2017, manufacturers used that additional money to hire new workers, invest in research and technologies, and continue producing innovative, lifesaving products in the United  For example, Zimmer Biomet, headquartered in Warsaw, IN, my home State, used the money from the device tax suspension to invest in new innovation to improve musculoskeletal health across the world. They were also able to upgrade their manufacturing equipment and facilities. Perhaps more importantly, these investments not only supported existing jobs, but they also helped to create new jobs--new, good-paying jobs.  Yet, despite this evidence, despite this strong bipartisan support for repeal, and despite a wide-ranging package of changes to the Tax Code becoming law in recent days, Congress has failed to address the medical device[[Page S93]]tax, which went back into place on January 1.  As we again discuss the policy priorities that were left unaddressed in 2017, I strongly urge my colleagues to work with me to quickly and meaningfully address the medical device tax. This would allow these innovative companies to make the long-term investments that not only lead to life-changing technologies but support thousands of high-paying jobs across the country, including in my home State of  Another issue that has garnered bipartisan support is a healthcare program that covers millions of our children. We must reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program--also known as CHIP--that expired in  I have long supported the CHIP program. It provides health coverage for millions of kids, including nearly 115,000 children from I am not alone in my support for this program. The fact is, CHIP has had strong bipartisan support for the past 20 years, and Democrats and Republicans in both the Senate and the House have shown they support a 5-year reauthorization of the program. That gives States the certainty they need to plan their budgets and provide high-quality care to these children.  Despite this shared commitment for the program and agreement on the need for a long-term reauthorization, we were only able to fund the program through March before Congress departed for the holidays. This short-term extension bought some time, but according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services--CMS--some States will start running out of money after January 19. This means families and States will very soon face the harmful consequences of congressional inaction.  Just last week, the Congressional Budget Office said that funding the CHIP program for the next 5 years will cost significantly less than previous estimates. This program is vital to our families and vital to our children. We should reauthorize the CHIP program right away.  Like the CHIP program, community health centers have enjoyed long bipartisan support for the high-quality care they provide to our families. Also, like CHIP, the funding for community health centers expired on September 30, leaving many health centers across Indiana worried about if they will have the resources they need to continue to serve  We have the ability to work together now to ensure that our community health centers can continue to provide cost-effective, high-quality healthcare to people all across the country.  Finally, we have demonstrated a common desire to address the needs of the opioid and drug abuse crisis. It is a scourge. It took the lives of 63,000 people just in 2016--63,000 of our brothers and sisters, our husbands and wives, our sons and daughters. It is a heartbreak that is crushing the entire country.  I welcomed President Trump's declaration of a public health emergency, and both Republican and Democratic Senators have highlighted the need for Congress to do even more to help those struggling with addiction.  Like many other States, the opioid epidemic has been particularly devastating in underserved areas in Indiana that lack adequate treatment providers.  Senator Murkowski and I have partnered on a bipartisan bill that would encourage addiction treatment professionals to serve in underserved areas by making addiction treatment facilities eligible for National Health Service Corps student loan repayment and forgiveness.  We can show our commitment to increasing access to treatment by reauthorizing the National Health Service Corps program, which expired in We also must recognize that a meaningful response to the opioid crisis will require robust and meaningful funding to help our communities as soon as possible.  I have often said that most people think Congress can do something to help make life better--to provide working parents with the peace of mind that their children can grow up healthy and to instill confidence in our communities so that they will have the tools they need to respond to this heartbreaking crisis. At the very least, Congress should not make this situation worse.  By failing to take action in 2017, medical device companies are once again paying a counterproductive tax that inhibits growth in  On all of these issues--medical device taxes, our families and our children and this opioid crisis, community health centers--we can work together as Democrats, as Republicans, but more than either of those, as Americans to make sure that our families can get decent healthcare, to make sure that no one else dies because of this terrible opioid scourge we are dealing with.

Assuming appropriation of the authorized amounts, CBO      estimates implementing H.1486 would cost $112 million over      the 2018-2022 period. Enacting the bill would not affect      direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go      procedures do not apply.

51,topic-id,893,"Mr.President, on September 5 of last year, Attorney General Sessions announced the repeal of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, which has been called The same day, President Trump called on Congress to come up with a solution to ``legalize DACA.''  The history of this issue I have explained many times on the floor, and I will say it briefly. Seventeen years ago, I introduced a bill called the DREAM Act, which said that if you were brought to the country as an infant, a toddler, a child, and you were raised in America and went to school here, had no problems of any serious nature with the law, that you would be given a chance to become a citizen of the United  Many of these children, of course, didn't have a voice in the decision of their families to come to this country, and this is the only country they know. They have gone to our schools. They have graduated from our schools. They stood up in the classrooms of those schools each and every day and pledged allegiance to that flag. It was their flag and their country. Many of them didn't learn until they were in high school, that technically, in the eyes of the law, this wasn't true; they were undocumented. They were illegal in the eyes of the law.  So what I tried to do with the DREAM Act was to give these young people a chance--a chance to become part of America's future and to become, ultimately, earning their way to legalization and earning their way to citizenship. That was the DREAM We have passed it at various times in the We passed it in the House over the years. We have never done it at the same time, same year.  So I called on President Obama and asked him if he would issue an Executive order and do something to help these young people. He created DACA said to the young people: Come forward, pay your filing fee, go through a criminal background check, and we will let you stay in America for 2 years at a time, renewable, and we will let you work in this country. Well, more than 780,000 young people did that. They signed up, paid their fee, went through the background check, and received that protection. Then came President Trump who said: That is the end of the program. We are not going to protect these young people any longer.  Well, whatever happened to those 780,000 DACA-protected young people? Many of them are in school, they are in college, law school, medical school. Some of them joined our military. That is it. They went and took the oath and said: I will serve this country. I will bear allegiance to this country. I will give my life for this country in the U.military. Nine hundred of them are in the military today.  DACA is going to be eliminated as of March 5 of this year by President Trump, which means they will be asked to leave the U.military, to stop this volunteer service to our Another 20,000 are teachers all across this[[Page S12]]country. High schools, grade schools, you name it, they are teaching, trying to find a way to help other young people do better with their lives. They lose their jobs when DACA expires and their DACA protection expires.  Thousands and thousands of them are doing important work, including as engineers, as police officers in training, as medics. These are people who are making this a better country, and all they have asked for is just a chance to be here and to be part of our future, but President Trump said: It is over. Now, Congress, do something about it.  Do you know what we have done since September 5, when the President issued that challenge? Take a look at this empty floor. That is what we have done--nothing. Despite the President's challenge, despite the lives of all these young people hanging in the balance, we have done nothing. That is why I come to the floor today. This has to come to an end. We have to do the right and just thing for these young people. We have to make those who are eligible for the Dream Act, those who are eligible to be part of our future--we have to give them a chance, and that is why I come and ask for help today.  I can tell you we are losing about 1,000 of these young Dreamers each week. Their protection under DACA expires. What does it mean? It means that at any moment of any day, a knock on the door could mean they would be deported and many times other members of their family with them. Their lives in the United States would come to an end, and many of them would be deported to countries they have never ever known. They might have been there as infants. Perhaps it was Mexico; maybe it was They knew it, not personally, but only through family stories, and they would be sent to these countries, many times with no family, no connections, sometimes with no knowledge of the language that is spoken there.  They believe they are I think they should have a chance to become Americans in the full sense of the law.  (",CREC-2018-01-03-pt2-PgS11.txt,326,LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM,2018.0,3.0,January

128,topic-id,1648,"Mr.President, it has been less than 2 weeks since we convened in the Senate, and those of us who have returned to the floor of the Senate may not notice any change, but there is a significant change. If you take a close look, one desk has moved from that side of the aisle to this side of the aisle. There are currently 49 Democratic Senators after the swearing in of our colleague, Senator Doug Jones of Now it is 49 to 51. It is almost as close a break as you can expect or even anticipate in a deliberative body.  It is an indication of more than just the acquisition of one additional Democratic We are moving closer and closer to parity, closer and closer to one another, and, I hope, closer and closer in solving problems. I think that was a message of the Alabama election; among other things, the American people want to see us work together. They have given us 49 and the Republicans 51. I think they expect that to be a signal that we should finally sit down and do something to solve the problems facing our great I feel that as I go home--of course, I run into my loyal Democratic friends who have their own political views, but the vast majority of people say: Can't you work together and solve something? Can't you do something for this Nation? I believe we can, and this month we must.  You see, on January 19 there is a deadline looming. It is only a couple of weeks away. On January 19, we have to make some very momentous, historic decisions about the rest of this year and beyond. One of those is where we will spend the taxpayers' dollars. How much will we spend on the defense of our Nation? How much will we spend on other agencies, which, I would add, also defend our Nation? That has to be decided by 60 votes. Do the math. As whip on the Democratic side, I have said that I learned basically all I needed to know about this job in the first grade. I learned how to count to 60.  On January 19, we need at least 60 Senators to agree on the spending program for this country moving forward, not just the Department of Defense but the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, the Department of State, and so many other critically important agencies.  The second thing we need to do is long overdue. The fiscal year, the operative fiscal year for the Federal Government starts on October 1. We are a long way from October 1, 2017. We still don't have a budget. We still have not brought the appropriations bills to the floor of the Senate for consideration.  I am not going to be partisan about this. We failed as Democrats in bringing those appropriations to the floor in a timely manner as well. We have to do something about this process, but we certainly have to face the reality that we are steaming through this fiscal year without a budget. We have taken last year's budget and continued to live by last year's budget. Reflect, for a moment, if you did the same thing for your family. If you were determined to spend in January of 2018 exactly what you spent in 2017, you would think to yourself: That makes no sense. The utility bills are different. I may have a different mortgage payment. A lot of[[Page S5]]things have changed. But we can't change until we pass a budget bill. That, too, is facing a January 19 deadline. Again, it will require 60 votes.  Here are two major issues--the caps on spending and the budget for our government, which need to be passed by January 19 on a bipartisan basis. It is time to come together and face not only those two overarching issues but the long litany of issues that Senator Schumer, the Democratic leader, raised in his opening remarks.  There are so many other elements--the Children's Health Insurance Program, affecting tens of thousands of kids in my State of They told me when I was home: Senator, we are running out of money to provide basic medical care for kids across Why haven't you done your job to reauthorize this program, as well as the program for community care clinics? These clinics are critically important for healthcare for thousands of families in my State and across the  There is one more issue that I am going to raise, as I have so many times, standing in this particular place on the floor, and that is the Dream The DREAM Act is a bill I introduced 16 years ago to give young people brought to the United States as infants and toddlers and children--they have grown up in this country, have no serious criminal issue they have been involved in, and have graduated from our schools--a chance for a future in America, the only country they have ever known. They are the  President Obama gave them a chance with an Executive order called He said: You can come forward, submit a $500 filing fee, go through a criminal background check, and we may give you--it is our decision--2 years of temporary protection to stay in this country. You can work in this country, stay here without fear of deportation on a 2-year basis. So 780,000 young people stepped forward and did that and were approved. Now they are working across America, and 900 of them serve in the U.military. They are undocumented by legal standards, but they have sworn their loyalty to this country and are willing to die for this country. What more could we ask of a young person to prove their loyalty to that flag and to this Nation? Nine hundred of them are now protected by  Then President Trump announced on September 5 of last year that he was going to eliminate that program, eliminate that protection as of March 5 of this year. The clock is ticking; the days on the calendar are turning. There are 900 in our military; 20,000 are teachers across America in grade schools, elementary schools, and high schools--at all levels--and 20,000 of them protected by DACA will lose their ability to teach starting on March 5 of this year because of President Trump's decision and his announcement.  He challenged us. He said: Look, I don't like this Executive order by the previous President; now pass a law. Pass a law and do something about it.  He asked us to do that months ago, and we have done nothing--nothing. I believe that by January 19, we need to take this up as one of the critical issues on our agenda. It is absolutely essential.  Let me add as well that this President has been critical of immigration. I couldn't disagree with him more. He has taken an approach toward immigration that I believe denies the very basis and foundation of this great  I have said it before, and I say it with pride: I stand here on the floor of the U.Senate representing the great State of Illinois, the son of an immigrant to this country. My mother was brought here at the age of 2--she was a Dreamer in her era--and she grew up in America, raised a family, and had a son who was sworn in to the U.She lived long enough to see that. That is my story. That is my family's story. That is America's story. Sometimes I wonder if the President has heard that story or paid attention to it.  Immigration has been at the heart of who we are as The diversity of this great country, when it has come together in citizenship, has been a force to be reckoned with around the world throughout history. I still believe that as much this day as I have ever believed it.  I may not be able to convince the President, but President Obama and others did plead with him to think about these young people, these Dreamers, those protected by Do you know what President Trump said about the Dreamers? Do you know what he said in one of his famous--sometimes infamous--tweets? He said we should ``show great heart.'' ``Show great heart,'' President Trump said, to these young people.  That is why I am here today making this statement on the floor--it is not a long speech; I have spoken many times in the past--to plead with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, in this closely divided Senate, to get this job done before January 19--not just for the 780,000 who took advantage of President Obama's Executive order but for those who were eligible and afraid. There were many thousands who were eligible for this program but afraid to sign up for it, to turn themselves in to the government, and they held back. They are eligible. There is nothing to disqualify them otherwise. Let's give them the same opportunity to be part of the future of this great That is what I believe we can do and should do.  There are 49 Democrats and 51 Republicans--carefully divided. Can enough of us meet in that aisle to create a real majority, a bipartisan majority, to solve this? I am convinced we can, as Senator Schumer said earlier. Our Acting President pro tempore has weighed in on it, and I thank him for his efforts, his personal efforts, on this issue. We have had long meetings. Sometimes we agreed, sometimes we didn't agree, but that is the nature of the Senate, the nature of compromise, and the nature of a process that the American people are begging us, Democrats and Republicans, to engage in, in a positive way by January 19 of this month.

814,topic-id,2012,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to speak about the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, known as That was an Executive order of President Obama's which provided temporary legal status to immigrant students and young people if they registered with the government, paid a fee, and passed a criminal and national security background check. It was for 2 years and renewable.  Young people who are protected by DACA are known by some as They came to the United States as children. They grew up singing the ``Star Spangled Banner'' and pledging allegiance to our flag. They believed that they were Americans, but legally, they are not. The average DACA recipient came to the United States at the age of 6 and has been here for approximately 20 years.  It was 7 years ago that I sent a letter to President I was joined in that letter, incidentally, by Senator Dick Lugar, a Republican from In that letter, I asked President Obama: Can you find a way to protect these young people?[[Page S134]]  We passed the Dream Act on the floor of the We passed it on the floor of the We have never managed to pass it in both Chambers in the same year. And the President created the DACA  The DACA Program has been a success. Approximately 800,000 Dreamers have come forward and received DACA protection. Let's allow them to be part of America as teachers, as nurses, as engineers, as first responders, and even serving in the U.military.  But on September 5 of this last year, 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Trump administration was setting out to repeal DACA, to put an end to it. That same day, President Trump called on Congress to come up with a solution to legalize He challenged us. He said to the U.Senate and House: Pass a law. If this is a good idea, pass a law.  It has been more than 4 months since the President issued that challenge. The Republican leadership of Congress has not proposed any legislation to legalize DACA as the President asked.  The deportation clock is ticking for these young people who are protected. Already, 15,000 have lost their DACA status. Beginning on March 5--the deadline that initially was imposed by President Trump--every day for the next 2 years, 1,000 DACA young people will lose their ability to work legally in the United States and will be subject to being deported from this country.  Who are they? Some 20,000 of them are teachers in our schools who would lose the right to work legally and have to leave their classrooms. Nurses would leave their patients. First responders would leave their posts. And 900 soldiers would lose their ability to volunteer to risk their lives for America's future.  This isn't just a looming humanitarian crisis; it is an economic crisis. More than 91 percent of DACA Dreamers are gainfully employed and paying taxes. Many of them are students; yet they are still gainfully employed because they don't qualify for Federal assistance for higher education, so they have to work jobs, sometimes many jobs.  The nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy reports that DACA-eligible individuals contribute an estimated $2 billion a year in State and local taxes. The Cato Institute, a conservative operation in Washington, estimates that ending DACA and deporting DACA recipients will cost the economy $60 billion and result in a $280 billion reduction in economic growth over the next decade.  Poll after poll shows overwhelming bipartisan support for the FOX News found that 79 percent of Americans support a path to citizenship for Dreamers, including 63 percent of Trump voters.  The answer is clear. It was 16 years ago that I first introduced the DREAM Act--bipartisan legislation to give these young people a path to citizenship. In July of last year, I introduced the most recent version with my colleague, Senator Lindsey Graham of South We need to pass the Dream Act, and we need to do it now, before January 19.  Over the years, I have come to the floor to tell the story of the I can give a pretty nice speech here, but these stories tell the story of this issue more than anything I can add to them. These stories show what is at stake when we consider the fate of DACA and the Dream  Today, I want to tell you about this young lady. Her name is Evelyn Valdez-This is the 107th Dreamer story I have told on the floor. Evelyn was 6 months old when her family brought her from Mexico to Houston, She was quite a good student. She graduated 11th in her high school class of 650. She took all advanced placement classes and was a member of the National Honor She was a member of the color guard in the marching band and regularly volunteered at homeless shelters and animal shelters.  It wasn't until she began to apply for college that she finally learned her immigration status. She wasn't like the other students with whom she had grown up and shared classrooms and experiences. Evelyn is undocumented, but it didn't stop her--she was going to pursue college.  One of her teachers believed in her because she was such a bright student and wrote her a letter of recommendation to go to college. She was accepted into the University of She received multiple awards while in college, including the Excellence in SI Leadership and Mentoring Award, the American Society of Plant Biology Award for Outstanding Research, and the Outstanding Biology Leadership  The summer after her freshman year, she was offered a great research opportunity through the National Science Because of DACA, she was allowed to work legally in the United States, and she was able to pursue this important research. That opportunity was in plant water transport research in This is where Evelyn fell in love with ecology and plants.  She graduated magna cum laude in 2016 with a bachelor of science in biology. Today, she is a second-year Ph.student at the University of California, Irvine, in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary She is researching the effects of climate change on the interactions between plants and soil. Evelyn's dream is to continue her research as a scientist and to become an advocate for strategies to mitigate climate change.  In September, the American Association for the Advancement of Science wrote a letter opposing the White House decision to rescind Here is what they said:       Many DACA students make significant contributions to the      scientific and engineering enterprise in the United States .      . . high-achieving young people in DACA contribute in many      ways to our nation. Many are studying to become scientists,      engineers, medical doctors and entrepreneurs. Given the      administration's decision, we urge Congress to craft      legislation that provides long-term protection for these      young people who seek to continue their education and      contribute to society. . . . Our nation needs an immigration      policy that advances U.innovation and prosperity, and      stays true to foundational American goals that seek      contributions to society from all.  The Presiding Officer and I had a unique invitation yesterday. I would just say that as a Member of the House and of the Senate, I have never been invited to a meeting quite like the one we had yesterday with the President in the Cabinet Room of the White It was the President's idea. I don't know if it was a spur-of-the-moment idea, but it is one that came together very quickly in a few days.  I think there were almost 26 of us--Democrats, Republicans, House and Senate Members--who were called together by President I was kind of surprised, but there I was sitting right next to the President of the United It was only the third time we had ever spoken. The other two times, incidentally, were about DACA and the Dream Act, as you can probably guess. He invited me to sit next to him as we talked about this issue.  Then he did something that was really unusual. I have been to some meetings with the President in the Cabinet Room with President Obama and President George Usually, what happens is, the cameras come in, the President says a few words, then the staff tells them to leave, and they reluctantly pull out and leave. Yesterday was quite different. The President told the press they could stay, and they did, for almost an hour. The conversations between the President of the United States and Members of Congress were shared with the American people. I had never seen anything quite like it.  I kind of liked it, to be honest with you. I think there was a lot of candor in the room. People were expressing their points of view, and there were many different points of view, but I think I came away from that meeting with more hope than ever that we can do something about DACA and the Dream The President told us he would like to see it done. He added, though, there were things he wanted to be a part of it. One of them dealt with border security, which has been a priority for all of us from the beginning.  We want to establish--both political parties want to establish that we are committed to border security, and we are. How you define it, what it costs, and how it is implemented--some of these things we can define in our agreement; others will be left to future efforts by Congress and the  Then he talked about the family unification, and that is an issue that is very delicate. It is one that, as my colleagues can imagine, really hits home.[[Page S135]]It is very personal as to whether a member of a family can bring someone they love--some relative in their family--to the United Even if they decide to bring them--incidentally, they may be waiting 30 years, in the case of those who are seeking entry into the United States through family visas; 80 years, from China; 160 years from Some of these things are unrealistic and will never happen, but to talk about family unification really strikes home with a lot of families.  I want to hear the President's point of view, but I want to deal with this in the most sensitive and sincere way. We don't want to flood the United States with people who are any danger to us, 1, or nonproductive citizens, but we certainly want to see families unified.  There is a question about diversity visas. I will not go into it because it is a long story--the creation of this program, where it is today, and where it might be in the future.  Here is what I do believe after yesterday's meeting. I believe President Donald Trump called for that meeting because he wanted to let the American people know he was serious. He wanted to show them he could be a President presiding over a table with 24, 25 Members of Congress from both political parties and tackle a sensitive, delicate, challenging issue. He wants to show the American people he can lead. I want to help him lead if the goal is to make sure DACA and the Dreamers ultimately have their chance to be part of America's future.  I am willing to work in good faith with the President to compromise, whatever it takes, to bring this forward. There are so many lives hanging in the balance, and this is one of them--this wonderful, brilliant young woman who wants to make not only the world a better place but America a better place. She simply wants the chance to be here and be part of America's future. We can give her no less.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

787,topic-id,653,"Mr.President, I rise to discuss the positive impact the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will have on Iowa farmers.  Of course, our Iowa agricultural economy is really important, and those men and women who are serving as farmers, ranchers, and growers in the State of Iowa mean the world to me, coming from a farm my family had in Southwest  We all understand this has been a very challenging time for farmers in our rural communities. The community I come from in Southwest Iowa has just 10,000 people in our county. Many of them have faced the challenges of the economic downturn. Since their peaks in 2012, corn prices have declined by 60 percent and soybean prices have declined by 47 percent. My neighbors are hurting, folks. Farm income has nearly been cut in half since 2013.  A lot of our producers are hurting, especially our young and beginning farmers who have gotten their start just in maybe the last 10 years or so, but, fortunately for our farmers, our ranchers, and our growers, tax relief is on its way. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will provide sweeping tax cuts for farmers and rural communities, allowing our producers to keep more of those hard-earned dollars.  About 95 percent of farms are organized as passthrough businesses, such as sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S corps. These businesses are taxed under individual tax rules and will benefit from lower tax rates for every income bracket. On top of that, they will see significant relief through a new 20-percent deduction on passthrough business income. The law also provides relief from the costly individual mandate which forced many farmers to choose between buying an expensive ObamaCare plan through their State exchange or being fined.  Now, just a couple of years ago, I remember a very intense conversation I had with a beginning farmer in Northeast When he was purchasing his insurance through the State exchange, the cost had more than doubled. He was shaking he was so upset about it, and he explained to me the additional cost of that individual policy was his truck payment. There was no room in his budget for the additional cost of that insurance policy so he had to make that choice: Do I purchase through the individual exchange or do I make my truck payment? Fortunately, within this bill, we have that relief. He can make that choice, and the choice is his on whether he makes that truck payment and forgoes the insurance or whether now he can do without that type of insurance and not be fined because he was too poor to afford it.  In addition, the bill dramatically expands section 179 expensing and allows 5 years of 100 bonus depreciation. Both of these changes will foster much needed investment in farms throughout  The law also preserves a number of important tax provisions for farmers, including the interest deduction, cash accounting, and the use of like-kind exchanges for property.  Last, but certainly not least, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act doubles the Federal estate tax exemption while preserving the stepped-up basis. The death tax can have a devastating impact on family farms. Over 90 percent of farm assets cannot be sold easily without losing value. Especially as we continue to experience a downturn in that ag economy, family farmers are sometimes left with no choice but to sell land or the equipment they use to farm that land when they are forced to pay that tax.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a big step in the right direction for agriculture. I am thankful to the President for his leadership and to my colleagues in the Senate and the House for helping get this long-needed bill done. On behalf of agriculture, thank you.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

Having access to API, which is biographic information, and PNR data, which is data about reservation and itinerary information, allows our homeland security professionals to confirm the identities and travel patterns of potential criminals and terrorists before they enter the United  Allowing our men and women on the front lines to fight against terrorism, to work with Visa Waiver Program countries to make sure that they rise to the same standards only increases the safety of our Nation, the safety of all Americans traveling abroad, and the safety of all people across the globe.

The United States is currently experiencing one of the highest terror threat environments since 9/11.

The two terror attacks in New York City late last year are stark reminders of this reality and the threat facing the United Given the nature of this evolving threat, I established a task force on denying terrorists entry into the United States last year and I appointed Representative Mike Gallagher to head up the effort.  I would like to thank all of the members of the task force for their hard work in making this effort a success. I charged this task force with examining how terrorists might infiltrate the homeland, identifying challenges with current U.Government information sharing and vetting procedures, and reviewing the screening agencies' structure and bureaucracy.  After completing its review, the task force issued a report outlining its findings and providing seven recommendations designed to address the identified gaps. These recommendations were the basis for several of the bills we are considering today. As evidenced by the recent spate of attacks, there is a large population of radicalized individuals in Europe who are willing to commit violence in the name of terrorist groups like We must remain vigilant and cannot forget many of these individuals are just one flight away from the United  Given the seriousness of this threat, we must do more at home and abroad to screen and vet people seeking to enter the United The bills we are considering today will enhance our capabilities by improving information sharing and promoting efficiencies in the screening and vetting process, helping ensure the homeland is the best secured against terrorist infiltration.

H.4433 mandates that this directive include descriptions of what equipment is classified as a sensitive asset, requirements for securing Department-issued sensitive assets, and recordkeeping requirements for reporting lost or stolen firearms and other assets.

As a 14-year FBI special agent, including significant time as a counterterrorism agent, I am an eyewitness to the importance of this program and the deliberate and lawful manner in which it is used.  The fact is, section 702 is a critical tool that the intelligence community uses properly to target non-U.persons located outside of the United States to acquire information that is vital to our Nation's security.  Equally as important, this crucial program has operated under strict rules and has been carefully overseen by all three branches of our government to protect the privacy and civil liberties of all  As we have seen, both in our country and abroad, proper surveillance and law enforcement is vital to protect us against terror attacks, especially lone attacker scenarios. As terror groups like ISIS continue to lose territory in Iraq and Syria, our intelligence community has warned that we will see more of these one-off attacks as opposed to more traditional conspiracies.  At a hearing of the Homeland Security Committee, I asked FBI Director Chris Wray about this program as part of our national security posture. He said, despite the high volume of threats, there are few dots that can actually be connected in regard to these ``more loosely organized situations.'' Information already lawfully obtained by the FBI is crucial in, as he said, understanding ``which threats are real and which ones are more aspirational.''  Section 702 allows the national security professionals to query information to determine whether a tip from State or local law enforcement or others is credible, and it begins the process of marshalling resources to head off potential threats.  Allowing section 702 to expire would leave America vulnerable at a time when we need this protection the most. As Director Wray clearly stated: ``If 702 is walked back, we will be . . . starting to rebuild the wall that existed before 9/11.''  Mr.Speaker, with today's terror landscape, we cannot go backwards when proven, legal means exist to keep Americans safe.  I urge my colleagues, Democrat and Republican alike, to support this vital national security measure. The safety and security of the families we represent depend on the passage of this measure.

159,topic-id,575,"Madam President, I rise today to honor the selfless and dedicated life of Thomas Monson, the 16th president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  After nearly seven decades of church leadership and service, President Monson passed away on Tuesday evening. Millions of members of the LDS Church around the globe mourn his passing as we celebrate his life.  There is much that can be said about what President Monson taught us from the pulpit. There is much more to be learned about what he did when he wasn't speaking--the sick whom he visited, the weary he sustained, the jobless he aided, and the homeless he sheltered.  A reoccurring theme throughout his life and his ministry was ``the rescue.'' He spoke movingly of a painting he had seen in a gallery in England that featured, as he described it, ``heavy-laden black clouds and the fury of a turbulent sea portending danger and death. A life from a stranded vessel gleaming far off. In the foreground, tossed high by incoming waves of foaming water, a large lifeboat, men pulling mightily on the oars plunging into the tempest. On the shore stands a wife and two children, wet with rain and whipped by wind. They gaze anxiously seaward.''  ``In my mind,'' President Monson said, ``I abbreviated the name of the painting. To me, it became ``To the Rescue.''  Throughout his life, President Monson went to the rescue of those in need. He possessed a genuine love for those who were sad, downtrodden, and less fortunate.  He was quoted as saying:       I firmly believe that the sweetest experience in mortality      is to know that our Heavenly Father has worked through us to      accomplish an objective in the life of another person.[[Page S33]]  This, he took to heart. In his early years of church service, President Monson presided over a congregation with 85 widows. Although he was their appointed church leader for just a few short years, the love he felt for those widows was evident. He continued to visit each widow throughout her remaining life and was present at the funeral for each of his dear friends.  He encouraged all of us to ``extend the hand that helps and the heart that knows compassion.'' My colleagues here would be interested to know that President Monson often quoted Abraham Lincoln saying: ``If you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend.''  President Monson's example of service and rescue was recognized by many world leaders. In an effort to promote America's spirit of generosity, President Ronald Reagan appointed him to his Task Force on Private Sector President Monson met with religious leaders of all faiths to talk about the welfare program of the church, which has been recognized as being highly successful in its scope and in its mission.  In closing, President Monson's daughter, Ann Monson Dibb, observed how her father embodied the Scripture in James that reads: ``Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.''

The list of companies nationwide that have announced pay raises, bonuses, and 401(k) contributions is growing. Companies that weren't able to invest more in their employees in the past have found renewed confidence in this Nation's economic future.  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle proclaimed that this bill was a tax scam that would only profit the rich. These baseless claims are the very epitome of fake news, and nothing could be further from the truth.  Already, more than a million Americans have received bonuses because of our efforts to reform the Tax $900 billion is being distributed to hardworking American taxpayers by job creators as of today.  Thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we have witnessed companies begin to reinvest in the future of employees. In fact, Aflac announced it will increase 401(k) matching from 50 percent to 100 percent for the first 4 percent of employee contribution, on top of issuing one-time bonuses to employees.  Our job creators are so inspired by the reforms we worked hard for, and those who are working toward retirement will enjoy these benefits for years to come.  While some in this Chamber stated that tax reform would lead to Armageddon, I would like to point out that, for many, tax reform has brought about what Reagan called morning in America again. Proponents of the status quo and naysayers claimed that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would cost taxpayers. That is simply not the truth.  Even modest increases in GDP growth caused by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will substantially contribute to a leveling off of the deficit. The Congressional Budget Office stated, for every one-tenth of 1 percent increase in GDP, nearly $270 billion in revenue is added over 10 years.  Most importantly, hardworking American taxpayers will now keep more of their hard-earned cash.

342,topic-id,512,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  As we destroy the caliphate in the Middle East, foreign fighters and terrorist sympathizers have fled the battlefield and are looking for new ways to spread their hatred, recruit new followers, instill fear, kill innocent people, and disrupt our way of life.  The December 11 bombing at the New York City Port Authority Bus Terminal was the second terror attack in New York in less than 2 months and a grave reminder of the reality of this threat.  Given this current environment, at the direction of Chairman McCaul, I led a task force to identify specific national security challenges and examine how terrorists might infiltrate our homeland and bring harm to our people. Subsequently, we produced a report with a series of solutions to fix any identified weaknesses that may be exploited by our enemies.  This report resulted in several pieces of legislation that have come before the House today. To that end, my bill, the Counterterrorism Information Sharing Improvement Act, seeks to enhance the current information-sharing environment that exists within the Federal and military communities. Throughout the task force, we heard time and time again about the incredible amount of biometric and biographic data being pulled off battlefields in Syria and Iraq, as U.forces and our allies continue to roll back the territories once held by  It is often DOD personnel that encounter ISIS fighters on the battlefield, which often leads to the collection of valuable data. However, if these fighters and their associates move back to the West or try to enter the U.S., the DHS becomes the primary entity that will engage them. Therefore, it is critical that the data recovered by the DOD in the battlefield is able to reach the DHS and its systems for effective frontline screening and vetting of known or suspected terrorists.  In order to verify we are utilizing this information to support our counterterrorism efforts, we must ensure that the Department of Homeland Security gets access to that data in a timely manner, particularly so that it can be used for screening and vetting purposes. My bill directs the President, acting through the Secretary of Homeland Security, to ensure that the DHS has access to biographic and biometric data collected by the U.Government on individuals associated with a terrorist organization. The bill also directs the Secretary to report to Congress on these efforts.  The U.must prioritize any opportunity to identify bad actors outside the country and expand our ability to identify and deter threats before they reach the homeland. Unfortunately, information-sharing challenges among U.agencies can prevent valuable information from becoming available for frontline screening and vetting. Not only is this a bureaucratic challenge, given the number of separate government agencies and components involved, but legal capacity and technical issues exist as well.  This bill will address these challenges and create improved collaborations between the Department of Homeland Security and its other Federal and military partners.  Mr.Speaker, I therefore urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.

Last week, the House took another weeklong break instead of staying here in order to talk about fulfilling our fundamental duty of passing a budget and funding the government. Yet here we are once again, for the third time in 2 months, just 10 days away from government funding running out, and once again we are scheduled to leave town.  Mr.Speaker, Congress is paid to do a job, and so we shouldn't leave town until that job is done. This constant cycle of careening from one budgetary deadline to the next is irresponsible and embarrassing. Only in Washington is doing a basic task like keeping the lights on considered such a difficult achievement.  It doesn't have to be this way. The solution is simple: No more breaks. Lock us on the House floor until we reach a budget deal that does right by our constituents, does right by the military, does right by all these different programs.

439,topic-id,2651,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the Chair for the opportunity to talk about a couple of issues here on the floor of the I really have two things I want to talk about today. One is the incredible tax bill that was passed by the Congress and signed by the President just before Christmas, a tax bill that has profound effects on the American economy, most of them negative and bad, but also a tax--I will use the word ``scam''--that will really--well, if you happen to be superwealthy, it is terrific.  I guess, Mr.Speaker, the President, when he went to his Christmas party at Mar-a-Lago, spoke to his guests, most of whom I suspect were rather wealthy, and he said: I just made you a whole lot richer.  Indeed, he did. So we will talk about that in a little more detail.  I also want to talk about the ongoing Mueller investigation. On the floor of the House, from time to time, many of my colleagues from the Republican side come here to the floor, or on cable television, and attack Mueller, attack the FBI, and anybody else who happens to be standing nearby, in an effort to discredit the special counsel's investigation of what happened in the 2016 Presidential election.  It seems to me that here in America, since the very first days of our constitutional government, we have always said that we are a country of laws and that the laws dictate what we do.                              {time}  1800  We are not a country of individuals that dictate what happens but, rather, a country of laws. What is happening here in this effort to discredit the Mueller investigation is to move away from that nearly century and a half of profound importance in how people govern themselves not by the will of an emperor or the will of a king or even the will of a President, but we govern ourselves by the laws that are enacted by elected representatives: Senators, Members of the House of Representatives, in the case of the National Government, or legislatures, county commissioners, county supervisors, or city council members.  We are a country ruled by laws that are enacted by the citizens; however, the effort to discredit, to derail, to stop the investigation of the appropriate entity--in this case, the Department of Justice, acting through the special counsel--is contrary to the fundamental foundation of the way in which we govern ourselves. That is to say that that discrediting, that effort to stop the investigation of whether laws were broken, disobeyed, or not followed completely undermines the foundation of our government and our relationship as individuals.  None of us want to be subject to the whims of an individual like a king or an emperor or a We want them--in this case, the President--to act through the law, that is, to follow the law and, in this case, an agency within the executive branch, the Department of Justice, to carry out its responsibility to determine if the laws have been followed, if there has been a breach of law, if there has been some other element that is contrary to the rule of law. It is that simple.  So I would ask my Republican colleagues here in the House of Representatives and in the Senate and those who are constantly on cable television who are attempting to knock down the Mueller investigation, to discredit his investigation, to discredit the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other agencies of the Federal Government to slow down, to stand back, and to let the operation that is fundamental to our well-being, that operation of enforcing the law to occur and see where it goes, let the investigation play itself out and not get caught up in questions of whether the Steele dossier was the reason for the investigation. It was not.  Clearly, today, we have learned from Senator Feinstein, whom I thank and whom all of us should thank, for making public the 10 hours of testimony from Fusion GPS available for all of us to see so that we can, as individuals, judge the validity of the charge that has been made that somehow the Steele investigation is all that this is about. It is not. It was not and is not. It is about information that came to the FBI from multiple sources, including counterintelligence information developed by our intelligence agencies. That then led to the investigation and eventually to the establishment of a special counsel.  So take a deep breath. Let this process unfold. Let the facts lead the way. Let the development of those facts be done, and let us then judge the outcome of the investigation.  It seems to me that a lot of the heat that has been put on the FBI and the Mueller team comes from a fear that there is something to fear. So the question should be asked: What is it that you fear?  Why is it that you are doing so much to try to waylay, discredit, stop the investigation?  Is there something that you know that the American public should know?  Is there something that you fear that Mr.Mueller will find out about the 2016 Presidential campaign, about connections to Russia?  Do you know something that would cause you to so aggressively try to stop the investigation? Perhaps you do, in which case, come to the floor and share with us.  I will let it go at that. It just seems to me that we ought to recognize that we are a nation of laws. We are not a nation of a king or an emperor or of a We are a nation of laws in which the President's task is to faithfully carry out the Constitution and the laws. If you don't like the laws, come here and change them or go to the Supreme Court and get a ruling that somehow that law is not constitutional. That is the way we should do it.  So enough of that. I have taken a few moments to look at this profoundly important issue about the very nature of government in the United  Let me take up another issue, which I actually opened on for just a few moments, and that was tax policy.  I have stood here on the floor before, many times, and talked about the tax bill as it was being developed, and I raised the alarm that somehow this tax bill would not be good for American families and working men and women in  I always want to start this discussion with this placard. Those of you who have followed me on the floor may have seen it before, but I want to frame what I am concerned about. I want you to understand the scope of this discussion and why it is of concern. I found this to be an extremely useful way to frame my values and, I think, to frame the values of my colleagues in the Democratic  What is it that we want to accomplish?  What is the value that we put forth?  What is our goal?  What are we trying to do with our public policy statements?  What did we attempt to do with our unanimous opposition to the tax bill that the House of Representatives and the Senate passed and the President signed?  This is the framework. If you would, this is the statement of values. It[[Page H73]]comes from Franklin Delano That is actually etched in marble at the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial here in Washington, D.These are his words: ``The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much.''  Let me repeat that: ``The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.''  For myself, and I know for my Democratic colleagues, this is the touchstone. These words are the touchstone about our policies, about the programs that we push forward. These words are the touchstone that give us a foundation upon which we then analyze the legislation and come to a conclusion to vote ``yes'' or ``no.''  In our analysis of the tax scam, we found that that legislation, now law, failed this test. It failed the fundamental test.  Did that legislation help those who have little or did it add to the abundance of those who have much?  The answer is this from the Joint Tax Committee: during the 10-year life of this legislation, the result of the tax scam is that 83 percent of the $1.5 trillion goes to the top 1 percent.  How can that be? How could it be that a piece of legislation that has been enacted and is now the law of the land will, over the next decade, shift more than $1.5 trillion to those who are already the richest men and women in this Nation, if not in this world?  Why? Why would we add a king's ransom--no, a national ransom--to those who already have 80 percent of the wealth of this Nation?  Why would we do that? Why?  Why would we ignore this test?  We didn't. We Democrats did not. We said ``no'' 186 times because it fails the fundamental test of fairness.  We know across this Nation, it is in economic study after economic study, that America has concentrated wealth in the handful of the top 1 percent to an extent only seen once in America's history before this time, and that was the Gilded Age at the turn of the 19th century. Never, other than now and then, did so few have such a high concentration of America's wealth.  Now, there are those who would argue that is a good thing because all of that wealth will be spent and trickle down to the rest of There is not one economic study anywhere that says that trickle down will actually happen; but, rather, what the tax scam bill does is to continue the concentration of wealth for the next decade.  So what of the poor, what of the elderly, what of the students in school who are borrowing vast sums of money so they can get an education?  What of the men and women who have been able to acquire a health insurance policy through the Affordable Care Act because they were able to have that cost of the premium subsidized?  What of those people?  The working men and women of America were dealt a very, very bad hand. But, Mr.Speaker, as the President said when he walked into his club for a Christmas party after signing the bill: I have made you so much wealthier.  So here we are. We had meetings today with military. We need to build new nuclear bombs. We need to build new missiles. We need new ships. We need new tanks.                              {time}  1815  Whether they do or not, you can debate, but there is an incredible demand for money from the military. By the way, we need to fight wars. We need to prepare for conflict on the Korean  Need, need, need, we need--yes, they do need. Not all of it. I would disagree with much of it, but nonetheless, enormous demand.  And in this tax bill, where is the money for that? Where is the money for the military?  If you are a military hawk, ask yourself: Where is the money?  It went to the top 1 percent and American corporations that already had $2.5 trillion of cash stashed away in their treasury. They didn't need more money. They were not even investing what they had, yet they received even more as a result of this tax scam.  So what is the purpose of all of this?  Oh, did I mention that in this bill--for that family out there that was able to get health insurance for the first time so they could have a baby, so they could have an operation that they needed, so they can have continuing access to preventative care, do you know what was in this bill? Do my colleagues understand what was in this bill?  Six, seven, eight million of our American families will lose their health insurance as a result of this bill, and all the rest of us are going to wind up paying anywhere from 10 to 20 percent more premium cost as a result of the language that was in this bill that restricts and literally guts the Affordable Care A test of our progress.  So what did the tax scam do?  It shifted a king's ransom--excuse me--a Presidential ransom to those who already have much, the top 1 percent. There you have it, 83 percent of it. And it purposely harms millions of Americans because they will lose their health insurance as a result of the language of this bill that guts the Affordable Care Act's programs.  How could it be? How could we do that?  We Democrats didn't. We said: This is bad public policy.  Now, guess what. That was step one of what I like to call the Texas Two  Do you know what step two is?  Step two is to suddenly wake up and realize: ``Oh, my, we have just added $1.5 trillion plus interest, maybe another 3- or $400 billion of interest to the national debt. Oh, my goodness. We have to do something,'' they say.  In fact, it has already been said by our esteemed Not the gentleman that is in the chair at this moment, but Mr.He has already said: We have to take the next step now. We have to cut entitlements.  Oh, my, the entitlements, we have to cut them in order to deal with the huge new deficit that was created by the tax plan. Wait a minute. Mr.Speaker, you just created the deficit and now you want to go after entitlements. Time out.  Do we understand what an entitlement is? Do we know what an entitlement is?  Let me tell you. Social Oh, we are talking about seniors. Social  You mean we have got to cut entitlements, Social Security? Oh, Mr.Speaker, that is what you want us to do? You want us to cut Medicare?  You are suggesting we do that by raising the eligibility age, not from 65, but maybe 67, 68. And you just cut the ability for these people to get health insurance at the same time? How does that calculate?  In my mind, it doesn't.  Did I mention Medicaid?  You know those programs--Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, education--those are entitlements.  That is what you want to cut? When 60, 70 percent of Medicaid goes to seniors, nursing homes, other disabled people, extended care, and nursing home facilities, that is what you want to cut?  Guaranteed, as sure as I am standing on the floor at this moment, that is the second step.  And I am not dreaming this up. These are the words of the Republican leadership in this House and in the So be prepared, America, there is a critical fight, an absolutely important fight that is taking place in your National Legislature, the Congress of the United It is about the very future of this fundamental notion.

There are many, many elements to this.  He mentioned education. Infrastructure is a piece of it, medical care, research, and so forth.  Staying with the infrastructure, the Democrats have proposed several different ways to pay for the infrastructure program. Two of those, or one big one, is now gone.  American corporations held $1 trillion--I think, almost $2 trillion--of profits offshore. In the tax, bill that money cannot be retrieved. It is going into the coffers of the corporations if they bring it back to the United States, with a very small tax.  One of the proposals brought forward by the Democrats was to repatriate, bring that money back to the United States and use it to support infrastructure, to use it to pay for immediate bonds, that we could then sell those bonds and use that money for infrastructure investment. That, of course, is gone as a result of the tax bill.  There is another proposal that really, I think, dovetails with the extraordinary ramp-up of the stock market. A lot of that has to do with transactions, billions of transactions every day. A small fee of less than one one-hundredth of a penny on each transaction would raise billions of dollars and go directly to deal with what is a problem in the stock market, and that is computerized gambling that goes on in the stock market.

73,topic-id,652,"Mr.President, I rise to speak about a horrible tragedy that took place in the early morning hours of December 31 in Douglas County, CO, when most Coloradoans were waking up and preparing for a celebration that evening to bring in the new year. Hours later, a gunman would open fire on Douglas County sheriff's deputies in what has been described by law enforcement as an ambush-style attack.  The gunman injured two citizens as well as Sheriff's Deputies Michael Doyle, Jeff Pelle, Taylor Davis, and Castle Rock Police Department Officer Thomas O'A fifth officer, Douglas County Sheriff's Deputy Zackari Parrish, heroically gave his life during this ambush in an attempt to save the lives of others.  Deputy Parrish was 29 years old and is survived by his wife, Gracie, and their two young daughters.  Zack's lifelong dream was to become a police officer. He attended Arapahoe Community College Law Enforcement Academy part time while he worked full time at a bank so he could make these dreams come true. Following graduation, Zack served for 2 years as an officer at the Castle Rock Police Department and spent the last 7 months as a Douglas County sheriff's deputy. His selfless nature and devotion to his family and friends was a testament to his tireless drive to protect his community. He was what every officer strives to be--dedicated to the job, persistent, and detail oriented.  At a vigil to honor Zack earlier this week, his fellow deputies shared Zack's ``knack for finding things other cops missed.'' They spoke of ``how he always wanted to chase the bad guys'' and how, even when it was time to go home, Zack would ``stay late to make one more check on patrol.'' His family and friends spoke of how Zack was known for his ``bear-sized love'' and even more so for his bear-sized hugs.  These are the qualities of those who righteously wear the blue uniform. These are the qualities that keep the rest of us safe and sound. These are the qualities of a hero. Zack, like all law enforcement officers, went to work each and every day being prepared to walk that thin blue line.  Colleagues at the vigil spoke about how Zack was not only dedicated to the difficult parts of the job but also to lifting the spirits of his fellow officers. According to his fellow deputies, Zack was known as the guy who would ``hunt for the best Christmas lights.'' It is that kind of passion, good nature, and of course love for his community that Zack will be remembered for.  As we saw on New Year's Eve, while the rest of us spent time with our families and friends, our brave law enforcement officers were protecting our communities. Their sacrifice is why we were able to celebrate with our loved ones.  We owe so much to Zack and the law enforcement officers across Colorado and across the country for their service. When a tragic event like this unfolds, I am often reminded of the words of LTC Dave Grossman, who wrote that American law enforcement is the loyal and brave sheep dog that is always standing watch for the wolf that lurks in the dark.  Regardless of their personal safety, our law enforcement officers run toward the danger. They are always there to help others serve our communities, and often through the worst of times, they provide hope and safety to our families, including mine, including yours.  I continue to pray--and let all of us continue to pray--for the other four officers and two citizens who were injured in the attack. We must continue to honor Zack's memory and support his brothers in blue as they continue his work and support his dearly loved family as they begin the new year in a way they never could have imagined. We honor his legacy and those who serve.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-03-pt2-PgS19.txt,1608,SCREENING AND VETTING PASSENGER EXCHANGE ACT OF 2017,2018.0,3.0,January

161,topic-id,710,"Madam President, up until about 8:58 this morning, we believed in Colorado that States rights would be protected. Up until about 8:58, maybe 8:55--until Twitter told us otherwise--we believed the will of Colorado voters would be respected. Why did we believe that? Because of conversations I had with then-Senator Jeff Sessions prior to his confirmation as Attorney General about what would happen with Colorado's marijuana policy.  At the time, prior to his confirmation, then-Senator Sessions told me there were no plans to reverse the Cole memorandum. Then-Senator Sessions told me marijuana simply wasn't going to be on President Trump's agenda; that it was something they weren't going to deal with; it was something President Trump simply wasn't going to focus on.  That was back in the spring of 2016, and up until 8:58 this morning, that was the policy. One tweet later, one policy later--a complete reversal of what many of us on the Hill were told before the confirmation and what we had continued to believe the last year. Then, without any notification, conversation, or dialogue with Congress, completely reversed.  Now, perhaps the Department of Justice didn't think this would be a big deal. I understand Attorney General Jeff Sessions' opposition to the legalization of marijuana. I opposed the legalization of marijuana in Colorado, but this is about a decision by the State of We were told that States rights would be protected and not just by the Attorney General, then the nominee to be Attorney General, we were told that by then-Candidate Donald  In Colorado, in July of 2016, then-Candidate Trump was asked if he would use Federal authority to shut down sales of recreational marijuana in States like Then-Candidate Donald Trump said: ``I wouldn't do that.''  When then-Candidate Trump was asked if he thought Colorado should be allowed to do what it is doing, he said: ``It's up to the Absolutely.''  That was then-Candidate Trump's position. I would like to know from the Attorney General what has changed. What has changed President Trump's mind that the Cole memorandum would be reversed and rescinded? What has changed the President's mind? Why is Donald Trump thinking differently today about what he promised the people of Colorado in 2016 to reverse course today? What changed? I would like to know that. I think the people of Colorado deserve to have that answer.  Without the Cole memorandum, legal businesses, operating in accordance with States rights and laws, are now operating under a cloud of uncertainty. Thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in revenue are at risk, and certainly the question of constitutional States rights is very much at the core of this discussion. I believe what happened today was a trampling of Colorado's rights and its voters. Sure, this was a heavily debated issue, something I have already said I opposed, but the people of Colorado spoke, and they spoke loudly, and I believe that if the same question were asked today, they would even have more support for the decision they made several years ago.  I agree with President Trump that this decision should be left up to the people of Colorado and other States, and I call on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to explain to me why President Trump was wrong in 2016, what changed their minds, and that they reverse their decision to withdraw and rescind the Cole memorandum and that they reimplement and reinstate the Cole memorandum. Until that happens, I think I am obligated to the people of Colorado to take all steps necessary to protect the State of Colorado and their rights.  That is why today I will be putting a hold on every single nomination from the Department of Justice until Attorney General Jeff Sessions lives up to the commitment he made to me in my preconfirmation meeting with him--the conversation we had that was specifically about this issue of States rights in Until he lives up to that commitment, I will be holding all nominations to the Department of  The people of Colorado deserve answers.

421,topic-id,1320,"Mr.Speaker, 39 years ago, a collective nightmare was foisted[[Page H67]]upon the people of the nation of Iran, and so when roughly 2 weeks ago, while on recess, I became aware of the courage manifest in the action of the Iranian people in standing up to a brutal totalitarian regime, I immediately contacted our office and suggested that we secure this Special Order hour, and reached out to a number of my colleagues, several of whom join me today, to speak loudly and clearly on behalf of the United States and the nearly 6 million people represented by myself and the individuals who will speak here today in support of those who would stand up and risk their very existence for those most basic human rights, which we as Americans take, tragically, for granted.  As I stand in this well, Mr.Speaker, in cities that the bulk of Americans have never heard of, in Isfahan and Karaj and Tabriz and Mashhad and Tehran, indeed, tens of thousands stand in the face of a regime with a record of destroying not only freedom but life itself in the instance of those who would stand up and demand freedom, stand up and demand basic human rights and dignity.  Mr.Speaker, to put this into perspective, if you were to take the population of the nation of Iran circa 1979 and compare it to the population of the United States circa 1941 and then align the numbers of Americans killed in combat during the entire Second World War, it would proportionally be roughly equal to the number of people who have given their lives at the hands of the brutal Iranian regime inside the borders of Think about that for a moment. Roughly 60,000 during the coup d'etat revolution in 1979, about 12,500 from 1981 to 1984, almost 33,000 during the 1988 uprising. We don't know how many were murdered in 2009, when this Nation stood silent as Iranians, brave, took to the streets to demand self-determination and toleration; that a regime should not be able to dictate how one worships, who one marries, what one believes; that people should be given basic rights to self-determination.  Today, we know very little about what is going on in Iran except for the brave women and men who are confronting challenges that we, by virtue of the fortune of our birth as Americans, will hopefully never have to confront. We know that roughly 50 have been murdered; we know that roughly 3,000 are imprisoned.  This time, I will not be silent. I have spoken with Iranian Americans of all different facets from a number of different groups. I ask these Iranian Americans, as well as those resisting within Iran and Iranians disbursed across the globe, to set aside their political differences and join together for the common goal of deposing a regime that murders its own sons and daughters to a tune that is comparable to the total number of American combat deaths during the Second World Enough is enough.  Today, I stand beside an image of Habib Habib was the former captain of the Iranian national soccer team. He and 40 others were executed in 1984 at the Evin Prison for having the temerity to criticize their government. He was 29 years old. The evidence indicates that he was tortured before he was executed.  In fact, again, as we stated earlier, over 12,000 people were executed by the Islamic Republic Security Forces just from 1981 to 1984.  Next is a young woman who tragically became something of an international folk hero for those who were paying attention, in that she had the temerity to stand and protest during the Green Revolution in 2009, suggesting that the Iranian people had a right to self-determination, when she was publicly, on film, murdered in the streets, 26 years old. The United States remained silent. The second of three children from a middle class neighborhood, she had the courage to stand up and point out injustice when she saw it, and paid with her life. Indeed, the protesters with whom she marched shouted, ``America, you are either with us or with the mullahs,'' and we did not respond.  Today, I am responding. This administration is responding.  The Iranians, with whom I have spoken across a diverse sect of opposition, do not want tanks and bombers and missiles, nor do I, having worn the uniform of this Nation, but while we can't rule out any particular alternatives, all they ask is a word of support; that when we act legislatively in this body and in the Chamber down the hallway, we have the follow-through to ensure that our actions are backed up; that unlike the 1990s, when the Iran Sanctions Act was passed, we don't let our so-called European allies turn a blind eye as their corporate entities continue to do business with the IRGC that uses the money generated through this business not only to murder their own citizens but to fund the likes of Hezbollah, and fast forward to current day, create instability, peril, death, and destruction literally across the entire region from the Mediterranean to the Khyber  There is no blind eye being turned this time.  Next we see Shekar A nurse, she was arrested, imprisoned, and tortured for rendering medical assistance to other Iranian brothers and sisters who were brutalized by the revolutionary guards in the streets of She was tortured viciously at Evin Prison, served a significant portion of a prison sentence, 7 of 15 years, before being executed along with nearly 33,000 others circa 1988.  Now, three names, three faces, three stories, probably 30 seconds to a minute on each. Let me put this into perspective, Mr.If we were to take 5 minutes to show the pictures and speak briefly on every individual murdered by the mullah regime in Iran, we would be here for over a year going 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  I don't stand here saber rattling, suggesting American military action. I stand here suggesting that what my Iranian-American friends and what people of Iranian dissent who are dissidents throughout the world have suggested to me is that if the American Government will stand up and say, ``We stand with you against these mullahs,'' that is the support that they need to continue the movement to see that there is a regime change, which leads to self-determination and democracy in Iran and the lifting of a dark cloud of terror from across the globe.  Don't believe me? I was born in 1972, and I have grown up with the perpetual mention of There are those who think that Hezbollah is something that has been around for a long time, but I point out today that Hezbollah is actually younger than the mullah regime; that, in fact, the mullah regime created Hezbollah; and Hezbollah has the unique distinction of being one of a very few terrorist entities that has actually killed human beings on every single inhabited continent on planet  No trade with Iran, no money to the IRGC; no money to the IRGC, no money to Hezbollah; no money to Hezbollah, we have self-determination in Lebanon, we have less of an oppressive interference in Iraq, we have more stability in Syria, and we have freedom in Enough is enough.  Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleagues for standing with me today, and I ask the American people and my colleagues to take the time to inform themselves about places like Isfahan and Karaj and Tabriz and Mashhad, and to think about the women and men who have the courage to walk through the threshold of a door of a home where, when they leave, they know full well they may very well not come back.

435,topic-id,502,"Mr.Speaker, I will conclude. If we were to spend 5 minutes on each of the individuals murdered by the Iranian regime since that regime took power some 39 years ago, we would be here 24/7 for over a year. If we were to name each country and spend 1 day where Iran and their proxies, such as Hezbollah, have taken human life, we would literally be here for months, 1 day per country.  Mr.Yoho articulated basic concepts of natural law, that people are endowed by their Creator with fundamental rights to include the right to life, the right to freedom, and the right to pursue happiness.  Mr.Duncan, Mr.Rothfus, and Mr.Rohrabacher spoke to the JCPOA, and the circumstances surrounding it, how our Nation turned its back on the multibillion-dollar criminal enterprise wholly subsidized by Iran that is Hezbollah, making a bad deal, ignoring trafficking of deadly narcotics throughout the world and, indeed, in our own country to get a worse deal.  I stand with my colleagues who renounce the JCPOA, and I would point out that it is my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, the broad bipartisan opposition to the JCPOA, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which I have referred to repeatedly, and only somewhat jokingly, as the ``Joint Comprehensive Piece of Something, JCPOS.''  But if you want to see the JCPOA go away, the best way to do that is to empower the people of Iran to empower themselves, and that is why I thank my colleagues, one and all, for standing with me here today to speak loudly and clearly. Mr.Speaker, it is my hope that people watching at home will take to social media where the youth of Iran have fomented this revolution, that hashtags such as #freeiran, #iranprotests and #iran will pick up steam, that the world can communicate with those who risk their very lives to assert their basic, fundamental, and Creator-granted rights of[[Page H72]]life, liberty, and the right to pursue happiness by showing them that we support them.  Mr.Speaker, I would point out that Mr.Gohmert so articulately spoke to the role of Rouhani in Iran and the fawning Western media that speaks to his role as a moderate. Mr.Speaker, Mr.Rouhani, quite literally, represents the mullahs, and so, as such, that would be as if suggesting that Mr.Goering or Mr.Goebbels was a moderate There is nothing moderate about the leadership of this regime.  So with this, I conclude: Americans have been killed by Iran or its proxies in this country, in Lebanon, in Iraq, in Kenya, and in People have given their lives at the hands of Iran in Australia, Argentina, Syria, Israel, Germany, the United Kingdom, in Tanzania, Malaysia, Afghanistan, Yemen, and Saudi It is time for this to end.

It is important that we discuss what has been going on in I recall I was on Active Duty in the United States Army back when President Carter stood by and basically encouraged the taking out of the Shah of No prince according to his own conduct, but he made a statement welcoming the Ayatollah Khomeini back to Iran as what he called him, I believe it was a man of peace. He could not have been more wrong.  There has been less peace because the Ayatollah Khomeini took over a state government, a national government, and a powerful military than any time since World War They have been the largest state sponsor of terrorism. They have, we have been told, probably provided most of the IEDs that have killed and maimed Americans fighting for freedom in the Middle East, especially in  They have worked to stir up trouble all over the Middle East, north Africa, and have created massive mayhem, and they are looking to do even more. And with the $100 billion or more that President Obama sent to Iran, they have been able to make more IEDs to kill more Americans, create more havoc, and stir up more sentiment against the United States since that unconstitutional sending under a treaty that was never ratified was done by the last administration.  Some have blamed President Trump for the problems in That is a bit ridiculous. The problems are the radical Islamist leadership in In fact, the same people that would like to blame President Trump are some of the same ones who hailed the $100 billion sent under a treaty that was never ratified that would be used to kill innocent people around the world, including  The people of Iran are to be congratulated for saying: Enough is enough.  There is a great article from Commentary magazine titled: ``What the Iran Protests Have Already Achieved.''  Sohrab Ahmari says: ``More than 1,700 arrests and at least two dozen deaths later, the Tehran regime seems to have suppressed Iran's latest mass uprising. Scattered protests and skirmishes continue nationwide, according to the citizen-journalists who, braving regime violence, continued to post footage on social media. But for now, the demonstrations don't seem to be growing in numbers or frequency. Yet outside observers tempted to write off the movement should recall that the 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the Shah began decades earlier. There were lulls through the years, which tempted President Carter at one point to describe the Shah's Iran as an `island of stability' in the Middle  ``Whatever the ultimate outcome, however, the protesters have already accomplished a great deal and shattered many myths in the Let's review their achievements:  ``First, the Iran protests showed that the people are not rallying to the regime under the press of President Trump's hawkish rhetoric.''                              {time}  1745  ``Far from being `swept up in a wave of nationalist fervor,' as The New York Times' Thomas Erdbrink reported a few weeks before the uprising, Iranians still detest their corrupt, repressive regime. As my colleague''--and this is the author, Mr.Ahmari, speaking--``Noah Rothman has noted on our podcasts, Americans have an almost religious conviction that world events revolve around the U.and specifically the White To be sure, America remains the most important Nation on the world stage. Yet the average Iranian doesn't wake up in the morning cursing Donald Trump for trying to undo the nuclear deal. More likely, he curses the fact that he can't even afford eggs to feed his children, and there are more proximate actors whom he blames for that: namely, the mullahs.  ``Second, the uprising revealed, once and for all, that Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has been no moderate, and that the reformer versus hardliner distinction is meaningless. Ever since he came to power, Rouhani has been the subject of adulation among members of the Western foreign policy establishment. The media attached the `moderate' and `reformer' labels to Rouhani on the night of his first election, in June 2013, and refused to remove them even as evidence mounted that he was no such thing. There was Rouhani's leading role in the violent repression of the 1999 student uprising; his support for the post-2009 crackdown; his long record of anti-American rhetoric (`the[[Page H71]]beautiful cry of ``Death to America'' unites our nation'); his decidedly immoderate cabinet; his work overseeing Iran's campaign of assassinations targeting dissidents abroad; and much else of the kind.  ``But now Iranians themselves are plainly telling the West that Rouhani is no moderate. Their slogans--`Not Gaza; Not Lebanon; My Life Only for Iran' and `Let Syria Be; Do Something for Me'--are a reminder that Tehran has continued to underwrite terror and bloodshed across the Middle East during the 4-plus years of Rouhani's The people have also been chanting, `Reformists; Hardliners; the Whole Game is Over.' Let's hope the same realization soon dawns in Washington and  ``Third, the protesters put the lie to the Obama administration's claims about the 2015 nuclear deal. Remember when senior Obama officials reassured Americans that Iran would use the sanctions relief under Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) to improve the lots of its people? Here is how Obama Treasury Secretary Jack Lew put it in an April 2015 address: `Many Americans, and many of our closest allies, are understandably concerned that Iran will use the money it receives as a result of sanctions relief to fund terrorism and support destabilizing proxies throughout the Middle We share those concerns, and we are committed to maintaining sanctions that address these activities, even after Iran takes the steps required to get relief from nuclear sanctions. But it is important to note that the connection between nuclear sanctions relief and Iran's other malign activities is complicated, and most of the money Iran receives from sanctions relief will not be used to support those activities.' ''  I would interject here he had absolutely, 100 percent, no basis for making such ridiculous statements.  ``Two months later, Colin Kahl, a National Security Advisor to then-Vice President Joe Biden, told the Truman Center: `It is our assessment . . . that the Iranians are not going to spend the vast majority of the money on guns. Most of it will go to butter.' ''  I would insert here he had no basis whatsoever for making such statements.  The article said: ``Millions of jobless and impoverished Iranians now beg to differ. It turns out that the regime was happy to spend the JCPOA''--the Iran treaty that was never ratified--``funds on Hezbollah, Hamas, the Yemeni Houthis, and other nasties, even if that meant Iranians would go hungry. And those hungry people aren't mistaken about the roots of their hunger. Iran remains the world's top state sponsor of terror, according to the U.State Deal opponents warned of this, only to be brushed aside by Obama and his media allies. The Trump administration now has an opportunity to correct course, by walking away from Obama's bad deal. The American people are under no obligation to finance Iran's terrorist statecraft.  ``The mullahs would have no one to blame but themselves. The Iranian people, defeated but unbowed, are sure to have another day.''

456,topic-id,865,"Mr.Speaker, we keep hearing about action that needs[[Page H76]]to be taken on the Deferred Action for Childhood I have spent a lot of time down on our Nation's southern border, and I was quite pleased, last year, when Border Patrol friends told me information indicated that, after President Trump was sworn in, the number of people coming into the United States illegally slowed to a trickle, that it was a dramatic decrease, and that continued for awhile. But, during the summer, as discussion about DACA started coming out, I was told, and, apparently, the numbers indicate, the surge began anew.  What I have heard over the years is anytime anyone in Washington starts talking about amnesty, legalization of any kind for people who have come into the United States illegally, there is a fresh surge across our border.  I have been told by border patrolmen, they hear people talking who have come in illegally--whether before processing, during processing, after processing, during the holding procedure, it is made very clear, since they are willing to come into the country illegally in violation of United States laws, that they want to get here before there is any legalization. And it makes sense, as I am told, that they are willing to come in in violation of U.law. They are also willing to say that they came in a previous time and, you know, backdate it, different identity, different date they came in, whatever is required in order to get legal status.                              {time}  1845  I appreciate hearing from my constituents, I always do, and I appreciate getting the opinions and thoughts of constituents from my district, the First District of They are always welcome.  In the last couple of days, I have gotten a stack of petitions in my office regarding a push to support what they are calling a clean Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals reform, but it raises some questions. The best I can tell by the words ``clean bill,'' they mean one that provides amnesty with no strings attached. However, all these petitions have been provided, actual names and addresses are only on a handful of them, many have names written in the same handwriting in ink, and there are numerous unsigned blank petitions in the stack we were provided.  In addition, I want to point out that, every time DACA legalization is mentioned, we have greater surges of people into our country illegally; and every time there is a surge, there are people who die trying to get into this country illegally, bodies found. We have the reports of a dramatic number of young girls, even some boys, who are pulled into sex trafficking, drug trafficking, as a way to pay off their debt to the drug cartels that control the area of the border that they were allowed to come across by the gang that brought them across.  It should be noted, every young person in America has dreams. The best way to achieve the greatest number of dreams for the greatest number of people in the United States is if we enforce the law across the board fairly.  I keep being amazed, and I have asked questions at our hearings:  So why did these people come into the United States illegally?  Well, because there are more jobs and opportunity.  No, but why did they leave where they left, where they fled?  Well, there was no opportunity there.  Why was there no opportunity? Why were there no jobs there?  Well, there is so much corruption. They don't enforce the law fairly.  So what we are being asked to do, instead of using political efforts to get these countries that people have fled to fix their political system, we are supposed to change our laws here so that those who have been working--I have helped some people 17 years trying to get into the country legally--they will be treated unfairly, because they have been trying to do things legally, in favor of people who violated the law to get here.  It kind of seems like we are being asked to become the kind of country they fled, where the law is not enforced fairly across the board. It sounds like the ultimate irony.  Until our border is made secure, we should not be discussing passage of any legalization bill. We should stop talking about legalization until the border is secure. When the border is secure, then we can work things out.  It is so ironic to me, the very people who are demanding a big amnesty, legalization, whatever you want to call it, say, ``We don't want a wall, we don't want the border secure,'' which means we will have to come back and have this discussion in the next couple of years all over again.  It was supposed to have ended in 1986. We will get border security in return for the amnesty. We got the amnesty, and we didn't get the border security.  I am joined by a friend, a very dear friend, who wrote speeches for his hero, a hero of mine, Ronald Reagan, who knows very well what happened in 1986.

It seems pretty clear, after our effort to create a democratic republic in Iraq, that if a nation's people have not been properly prepared and educated to maintain a democratic republic, they won't keep it. It seems pretty clear from the places we have been together.  I will never forget Christian friends that I made in west Africa, who sat me down at the end of the week and said they wanted me to understand that they were so thrilled when we elected our first Black But since he was elected, they said: We have seen America get weaker and weaker, and we wanted to make sure you took a message back to Washington that we are Christians, we know where we go when we die. But our only chance of having peace in this life is if America is strong.  I will never forget those words.  They said: Please stop getting weaker. We suffer when you are weaker.  And most of the people who are pouring across the United States for a better way of life, they are not coming to weaken us. They are coming with their own hopes and aspirations.  But I ask: What would be better? What better neighbor would we be to continue until so many come in, our system fails and goes bankrupt, as California is doing now?  Or would we be better to say: Let's build a wall where it is necessary. Let's totally secure our border. Let's cut off the 70 to $80 billion that is flowing from the United States into the drug cartels of Mexico, that allows them to corrupt the Government of Mexico and the local governments and terrorist people and put police heads on stakes to terrorize us. Let's cut off that 70 to $80 billion, however much it is.  Let's totally secure the border. And people who love their Mexican heritage are--other countries in Central and South America, they love their heritage, but they can't make it.  Why don't we help cut off the corruption by cutting off the flow of money out and drugs into our country? Why don't we work on that? Wouldn't that be a better neighbor to our friends to the South?  There is no reason Mexico is not one of the top 10 economies in the world. They have got the wonderful people, hardworking folks. They have got the resources. They have got a fantastic location.

We are told that the folks in the deep state have made very clear they want what they call a clean reauthorization. Nothing clean about it when you look at how 702 is spent.  So just spend a couple of minutes here, based on an article entitled ``How the FBI and DOJ Intelligence Units Were Weaponized Around Congressional Oversight'' from January 8, 2018. It goes through this scenario.  Sometime in early 2016, Admiral Rogers--talking about Admiral Mike Rogers, not the Mike Rogers that was here in Congress--became aware of an ongoing and intentional violation of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Section 702 surveillance, specifically item 17, which includes the unauthorized upstream data collection of U.individuals within NSA surveillance through the use of ``about inquiries,'' where they do a surveillance of someone foreign, capture American citizens, which would violate our Fourth Amendment rights, except that those names are masked and, supposedly, all kinds of efforts to protect that, so it is not a violation of the Fourth Amendment, supposedly.  But this article points out that they get all of these conversations in the database, and then they can do inquiries about people, subjects, and capture that information about Americans, basically allowing them to get around the Fourth  Mr.Speaker, I commend this article.

Mr.Speaker, as you all know, the Judiciary Committee worked diligently for a year on legislation that does two things: one, protect Americans' civil liberties by requiring a court order to access section 702 data during domestic criminal investigations; and, two, reauthorize the 702 program, which is our Nation's most indispensable national security tool.  We achieved that by passing the USA Liberty Act in the House Judiciary Committee last year by an overwhelming bipartisan vote, which is no easy task; however, we were able to responsibly balance civil liberties with national security.  The bill we will vote on today was drafted in the spirit of the USA Liberty It is not perfect and the process getting here was not ideal, but the bill requires, for the first time, a warrant to access section 702-collected communications on U.persons in criminal investigations.  Moreover, in routine criminal cases, when the FBI accesses U.person communications that were incidentally collected without first obtaining a warrant, the FBI will not be permitted to use those communications in a criminal prosecution. This will prevent a national security tool from advancing run-of-the-mill criminal prosecutions.  These are meaningful reforms. The bill that was presented to us before Christmas with its optional warrant construct was not real reform. The bill we are debating today, however, contains meaningful reforms.  I would have preferred to include additional reforms, but I cannot stress to my colleagues enough that our choice cannot be between a perfect reform bill and expiration of this program. The 702 program is far too important for that. With this bill, we can have meaningful reform and reauthorization.

Mr.Speaker, the revolution of 1979 marked an enormous step backwards for global security and for the basic rights of the Iranian people, the longest suffering victims of this corrupt terrorist regime.  From its very beginnings, the Islamic Republic of Iran, under the control of its Supreme Leaders, has repeatedly violated the fundamental human rights of its own citizens.  In August, the U.Special Reporter on the Situation of Human Rights in Iran highlighted the Khamenei regime's many ongoing abuses, ``including the arbitrary detention and prosecution of individuals for their legitimate exercise of a broad range of rights; the persecution of human rights defenders, journalists, students, trade union leaders, and artists; a high level of executions, including of juvenile offenders; the use of torture and ill treatment; widespread violations of the right to a fair trial and due process of law, especially before revolutionary courts; and a high level of discrimination against women and religious and ethnic minorities.''  Beginning late last month, protestors across the country have taken to the streets to decry their dismal economic prospects; Iran's costly, aggressive, and destabilizing actions throughout the region; and an antidemocratic regime that stifles their rights and aspirations and supports terror. These brave men and women, engaged in peaceful demonstrations, have every right to demand change from their corrupt and oppressive terrorist government.  While Iranians live under a brutal, authoritarian mullahcracy at home, their government insists on bankrolling terror throughout the region. Iran has capitalized on sanctions relief, bolstering its arsenal of conventional arms and its illegal ballistic missile program, and increasing the funding of heinous terrorist organizations and proxies in Lebanon, Yemen, and Iraq, as well as propping up the murderous regime of Bashar al-Assad in  As the world's leading sponsor of terror, Iran provides more than $800 million, annually, to Hezbollah and recently renewed its support for Iranian-backed forces are also attempting to gain a foothold in Syria, right up against Israel's border, to threaten our vital ally and the leading democracy in the region.  There should be nothing partisan about having the backs of brave men and women anywhere who risk death to speak out for what is right and against a terrorist regime.

This bill package is just the latest attempt by my Republican colleagues to push a highly partisan agenda by combining that divisive proposal with noncontroversial items.  Today's bill includes two bills that passed Senate and House Natural Resources Committee by unanimous consent.  One of these bills would make a technical correction to a previously passed Tribal water settlement, and the other would clarify that two pueblos in New Mexico should receive equal treatment when leasing their lands.  Unfortunately, instead of quickly passing these bills and suspensions and sending them to the President to be signed into law, House Republican leadership has decided to take those two bills hostage and combine them with a highly divisive bill that is likely not going anywhere--H.986, section 3 of this legislation--which I do not support.

551,topic-id,752,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.Collins), my friend, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate.  Mr.Speaker, I stand here today with the rest of my Democratic colleagues in utter amazement at the dizzying dysfunction exhibited by our friends across the aisle. For reasons beyond understanding, we have to vote on the reauthorization of section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act because late last year the Republican leadership chose to prioritize massive tax cuts for their wealthy donors over the safety of American citizens.                              {time}  1500  Like so many other important issues, House Republicans decided to punt on the reauthorization of 702 by simply extending it to January 19 of this year, coincidentally, the same date the government will possibly shut down.  Mr.Speaker, as a former judge and the former vice chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, I do occupy a unique vantage point in the ongoing debate between the need to steadfastly protect the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution while also ensuring that those in the intelligence community have the tools they need to keep our country safe from those who wish to do us grave harm.  Putting the finer points on this debate aside for a moment, I can tell you with complete certainty that such a debate deserves to be lengthy and thorough, neither of which have happened here.  I was concerned to learn, if not a bit dismayed, that the House Intelligence subcommittee which has oversight jurisdiction of the National Security Agency did not hold a single hearing on today's bill. In fact, the full committee did not even hold a single hearing on this important piece of legislation.  Think about that. As the Republicans approached the need to discuss the reauthorization of one of the more important tools to fight terrorism that, simultaneously, brings along legitimate and important Fourth Amendment concerns, the majority, in all their wisdom, thought it prudent to hold exactly zero hearings on such an important matter. That is a brazenly inept way to govern.  To add insult to injury, I am told that members of the committee were given about 36 hours to read the bill before having to vote it out of committee.  A side note here: the bill they were given 36 hours to review is not actually the bill we have before us today because the majority had to use a Rules Committee print to fix some of the most troublesome parts of the original bill in order to obtain my friend Ranking Member Adam Schiff's support. Mr.Speaker, without a doubt, that support did not come easily, and important changes were made to the bill as it was presented to the committee in its original form.  For example, Mr.Schiff was able to ensure the Republicans' unmasking language was removed from today's bill. The removal of such language ensures that one of the Republicans' most heinous political stunts is not codified into law. This was and is a significant improvement.  Moreover, the Republicans removed the controversial expansion of the definition of ``agent of foreign power,'' which concerned privacy and technology groups.  Today's bill also addresses what is known as ``abouts'' collection. This is the collection of communications that are not to or from a target but, rather, communications that merely reference the target. The NSA, itself, shut down this collection method earlier this year.  The legislation before us today will allow such collection to resume, but only if the NSA first devises a way of doing so that addresses privacy concerns, obtains permission from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, and Congress does not object after a 30-day review period.  Now, this may seem to be a better option than what I am sure many, if not most, Republicans wanted, which is the full-scale reimplementation of ``abouts'' collection, but considering how much difficulty the majority has in simply keeping the lights on around this place, I think it is fair to question their ability to provide meaningful oversight in just 30 days. Again, this is simply evidence for the need to return back to regular order under which bills are fully and fairly considered.  Regardless of where one comes down on this issue, I can assure you that there are Members on both sides of the aisle that are sick and tired of being shut out of important policy discussions concerning subjects like those before us today.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2018-01-10-pt1-PgH103.txt,511,NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT APPRECIATION DAY,2018.0,10.0,January

565,topic-id,309,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, the United States House of Representatives is known as the people's House, yet the people's representatives continuously are shut out of policy discussion after discussion. They are shut out of writing bill after bill, and they are shut out of offering any meaningful amendments.  Quite simply, Mr.Speaker, if the people's representatives are shut out, then the people are shut out. If you look around at how the majority is running this place, through a historically closed process, the result is not at all pretty.  I have some advice for my Republican friends. If, like this side of the aisle, you spent more time working on policies that help the American people instead of the wealthy and rich corporations who are, I might add, doing just fine, you would likely not only see more legislative successes, but you would be able to spend more time on important issues like this critically important issue, the extension of section 702.  Mr.Speaker, as is clearly evident, Democrats remain ready to work in a bipartisan manner to accomplish all that remains left to do for the American people. We are ready to fund the government and provide for smart investments for the future of our country.  We are ready to pull the hundreds of thousands of DREAMers out of unnecessary limbo and provide them with the status they deserve. We are ready to go forward with comprehensive immigration. We are ready to provide the funding and authorization needed to give millions of low-income children the health insurance they need. We are ready to fix our roads and our bridges and our railways and air trafficking. We are here and waiting, but time is running out.

533,topic-id,1979,"Mr.President, I rise to pay tribute to a trio of excellent staffers, all of whom served with distinction on the Senate Finance Committee for a number of years and who recently left the committee to pursue other ventures.  First, Mr.President, I would like to say a few words about Chris Campbell, a longtime friend and trusted adviser, who until recently served as the Republican staff director on the committee. Last summer, he was nominated and confirmed to serve as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial  I have known Chris for more than 17 years, and I cannot overstate his importance and contributions to my years of work here in the Chris joined my campaign for President back in 2000, where I immediately recognized his talent and leadership abilities and appointed him to be my national field director, although he was relatively young and inexperienced at the time. Needless to say, I don't blame Chris for how that particular campaign turned out. In fact, that same year, I asked him to serve as director for my Senate reelection campaign, which thankfully met with much better results. After that, he came to Washington to serve on my staff on the Senate Judiciary Committee.[[Page S90]]  I have long urged my staffers to get as much education as possible to enhance their understanding and gain new perspectives. I nagged Chris about this during my Presidential campaign. Eventually, after working on my staff for a few years, he wanted to upgrade his bachelor's degree in political science from the University of California at Santa Barbara with an MBA from the Thunderbird School of Global  A short time after receiving his MBA and a brief stint in the private sector, Chris desired to return to public service, and when he returned to Washington, I hired him back without hesitation and asked him to serve as my legislative director, a post he held until 2011 when I took over as the lead Republican on the Finance Committee and appointed him to be the staff director.  During his time on the committee staff, Chris quarterbacked every major effort we undertook. This includes successes like the approval of free-trade agreements, the bipartisan renewal of trade promotion authority and the modernization of U.trade laws, the repeal and replacement of the Medicare sustainable growth rate, and the long-term funding of the Federal highway trust fund, just to name a few.  Of course, his work on the long-term tax reform effort was invaluable. We began our work on tax reform right out of the gate in 2011 and worked with Chairman Baucus and others to drive it forward. Chris was a key part of all of the work we did over the years to advance tax reform. While his move to Treasury came just before the final stages of that effort, I was fortunately able to benefit from his continued advice and counsel as we moved closer to and eventually crossed the finish line.  Chris is a shrewd but effective negotiator and a brilliant legislative strategist. Congressional Quarterly named him one of the seven most influential non-elected people working in Congress, and Roll Call put him on its list of the 50 most influential staffers on Capitol Hill for 7 straight years. Clearly, I am not the only one who recognizes his abilities. I know the other members of the Finance Committee--on both sides of the aisle--have also acknowledged and benefited from his years of work.  Still, even with all of his accomplishments, what stands out most to me about Chris Campbell is his life story. He is a great example of how hard work and education can help a person become much more than what some statistician might predict. Chris grew up in Hemet, CA, as one of six children who struggled--and that is putting it lightly--to make ends meet. He didn't grow up with family connections or powerful benefactors, but thanks to his diligence and determination and no shortage of natural ability, he became one of the most effective and influential staffers on Capitol Hill, and he now serves in a key leadership role in the administration.  While it pained me to see him head off to Treasury, I have been comforted to know that the President knows how to pick the best people and that the Department of the Treasury is being well served.  I personally want to thank Chris for his years in working with me, for his candid and thoughtful advice, and for his commitment to public service. I wish him all the best in his future endeavors, which I am quite sure will be just as successful as his time here.                         Tribute to Becky Shipp  Mr.President, I would like to say a few words about another former staffer, Becky Shipp, who also left the Finance Committee staff a few months ago to pursue another venture.  While I have known Becky for more years than either she or I would like to count, I can tell you that she served tirelessly on the Senate Finance Committee for more than 10 years. She saw chairmen come and go and was an institution here in her own right.  In my time on the Hill, I have come to know many different staffers, all of whom got involved in the government for all types of well-meaning and patriotic reasons. They each have some expertise, some interest, and some motivation that helps them get through the hard times that staff encounter with the stressful conditions and the below-market pay.  I have long said that Senators and staff take on sacred obligations when we come to work here, and I cannot think of many who have taken that sacred obligation to heart more than Becky She spent her time in Congress working on welfare and human resource issues. Her dedication and zealousness in defending the less fortunate should serve as an example to all of us.  While issues surrounding child welfare, child and family services, and foster care programs are often overlooked, anyone in Washington who knows anything about these issues knows that Becky has played a singular role in the creation and preservation of the safety net we now have in place. Too often, welfare issues become bitterly partisan, but during Becky's time here, she always strove to find common ground no matter the personal sacrifice.  Her time on the Hill was extremely productive and impacted far more children and families than most any of us could probably ever count. Still, it was not without moments that, when looking back, seemed pretty lighthearted. One such moment came just a few years ago after many in Congress had become aware of the fact that welfare funds distributed through electronic bank transfers had been used by some to purchase alcohol, food, or other illicit items from strip clubs and other less than savory establishments. Becky quietly began developing a proposal to prevent this type of abuse. Eventually, her idea gained more traction than she thought it would initially.  Once members of the Finance Committee and in the House began to realize the nature of this problem, her proposal caught on like wildfire. The problem was that the Social Security Act did not have a definition for these establishments. After quite a bit of wrangling and putting herself in the shoes of some of the more seedy clientele and business owners, Becky developed a definition, more or less, from scratch. Specifically, the bill, now a Federal statute, prohibited the distribution of Federal welfare funds at ``any retail establishment which provides adult-oriented entertainment in which performers disrobe or perform in an unclothed state for entertainment.'' Now, many have chuckled at the specificity of that definition and at the fact that someone, somewhere had to come up with and write down that type of legal terminology, but Becky was not playing a joke or trying to be facetious; she was addressing a legitimate concern. That story, to me, epitomizes the type of person Becky Shipp is and the type of congressional staffer she was when she worked in the  I am quite certain that, even in her new endeavors, Becky will remain committed to promoting the same type of no-nonsense, proper governance, with an equal eye toward helping those in need to find meaningful work, care, and assistance. While Becky's work ethic, persistence, and friendliness have already been missed on the Finance Committee, I am quite certain that she will continue to do many great things and help many more people.  I personally thank Becky for her years of service and for all that she has done for me, for others in the Senate, and for those in our country who have been in need of a helping hand.                      Tribute to Preston Rutledge  Finally, Mr.President, I want to say a few words about Preston Rutledge, my former tax counsel who was recently nominated and confirmed to serve as Assistant Secretary of Labor for the Employee Benefits Security  Preston began his career in public service as a teenager when he worked in the national forests. Later, he served honorably as an officer in the U.After graduating from law school, he was a law clerk on the Fifth Circuit of the U.Court of Appeals and spent more than a decade working at the IRS, focusing on tax-exempt organizations and employee benefits.  He came to the Finance Committee about 7 years ago. During that time, he worked on a number of issues that many people, quite frankly, consider to be tedious or mundane, but Preston is an expert on these issues, and he has always taken great pleasure in the issues and work before him.  As a staffer, Preston was, more than anything, committed to advancing reforms to our Nation's pension and savings programs in order to ensure a stable and reliable retirement savings system. Toward that end, he was a lead[[Page S91]]staffer in the drafting and passage of key pieces of pension and savings legislation, including the Retirement Enhancement and Savings Act, which provided a number of key reforms to our Nation's retirement savings system, and the ABLE Act, which provided savings enhancements for children with disabilities and their families.  Preston's knowledge of tax policy and ERISA issues is unsurpassed. I was not the only one to benefit from and rely upon his expertise. Indeed, the entire Finance Committee relied on Preston whenever these types of issues came up because, once again, there just aren't many people in Washington with that particular focus and expertise.  I wish Preston good luck in his new position at the Labor Department and thank him for the work he performed on the committee. I am confident his expertise, as well as his open-minded and inclusive approach, will help improve the situations of workers and families across the country. I can think of no one more capable to serve in this important capacity.  As you can see, I have been fortunate to have worked with some excellent staffers in recent years--well, really throughout my whole service in the That has been true of my entire time at the  Of course, I have many great staffers still working in the Senate, both in the Finance Committee and in my personal office. I am grateful for each of them as well. I am very fortunate to have them with me as we have some important work ahead of us.  The Finance Committee's current workload is, quite honestly, mind-boggling. There is much to do over the next several months. I will have more to say on that in the coming days. For now, I will simply say, I look forward to working with my colleagues and staff on the vitally important tasks that lie ahead.  With that, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.  ",CREC-2018-01-09-pt1-PgS89-2.txt,1351,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2018.0,9.0,January
816,topic-id,330,"Mr.President, today I wish to pay tribute to a remarkable man whose smile and beautiful soul touched the lives of everyone he met. Matthew Hillyard passed away peacefully at his family home on January 4, 2018, to the grief of not only his family and close friends but to everyone who knew him in the Utah  Matt, the loving son of Lyle and Alice Hillyard, was born with Down syndrome. His parents were told he would not live past adolescence; yet he defied the odds and packed a lot of life into 42 years on Matt never let his disability define him; instead, he shared his special light with everyone who caught his eye.

He made friends with people from all walks of life--be they legislators, security guards, or schoolchildren visiting the capitol. Matt's smile and his big hugs were legendary, and people would often line up to be the recipient of his affection.  I had the privilege of enjoying Matt's hugs and greetings on many occasions, and I never left his side without feeling I had been in the presence of a truly remarkable son of our Heavenly Legislative bodies across our country would be well-served with the steady presence of someone like Matt, a kind soul who gives love and unwavering friendship to all.  I believe there is a special place in Heaven for Matt, who personified the pure love of He lived a life of sweet innocence, friendship, and love. His warm embrace and sweet smile will be greatly missed by all.

1077,topic-id,740,"Mr.President, earlier this month, I announced that my current term of service would be my last. Since then, many of my colleagues have asked how I feel with my Senate tenure drawing to a close. I think many expect me to say that I feel an overwhelming sense of satisfaction and relief. If anything, the decision to retire has imbued me with a sense of urgency that I have never felt before.  With a year left in office, I have an agenda that is as ambitious as ever,[[Page S157]]and the ticking shot clock is a constant reminder of just how much I have left to accomplish. Just 168 legislative days remain in my Senate term, and I can assure you that those 168 days will be among the proudest and the most productive periods in all my public service.  Anyone who thought Orrin Hatch would coast quietly into his golden years clearly doesn't know me. The stars have aligned for this year to be one of my most successful yet. So don't expect me to go gentle into that good night. Expect me to be right here on the Senate floor, early and often, pushing the most critical reforms of this Expect me to take the lead on a Finance Committee agenda that will equal in ambition our accomplishments of 2017. Expect me to be the same steady presence in this body that I have been for the last 41 years.  Above all, expect a flurry of legislative activity from my office. I have a dedicated staff. They are determined to drive this old workhorse into the ground. And I have arguably the best working relationship with this President of anyone on Capitol Add to this the advantages that accrue from a lifetime of legislative experience and bipartisan dealmaking.  The point I wish to make is simple: In legislative terms, my final year could well be the most fruitful yet, and I hope it will be.  In the months ahead, I am eager to capitalize on our tax reform victory by putting the Nation back on the path to fiscal sustainability, finding a way forward on immigration, and securing long-term funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program--a program that I helped put into law and have been very pleased with over the years. I also intend to update our intellectual property laws for the 21st century, enact key fixes to our higher education system, and fill our courts with as many qualified judges as possible. Likewise, I look forward to working with my colleagues across the aisle to improve the competitiveness of our workforce, strengthen digital privacy, and blaze new trails on medical marijuana research.  But this brief overview doesn't cover even half of my agenda for 2018, nor does it include some of the legislative surprises I plan for later this year. The virtue of being a seven-term Senator with a reservoir of good will is that you have a little bit of latitude in your final year. That is why my plan is to go big and to go bold, because unless you are Michael Jordan, you retire only once, so you might as well make the most of it.  The truth is, I put the pieces in place long ago to ensure that my final year in office would be a legislative knockout, so no one should count me out, not for a single second, and anyone who does should be reminded that I can do in just a few months what it takes most a decade to complete. Tough old birds like me don't have lameduck years; we just dig in and get tougher. For me, 2018 is not a victory lap but a sprint to the finish, and I plan to finish strong. I look forward to working with all of you until the very end.  With that, I just want to say how much I love the Senate, how much I love my colleagues on both sides of the floor, how much I have enjoyed working with all of you over all these years and will enjoy this remaining year hopefully even more. I hope I can do some things that will be very beneficial to our country, to all of us, and that will help us all feel better about our service here and help us all strive to do better together.

563,topic-id,627,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to say ``pause,'' take a step back, reject the rule, and give ourselves a chance to, frankly, do it better.  FISA reauthorization is inarguably one of the most consequential votes we will take in this Congress because the constitutional stakes are so high. Civil liberties are the core of our Bill of Rights, and we are asked to take action that affects them in the name of keeping us safe. I get that.  But it is critical that we get it right. I think we can do better. To make decisions of this magnitude, we should have the most robust process possible, full and open debate, and input from the stakeholders, thoughtful deliberations by the The process for this bill thus far has decidedly not been that, has not been great. It was written and rewritten in secret and with minimal debate or stakeholders' input.  But--this is a big but--I am actually optimistic because I have seen a change in the last few days and I think we have an opportunity here. The administration is suddenly engaged, and we are seeing vibrant debate from stakeholders in the technology sector, civil liberties advocates. Members have had very serious discussions, including here on the floor today, but in the Halls, offering amendments to rules, unfortunately, which are not being allowed--save one.  We are being asked to shut all that down, that opportunity, and push through an extension that will run for 6 years. Frankly, stop and think: 6 years in the world of technology is an eternity.[[Page H110]]  So, for all these reasons, I ask my fellow Members to join me in opposing this rule and, instead, allow the House an opportunity to work its will, to take a little more time, and to do it better because we really do need to wrestle with privacy, with what privacy means in a world where our entire personal lives are stored somewhere online as ones and zeros. Frankly, that is happening at an even faster pace than it is now.  We need to debate how the Fourth Amendment protects us against search and seizures applying to our digital records. We are all being rendered into nothing but a massive storehouse of ones and zeros.  The tensions or balance between civil liberties and national security is a debate as old as this country, but they are not mutually exclusive. They are hard--they are darn hard--but they are not mutually exclusive and they are not impossible.  I know well how many threats we face around the world and I don't take them lightly. The fact that we have not faced another major terrorist attack since 9/11 is a testament to the skill and the hard work of the intelligence community, and I tip my hat to them. I am absolutely committed to giving them the tools they need to keep us safe, consistent with our constitutional rights.  But we live in an era of the most powerful spying tools the world has ever known. Twenty-five years ago conversations were ephemeral. They were conducted in person or over the phone. But now they occur over email or chat and they are archived forever. Our medical, financial, and legal records are all online; so are our photos. Our cell phones track us everywhere we go.  The data available on us is unprecedented, and the fundamental principle of the Bill of Rights is that we have the right to keep our data private. We need new safeguards to ensure that.  So, by rejecting this rule, we have a chance to do it better. In so doing, both keep us safe and protect our constitutional rights.  For these reasons, Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject the rule.  ",CREC-2018-01-10-pt1-PgH103.txt,2040,TRUMP ADMINISTRATION DECLARES WAR ON STATE LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA,2018.0,10.0,January

Immigrant communities have long helped write the economic, social, and cultural story of my home State of New Mexico and, for that matter, the entire That is certainly true for Dreamers, undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as children and are vital members of communities across New  Over the years, I have had the privilege of meeting many of New Mexico's estimated 7,000 I have met with students who grew up here and are now striving to become doctors, scientists, teachers, and even serve in our military. These young people are our children's classmates. They are our next-door neighbors. They are our colleagues. They are family members, and many are truly rising stars. In fact, I would argue that these Dreamers are the future of a great  Every day these young people add to the strength of our economy, to the vitality of our country. More than 97 percent of DACA recipients are in school or in the workforce.  The DACA Program allowed them to work legally, to get driver's licenses, to go to college, to serve in our military and give back to their communities. DACA helped almost 70 percent of recipients secure a job with better pay, and better pay leads to real investments in our communities and our economy.  After their DACA applications were approved, nearly two-thirds of recipients reported buying their first car, and almost one in six reported buying a new home. DACA recipients also paid billions of dollars in Federal, State, and local taxes. Why on Earth would[[Page S119]]we kick out these contributors to our economy and our country?  The economic impact of removing nearly 700,000 workers from the U.workforce would be staggering. It would cost our economy nearly half a trillion dollars in GDP loss over the next decade. But passing the Dream Act could add an estimated $281 billion to the U.economy over the next 10 years. That, to me, sounds like putting America first.  I stand with these Dreamers, and I always have. One of my first actions when I was in the House of Representatives was to sign on as an original cosponsor of the Dream Act, which would create a pathway to legal status and citizenship for Dreamers who pursue higher education or serve our Nation in uniform. This commonsense, compassionate, and responsible policy is long overdue for a generation of young  Since President Trump made the heartless decision to end DACA, I have held his administration accountable for their mishandling of renewal applications for DACA recipients. My office has assisted Dreamers in New Mexico through the DACA renewal process and is actively participating in meetings with communities and local advocacy groups throughout the  I introduced legislation to safeguard Dreamers' private information, such as addresses and telephone numbers, so the Trump administration can't use those to target them or their families for deportation.  When my office learned that the Department of Homeland Security had arbitrarily rejected hundreds of renewal applications that arrived late because they were delayed by the Postal Service, I pressed the administration to take immediate action to reverse its decision. I am pleased to say that Dreamers whose applications were rejected due to Postal Service delays were allowed to resubmit their renewals for In fact, just last week, the first two DACA recipients in New Mexico, who brought this to my attention with the help of Catholic Charities, were told that they could move forward with their DACA renewal applications.  President Trump's decision means that until Congress passes the Dream Act, these young members of our communities still face deep uncertainty about whether they will be able to stay in school, keep working and contributing to our economy, and remain in the Nation that they call home.  Congress must pass the Dream Act now. Threatening to deport these young people who grew up in America and want to contribute to their Nation will not fix our broken immigration system. Making the American people foot the bill to build an unnecessary and wasteful border wall--which families in New Mexico's border communities have told me they do not want nor do they need--will not fix our broken immigration system.  President Trump and congressional Republicans wasted an entire year trying to take away American's healthcare and then rushing through tax breaks for the superwealthy in the final weeks of the year. By squandering an entire year, they pushed Dreamers aside and put their lives in jeopardy.  I voted to fund the government through the holidays in hopes that Congress could finally reach an agreement to pass the Dream We also urgently need to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program, fix wildfire disaster funding, provide disaster relief for Puerto Rico, which is still recovering from Hurricane Taking care of these long-neglected and bipartisan priorities is the bare minimum of governance. Republican leaders in Congress need to take this opportunity seriously, especially if they expect our support.  I will be fighting every step of the way to pass the Dream Act, and I encourage all of my colleagues to do the same.  Since President Trump shamefully pulled the rug out from under Dreamers when he hastily ended the DACA Program, I have spent time meeting with Dreamers in New Mexico, as well as here in You cannot hear their stories without realizing how morally bankrupt the administration's current policy is. It is impossible for me to convey the desperation and the fear they are feeling every day that passes without our passing the Dream  Now is the time to give these young Americans a permanent place in this great Enough is enough. Their patience has worn thin with the President and congressional Republicans using them as political bargaining chips. It is immoral to play politics with the lives of these young  I will say it again. Congress absolutely must pass the Dream Act, and we have an opportunity to do it now.  We should not stop once we pass the Dream Leaders in Congress have waited far too long to finally address our Nation's overall broken immigration system. I still continue to believe that our Nation urgently needs Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform, which includes a visa program that meets the needs of our economy. It is a tough but fair path to earn citizenship for the estimated 11 million people in our country who are undocumented and a plan that ensures community safety and security at our borders.  When I think about immigration, I always wonder how different my own life would be if America had turned my father away when he immigrated here as a young boy. Our Nation's enduring spirit has been built by the hard work and the dreams of so many striving young immigrants like my father in the 1930s and like so many Dreamers today. No Member of Congress should be able to rest until Dreamers are able to rest easy, knowing they will be able to stay and to contribute to literally the only Nation they have ever called home.

996,topic-id,990,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the Chair for the opportunity to address the House this afternoon.  Beginning in 2013, I began discussing how our economic recovery was subpar in comparison to post-World War II recoveries. That is, in part, due to, as I argued, the wet blanket of the avalanche of new regulatory costs imposed by the previous administration.  Since Congress has a poor track record of regularly enacting all of our appropriations bills, funding the government, and directing agency priorities, the administrative state, that unelected portion of our government, has expanded in authority and filled that void.                              {time}  1215  The House turned a corner this year, Mr.Speaker, by passing all 12 spending bills, fully vetted through our committees, prior to September 30, 2017. Sadly, only the first time since 2010. Further, it has been more than 21 years since Congress has passed all 12 funding bills and had them signed into law before the start of a new fiscal year.  Likewise, the Supreme Court, in their case, Chevron U.S.v. the Natural Resources Defense Council, back in 1984, set up a concept now referred to as the ``Chevron deference.'' This, too, has empowered the unelected, Big Government Washington authorities deferring to their authority, rather than the People's This has further emasculated the Article I powers of the I disagree with this concept of Chevron deference. Before he died, Justice Scalia regretted his defense of Chevron deference and said that it, in fact, ``contravened separation of powers.''  This combination of the Chevron deference and the lack of the regular, predictable oversight and appointments have resulted in this wet blanket of a growing leviathan of a centralized Federal power, negating State authorities protected under the 10th Amendment and curbing freedom for our families and individuals.  Noted New York lawyer and author, Philip Howard, calls this ``The Rule of Nobody.'' In the 2014 book, Howard argues that our administrative state is wearing people out. The process is devoid of human judgment and common sense.  Many of us, in the Congress, are pushing back insisting, like in the VA Accountability Act, that--a shocking idea--bad employees should be fired and, through the public oversight of our committees or in my own Golden Fleece Awards, that we demand accountability of the personnel of the Federal Government and commonsense in the application of our policies.  Howard recalls the U.Open golf championship, back in 2011, out in Bethesda, Maryland, when county officials shut down a children's lemonade stand near the course because it didn't have a vendor's license, Mr.This mindless, box-checking approach is not limited just to the beltway's Federal mandates.  So enters President Trump, our new Last year, I wrote then-President-elect Trump asking him to create a regulatory relief task force to address the overly burdensome regulations from our Federal agencies that, in my view, have hurt, over the past decade, our economic growth, our job growth, our productivity, and, hence, our wage growth.  In February of 2017, President Trump ordered Federal agencies to create a regulatory reform task force to identify rules within their agency that needed elimination or modification.  I rise today to recognize the improvements in the regulatory process in the past year and the significant reductions in cost to the economy, as a result, and I commend the new administration for seeking to continue this momentum into 2018, with the recent release of its regulatory plan and agenda for 2018.  As Phil Howard has demonstrated, and we experience daily, the Federal administrative state is lacking in accountability. It is not just vast and costly; it is unnecessarily intrusive into the everyday lives of hardworking  In Arkansas, we have seen agency regulations that have had devastating economic impacts on our farmers, small businesses, nonprofits, schools, colleges, universities, and State agencies.  President Trump set the proper tone for reining in this regulatory state by issuing an executive order, in the first 10 days of taking office, directing agencies to eliminate two existing regulations for each new one issued. Common sense.  In 2017, Federal agencies have withdrawn or delayed 1,579 planned regulatory actions, leading to over $8 billion in lifetime net cost savings.  In 2018, the Trump administration plans to raise the bar by issuing 448 deregulatory actions and 131 regulatory actions, a better than 3 to 1 ratio, resulting in more than $9 billion in lifetime costs savings for the economy.  This chart shows the annual cost of new regulations reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget every year, beginning in 2009. You can see the wet blanket that I described growing between 2009 and 2012. But you can see, in the last column, 2017, that there is actually a decline: a $570 million reduction in the cost of new regulations proposed by  During 2017, here in Congress, we have passed 13 congressional review acts, 11 of which President Trump signed into law this year. By repealing these 11 damaging, large rules, the economy will save some $10 billion over the next 20 years.  These savings and cuts put the control back in the hands of the American people and ensure more accountability and much-needed transparency to the rulemaking process is assured, while providing that local businesses, local farmers, and communities have relief.  Also, we are working with the administration to rightsize regulatory costs through the use of cost-benefit analysis and asserting our Article I oversight authority. Thus, Congress is working, through our committee process, also, to lower and remove the costs and burden of that wet blanket of an overburdened regulatory state.  Naturally, this cost benefit work must be done responsibly by balancing labor and capital, clean air and water, energy security, clean energy, future safe banks, and protected consumers. All that is the responsibility of our elected Members in the House and Senate and their oversight of the executive.  I commend President Trump for cutting the red tape in Washington and giving control back to our States, local communities, and hardworking taxpayers.

Although Coptic Christians have repeatedly been victims of numerous attacks from terrorist groups and extremists, it has been most disturbing to me to learn of the attacks carried out against Copts and Christian churches that are carried out by their fellow  On December 22, 2017, just after Friday prayers, dozens of Egyptian Muslims assaulted a Coptic Christian church south of Cairo in an act that started out as a demonstration. While unsanctioned by the Egyptian Government, this church had been holding services for some 15 years.  According to reports, the individuals called for the church's demolition, destroyed its contents, and assaulted those worshipping inside. Based on similar attacks, it is unlikely, Mr.Speaker, that the Egyptian Government will hold those perpetrators accountable for this egregious action.  This is just the most recent example of the ongoing trend of assaults on Copts, their churches, and their property.  I believe that many of us in Congress were pleased to see Egyptian President el-Sisi join Coptic Pope Tawadros II in participating in last Saturday's Orthodox Christmas mass at the recently opened Nativity of Christ Cathedral in Egypt's new administrative capital east of  President el-Sisi's words of tolerance and hope are appreciated by all those who respect peace for all those who live in Egypt and all who favor religious freedom across the globe.  However, while President el-Sisi spoke words of tolerance, there are, in my view, greater actions that both he and the Egyptian Government can take to protect the rights of Egyptian Christians seeking merely to raise their families, pursue their work, respect their leaders, and love their ancient nation.  For this reason, I introduced 673 to urge continued progress in religious tolerance in this very important country. There are many constructive steps that will enhance tolerance, provide better security for Christians, and improve the education and opportunities for all  My colleagues and I offer this resolution because of our long friendship and partnership with We are partners in regional peace efforts, regional economic growth, and in our mutual desire to defeat militant terrorist groups and nations and those who finance them.  President el-Sisi has set the right tone at the top level of his government, and I believe he has a respectful partnership with the leadership of the Copts and other Christians in  But that respect and the resulting legal protections must be passed down to all levels of government and society because the streets, sadly, tell a different story.  The Egyptian people are a proud people with an extraordinary civilization, and I believe this is a great opportunity for Egypt to emphasize the importance that Copts can play in Egyptian society as full Egyptian citizens.  As Coptic Pope Tawadros II told me on my visit to Cairo, all Egyptians, Muslim and Christian, take their water from the  Egypt is an essential partner in the efforts toward a lasting peace between Israel and her neighbors and in the fight against terrorism and violent extremism.  President el-Sisi told me on two occasions how important counterterrorism is to the Egyptian It is their number one concern, without any doubt, and I commend the President for his partnership with the United States, and especially with Israel, in the field of counterterrorism.  With ISIS carrying out two terrorist attacks last year in Egypt within a month of each, in November and December, that killed Muslims and Christians, the Egyptian Government's concerns about terrorism are legitimate and real.  However, in my view, I do not believe Egypt's march toward modernization and progress and focusing on counterterrorism should come at the cost of sacrificing advances in human rights, education, and religious freedom.

808,topic-id,1088,"Mr.President, every Member of this body is only a few generations removed from the immigrant experience. At some point in the recent past, each of our ancestors made the courageous decision to leave his home in search of a better life in Each of them took a risk. They didn't know what awaited them in this country, but they believed that through their own hard work and determination, they could succeed.  My mother took a huge risk when she brought my brothers and me to this country. Leaving her entire family behind, she packed our belongings into one suitcase, and we set sail for We grew up poor, but Mom worked so hard every day to build a life for us in this country. She worked minimum-wage jobs with no health insurance. We moved apartments and schools every few years. Eventually, we were able to bring my grandparents to Hawaii from So I understand as an immigrant how important family unification is to immigrant families.  I share my story not because I think it is particularly extraordinary but because it is a story that millions of families in our country share. The same hopes that drove my mom to risk everything to bring us to America are reflected in the stories of millions of immigrant families across the country, and they are reflected in the lives of Dreamers, whose futures are now at risk because of the President's decision to end the DACA  More than 15,000 young people have already lost their protection from deportation as a result of the President's decision, and 122 more will lose DACA protection every single day. It was with this sense of urgency in mind that I joined a bipartisan group of my colleagues at the White House yesterday to find a path forward to protect the The President took great pains to appear reasonable and eager to make a deal, but we left yesterday's meeting without much clarity about where he stood.  Only a few days ago, the President threatened to hold Dreamers hostage until he got $18 billion to build the wall. I would call that his vanity project. In response to my question at yesterday's meeting, the President appeared to demonstrate some flexibility on this issue, but after the Freedom Caucus spent yesterday afternoon warning of a potential betrayal on so-called ``amnesty,'' the President reaffirmed in a tweet his hard-line position that funding for the wall must be part of any deal on  Between insisting on building an unnecessary wall, demonizing family reunification, and peddling misinformation about the diversity visa lottery, the President lost track of what is really at stake here--the inspiring young people whose lives he has left hanging in the balance.  Before the holidays, it was heartening to see so many Dreamers from all across the country taking direct action in the halls of Congress to fight for their futures. I spoke with a number of these young people, like Victor from Houston, who traveled for days to make his voice heard in  Victor's parents were seasonal farmworkers who traveled to the strawberry fields of Florida every year. They settled down in Houston and saved money for a car and an apartment. They sent for Victor and his sister when he was only 4 years old.  Victor spent most of his childhood not even knowing his immigration status. It wasn't until he came home one day with a permission slip to join his middle school class on a trip to Spain that his mom told him that he was undocumented. Learning what it meant to be undocumented--that if he traveled to Spain he couldn't come home--was really hard for Victor, but he tried to put it from his mind.  As the years passed, it got harder for Victor to grapple with his status. He loved going to school, but he knew as an undocumented immigrant that his options after he graduated from high school were limited. He developed depression, and his grades suffered. But a few months after graduation, President Obama created the DACA Program, and Victor successfully applied for it.  Victor told me that even though he had DACA, he was still too afraid to talk about his status with anyone. During the 2016 election, this changed. He confronted his friends who voted for Donald Trump and shared what losing DACA would mean for him.  On September 5, Victor knew there would be an announcement about his future. He put his phone away and started cleaning his house to distract him from what was about to happen. Eventually he ran out of distractions and sat down to watch Attorney General Jeff Sessions' DACA announcement. Victor began to cry. In the days that followed, Victor started having panic attacks--sometimes as many as five to seven per day. He was afraid to get in the car because he didn't want to hurt anyone if he got a panic attack while driving. A few weeks later, Victor showed up for his first United We Dream event in There he met fellow Dreamers and allies committed to fighting for him. He told me that it was amazing to see so many people show up in support and solidarity.  Victor made himself a promise that once the Dream Act passes, he is going to go back to school to study psychology so that he can help LGBT youth like him. Before he left, Victor said something really insightful. He said that it is really important for people to come out of the shadows to tell their stories because once you tell your story, then they can no longer demonize you.  I couldn't agree more.  Fighting to protect Dreamers is about much more than the law. It is about compassion and basic human decency. Late last night, Dreamers won a temporary reprieve when a district court judge in San Francisco issued a preliminary injunction to reinstate the DACA Program for existing enrollees. The judge said that ending DACA in the way the administration ended it was arbitrary and capricious. This was an important victory, for now. It is just a temporary injunction, a temporary reprieve. So I agree with my Democratic leader that we cannot allow this decision to make us think that we are out of the woods, not at all. It cannot dim our resolve to pass the Dream The fight continues.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

1082,topic-id,1551,"Mr.President, I have been consistently voting against cloture motions to proceed to debate on judicial nominations, and I would like to take this opportunity to explain why. The Senate has a constitutional obligation to provide advice and consent on judicial nominees, and I take this obligation very seriously.  The American people depend on the Senate to fully consider and vet each judicial nominee because throughout the course of their lifetime appointment, judges will issue rulings and opinions that touch each of our lives. The process of nominating, considering, and confirming judges should be a deliberate one. Its purpose should not be to confirm as many judges as quickly as possible. Senators should be able to provide input on who should sit on the Federal bench; Senators should have an adequate opportunity to hear from third-party experts about the records and qualifications of each nominee; and Senators should have enough time to question and examine a nominee during a confirmation hearing.  Insisting on a deliberate and comprehensive process is not, as some of my Republican colleagues might argue, an effort to deny the President his prerogative to nominate judges to lifetime appointments to the Federal bench. Instead, this process is essential in determining whether each nominee is qualified for the job and can separate their personal ideology from the decisions he or she renders. For a lifetime appointment to the Federal bench, this shouldn't be too much to ask.  Over the past year, we have observed a number of concerning issues in the nomination and confirmation process for Federal judges that need to be corrected. The President has essentially outsourced the judicial selection process to two organizations with strong, ideologically driven agendas--the Federalist Society and the Heritage  The Federalist Society, for example, describes itself as ``a group of libertarians and conservatives dedicated to reforming the legal order.'' This is a group that has supported legal efforts to undermine environmental protection, erode the constitutional right to choose, and blur the lines between church and  The Heritage Foundation describes its mission as one to ``promote conservative public policies.'' Over the past few years alone, this organization, this group, has fought to undermine the Affordable Care Act, oppose LGBTQ rights, and erode the ability of Federal agencies to issue lifesaving regulations. It is not unreasonable to assume that these organizations, through their close association with the White House, expect their ideologically driven agendas to be reflected in the nominees they recommend.  While I concur with Justice Rehnquist's assertion that no judge joins a court tabula rasa, or as a blank slate, we should have a baseline expectation that lifetime appointees should be able to render justice free from their own personal ideologies. At the same time as the Trump administration relies more heavily on the Federalist Society and Heritage Foundation to select its judicial nominees, it is devaluing the work done by the American Bar The ABA has reviewed and vetted judicial nominees in a nonpartisan manner for over 60 years. With the exception of George Bush and now Donald Trump, Presidents in both parties have consulted with the ABA prior to officially nominating to the bench.  President Obama, for example, provided a great demonstration for how this process should work. Working closely with the ABA, President Obama routinely submitted potential candidates for scrutiny prior to their formal nomination. After conducting their independent, nonpartisan reviews, the ABA issued ``not qualified'' ratings for 14 candidates who had been proposed by President President Obama followed the ABA's recommendation and did not formally nominate any candidates rated ``not qualified.''  Under President Trump, on the other hand, we no longer wait for the ABA to complete its assessment of nominees prior to a nomination hearing itself, much less before the nomination. We no longer have an opportunity to review the ABA's report and, in many cases, do not have the chance to question an ABA representative at a nomination hearing about its review of the nominee.  We have seen the serious consequences of this change in practice in two high-profile nominations this year.  Despite having never tried a case, President Trump nominated Brett Talley to serve the District Court for the Middle District of Mr.Talley was nominated, given a hearing, and listed for a Judiciary Committee vote before the ABA could even finish its evaluation. Given his complete lack of qualifications for the job, it wasn't[[Page S162]]surprising that the ABA unanimously rated him ``not qualified.'' Because he was rushed through the nomination process, we only learned later that Mr.Talley failed to disclose that his wife works in the White House Counsel's office. After two Republicans on the committee--Senator Grassley and Senator Kennedy--expressed their opposition to Mr.Talley, he, fortunately, withdrew from consideration.  We were not so lucky with Steven Grasz, who was recently confirmed to the Eighth Mr.Grasz was nominated and scheduled for a Judiciary Committee hearing before the ABA could complete its review. By the time the ABA finished its exhaustive evaluation, during which it found him to be not qualified, Mr.Grasz was scheduled to appear before the Judiciary Committee in less than 48 hours. This was not nearly enough time to adequately address and assess the ABA's conclusion that Mr.Grasz would not be able to serve as a judge without the undue influence of his personal beliefs.  Courts are supposed to protect the rights of minorities, and it is troubling to reflect on the ABA's conclusion that Mr.Grasz would be unable to divorce his positions on issues like reproductive and LGBTQ rights from the cases he will hear on the Eighth Circuit court judges are only one step away from the U.Supreme Court and deserve to be scrutinized closely in the Judiciary Unfortunately, last year, the Judiciary Committee overrode the objections of the minority to hold four nomination hearings with more than one circuit judge nominee considered simultaneously.  To put this in some historical context, the Judiciary Committee held four such hearings in the entire 8 years Barack Obama was President, and it held each of these hearings with the consent of the Republican minority on the committee. During hearings on circuit and district court nominees, each committee member generally has only 5 minutes to question nominees--many of whom are highly controversial and deserve maximum scrutiny. Five minutes, which includes the time the nominee takes to respond, is not nearly enough time to engage in meaningful dialogue about a nominee's judicial philosophy or to examine controversial cases a nominee may have decided in the past.  The American people deserve much more as we consider lifetime appointments to the Federal bench. I am also concerned about the erosion of the blue-slip process, which has traditionally been a collaborative mechanism to enable Senators to confer with the White House on nominees from their Although there have been exceptions over the years, Presidents and Senate majorities of both parties have both respected the blue-slip process.  In 2009, the Democrats controlled the White House and had a filibuster-proof majority in the Every Senate Republican signed a letter to President Obama urging him to respect the blue-slip process. I would like to read a passage from that letter for emphasis.       Regretfully, if we are not consulted on, and approve of, a      nominee from our states, the Republican Conference will be      unable to support moving forward on that nominee.       Despite press reports that the Chairman of the Judiciary      Committee now may be considering changing the Committee's      practice of observing senatorial courtesy, we, as a      Conference, expect it to be observed even-handedly and      regardless of party affiliation. And we will act to preserve      this principle and the rights of our colleagues if it is not.       Because of the profound impact that life-tenured federal      judges can have in our society, the founders made their      appointment a shared constitutional responsibility.  This is the Republican conference asking the Democratic majority, the Democratic President, and the chair of the Judiciary Committee to observe the blue-slip process.  President Obama, and the Democratic majority at that time, upheld the blue-slip process without exception. Last year, the Judiciary Committee held a nomination hearing for David Stras to serve on the Eighth Circuit despite his not receiving two positive blue-slips from his home State This is the first time since the early years of the George Bush administration that the Judiciary Committee has held a hearing for a nominee when a home State Senator has not returned a blue slip. If the Senate proceeds to vote on and confirm Mr.Stras, it will be the first time since 1989 and only the third time in the last 100 years that a judicial nominee will be confirmed without having two positive blue slips.  I, certainly, take the chairman at his word that this was a onetime exception to the blue-slip process, but I will hold him and the President to the same standard they demanded from President Obama in 2009.  I will continue to rigorously defend the Senate's constitutional obligation to provide advice and consent on lifetime appointees to the Federal bench. Until we return to a normal process through which we can provide this kind of advice and consent, I will continue to oppose invoking cloture on any judicial nominee, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in this position.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from                          Tribute to Jeff Cook  ",CREC-2018-01-11-pt1-PgS154.txt,1844,RAPID DNA ACT OF 2017,2018.0,11.0,January

591,topic-id,410,"Mr.Speaker, what a sad state of affairs. There are scores of critically important issues that need to be considered by this House, not the least of which is funding our government. We failed to do that, and now we are confronted with a bill that is recycled, and we have added two natural resources bills on it that could have passed unanimously.  I am a big defender of Native Tribes' rights and sovereignty, and I know that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle remain committed to their sovereignty as well. This bill, however, is about undermining the National Labor Relations Act, not about Tribal sovereignty.  That act, the National Labor Relations Act, safeguards workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively. Most of my friends on the other side of the aisle are not for that. I know that. I have seen them vote that way.  No matter where you work, the basic protections for American workers, however, ought to apply. It is already[[Page H122]]settled law that the National Labor Relations Act and other worker protection laws apply to businesses even on Tribal lands outside the context of inherently governmental functions carried out by Tribal governments. This was not decided by some faceless bureaucrat. This was a court of our land that made this decision.  Instead of undermining workers' rights, this House ought to be moving forward with policies that help our workers and their families make it in America as part of a strong middle class. That means raising wages. It means making childcare more affordable. It means expanding access to opportunities like higher education, homeownership, and a secure retirement. Those are the issues that Democrats continue to be focused on.  That is not what this bill focuses on. Instead, Republicans are focused not on helping workers, but trying to pit one group, Tribes, against another group, workers. That is not what we ought to have in this country.  And they are attaching popular, noncontroversial natural resources bills to this legislation. They have nothing to do with this legislation and would pass overwhelmingly.  I am going to vote against this bill, and I hope they will bring the natural resources bills back so we can pass those, as everybody wants to do.

Secretary Mattis and his predecessors have all believed that a CR is damaging to the military's ability to move forward and plan. I would suggest to my friend, the majority leader, Mr.Speaker, that it is equally damaging to the nondefense side of the budget. Administrators and secretaries cannot plan for what resources they will have a month out, 2 months out, or until September 30 and the end of the fiscal year.

In addition, I would respectfully hope that we can pursue the policy and agreement that we made and on which Speaker Ryan was a principal on your side of the aisle and Senator Murray was the principal on our side of the aisle and reached agreement on the parity of increase--not parity of expenditures, because we spend more on defense, but parity of increase.

626,topic-id,211,"Mr.Speaker, character assassination is Donald Trump's favorite trick when people make him look bad. This month, Trump and his allies have been desperately smearing the authors of the infamous dossier, which exposes disturbing facts about Trump's Russia connections. By attacking Chris Steele and Fusion GPS, they are trying to divert attention from the damning content of the dossier and also to impugn the FBI for launching its investigation.  Here is the problem: the dossier didn't start the FBI investigation. It was a Trump policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, boasting to an Australian diplomat that Russia had stolen emails to interfere in our election. That was 2 months before those stolen emails were put online, and that smacks of collusion.  Thankfully, our Australian allies shared this information with the FBI and the investigation began. The dossier came along and corroborated what the FBI had already heard.  There is another problem with this smear campaign: It wasn't just the FBI that took the dossier seriously.

57,topic-id,1673,"Mr.President, I begin by wishing everyone a happy new year, and hopefully everyone had a great We did.  I have three observations I wish to make about 2018. First, here in Washington, we are experiencing some really frigid temperatures this week. Let me tell my colleagues that in Oklahoma, it was even colder there than it was here. That is unusual, but it was. So we experienced recordbreaking, bitter, cold weather, and it was pretty miserable, but the great, warm people of Oklahoma had a great Christmas, New Year's, and everything is good. Many parts of the country saw 2017 with the recordbreaking cold weather, and meteorologists are predicting more recordbreaking cold for the rest of the week and the beginning of next week.  I bring this up to highlight the fact that President Trump joked last week on He said: ``We could use a little bit of that good old global warming.'' I say it a little bit differently. I say: Where is global warming when we need it because we sure needed it this last week. Well, the alarmists went crazy over this. Let me explain what an alarmist is.  Alarmists believe global warming is coming due to anthropogenic gases, and the world is coming to an end. They are the ones who jumped on that, and they actually went crazy for not understanding the difference between weather and climate.  We keep saying the same thing. Every time we go through one of these periods where we experience an event again, we have the same thing that comes up, and we talk about it. Climate is always changing. We understand that. We actually had a unanimous vote on the floor of the Senate, saying, yes, climate changes; it has always changed. Historically, scripturally, there has always been change. We understand that. Anyway, I remember I have been criticized for the same thing.  My colleagues might remember, I brought a snowball here a couple of Februaries ago to show we are not experiencing climate change when it snows in February, after we have been told for decades that soon we wouldn't have any snow again.  That was really kind of a fun thing. I had some of the pages lined up, and I asked: Which one of you guys is the most athletic? It happened that the guy who raised his hand--they all pointed to him and said: He is the guy who is most athletic, and he was from So I said: I will tell you what I will do. I will take the snowball, throw it up there at the Presiding Officer, and you intercept it. If you don't intercept it, it will be a mess. He intercepted it. It was beautiful.  Sometimes people have to quit being so serious about all of this stuff and realize there are things that are happening that people need to talk about, that are for real, on point. Some might remember Al Gore made some pretty outrageous claims. Enough years have gone by, but he said that by the deadlines he pointed out, global warming was going to cause all the snow to melt on Mount I was not far from Kilimanjaro just a few weeks ago, and the snow is still there.  He said that by 2016 the Arctic would be completely melted and all the polar bears would be extinct. None of that happened. The only thing that has happened, according to an article in the New York Times, is that Al Gore has now become the first environmental billionaire. Critics were quick to jump on my case when he did that, and I had to remind them that there is a difference between weather and climate.  Those same critics are also quick to jump on weather events when it supports their cause. Whenever there is a particularly bad tornado in Oklahoma--and we have bad tornadoes in Oklahoma; I have never seen a good tornado--there are people who have witnessed them, and I am immediately asked if this will cause me to change my mind about global warming or climate change. I said: Why? Alarmists have been insisting for a long period of time that the world is coming to an end, and it is coming to an end because of global warming.  After this past hurricane season, I was repeatedly ask if I thought climate change was to blame for the tragic natural disasters. Again, I responded: You alarmists have been insisting that weather isn't climate; so why do you change your position now?  I am not surprised that we have hurricanes during hurricane season, we have tornadoes during tornado season, and we have cold and snow during the winter. That is not unique to just my State of That is all over the country and all over the world.  We hear constantly that natural disasters are getting worse. Yet, when we look at the data, there is no support for the conclusion. When category 4 Hurricane Harvey hit Texas and other Gulf States, it was the first major hurricane to make landfall in the continental United States for 12 years. The next largest gap between major hurricanes actually lasted only 8 years, and that was in the 1860s. Tornado activity has also been down in recent years, with the latest data of 2016 showing a continued low number of tornadoes across the United I might say that this is also true for my State of Since we are experiencing recordbreaking cold last week and this week in much of the country, we are once again reminded that weather is not climate.  So what is happening on the climate front? Now, keep in mind that the alarmists are the ones saying that the world is coming to an end because of global warming. They say that we all will be burned to death and temperatures are skyrocketing. Over the last couple of years, we have been told that it was the hottest year on record. We have been scolded by the jet-setting Hollywood celebrities about our carbon footprint, but, again, if we actually look at the data, there isn't support for all of this hysteria.  The Obama administration touted 2014, 2015, and 2016 as the hottest years on record. But the increases are well within the margin of error. In 2016, NOAA said the Earth warmed by 0.04 degrees Celsius, and the British Government pegged it at 0.01 However, the margin of error is 0.1 degree, not 0.01. So it is all statistically meaningless and below the doom-and-gloom temperature predictions from all the various models from consensus scientists.  Now, this is interesting. Steven Koonin was appointed Under Secretary for Science at the Department of Energy by President That was during the Obama administration. He said: ``The Obama administration relentlessly politicized science and aggressively pushed a campaign about that politicized science.'' In other words, he used that to make a case that is not true, and this comes out of his own administration.  In September 2017, University of Alabama in Huntsville climate scientists John Christy and Richard McNider published a study showing no acceleration in global warming for the last 23 years.[[Page S16]]  Their research shows that if you remove the climate effects of two volcanic eruptions and the El Nino and La Nina systems that occurred over the last 38 years, there has been no change since the early 1990s to the rate of warming and that model predictions from the IPCC are overstated by about double.  Keep in mind that the IPCC is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of the United They started this about 40 years ago, and their scientists have been completely discredited.  I remember when that took place in They had one of the big annual United Nations parties. At that time, Lisa Jackson was Obama's Administrator of the She knew I was going to go there and tell the truth to all these people.  I asked her this question on the public record. In the event that I leave town and you are going to start regulating global warming, you have to first declare that there is an urgency to this and you have to use a scientific declaration. What science will you use?  She said: We are going to use the IPCC, or the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  As luck would have it, just a matter of days after, the IPCC was totally rejected. Everyone remembers how they had been caught rigging the information in terms of weather, and it was really quite a mess.  Going back to Christy's explanation, which just came out the other day, the volcanic eruptions cooled the Earth when ash, soot, and debris entered the atmosphere and sunlight was reflected away. ``Those eruptions happened relatively early in our study period, which pushed down temperatures in the first part of the dataset, which caused the overall record to show an exaggerated warming trend.''  So we have two respected climate scientists using sound science to discredit the so-called consensus scientists. By the way, there are hundreds of other scientists out there. One of the best known is a guy from MIT named Richard He has been very outspoken on this.  So every time we hear people talking that ``there is a consensus of science,'' I think we know better. Remember that the media does not share the studies. So quite often they do not say anything about some of the failed practices being used to draw us to these conclusions. I am thankful we have a President and an administration that refuses to handcuff our economy with policies based on overblown headlines.  So while we continue to have tornadoes in May, hurricanes in the fall, and bitterly cold temperatures in the winter, we must remember that the climate has been stable over the last few decades, and we shouldn't give in to the fearmongers out there. Rather, we should focus on actual threats to American families, like the regime which calls for ``death to America'' and ``death to Israel.''                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-03-pt2-PgS13.txt,583,RAPID DNA ACT OF 2017,2018.0,3.0,January
59,topic-id,1682,"Mr.President, I mentioned that there were three things I wanted to address for this new year. The third is tax reform.  We are approaching 1 year under President Trump's administration, and we are already seeing the benefits of tax reform and cutting harmful regulations.  The comprehensive tax reform legislation passed by Congress last month will allow American families to keep more of their hard-earned money--which we had been talking about for a long time--and it will make it easier for businesses to grow and hire more hardworking people.  Already, businesses across the country--such as American Airlines, Southwest Air, Boeing, Comcast, Wells Fargo, AT&T, and Express Employment Professionals, headquartered in Oklahoma City, in my State of Oklahoma--have announced investments in their employees and businesses as a result of the tax bill.  Clearly, the tax reform will compound the economic growth we have already seen as a result of President Trump's consistent efforts to cut regulations his first year.  Following the severe economic recession of 2008 and uncertainty in the future, many companies had chosen not to invest in their business or their employees. During the Obama administration, Federal bureaucrats unleashed hundreds of regulations that increased the cost of doing business, stifling job creation, and the result was obvious.  According to a report by the Heritage Foundation, by 2015 Obama's regulations were costing taxpayers over $100 billion a year. With these limitations on job creators, it is no surprise that the average GDP growth under President Obama was just a little over 1.5 percent--no matter that previously, throughout history, in the United States it has consistently been about 3 percent.  In less than 1 year, by directing Federal agencies to delay, withdraw, or invalidate 1,600 planned regulatory actions, President Trump has done what President Obama was unable to do in 8 years; that is, to restore the confidence of the American business community. He did this by reversing the Obama regulations. I have one--in fact, I have[[Page S17]]taken the time to list these regulations that were putting people out of business.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a document entitled ``Congressional Review Act Resolutions Passed'' at the conclusion of my remarks.  There are two ways you can get rid of regulations. One way is to do it through Executive actions. I think everyone knows what that is. The more difficult way is to do it through the Congressional Review Act Resolutions; that is, the I was very proud of the first CRA that we were able to get passed. It was one that I introduced, and it was one that is very popular. It was a rule that was put in during the Obama administration that said that we were in competition with the domestic oil and gas companies with China or some other company, and we had to give to them how we put together our playbook, which would put the U.companies at a disadvantage.  We did a CRA on that, and I was very proud to do that. I think people should look at these and realize the great results we had as a result of doing away with the overregulations. I have them listed here, and this is something people are not really aware of.  On January 1, the New York Times even recognized the positive effect of the President's deregulatory agenda. This doesn't happen very often with the New York Times, but they reported on a new ``wave of optimism'' in American business.  Listen to this. The ``Trump effect''--this is what the New York Times is calling it, very appropriately, I might add--``is beginning to translate to investment in new plants, equipment, and facility upgrades that bolster economic growth.''  This is from the New York They continued by saying that with the lowest unemployment rate in 17 years, we are also seeing the ``Trump effect''--again, that is their term--on wages as businesses invest in their workforce by raising wages to keep attracting skilled employees.  This week the Wall Street Journal reported that cities like Minneapolis have seen a 4-percent wage growth in the last year--the highest growth in 6 years.  I am confident we are going to hear more success stories around the country. The proof is in the numbers. For the first two full quarters of the Trump administration, starting with the second quarter of 2017--the ones he would have control over--we have increased the GDP growth to over 3 percent. That is pretty amazing--over 3 percent. This is from the average of 1\1/2\ percent.  What is important about this is, for each 1 percent increase in economic activity, or the GDP, that translates into additional revenue coming into the government of about $3 trillion over a 10-year period. That is why, in the 1981 tax cut under Reagan, they started the year with the total revenue coming in to be $469 billion. But then, as a result of the tax reduction, the increased economic activity increased it to $750 billion. We actually increased our revenue by decreasing the individual rate.  Finally, the made-in-America economy is running at full speed again. We have three huge success stories of the Trump administration: 1, eliminating the Obama overregulations to free up businesses and, 2, reestablishing America as a leader in the free world by reversing the Obama policy of appeasement. Hiram Mann said: ``No man survives when freedom fails, the best men rot in filthy jails, and those who cry `appease, appease' are hanging by those they tried to please.'' And 3 is tax reform--the first tax reform in three decades.  With that, I want to say happy new year; 2018 is going to be great.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              Congressional Review Act Resolutions Passed       1.

62,topic-id,509,"Mr.President, one week ago today, the men and women of Iran began protesting in the streets. It began with people speaking out against a sluggish economy, and economic growth does not exist in People finally got fed up with it. Keep in mind that the country of Iran is still recognized as the financial backbone of terrorism throughout the world.  The State media in Iran has reported that over 20 individuals have died in these protests for their own freedom and over 450 have been arrested since the regime's violent crackdown against the protesters. Let's keep in mind what they are protesting for. They just want some of the freedoms they know other countries have, and right now they don't see any other way to make this happen.  In an act that defies transparency and democratic principles, the regime has shut down social media and messaging sites, limiting the flow of information about the protests. In other words, they are not letting the outside world know what is going on there. Iran clearly thinks they can get away with this flagrant disregard of human rights, and why shouldn't they? Under the Obama administration, Iran was able to violently crack down on democratic protesters in 2009, to continue ballistic missile tests in violation of U.resolutions, and to finance terrorist organizations in the region without international condemnation or repercussions. Remember, Iran is the financial backbone of terrorism in that part of the world.  Just last month we learned how the Obama administration undermined law enforcement efforts against Hezbollah's drug trafficking operations. Hezbollah is well-known to be a proxy of Everybody knows it is a terrorist organization. But rather than going after the financial backing of a known terrorist organization, Obama swept it under the rug. His focus was on creating and then protecting the flawed Iran nuclear deal--a deal Obama promised would end Iran's aggressive behavior in the region and promote reforms in Iran through economic opportunity.  The actual results of the deal have never been clearer. The ruling elite of Tehran continues their aggressive behavior by putting their nation's resources toward supporting Assad's regime in Syria, testing ballistic missiles, and committing human rights abuses against women and religious minorities. It is no wonder that freedom-loving men and women in Iran seek meaningful change.  Fortunately, President Trump has already been clear that the United States stands behind the rights of Iranian citizens for peaceful protests.  Maybe the Ayatollah doesn't recall or didn't get the message from President Trump when he was sworn in last year: Under President Trump, America is the leader of the free world again--standing up for common, human dignity and democratic values. He has backed up his support with action, weighing additional sanctions against the regime and having U.Ambassador Nikki Haley--who is doing a great job, by the way--call for emergency U.meetings to address the human rights concerns.  I support his efforts and look forward to working with the President and his administration to enact any needed sanctions against Iran in order to advance freedom and democracy.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-03-pt2-PgS16.txt,583,RAPID DNA ACT OF 2017,2018.0,3.0,January
805,topic-id,2889,"Mr.President, for about 20 years now, I have viewed the development and deployment of a layered ballistic missile defense shield as probably singularly the most vital thing we could be doing around here. People are aware of that now. Adversaries, like North Korea and others, have ballistic missiles, and they are increasing their range capability. Iran is getting almost everything. One of the problems you have is that you get countries like North Korea developing missile capabilities, and if they have it, then other adversaries have it. I am talking about Yemen and all the rest of them.  It is important for us to communicate to the American people that the[[Page S128]]threat we face is probably the most imminent threat we have had in the history of this country. Today, it is the greatest threat we have had certainly in my lifetime.  I have come to the floor and spoken on this issue in 2001, 2009, 2012, and this will be the fourth time this year. Over the last 30 years, we have witnessed the missile defense programs go through dramatic investment periods, followed by extreme starvation and cancellations--I am talking about in the United States--depending on who happens to be President at the time.  Remember, of course, when Reagan came in and people made fun of him with ``Star Wars'' and tried to defame him in any way they could. Yet he was able to be persistent and start a program, and we should be very thankful we have it today. That was followed in 1989 by President He continued that program.  However, in 1993, when President Clinton was in office, the first thing he did was to cut $2.5 billion out of the Bush missile defense budget request for fiscal year 1994. He also terminated the Reagan-Bush Strategic Defense Initiative and downgraded the National Missile Defense Program to a research and development program. He cut 5-year missile defense funding by 54 percent, from $39 billion to $18 billion.  I say this because these times are changing. Continuing with his administration in 1996, he cut the funding and slowed down the development of THAAD and the Navy Theater Wide To remind ourselves of how important that was at that time and the cuts he made to that and how critical that was, THAAD right now is the only thing we have to join forces with South Korea to be able to knock down something coming from North Korea to South The Aegis system is a defensive system that we could share with Without these systems, they would be wide open. That was 1996.  In 1999, the last of the Clinton years, he delayed by at least 2 years the Space Based Infrared System, which is a very complicated system that knocks down incoming missiles. Then, in 2000, Bush came in. By the end of 2008, President Bush had succeeded in fielding a missile defense system capable of defending all 50 One of the things he did that was most significant--and this is in the final years of his administration--was to recognize the fact that we have had ground-based interceptors in our country for a number of years. In fact, there are 44 ground-based interceptor systems. Unfortunately, they are all on the west coast because that is where we thought the threat would be. We discovered at that time, during the Bush administration, that the threat was from both sides because we recognized that Iran was developing the capabilities, as well as North Korea and others. So in order to protect Eastern United States as well as Central Europe, we had the system that was set up. It was kind of funny because I remember being there with one of our strongest allies. The system they set up was one where they had a radar system in the Czech Republic, and they had a rocket system--a ground-based interceptor--in Poland, right next door. I remember when Vaclav Klaus was the President of the Czech Republic, one of our strongest supporters, and he said to me at that time: Now, if we go ahead and put our system in the Czech Republic and in Poland, can you assure me that if we incur the wrath of Russia, we are not going to end up being embarrassed and have the rug pulled out from under us?  I said: There is not a chance in the world that would happen.  Well, that did happen. In fact, it was a total of 44 ground-based interceptors that were fielded. That was in Alaska and California, on the west coast. We went through this where they pulled the rug out from under Poland, as well as the Czech Then, in April, came our first Obama defense cuts, which began disarming America and dismantling our layered missile defense system. This is critical because we put this in for the reason that we perceived the threat to be coming in from the east as opposed to the west coast, and the very system that would have protected us was taken down by President  I would say, due to his overall reduced budget requests in defense, there were not enough Aegis ships. I already mentioned how we are using those today in defense of many of our allies, including Since Kim Jong Un took power in 2009, he has already conducted more than 80 ballistic missile tests. That is far more than his father and his grandfather conducted.  North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests of increasingly powerful weapons. The latest test was in September of last year. The major test actually came after that, and that was on November 28. On November 28, he demonstrated that he had the range of the United States and the central part of our country. In other words, it was stated by others who observed that he now has the capability of reaching any target in mainland United  There were some scientists who did an analysis of what they did on November 28. They made it very clear. David Wright, an analyst for the Union of Concerned Scientists, wrote that--this is something that happened on November 29--that yesterday's test indicates that North Korea can now hold the United States well within missile range. He said: ``Such a missile would have been more than enough range to reach Washington, DC, and in fact any other part of the continental United States.''  Here is the scary part of this. Those who are not wanting to believe that the threat is real and the threat is there are saying: Well, we don't know that the missile he demonstrated on November 28 could have reached that range if it had a full payload, a load of a nuclear warhead.  We don't know if they had one or not, but that doesn't give me much comfort. They also questioned whether or not it could sustain the reentry back into the atmosphere.  The point is that they now have that capability, and that is something we have to keep in mind as we are making decisions, because we have decisions to make, and that is what we are doing right now in trying to decide how we are going to keep the government from shutting down and develop some kind of a budget plan that is going to serve us well.                               Tax Reform  Mr.President, let me mention something else that I think is very significant because I heard today a lot of people criticizing and not really understanding what happened with the tax plan that was passed. We are already getting the results of it. It is kind of exciting. I don't recall anything in my career where we got the results as quickly as we got and we are getting right now. We heard Minority Leader Schumer call the tax plan ``a punch in the gut to the middle class.'' In an op-ed piece in the New York Times, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders said: ``The Republican agenda on health care and taxes is . . . widely disliked by the American people'' and a ``tax giveaway to the wealthy.''  I think it is important that people understand that not only is middle-class America going to benefit from this, but they already have. One million Americans are counting on receiving raises and bonuses from this tax reform. In my State of Oklahoma, thousands of employees will be receiving and have already received large compensation increases, bonuses--Express Employment Professionals in Oklahoma City, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and AT&In fact, Senator Roy Blunt was coming back on a plane, the same one I was on, and the flight attendant was talking about how she had already received a $1,000 bonus. Then, the rest of them chimed in and said: We have too.  That is already happening. Right now we have a list of 123 major corporations that have already given an average of $1,000 for every employee they have, predicated on the assumption that the tax plan is going to increase the economy, and that is exactly what is going to happen.  I am confident that this is actually happening today. I have to say this, though, because more people still try to say: Well, we can't give tax reductions to people and still increase revenue to do all of these things we need to do with our national defense and with our infrastructure programs.  That is not true.  I am going to repeat one that I have done before on this, but people seem to not understand. It is easy to say: Well, if you reduce taxes, you are going to reduce revenue.[[Page S129]]  That is not the way it works. I remember very well what happened. I was not in this position, of course, but in 1991, when Ronald Reagan was President, at that time he had the most far-reaching reduction in taxes. Remember, the top rate was reduced from 70 percent to 30 percent, and the other brackets came down proportionately. Yet at the time he did that, in 1981, the total amount of revenue coming into the United States was $469 billion. As a result of that, it increased revenue to $750 billion. That is huge, and it shows that it really happens. The reason it happens is that for each 1-percent increase in the economy, it produces increased revenue of some $3 trillion. That is what happened then, and that is what is going to happen now. People are rejoicing today.  I ask unanimous consent that a sheet that outlines all of these companies that are giving large bonuses as a result of the tax bill be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               companies increasing compensation, so far       1.

Zions Bancorp                    tax relief pays american workers       Almost immediately after Congress passed the Tax Cuts and      Jobs Act, American workers at dozens of firms began to see      the effects in the form of bonuses and raises. For supporters      of tax relief this was good news, though not altogether a      surprise. During debate over the law, economists cited      research that workers bear most of the burden of the      corporate income tax via reduced wages. The remainder is      borne by consumers and investors. A significant cut in the      corporate rate would provide real benefits to workers.       One study by scholars at the American Enterprise Institute      concluded that a 1 percent increase in the corporate tax rate      is associated with a 0.5 percent decrease in real wages. A      2007 Treasury Department survey of economic studies found      that workers ``bear a substantial burden'' of the corporate      income tax. The Congressional Budget Office concluded in 2006      that workers pay more than 70 percent of the cost of      corporate taxes.       Opponents of tax relief countered that a corporate rate cut      would help only the wealthy--a claim being knocked down more      each day. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that ``history      shows tax cuts like these benefit the wealthy and the      powerful to the exclusion of the middle class.'' As a wave of      companies across the country began announcing bonuses and      giving raises to workers, it became clear that tax relief is      putting more money in the pockets of the hard-working      Americans who Republicans said would win because of the law.       The same day the House and Senate passed the bill, December      20, AT&T issued a press release saying: ``Once tax      reform is signed into law, AT&T plans to invest an additional      $1 billion in the United States in 2018 and pay a special      $1,000 bonus to more than 200,000 AT&T U.employees--all      union-represented, non-management and front-line managers. If      the President signs the bill before Christmas, employees will      receive the bonus over the holidays.''       So far, at least 123 companies have announced they are      giving employees bonuses or otherwise increasing compensation      due to the tax cut legislation. Notable examples include:       American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and JetBlue      announced $1,000 bonuses for their employees (a total of more      than 200,000 people). American's bonuses will exclude      officers; Southwest's and JetBlue's include all employees.      American said it would pay bonuses ``in light of this new tax      structure.'' JetBlue said that ``our Crewmembers should be      the first to benefit.'' Southwest said it would put the      savings from tax relief ``to work . . . to reward our hard-     working Employees.''       AT&T announced $1,000 bonuses to its 200,000 employees. It      also said that it will increase capital expenditures by $1      billion in 2018.       Comcast announced a $1,000 bonus for more than 100,000      employees. In addition, it plans to invest $50 billion in its      infrastructure in the next five years. Comcast said the      bonuses are ``[b]ased on the passage of tax reform and the      FCC's action on broadband.''       Nationwide Insurance announced a $1,000 bonus for 29,000      employees and increased 401(k) matching. The company told its      employees: ``The combination of the new tax legislation,      including a reduced corporate tax rate, and our associates'      ongoing commitment to our members, community and On Your Side      promise are the reasons we're making this investment that      further enhances the already robust benefits we offer to      attract and retain the best talent.''       PNC Financial Services announced $1,000 bonuses for 47,500      employees as well as $1,500 to be added to existing pension      accounts. The company also will raise its base pay rate to      $15 per hour. PNC's CEO said: ``The tax reform law creates an      opportunity to reward our employees who are working hard each      day to serve our customers, build strong relationships in our      communities and create long-term value for our      shareholders.''       U.Bank announced a $1,000 bonus for nearly 60,000      employees and enhanced health care offerings in the 2019      enrollment period. It will also raise base pay rate to $15      per hour. The bank said that these decisions were ``a result      of the tax reform package.''

It is called the college football season, which is capped off by the Rose Bowl, which is played in Pasadena, This year, the Rose Bowl was played between the University of Georgia, my home State, and the University of It was one of the greatest football games, I think anybody would admit, that has ever been played in that game before, and I am proud of both universities.  I am equally proud of the University of Alabama and Clemson University--the other two teams that played for the right to play in Atlanta, GA, on Monday night of next week, on January 8, to decide the collegiate national championship. My Bulldogs of Georgia will be one of those two teams. They defeated Oklahoma 54 to 48 in a great football game in Alabama made a decisive victory over Clemson in New Orleans, LA, in the Sugar The two will meet this coming Monday night in the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta,  I don't know which is going to win. I know which one I am pulling for. I know which one I am on the floor bragging about tonight, but I am equally bragging about all of our collegiate athletics in this country and the great men and women who make it work--the coaches, athletic directors, and people who make it go.  In particular, with Georgia's victory, it prompts me to come to the floor and talk about Kirby Kirby is the head coach of the University of For 9 years preceding his coming to Georgia, he was assistant to Nick Saban, coach for the University of They will play against each another on Monday night for this year's national championship. It is ironic that the coach and his pupil will be the two coaches in that great game.  Kirby is a University of Georgia graduate. He was a great University of Georgia football player in his own right. He came to the University of Georgia with high hopes as an alumnus, hoping that he could be the person to take Georgia to new heights.  It took him only a year. The first season was 8 and 5. The second season was this year, 12 and 1--now 13 and 1--winning the Rose Bowl and playing for the national championship on Monday night.  Kirby Smart is not just smart because he knows football; he is smart because he knows how to be a leader. You saw an example of a man in the Rose Bowl who never took credit himself. He always gave it to his other coaches and to his other players. He never tried to be the winner. He always tried to be in the background. He put others ahead of himself, but deep down inside--and behind the great victory that was won that night--it was his spirit, his encouragement, his living the dream that all the Georgia players followed.  I want to talk about a couple of them. Sony Michel was the offensive player of the game, one of the greatest running backs ever to come out of the University of Georgia, and we had some good ones--Frankie Sinkwich, Charlie Trippy, and Herschel On defense, Roquan Smith, the Dick Butkus Award winner, played a great defensive game. Then, with the combination of leadership they brought to the team on the field and the quiet leadership and confidence Kirby Smart brought to the team as its coach, they won that game 54 to 48 in a double-overtime elimination of the University of  My congratulations go to Oklahoma and their quarterback Baker Mayfield, who was the Heisman Trophy winner, on playing a great game.  I wish Alabama a lot of luck on Monday night, but not enough to beat my This is going to be our chance to win a national championship for the first time in 38 years of football. We are going to be in my home State of Georgia in our newest athletic facility, the Mercedes-Benz I think it is an appropriate place for us to win, so I am going to say ``Go Dawgs'' from the floor of the  On Monday night, I hope Kirby Smart remembers the reason I am bragging about him today on the floor is that he is going to be our leader Monday night. He is going to carry us to victory one more time.

His work has helped me to make possible the path that I have taken, from being a 16-year-old immigrant girl who came to this country by herself for college, to serving, now, as the first Indian-American woman elected to the United States House of Representatives--and it is the courage and the fight of King that made my journey possible.  I knew of King first because of his connection to Mahatma Gandhi, a great leader from my own birth country of Like Gandhi, King was a once-in-a-generation leader. Like Gandhi, the problems that King tackled were once seen as insurmountable problems, institutional barriers of race and class that seemed as if, if taken on, would topple society as we knew it, tall walls of tradition and practice that kept our society segregated and divided.  But that did not stop him from speaking out, organizing, and leading a growing movement that reminded the leaders of our country of the very dream that made America possible: that all men and women were created equal and that we should be judged by the content of our character and not the color of our skin.  King's gift was in his unique ability to bring truth, compassion, and justice together for a better future and to remind us of how much we share even across our differences. He followed Gandhi's principles of nonviolent resistance, also known as satyagraha: ``satya'' meaning truth, and ``graha'' meaning adherence to truth.  Satyagraha then meant insistence on truth, and that is what King preached and acted upon: truth about ending segregation and discrimination, truth about ending the war in Vietnam, truth about lifting up sanitation workers and ending poverty, truth, ultimately, that it is love and not hate that builds our character and our collective society.  If King were here with us today, he would call on us to have faith in our fight for justice and to substitute courage for caution. He would call on us to work passionately and unrelentingly for the very vision of our country that inspires so many around the world, for that more perfect Union that we know is still ahead of us, for that society that remembers that we are all better off when we are all better off.  King would remind us that justice is what love looks like in public. He would call on us to move into that plane of higher education, that plane of moral consciousness where we simply cannot stand by as injustice occurs around us.  He would call on us to address economic inequality by raising the minimum wage and enacting real tax reform whose benefits accrue to the masses and not to the top 1 percent and the wealthiest corporations.  King would call on us to pass the Dream Act and support the futures of 1.5 million young people across the country. He would call on us to expand and support the Affordable Care Act and healthcare for everyone so that no one is one healthcare crisis away from bankruptcy.  Our work is still to fight for justice and build that beloved community where each of us has a place to stand regardless of the color of our skin or where we live or how much money we have in our pockets, and in this beloved community, we would tackle the legacies of racism and implicit bias that we all carry with us with courage and with fortitude. We would work together to build that community that inspires us and to leave a world to our children that makes us proud, and, most importantly, we operate always from a place of generosity and abundance rather than fear and scarcity.  From that jail cell in Alabama, King wrote: ``We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny,'' or, as the great civil rights leader Reverend Joseph Lowery once said to me during the Immigrant Workers Freedom Ride: ``We may have come over on different ships, but we are all in the same boat now.''  To make a difference, to truly serve the people, it only takes courage and coming together as a collective, across the aisle, across rural and urban, across Black, White, and King showed us what that really looks like, and he died because he was compelled to stand for making a reality from a dream of what was possible only in a country as great as the United States of  Today, as we remember and honor Martin Luther King, Jr., we remember, too, that if we are courageous, if we put people over politics, our actions have the power to change lives, to push that moral arc of the universe more quickly towards justice. As King said: ``We must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back.''[[Page H87]]                            ____________________",CREC-2018-01-10-pt1-PgH86-2.txt,99999999999999,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2018.0,10.0,January

What makes us different from those who would harm us is our commitment to our constitutional values: that we are innocent until proven guilty and that our government must obtain a warrant and show probable cause that there is a legitimate reason to listen in on our conversations.

440,topic-id,553,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from California for yielding and for his forceful advocacy and brilliant articulation of[[Page H74]]the GOP tax scam and all that it represents.  It really is a wolf in sheep's clothing. It is the ultimate hustle. It is nothing but a classic bait and switch. It is a fraudulent Ponzi scheme. The notion that this bill is designed to help benefit middle class folks and working families, those who aspire to be part of the middle class, is such complete fiction when 83 percent of the benefits of the GOP tax scam will go to the wealthiest 1 percent in  We know that at least 36 million middle class families, if not more, will experience a tax increase. Medicare, as was just articulated, will be undermined, the deficit will explode, and our children and grandchildren are being asked to shoulder at least $1.5 trillion in additional debt to pay for tax cuts for millionaires, billionaires, special interests, corporations, and big donors to our friends on the other side.  Don't take my word for it. There have been Members of this House who have indicated they needed to get this massive tax cut for wealthy individuals done or their donors would stop contributing. We didn't say that. That is folks from this Chamber on the other side of the aisle when talking about the urgency of jamming this reckless tax scam down the throats of the American people.  As the Congressman, the distinguished gentleman from California, just articulated, the whole premise that anyone other than the wealthy and the well off is going to benefit is built upon the fraud of trickle-down economics, when there is absolutely no evidence that trickle-down economics has ever done anything for everyday  When Ronald Reagan cut taxes on millionaires in 1981, we didn't get explosive economic growth. We got an explosion in the deficit.  When George Bush cut taxes on millionaires and billionaires in 2001 and 2003, we didn't get explosive economic growth. We got the Great Recession in terms of the legacy of the Bush economy.  Then there was the so-called great Republican experiment in Kansas, where a Republican State Legislature and a Republican Governor massively cut taxes on the wealthiest, top folks in  And was there massive economic growth?  We got prison riots, overcrowded classrooms, and crumbling infrastructure.  Those are the facts. That is what so-called trickle-down economics has yielded, and now this fraud is being perpetrated on the American people.  It is shameful. It is our children and grandchildren who are going to deal with the consequences of this highly partisan effort to benefit the wealthiest amongst us. It is a raw deal for the American people.  We are going to offer a better deal for the American people; focus on better jobs, better wages, and a better future; focus on higher pay, lower cost; and giving the American people the tools to succeed in the 21st century economy by focusing on a real infrastructure bill, real training, real community college opportunity, real tax reform for middle class Americans and those who aspire to be part of it.  I thank the distinguished gentleman for yielding, for his leadership in this area, and I look forward to working together to deliver to the American people the better deal that they deserve.

442,topic-id,259,"Mr.Speaker, it certainly is the case that because of the GOP tax scam, because of the $1.5 trillion in additional debt that we, as a country, will now have to shoulder so that massive tax cuts can be provided to millionaires, billionaires, special interests, corporations, and big donors, that we are not necessarily in a position to responsibly fund the type of infrastructure plan that the Nation deserves to fix our crumbling bridges, roads, and tunnels.                              {time}  1830  We believe, as Democrats, that the American people, in that regard, deserve a better deal, a better deal, again, focused on higher pay, lower costs, and the tools to succeed in the 21st century economy.  One of the ways that you deliver better jobs is through a meaningful infrastructure plan that is appropriately funded, not on the backs of working families, middle class folks, and everyday It should be funded in an appropriate way. Those who can afford to pay should be paying their fair share. But we just went through a reverse Robin Hood process as it relates to this tax bill, and that is unfortunate.  I am hopeful that we will proceed in a bipartisan way. The President has indicated that he thinks that would be an appropriate approach. We will see whether that is a genuine articulation of a way forward or not. But we cannot repeat the mistakes that were just attendant to the process of jamming this tax bill down the throats of the American people and jamming us in a way that will hurt everyday  ",CREC-2018-01-09-pt1-PgH72.txt,2149,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2018.0,9.0,January
444,topic-id,156,"Mr.Speaker, I think that is exactly right. The gentleman's concerns and suspicions are well-founded based upon the approach that was taken by this Congress on the other side of the aisle in connection with the tax bill.  So the individual tax cuts, to the extent that there are any that will be felt by the American people, are modest; the corporate tax cuts are massive.  The individual tax cuts are temporary; the corporate tax cuts are permanent.  The ability of individuals to take a State and local tax deduction has been decimated; the ability of corporations to use the State and local tax deduction on their corporate tax return is untouched.  The moving expense deduction for individuals has been eliminated, but corporations can continue to take moving expense deductions for closing down a factory or a plant here in America and shipping those good-paying American jobs overseas to China, India, or other parts of the world.

810,topic-id,1610,"Thank you, Mr. I rise as many of my colleagues have this afternoon, and I have risen on the same topic often to talk about our  Usually, when I have risen in the past, I have told stories about Virginia We have about 13,000 Dreamers in I have highlighted stories of Dreamers from Latin America, Africa, Sweden, and One of the students I talked about, Gloria Oduyoye, just graduated from William & Mary Law School within the last month and thus became the first Dreamer to be a law school graduate in Virginia and one of the few Dreamers who attained a law degree in the United I talked about her story.  Today I decided not to talk about stories of individuals again but to try to put it in context, with the message really being that the time is now to make a decision. We don't need more information. We just need the will to act and do what I think is the right and the fair thing to do because we have been at this discussion now--it is hard to believe we have been at this discussion for 16 years.  The American public--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--overwhelmingly support a permanent solution for It is not that we need to know anything more to solve this. We have been talking about it for a very long time.  I want to encourage Members of this body and in the House who are involved in the negotiation to come to an agreement and provide permanent protection for the Dreamers before next Friday so that we can protect this community, which is frightened because[[Page S131]]they are so worried about being deported or losing their ability to work, to go to school, losing the ability to protect their families. But it is more than just protecting people because they are frightened; it is protecting them because, as I have seen in Virginia and in every State, they so enrich this country.  The first version of the DREAM Act, it is hard to believe, was introduced in 2001. The Senator from Illinois, Mr.Durbin, who has been a champion of this and has my deepest admiration for his persistence in this endeavor, introduced the first version of the DREAM Act together with the senior Senator from Utah, Mr. The bill has evolved since then. It wasn't exactly the same as we are contemplating now, but it was the first version of the bill. It sought to repeal a provision of the 1996 immigration reform that prohibited undocumented immigrants from eligibility for higher education. Instead, what the bill, in its original version, did 17 years ago was to grant permanent resident status to young, undocumented immigrants with a high school degree or equivalent GED who fulfilled certain residence requirements and did not have criminal records. That was the start of this discussion. We are still looking for the permanent answer.  The DREAM Act first almost passed in 2007. It attained more than a majority vote in the Senate, but it didn't get to the 60-vote threshold, so that was insufficient for passage. In 2010, the House passed the DREAM Act, but the Senate again failed to approve it with a 60-vote threshold.  In 2013, just a few months after I came to the Senate, we contemplated, debated, discussed, voted upon comprehensive immigration reform in I was kind of proud then. I was a young Senator, had been here a couple of months and stood in my chair and offered a speech on the floor of the Senate in Spanish to describe what was in the bill for the 45 million Americans who get their news every day in the Spanish language. After I was finished describing it, people came up to me and said: Has anybody ever done that before? And I said: Frankly, I don't know.  It turned out that it was the first time in the history of the body that a speech had been given in a language other than But what was important about that moment in June of 2013 was not the speech; it was the vote. The package was comprehensive. It included not just the DREAM Act but border security, assistance for employers to determine the immigration bona fides of those applying for work. These are reforms--an approval for people here on temporary protected status from El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Somalia, Sudan, and Haiti to become permanent residents and then convert that into a path to citizenship. That comprehensive immigration reform bill, in my view, represents the Senate working at its best: a bipartisan working group, coming through committee, coming to the floor with amendments. It passed this body with 68 votes in favor.  It was evidence of the naivete of a young Senator at the time that I assumed, of course, something was going to happen because it passed here with 68 votes. I knew the House wouldn't do exactly what we did, but I thought they would do something, and we would be conferencing it. But alas, I was naive; that was not to happen.  We are now in a different place, and we have the ability to act.  I supported President Obama's actions in June of 2012 to protect Dreamers--the DACA Program; and then later, the DAPA I felt that those actions were completely in accord with earlier Executive actions Presidents had taken in the area of immigration.  Since June of 2012, 800,000 young people have achieved Dreamer status. Some of them aren't so young anymore. I sometimes refer to them as students and kids, but they are in the military, they are parents, they are teachers, and they are active in their communities. As I said, there are 13,000 in my DACA has allowed them to continue their education, to work legally, and to remain in the only country they have ever known.  I will say I was disappointed when President Trump in September announced that he would terminate the program in 6 months--in I felt like it was the breaking of a promise to these young people because he had said, even as a candidate and then as President, that Dreamers were good kids and that they wouldn't have anything to worry about from him.  I will say there was one aspect of what the President said--I can't just be critical without pointing out that there was one thing about what he said that I thought was right. He said: And Congress should fix it. I agreed with President Trump on that. I wish he hadn't terminated the program, but he was right that this is something for Congress to fix because anything done by Executive action, even fully within the power of a President to take it, is subject to being changed by another The lives and futures of these young people are such that we shouldn't be scaring them about whether they are protected or maybe back to being protected depending upon who was the occupant of the White  That Presidential announcement in March, although I was disappointed, on that core piece of it, that Congress should fix it, I think President Trump was right and I think he is right. I think this is something that Congress must fix, should fix, can fix, and we have all the information about it to fix it right now.  It has been difficult and a little bit heartbreaking to talk to these young people and their families about the fears they have. I don't live under the fear of deportation. I don't live under the fear of my job being taken away because of my status. I don't live under the fear of my kids not being able to get instate tuition and instead having to pay out-of-state or not being able to afford it at all. It is not a fear I walk around with every day. It is hard to put yourself in somebody else's shoes and experience the fear and even terror they are feeling when you yourself don't have that same exposure.  I have spent a lot of time listening to these young people and their parents in Northern Virginia and Richmond, especially, where I live, and the fear they feel is very palpable, and the panic they feel is very palpable, and I understand why. I think part of our job should not be to increase anxiety and fear; part of our job should be--when we can, when it is the right thing to do, when it is within our grasp--to take action and provide clarity and certainty so people will know what their status is. I think the time for that is now after 16 years.  Maybe the most important thing I am saying is that this is not a new issue. It is not that we need another week or another month or another year to figure out the answer. The first bill was introduced in 2001, and I think January 19, 2018, is ample time for us to now get this right and make it either part of the spending bills that we will do at year-end or part of a stand-alone bill that we could embrace as a body.  I was heartened by some of the comments by the President, as reported yesterday, during the meeting with bipartisan leadership at the White House about this. We can do it, and the time is right to do it now. So I would ask my colleagues and especially urge all those in the negotiations to make this decision and provide these wonderful young people with certainty about their future.

465,topic-id,1802,"Mr.Speaker, I stand with so many of my colleagues today in a call to action for this body to address a crisis that is at its breaking point for pensioners across our country, retired workers, who have come from the building trades, miners, truck drivers, so many more--actually, hundreds of thousands of Americans--losing their pensions or about to lose them.  Millions of American retirees have worked and earned pensions that they contributed to through the multiemployer pension programs. In fact, I met one retiree recently who paid over[[Page H79]]$225,000 into his plan and has not been able to access one penny--not one penny. Yet hundreds of these plans face serious financial shortfalls, leaving millions of retirees facing an uncertain retirement future.  For today, Congress needs to step up and secure the pension benefits these workers have earned. And there should be no pension cuts for workers who contributed to their own plans and should have a right to the money that they invested. Congress can no longer kick the can down the road. There simply is no more time.  This problem does not go away if Congress continues to ignore it. Rather, the financial stress mounts for the retirement funds and, of course, for the retirees and for their families so severely impacted. Indeed, the costs the Federal Government will bear if we don't solve this problem now become exponentially more significant as time ensues.  Over the last 4 years, I have heard extensively from retirees forced to ride this terrible economic roller coaster. It is almost like a corkscrew, right side up, upside down. They are caught in this as their retirement security careens out of their control through no fault of their own.  There are thousands, tens of thousands of Americans who did everything our country asks of its productive citizenry, retirees who worked for decades for a company and thought they would have a secure retirement but now they face a stark reality.  From Toledo, Ohio, such retirees as Carol Jones, who drove a truck for over 30 years and who missed holidays and major life milestones because of his work on the road, the knowledge that he was earning a pension helped in those moments, but now he says it all feels like a pipe dream. And when you drive a truck for over 30 years, things happen to your knees; they happen to your back. Bouncing over concrete for three decades has severe costs for so many. But if a solution is not passed now, Carol won't even be able to continue to care for his disabled daughter.  Or how about Ernest Frye, a teamster for 54 years? He and his wife currently can live on what they earned through his pension, but, with its threatened cuts, everything will fall apart for them. They will have to rely on the government to cover the difference. And with the rising cost of medical expenses, they run the risk of also losing their home if his pension is cut. What kind of cruelty is this?  Or how about Cindy Grimley, who was hired in 1978, and has taken pride in being able to take care of herself? Even with the pension she earned and lives on, she cannot afford medications her doctor tells her she needs, and she can't afford to lose a single dollar of her promised pension.  Or how about Tom Brady, who worked 30 years--30 years--with Roadway Express and is a Vietnam veteran? He faced a 50 percent cut under the Central States Pension Fund application. They call it Any cut to his pension won't only impact him. He has six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren whom he and his wife help support.  I hear countless stories across this country of how retirees are caring for children with disabilities, supporting their own ill and aged parents, or supporting children and grandchildren with life expenses. These cuts impact more than just the individual who earned the pension. And, really, don't these workers who retired have a right to the money that they put into these plans?  You know, there were hundreds of companies that walked away from their pension promises. They didn't keep their promise to the workers. The workers put their money in, and some of the companies walked away. Is it the worker's fault?  Ask any retiree or responsible economist, if we fail to fix this pension crisis, we will create a tremendous deficit to our economy both locally and nationally. Some retirees already live under the financial constraint of us not solving this challenge, and some have already had 70 percent cuts to their pensions.  For example, Ironworkers Local 17 in How about the New York State Teamsters? How about the United Furniture Workers pension and the International Association of Machinists Motor City pension? They have all seen that decisions were made forcing cuts upon their retirees. And millions more live on that precipice: money that should be coming to them because they earned it, they put it away, and then it was taken away.  This House has continued to let these retirees down. There has not been a single hearing to fully understand the financial plight confronting retirees. How irresponsible is that for the leadership of this House? The Senate has only taken a bit of action, but no solution.  Immediately after the House passed the scam pension bill a few years ago--that is the original Multiemployer Pension Reform Act--I set to work to correct the unfairness that it allowed, and we introduced the Keep Our Pension Promises Act, which, back then, had the number H.2412. We called it It would have prevented these draconian cuts to earned pensions by filling the financial gap of many of these plans, such as the Central States Pension Fund, and reinstate the anti-cutback provisions that are contained in the ERISA legislation, the Employee Retirement Income Security The bedrock of that law was that, if workers work and they put money aside for their pensions, that pension money will be there for them.  But our bill lacks sufficient bipartisan support. So back last December, it was very reassuring for me to stand with my colleagues Representative Richie Neal of Massachusetts and, from the other body, Senator Sherrod Brown as we introduced the Butch Lewis Act, H.4444 and 2147.  In the House, this legislation now has two Republican cosponsors, and I hope many more of our colleagues' support will follow. But there is not time to recruit cosponsors one or two at a time. Retirees across our country are waiting for true leadership to push an equitable solution so they aren't led to the guillotine on their pensions. It is time for real congressional leadership to identify the impact this crisis will have and organize an effort here either to create a new bipartisan solution or pass the already bipartisan Butch Lewis  If we fail to act, we can no longer wonder why the middle class is angry at Washington and this Congress, for they see this as just another broken promise by We can no longer wonder why they believe the system is rigged, because here are more than a million honest Americans who worked for a living decade after decade. They worked hard. They followed the rules, and now they are getting thrown under the bus. The companies they worked for reneged on their promises.  And you know what? Unless we do something, the promise under ERISA will remain unfulfilled, and that is their pension security.  I would say to my colleagues, if you ever wonder why tens and tens of millions of Americans are angry and deeply disappointed or feel betrayed by their government and the companies they worked for, look no further than this issue.  I remember one man who didn't come from my State, but I met him here in He said: Congresswoman, I earned and put away $225,000 in my pension plan, and they told me I had to work 20 years. So I drove 20 years, drove a truck 20 years.  And he said: I started to have back problems. And when I got to my 20th year and I made it through, I said to them: Well, I am ready to apply.  And the company said: You know what? We changed the rules. You have to work 2 more years.  So he said: Two more years?  So he made every effort that he could under great pain to work those 2 years up through his 22nd year of employment as a driver, and then at the 22nd year, the company said: You know what? We changed the rules. Now you are going to have to work an additional 3 years.  Imagine having promises broken all the time.  And now he is disabled. He has difficulty standing, sitting. He has pain all the time. And he has not been able to gain access to a penny of money that he earned. Surely, if someone at the White House is listening to this, if you think about President Trump's travels through Ohio when he talked to the miners and he sought their vote, or in Chicago with those who drove a[[Page H80]]truck and paid into the Central States Pension Fund, the promises that were made, surely we can find a way to help keep the pension promises that these workers earned.  I want to thank all of the Members who cosponsored our former bill, the Keep Our Pension Promises Act, and the Butch Lewis Act, and I thank Members of both parties for trying to find a solution, a real solution, for this crisis. We are moving toward it. We really don't have any time to waste because Congress must reach a solution early this year, and we should look no further than including that pension relief in the upcoming spending deal that is being negotiated between the White House and this Congress now.  Pensions now. Pensions now. These workers have earned their pension. Why has the government of the United States made it so difficult and made their retirement years so stressful by not reaching a solution to date? I make a strong appeal on behalf of over a million workers across this country who so justly earned the pension benefits that they deserve.  I thank my colleagues who are listening. I thank the American people for writing us and for sharing their personal stories with us. I have great hope, in these final negotiations on a spending bill for 2018 which is currently under negotiation at the highest levels, that this pension issue finally will be resolved.  Keep the letters and emails and phone calls and visits coming. This is the time to make your weight felt.  Mr.Speaker, thank you so very much, and I yield back my remaining time.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-09-pt1-PgH78.txt,616,HONORING THE LIFE OF SHERIFF'S DEPUTY ZACKARI PARRISH,2018.0,9.0,January

588,topic-id,261,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill.  It was in 1935 that this body enacted the National Labor Relations It guaranteed basic rights to private sector workers to organize into trade unions, to engage in contractual bargaining for decent wages and better conditions at work, and to take joint action, if necessary.  But in 1935, just like today, here, 2018, the Republican Party and business interests vehemently opposed passage of any laws that help workers. Little has changed. Once again our Republican colleagues trample on the backs of workers.  This legislation rolls back proven protections that allow wages to rise in places like California, and their casinos, from $10 an hour to $13 an hour. Now, these modest pay increases have helped elevate the workers who work in those casinos above the Federal poverty level.  Who has ever tried to buy a house in California or tried to live on $13 an hour or $10 an hour? You are not talking about a whole lot of money there, especially from a party that just gave $1 trillion away to the people at the very top.  But with this bill, our Republican colleagues chose to strip these hundreds of thousands of workers, the majority of whom are not members of Tribes but work in those casinos, of decent wages and their right to a voice in the workplace.   Beneath their sheepskin costumes hides another Republican attack on worker rights in this country, this time under the guise of Tribal sovereignty.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

589,topic-id,1159,"Let me remind my colleagues though, throughout our National Labor Relations Board's history, it has never and will not assert jurisdiction where it would interfere with a Tribe's internal governance rights in purely intramural matters.  So I urge my colleagues to oppose this bad bill.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record the strong opposition to it from the United Steelworkers of America and from the Communications Workers of As a proud daughter of labor, I am proud to stand here today in opposition to this bill.                                          United Steelworkers,                                  Pittsburgh, PA, January 9, 2018.     Re United Steelworkers oppose inclusion of anti-worker H.         986, Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act of 2017 in 140.     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 850,000 members of      the United Steelworkers (USW), we strongly urge you to oppose      140 on the House floor this week. Rather than[[Page H121]]     being identical to the Senate bill, this version includes the      anti-worker and undemocratic Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act of      2017 (H.986).       H.986 would exempt all employees of federally recognized      Native American-owned commercial enterprises operated on      Indian lands from the protections of the National Labor      Relations Act (NLRA) and would authorize over 567 distinct      and separate labor law jurisdictions in the United       To be absolutely clear, this legislation strips workers--     both Native American and non-Native American--of their NLRA      protections. While some organizations have falsely attempted      to paint tribal governments as similar entities to states      (which are exempt from the NLRA), tribal governments are      substantially different than states in one key democratic      principal: state governments allow workers an ability to vote      for their legislators no matter their ancestry, while most      tribal governments require blood quantum or lineal descent to      determine who is eligible for membership or citizenship.       Simply put, if H.986 becomes law by inclusion in 140,      U.citizens working in the United States for tribal      commercial enterprises would not be able to vote for the      elected representatives who set their labor laws. These      workers will lose the ability to petition the government that      oversees their working conditions.       The gaming industry, which is an employer for approximately      246 of the 567 federally recognized American Indian tribes;      has over 600,000 casino workers on tribal lands, the      overwhelming majority of whom are not Native In      2011 before the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, the National      Indian Gaming Commission testified that the vast majority of      employees (up to 75 percent) were non-tribal members.       Our union understands the importance of the principle of      tribal sovereignty; however the fundamental human rights of      employees are not the exclusive concern of tribal enterprises      or tribal governments. As the International Labor      Organization highlighted in a letter on a previous version of      this bill, ``it is critical that the State (the national      authority) takes ultimate responsibility for ensuring respect      for freedom of association and collective bargaining rights      throughout its territory''. That is why we believe the      current test set by the NLRB is the best course of action      until labor laws are strengthened in the United       In 2004, the NLRB under the Bush Administration ruled for      the first time that Tribal casino workers should have the      benefit of NLRA protections, San Manuel, 341 NLRB 138      (2204). Yet, since the San Manuel ruling, the NLRB has      asserted jurisdiction on a case-by-case basis. In 2015, the      NLRB declined jurisdiction citing the 1830 Treaty of Dancing      Rabbit Creek and 1866 Treaty of Washington stating:       ``We have no doubt that asserting jurisdiction over the      Casino and the Nation would effectuate the policies of the      However, because we find that asserting jurisdiction      would abrogate treaty rights specific to the Nation.''      Chickasaw Nation Windstar World Casino, 362 NLRB 109 92015).       Similarly the NLRB declined jurisdiction:       ``. . . when an Indian tribe is fulfilling a traditionally      tribal or governmental function that is unique to its status,      fulfilling just such a unique governmental function      [providing free health care services solely to tribal      members],'' Yukon Kuskokwim Health Corporation, 341 NLRB 139      (2004).       The NLRB has developed a reasonable and responsible test to      determine jurisdiction. H.986 creates significant      confusion and jurisdictional issues over labor law      enforcement and grossly undermines worker's rights. Our union      urges you to oppose 140, with the inclusion of H.986,      and asks you to instead work to expand worker's rights not      restrict them further.           Sincerely,                                                    Leo Gerard,     International                                  ____                                                  January 9, 2018.       Dear Representative: On behalf of the members and officers      of the Communications Workers of America (CWA), I am writing      to express our strong opposition to 140. CWA has no      objections whatsoever to Sections 1 and 2 of the bill as      amended. Unfortunately, these non-controversial, sensible      bills have been hijacked to also pass H.986, a bill that      would strip hundreds of thousands of workers at tribal-owned      and -operated enterprises of their protections for the right      to bargain collectively.       H.986 seeks to overturn a National Labor Relations Board      (NLRB) decision in San Manuel Indian Bingo and Casino, which      applied the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to a tribal      casino enterprise. The NLRB's finding in San Manuel adopted a      test to determine whether the NLRA is applicable to      businesses operating on tribal lands--if it would ``touch      exclusive rights of self-governance in purely intramural      matters'' or ``abrogate Indian treaty rights,'' the NLRA      would not apply, but otherwise the decision will be based on      a series of factors including whether an entity is a purely      commercial enterprise or employs or caters to individuals who      are not tribal members.       The San Manuel test balances two crucial issues--tribal      sovereignty and the right of workers to bargain collectively.      The test ensures that truly internal matters of self-     governance will continue to be handled by sovereign tribes,      while also ensuring that the fundamental rights of workers to      organize and advocate for their own interests are properly      respected. H.986 would overturn this balance by exempting      any enterprise or institution owned and operated by an Indian      tribe and located on its land from the requirements of the      NLRA--or any other guarantee of workers' fundamental right to      organize and collectively bargain.       The practical impact of H.986 would be to exempt a broad      swath of businesses from the NLRA, even though, in many      cases, they are purely commercial enterprises. For many of      these companies--particularly casinos--the majority of their      workforces are not members of the tribe employing them and      therefore do not have full access to internal, tribal      mechanisms for grieving issues or petitioning for change in      tribal policies. This is why the International Labour      Organization stated in 2015 that ``it would appear likely      that an exclusion of certain workers from the NLRA and its      mechanisms would give rise to a failure to ensure these      workers their fundamental freedom of association rights.''       I urge you to oppose 140 as amended and instead work to      advance an agenda that protects both workers' fundamental      human right to organize and tribal sovereignty. CWA will      consider including votes on this bill in our Congressional      Scorecard Thank you in advance for your consideration.

As chairman of the Homeland Security Committee's Subcommittee on Transportation and Protective Security, I recently led a bipartisan congressional delegation to Europe and the Middle East to examine international aviation security and counterterrorism operations. The efforts of DHS personnel stationed overseas to build relationships with foreign partners, to coordinate with other Federal agencies, and to secure our homeland from threats before they arrive on our shores are truly a testament to the vital counterterror mission of Homeland Additionally, the trip underscored the need to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of our overseas programs in a manner that is risk-based.  Unfortunately, however, I also observed that even today, more than 15 years after 9/11, the United States Government still struggles to avoid stovepiping and effectively participate in information sharing and collaboration on homeland security matters.

Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.4561, the SAFE TECH Act, sponsored by my good friend and colleague and a knowledgeable alumnus of the Homeland Security Committee, Congressman Bilirakis, who recently participated in my subcommittee's overseas congressional delegation to examine airport security and the passenger screening technology in place at last point of departure airports with direct flights to the United  As part of our delegation, we visited Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, where we saw the effective deployment of new and advanced computed tomography screening technology, as well as a number of other screening technologies aimed at making the passenger and employee screening checkpoints both more effective and more efficient.  Upon returning to the United States, the committee conducted rigorous oversight and found that the existing testing and evaluation processes in place at the Department of Homeland Security and the Transportation Security Administration are riddled with bureaucratic bottlenecks that serve to delay new technologies for years.  I will note that the technology in place at the airport in Schiphol was made in the United States, yet we are not taking advantage of that technology because of these bottlenecks.  Additionally, due to logjams at Homeland Security and TSA facilities, small businesses, as well as technology startups, are often prevented from participating in the acquisitions and procurement processes. As a result, our aviation system is left with antiquated security technology that is incapable of adequately responding to new and ever-evolving threats.  Madam Speaker, this is simply unacceptable, and we must act to reform the Homeland Security and TSA acquisition processes. H.4561 takes significant steps toward making these reforms by allowing new technologies to receive third-party testing and evaluation, while maintaining existing lines of authority for the TSA administrator to ensure such testing remains held to the highest standards of security and integrity.  This bill will not only drive innovation but will also save taxpayer dollars at Homeland Security and TSA, while reducing costs to companies developing new screening technologies. That is why we have received broad support, not only in a bipartisan manner here in Congress, but also from the private sector.  Madam Speaker, I commend the dedication of Congressman Bilirakis to reforming the broken acquisitions process currently in place and for working with me and the committee on developing this bill. I also wish to thank Chairman McCaul for supporting this legislation and moving it quickly through the committee to address the serious concerns we found through our oversight efforts.  I also thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, who routinely support bills of ours, and we routinely support bills of theirs, because we both understand that homeland security is a very bipartisan issue.

As Senator Kaine just noted, I was also heartened, after the meeting at the White House, by the fact that this President understands--he said he understands that we can't wait until March to get this done, that we need to get this done soon. For me, the easiest way to do this is by passing the Dream  The Federal court decision in California yesterday will provide some temporary relief, as every single day more and more kids fall out of status. That sounds like a legal term, but for them, it changes their whole life. These are kids who literally believed our government. They were told: You register. You sign up. We are going to allow you to stay.[[Page S132]]  And then, in one little moment and with a signature, that all changed. Their lives changed. So it is now our obligation in the Senate to get this done.  We have already seen the harmful effects of the administration's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, and the situation will continue to get worse until we take action. This is not just a small thing. I have met these kids. Ninety-seven percent of them either work or are in school. The average age they were when they were brought to this country is 6\1/2\ years old.  A few months back, I stood in front of a Catholic church with our archbishop of the Twin Cities, Archbishop Hebda, and a number of his parishioners and a number of the priests from that church to talk about what this meant in people's lives--kids brought over through no fault of their own.  My favorite example of a Dreamer, Senator Kaine and Mr.President, is Joseph He was brought over--and he didn't know this at the time--as a baby. His parents had died, and he was brought over to Sleepy Eye, MN, where he was raised. This was a long time ago. When he got to be the right age, he decided that he wanted to serve our country, and he signed up to serve in World War  Well, back then, he went to the military, to the Army, and said: I want to sign up.  They said: Well, it turns out--I don't know what term they used back then, but he was undocumented. And when I first met him at the young age of 99, as he explained to me, back then, all you did was you went to Canada for a day, with our country's OK, and slept in a hotel for a night, which is what he did, and then came back. Then he was made legal, and the Army signed him up, and he ended up going over and serving in the He came back to this country, met his wife, got married, had a son, and that son served in the Vietnam war.  A few years ago, when he was 99, I got to bring him to Washington, and we stood in front of the World War II There he stood. He had never seen it before, and he would never go again. He just died at the age of 103. He stood there with two Dreamers, suburban high school kids from Minnesota who wanted to join the Air Force, but they couldn't do it. They didn't have that right status. They were Dreamers too. They had been brought over as young kids.  To me, that just brought it all home. This is a war hero, someone who served our country, and this is the kind of person we are talking about when we talk about the His last act of patriotism in the last few years of his life was to continue to push so that other kids could serve their country just as he had and just as his son had.  While we have not reached an agreement yet on this bill, the reports on the bipartisan meeting are hopeful. But time is ticking by. Time is ticking. The American public is with us. This is not one of these issues where the public says: What are they doing? This makes no sense. A recent poll found that 86 percent of Americans support action to allow the Dreamers to stay here in the United So I am very hopeful that we can come together on a bipartisan agreement.  The Dream Act was based on one simple principle, and that is that you should have the opportunity--this set of people, 800,000 people who came over here through no fault of their own, should have that opportunity to call this country home, as they have been doing for so many years.  Passing the Dream Act isn't just the morally right thing to do, it is the economically right thing to do. One recent study estimated that ending deferred action for childhood arrivals would cost the country over $400 billion over the next 10 years. It would cost my State more than $376 million in annual revenue. We are proud to be the home of more than 6,000  Since it was established in 2012, it has helped, as I have noted, nearly 800,000 young people who have lived in the United States since childhood to have better lives. Think about that--800,000 people. As I mentioned, 97 percent of them are in school or in the workforce, and 72 percent of them are currently in school pursuing a bachelor's degree or higher. More than 100 students applied to medical school last year. Nearly 100 of them are currently enrolled in medical school at a time when we need more doctors, particularly in rural areas. Those are the facts.  I note that at the meeting at the White House, the President actually said that when this got done, he wanted to pursue comprehensive immigration reform. It is something that we have done before on a bipartisan basis in the Senate, and I believe that is where we need to turn now.  We talk about the economic sense of the Look at our country overall. Seventy of our Fortune 500 companies are headed by immigrants. Twenty-five percent of our U.Nobel Laureates were born in other countries. Immigrants have been an economic engine for this country.  Everyone in this Chamber came from somewhere. Their relatives came from somewhere. My grandparents on my mom's side came from Switzerland, and on my dad's side my great-grandparents came from They worked in the mines. They worked so hard just to send my dad to college. They saved money in a coffee can in a basement. I am here today with great-grandparents who came straight from Slovenia, a grandfather who worked in a mine, a dad who grew up there and was the first one in the family to go to college and get a 2-year degree and then a 4-year degree, and I literally stand here on the shoulders of these immigrants.  On my mom's side, the Swiss side, my grandpa came over and ended up at Ellis Island when he was 18 years old, and they had reached the cap on Swiss immigrants. That might sound amusing, but that was the case. He then somehow got himself to Canada--I think he said he was going to live there--came back through--because he wanted to be in our country--came back through, ended up in Wisconsin, like all good Swiss, with my other relatives on my grandma's side, worked at a cheese factory, and was an alien for 20 years. He finally applied for citizenship when World War II was breaking out, and that is when they found out that, in fact, he maybe had come into the country two different ways. But back then, they listened to his story, and they gave him citizenship. Otherwise, he would have been deported--I think it was 3 weeks before the U.joined World War II--as a Swiss Instead, he married my grandma back then, they had my mom and my mom's brother, and here I am.  I am on the shoulders of those immigrants. So when I see these Dreamers, I see my own family, and I hope everyone in this Chamber sees the same thing--the American dream. That is why, Mr.President, I stand with the Senator from Virginia, Mr.Kaine, with Senator Durbin, and so many of my colleagues who have been working on this for so long on both sides of the aisle. There has been leadership on both sides of the aisle. So let's get this done, let's pass the Dream Act, and let's never forget that we all come from somewhere.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.

1054,topic-id,1142,"Mr.President, once more I am coming to the floor to talk about the basic rules of the Senate and how we actually get on legislation.  We have spent all of this week on four district court judicial nominations--the entire week, no legislation--because we can't get on legislation.  In 2013, we were in a situation similar to this. The minority party, at that point being the Republicans, were slowing down the process in the Senate on nominations by the Democratic Party, at that point the majority. So Republicans and Democrats sat down together and said: This is a problem. We cannot get to legislation.  The Republicans and Democrats together, with 70-plus votes, made a 2-year rule change in the Senate in the 113th It was a simple rule change: 2 hours of debate for a district court judge, 8 hours of debate for just about everyone else, and 30 hours of debate for circuit court, Supreme Court, and Cabinet nominations. It was a bipartisan agreement that worked very well for that 2-year time period.  Then, at the end of that 2-year time period, it had a sunset on it, and it expired. The hope was that we would relearn how to be able to do this. I wasn't in the Senate at that time, but I have spoken to multiple people about that process.  What happened instead was, during the first year of that, there continued to be ongoing frustration, so my Democratic colleagues used what is affectionately called the nuclear option to be able to change the rules of the Senate to say that they could bring individuals with only 51 votes--not 60--and[[Page S151]]then they used the rule, on top of what they changed, to bring people forward at greater speed, which they did. For the rest of the next year, they used it that way.  We now come to this time period. Let me give an example of what I am talking about and the frustration it creates. Let me confirm my number and make sure I get it right for all of the Senate history. From 1967 until 2012, there were 46 cloture votes invoked. That means they requested a cloture vote, and it went all the way to be a vote--46 of those on judges and the executive branch from 1967 to 2012.  Last year, there were 46 cloture votes in this body, just in 1 year. What was from 1967 until 2012 the total number, Democrats did to Republicans in 1 year--last year.  The statement keeps coming up over and over again: Why can't we get on legislation? Because each day is full of dead time, debating nominations--nominations like what passed today unanimously in the But we had to have cloture time set aside for it.  This has to be fixed. The rules of the Senate are set by the In 2013, the Senators stood up and said ``This has to stop,'' and they fixed it. I am recommending again that the Senate, once again, implement the same rule that Democrats led Republicans to do in 2013 now, in this year, and instead of doing it for one Congress, make it the rule. If it was a good idea for Democrats in 2013 and 2014, why is it not a good idea for Republicans and Democrats now?  That simple rule is, when we can't agree on a candidate, we would have only 2 hours of debate on a district judge--remembering that for the entirety of this week, it took the whole week to do four of them. We could do 2 hours of debate for each one if it is a district court judge, 8 hours for just about everybody else, or 30 hours of debate for Supreme Court, circuit court, and Cabinet-level nominations.  People would think that would be a slam dunk. So far it has not been. For some reason, my Democratic colleagues say: That rule was good for us, but it is not good for you, and it is not good for the future of the I believe it is. I believe it was a fair rule then, and it is a fair rule now. Enough debating about the rules of the Senate; let's get on to the business of the Senate and actually do what the American people sent us here to do.  Interestingly enough, there is also a very obscure rule in the Senate called rule If, at the end of the year, there are still nominations that are pending out there, those nominations have to be returned to the White House, and they have to start all over again. The Senate can agree by unanimous consent to say that we all understand these are all in process and, by unanimous consent, just agree to those things to be able to hold them on the calendar.  Let me give an example. Under President Bill Clinton, at the end of his first year, only 13 of his nominations were sent back to the White After the end of George Bush's first term, only two nominations were returned back to the White After President Obama's first term, only eight were sent back to the White After President Trump's first term, 90 were sent back--Bill Clinton, 13; George Bush, 2; President Obama, 8; President Trump, 90.  I don't think my Democratic colleagues understand that they are continuing to amp up the volume of obstruction, saying: Someone has obstructed us in the past, so we are going to do it 10 times to you. All that leads to is that the next time the Republicans are in the minority, we do it 10 times again, and it makes it worse.  There is a way to fix this. We should come to that mutual agreement. We should resolve the rules of the  We have to get on to the budget. We have to get on to the Children's Health Insurance We have to get on to intelligence issues. We have to get on to immigration. We have to get on to infrastructure. We have to get on to a lot of other things, but we are stuck debating about people, and that should be an easy one for us.  I am recommending to this body what my folks used to say to me: What is good for the goose should be good for the gander. If it was a great rule when Democrats were in the majority, it should be a great rule when Republicans are in the majority.  Let's take clean, fair rules and apply them to everyone. Let's move on with the nomination process. Let's get back to the business of doing legislation so we can get this resolved.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

410,topic-id,139,"Mr.Speaker, last month, Republicans rammed through a terrible tax bill with devastating consequences, and women are among the hardest hit. This tax plan drains funds from working mothers while giving huge tax breaks to corporations and the wealthy.  Women are breadwinners for half of the American families with children. These women often do more work for less pay.  Nearly six in ten workers in low-wage jobs are women. Women earn 82 cents on the dollar. In Michigan, it is even lower: 74 cents.  The tax plan takes away the individual mandate, so 9.5 million women could lose healthcare--annual exams, birth control, cancer screening, pregnancy support--and lose economic security.  Under this new law, the wealthiest continue to prosper at the expense of hardworking women in this country.

779,topic-id,2482,"Madam President, just last week we began the second session of the 115th We are now safely into 2018, and we should be talking about what we can accomplish for the American people in the new year. We simply face a long list of unfinished business from 2017--last year--and, unfortunately, we have a very short window in which to get it done.  We are 4 months into fiscal year 2018, and we still don't have a budget deal. I am vice chairman of the Appropriations We should have had this done long before now. Our agencies are operating under last year's funding levels. They have little flexibility to handle the problems they face today.  We still haven't reauthorized the Children's Health Insurance Program, what we call CHIP, so that puts the healthcare of 9 million children at risk. These are American children.  Nearly 800,000 Dreamers live under uncertainty and fear of deportation, living in the country they have known most of their lives. I don't know how anybody, Republican or Democrat, could call this acceptable.  Now, I know the Republicans control the House, they control the Senate, and they control the White They are in charge. They have to show responsibility and show leadership on these issues, but instead of addressing these issues, last year the Republican leadership spent time rolling back sensible regulations designed to protect the American consumer, designed to protect our environment, and designed to protect people from harassment in the workplace. They rolled those all back, and then they passed a massive tax cut for big corporations and the wealthiest of  We Democrats have been calling for bipartisan budget talks since June--7 months ago. We have passed three continuing resolutions since September of last year to give us more time to strike a deal on the budget and Dreamers and CHIP and disaster funding. These are just to name a few, but they are enormously important to the people who are experiencing the disasters or who have children who need healthcare or who are Yet, on the 102nd day of the fiscal year, there are only 9 days until the next fiscal cliff, and we don't have a budget deal.  President Trump said months ago that the country could use a good government shutdown. I don't agree with[[Page S120]]him, but I am beginning to think that is exactly what his party is angling for--a manufactured crisis to distract from the fact that they are not doing their job.  The Washington Post seemed to confirm this last December, when it reported the President privately told people that a government shutdown would be good for him politically. In all of my years in the Senate--I have been here under Republican and Democratic Presidents alike--I have never heard such damaging rhetoric come from the President of the United  Nobody wants a government shutdown--nobody. It is devastating to people not only throughout the government but to people throughout the whole country. However, that seems to be what they are vying for.  For months, I have been calling for a bipartisan budget deal that is based on parity--equal increases for defense and nondefense programs--that would provide relief from sequestration. I agree with the Republicans and Democrats who say military readiness has suffered under sequestration but so has our Nation's economy, so has our educational system, so has our infrastructure, and so has our care for our veterans.  If we want to combat the problems caused by sequestration, we have to raise the caps on both sides of the ledger. Fixing one side of the equation will not address the needs of our Nation and, even worse, will actually shortchange our military.  If we don't invest in our economy, if we don't invest in the education of our youth, the military will not have expert, qualified soldiers, the men and women on whom they rely. If we don't invest in our diplomacy, our Nation and the world become less safe. If we don't improve our cyber security defenses and our physical infrastructure, we become soft targets for those who would do us harm, both in this country and outside this country. If we don't care for our veterans, we are not going to have young men and women who are willing to serve.  This week, the majority leader came to the floor making the case for increased defense spending. He asked us to listen to our nonpartisan military leaders about what they think is needed to keep this country safe. I couldn't agree more.  To that end, I have two letters signed by a combined 560 retired admirals, generals, and other former military members. I ask unanimous consent to have these letters printed in the Record following my remarks.  I have no idea what these admirals', generals', and others' political parties are, but they make the case that we have to increase our investment in domestic priorities--including education and childcare, as well as diplomacy--if we are going to keep our country safe and support our military. Secretary of Defense Mattis said even more bluntly: If we do not fully fund the State Department, we should be prepared to buy more ammunition for our military.  The wisdom of our military leaders notwithstanding, Republicans appear to be dug in. They claim equal increases for both defense and nondefense programs would add too much to our deficit and burden our children. It is one over the other. It is hard to have somebody say that with a straight face in the wake of the President signing a tax bill to add $1.5 trillion to our Nation's debt and to benefit primarily large corporations and the wealthiest You can't make the argument that we can't afford to take care of our domestic needs. It is simply not credible.  Budget negotiations are not the only place where Republicans haven't engaged in a productive way. President Trump's decision to end the DACA Program has put nearly 800,000 Dreamers in this country in an untenable position. The decision was as cruel as it was senseless. It may make a tweet that people look at, but if you are one of those Dreamers and you are on your way to school and are expecting a scholarship to college and you don't know if you are going to be in this country tomorrow, that is not a tweet.  The President should have worked with He should have found a permanent legislative solution while keeping DACA protections in place. I believe he terminated the program under false pretenses, yielding to xenophobic voices in his administration, and last night a Federal judge issued an order that said just that: Terminating DACA was not required under the law--far from it. But a court order that only temporarily halts the administration from dismantling DACA provides little comfort to They live each and every day uncertain of the future and with fear of deportation.  Now, I have heard Members of the Senate trying to decide at what time we are going to finish voting for the week. Their big fear is this: Are we going to make our flight home?  Dreamers have to worry if their flight is going to be out of this country and back to a country they don't even know. They worry if they will have to leave the country they know and love.  Dreamers are Americans in every way, except on paper. They were brought here as children, through no fault of their own. They are law-abiding members of our community. They attend school. They serve as doctors and teachers. They defend our homeland as brave men and women in uniform.  This is a crisis of the President's own making. Now, Congress needs to pick up the pieces. I hope, after the meeting yesterday, we will be allowed to pick up the pieces. We have spent months trying to find a path forward, but you can't find one if the administration keeps moving the goalposts.  We need to address the fate of the Dreamers now. You can take a poll in this country. The American people want us to. Also, look at the broad bipartisan support on display yesterday at the White Republicans and Democrats want to fix the mess that the President created. A solution should be within our grasp.  The White House has made unreasonable demands, such as $18 billion of American tax dollars to build a wall on the southern border, in exchange for The $18 billion wall is last century's solution. It does nothing for this century.  If they really believe Mexico is going to pay for it, I have a solution. Open a bank account and, as Mexico sends us money, then use it to build a wall. Don't ask the American taxpayers, who are strapped at home, to pay for something the President says the Mexicans will pay for. Open an account, find out if they are telling the truth, let the money come into the account, and then build it.  But, worse, don't use the Dreamers as negotiable commodities. They are not commodities. They are human beings. They are people who deserve to have their dreams. Let's pass a bill--we could do it this week--protecting Dreamers now. Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White This is their government.  We have a week and a half before the next continuing resolution expires. We have a lot to do. Let's get serious. Let's get to work. I am willing to work here every day, every night, right through the weekend. Let's get it done. We are not doing it for us. We are doing it for all the American people. Let's do it for all the American people--not for special interests, not for one party. Let's do it for all the American people. It could be done, if we want to.

The stunning fact is that      today, 71 percent of young adults ages 17 to 24 cannot      qualify for military service because they are too poorly      educated, medically or physically unfit, or have a      disqualifying record of crime or drug abuse. if these issues      are not addressed, the Nation risks a shortage of qualified      recruits--one that will leave the country vulnerable for      years to come.[[Page S121]]       Mounting research shows that the early years of life have      an incredible impact on educational attainment, behaviors and      health. High-quality early interventions can help vulnerable      children succeed in school, stay on the right side of the law      and achieve a healthy weight in the long-term. These outcomes      open the doors for many career paths, including military      service.       Long-term studies of early education programs show      impressive differences in children's educational outcomes. A      recent analysis of Head Start outcomes, comparing siblings      who did versus did not attend the program, found participants      showing increased probability of graduating from high school,      attending college, and receiving a postsecondary credential.      High-quality state preschool programs have also demonstrated      lasting effects on students' elementary-school performance.

We know from our service in uniform that many of the crises      our nation faces do not have military solutions alone--from      confronting violent extremist groups like ISIS in the Middle      East and North Africa to preventing pandemics like Ebola and      stabilizing weak and fragile states that can lead to greater      instability. There are 65 million displaced people today, the      most since World War II, with consequences including refugee      flows that are threatening America's strategic allies in      Israel, Jordan, Turkey, and       The State Department, USAID, Millennium Challenge      Corporation, Peace Corps and other development agencies are      critical to preventing conflict and reducing the need to put      our men and women in uniform in harm's way. As Secretary      James Mattis said while Commander of U.Central Command,      ``If you don't fully fund the State Department, then I need      to buy more ammunition.'' The military will lead the fight      against terrorism on the battlefield, but it needs strong      civilian partners in the battle against the drivers of      extremism--lack of opportunity, insecurity, injustice, and      hopelessness.       We recognize that America's strategic investments in      diplomacy and development--like all of U.investments--must      be effective and accountable. Significant reforms have been      undertaken since 9/11, many of which have been embodied in      recent legislation in Congress with strong bipartisan      support--on human trafficking, the rights of women and girls,      trade and energy in Africa, wildlife trafficking, water, food      security, and transparency and accountability.       We urge you to ensure that resources for the International      Affairs Budget keep pace with the growing global threats and      opportunities we face.

Maybe they      think it will be good for them politically. Maybe they      believe the chaos created by a government shutdown would be a      welcome distraction from the ongoing Russia investigation      being conducted by special counsel Robert Mueller      Whatever the motives of the Republican leadership, one thing      is clear: A government shutdown would be disastrous for the      American people.       A shutdown would harm tens of millions of working-class      families who would be unable to access vital services. It      would disrupt the lives of hundreds of thousands of federal      employees who would not receive the paychecks they expected.      It would endanger members of the U.military who are      putting their lives on the line defending our nation.       Congress has a responsibility to the American people to      prevent a shutdown and work in a bipartisan manner to reach a      fair budget agreement that addresses the very serious      problems facing the working people of our country.       Unfortunately, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-     Ky.) ratcheted up threats of a government shutdown last week      by insisting on ending the long-standing, bipartisan      agreement over parity for defense and non-defense spending.      This principle of parity is enormously important for working      families and is something that cannot be terminated. If we do      not act, funding for education, child care, health care,      nutrition assistance, affordable housing and other important      domestic programs will be at a 40-year low as a percentage of      our economy.       As the middle class continues to shrink, cuts to non-     defense spending would cause even worse economic pain to      working families, the elderly, children, the sick and the      most vulnerable. Meanwhile, as Trump and the Republicans      demand an unbelievable $100 billion increase in military      spending over the next two years, the Defense Department has      been inoculated from budget cuts over the past several years      because of the Overseas Contingency Operations loophole--a      special account not subject to spending caps established by      Congress in 2011.       Providing parity in these budget negotiations means, among      other things, fully funding--without offsets--the Children's      Health Insurance Program for 9 million kids and community      health centers for 27 million It means increased      funding for the Social Security Administration and the      Veterans Administration so they can provide guaranteed      benefits to seniors and veterans who have earned them. It      means keeping our obligations to more than 1.5 million      workers and retirees who are about to lose a large part of      the pensions they were promised. It means addressing the      crisis of student debt, expanding child care, improving our      crumbling infrastructure in rural America and protecting our      national parks. It means providing help in the national      struggle against opioid and heroin addiction.       Furthermore, as part of the budget negotiations, we must      also provide adequate disaster relief to Texas, Florida,      Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, as well as assistance to      the Western states recovering from terrible wildfires.       Finally, Trump added even more fuel to the fire when he      decided to use 800,000 ``dreamers'' as a bargaining chip for      an $18 billion wall that the overwhelming majority of      Americans do not want. These dreamers are young people who      have lived in this country for almost their entire lives.      They go to school. They work. They serve in the U.     military. The United States is their home; they know no      other. For Trump and the Republican leadership to allow their      legal status to expire, and to subject them to deportation,      would be one of the cruelest acts in modern American history.      It must not be allowed to happen.       This is not just my viewpoint. It's what the American      people want. A recent Quinnipiac University poll showed that      77 percent of the American people, including a large majority      of Republicans, support providing legal protections for the      dreamers. The Republican Congress must act. A clean Dream Act      must be signed into law as part of any budget agreement.       The American people are increasingly disgusted with a      government that protects the interests of the wealthy and the      powerful, while ignoring the needs of the vulnerable. The      U.government must do more than provide huge tax breaks to      billionaires, callously deport young people, greatly expand      military spending, end net neutrality, deny the reality of      climate change and threaten to cut Social Security, Medicare,      Medicaid, education and nutrition programs. We must pass a      budget agreement that addresses the needs of Americans and      not just billionaire campaign contributors.[[Page S122]]    ",CREC-2018-01-10-pt1-PgS113-7.txt,1383,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2018.0,10.0,January

818,topic-id,1524,"Mr.President, according to Landmine Monitor, which is the world's best source of data on the production, use, export, stockpiling, and clearance of landmines, cluster munitions, and other unexploded ordnance, 2016 was a terrible year for casualties caused by mines and other  In 2016, the Monitor recorded 8,605 casualties, of which at least 2,089 people were fatalities. That is the highest number since 1999, and it includes the most casualties of children ever recorded. Civilians represented 78 percent of recorded casualties in 2016. There are still 61 countries that are known to be contaminated with landmines.  On the positive side, approximately 232,000 landmines were destroyed in 2016, and 66 square miles of land were cleared of mines and other International donors and UXO affected countries increased support in 2016 for UXO clearance programs by $40 million above the previous year to $564.5 million. The United States was, like previous years, by far the largest donor.  It is also encouraging that, since March 1, 1999, when the international treaty banning antipersonnel landmines came into force, 163 countries have joined. That is an extraordinary achievement for a treaty that owes its existence to the vision and perseverance of hundreds of advocacy, human rights, arms control, humanitarian organizations, and journalists, around the world, and the leadership of former Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy; yet despite this progress and substantial declining in the past few years, the number of innocent people maimed and killed by mines has steadily increased.  There are several explanations for this. Rebel groups like ISIS routinely use landmines and other improvised explosive devices. The wars in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Yemen have been largely responsible. It may never be possible to completely eradicate the use of landmines by rebel groups, for the weapon is so cheap to manufacture while causing such harm.  But the major powers that have not joined the treaty--the United States, Russia, China, Pakistan, and India--also share the blame. Antipersonnel landmines, which are designed to be triggered indiscriminately by the victim, whether an unsuspecting farmer or an enemy or friendly combatant, have no place in the arsenals of modern militaries. It is hypocrisy to claim on the one hand, as our military does, that it uses every precaution to avoid harming civilians and prides itself on its precision weapons, and on the other hand to insist on the right to use a weapon that is the antithesis of precise and overwhelmingly harms civilians.  I have spoken more times than I can count about the scourge of antipersonnel landmines and the need for the United States to join the Mine Ban Treaty so we are no longer an excuse for other countries not to join. Our military has not used landmines for more than two decades. In fact, U.policy now strictly limits the use of antipersonnel mines to the Korean Peninsula, but we do not need them. What we need is the best protection for our troops to maneuver safely through minefields. We should have banned these indiscriminate weapons a long time ago, and we would have if landmines were blowing off the arms and legs of children in this Nation the way they are in others, but we have learned that the Pentagon is not in the habit of giving up weapons, even if they are weapons that deserve to be relegated to the dustbin of history. That decision will only be made by a President who is willing to do what is morally right.  Landmines have been aptly described as weapons of mass destruction in slow[[Page S136]]motion. President Trump reacted with anger and disgust, as he should have, when Syria's President Assad used chlorine gas against his own people. He should react the same way toward antipersonnel landmines and set an example for the rest of the world.  I ask unanimous consent that a January 6, 2018, New York Times editorial on this subject be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, 6, 2018]                 Why Do Land Mines Still Kill So Many?                        (By the Editorial Board)       The world is rolling backward, and at a disturbingly faster      pace, in the struggle to limit carnage from land mines and      other booby-trap explosives. The most recent numbers,      covering 2016, are appalling.       Known casualties that year came to 8,605, including 2,089      deaths, according to a new report by Landmine Monitor, a      research arm of the International Campaign to Ban      The toll was nearly 25 percent higher than the 6,967 maimed      and dead counted a year earlier, and more than double the      3,993 in 2014. And these numbers are almost assuredly an      undercount. ``In some states and areas, numerous casualties      go unrecorded,'' Landmine Monitor said.       Much of the 2016 mayhem stemmed from conflicts in      Afghanistan, Libya, Ukraine and Yemen, but people in 56      countries and other areas were killed or wounded by      improvised explosive devices and other ordnance placed by      governments or, more commonly, by insurgent groups. The sheer      indecency of it is self-evident. Nearly 80 percent of the      victims were civilians; children accounted for 42 percent of      civilian casualties in situations where the ages were known.       One subset of the menace, cluster munitions, is singularly      vicious. A single cluster bomb can contain dozens, even      hundreds, of baseball-size bomblets that spray in all      directions, ripping apart anything in their path. All too      often, they fail to detonate right away and thus become time      bombs that imperil unwary civilians who pick them up,      including curious children. Cluster munitions alone caused      971 known casualties in 2016, more than twice the toll of the      previous year, according to Cluster Munition Most      victims were Syrians, nearly all of them civilians, but Saudi      Arabia has also used American-supplied cluster bombs in            Perhaps the saddest part of all this is that for well over      a decade the world seemed to have gotten a grip on what are      referred to generically as the ``explosive remnants of war.''      Thanks to an international treaty that came into force in      1999--now signed by 163 countries and banning the production,      stockpiling and transfer of land mines--casualties declined      steadily worldwide. They reached a low of 3,450 in 2013,      compared with 9,228 in 1999. (A companion treaty outlawing      cluster munitions, joined by 119 countries, went into effect      in 2010.) As the death and injury toll for 2016 shows, nearly      all that hard-won progress has been erased by the brutal      conflicts of recent vintage.       The picture is not irredeemably bleak. The Landmine Monitor      said that 32 donors, led by the United States, contributed      nearly $480 million in 2016 for mine clearance and victim      aid. That was an increase of 22 percent from the year before.      More than 232,000 antipersonnel mines were reportedly      destroyed in 2016, and about 66 square miles--an area nearly      the size of Brooklyn--were cleared of explosive hazards.       The grim reality, though, is that the land mine and cluster      munitions treaties are undercut by the refusal of some of      modern warfare's most powerful players to sign them. Among      those countries are China, Iran, Israel, North Korea, Russia      and Saudi And the United The Pentagon has      long insisted that eliminating cluster bombs could put      soldiers at risk. As for land mines, they are deemed by      Washington to be a useful tool in the demilitarized zone      separating North and South Korea--a first-line defense for      the South against a possible invasion. But given the North's      nuclear buildup, a mined DMZ seems to be a Cold War vestige      of diminished value.       Washington is not immune to international suasion. Land      mines are so stigmatized that American forces have barely      used them since the 1991 Persian Gulf war. The United States      stockpile, estimated at three million mines, is significantly      reduced from pre-treaty years; it's puny compared with the 26      million mines that Russia has on hand, according to the      International Campaign to Ban Similarly, American      reliance on cluster munitions, which peaked in the early      stages of the 2003 Iraq war, has all but disappeared.       In 2014 the Obama administration even signaled it might be      willing to join the anti-mine treaty. Regrettably, that step      never came. It might have been a moral statement encouraging      others to follow suit. Now, with President Trump openly      disdainful of international agreements, the likelihood of      Washington's signing the treaty would seem to be about zero.      The Pentagon, under his ultimate control, recently authorized      the military to restock older cluster munitions, whose      immediate failure rate can be high, leaving bomblets that can      explode and kill civilians even years later.       For countries like Afghanistan, Libya, Ukraine and Yemen,      the risks may endure long after the guns go silent. Vietnam      provides an example. Since the war there ended in 1975, at      least 40,000 Vietnamese are believed to have been killed and      another 60,000 wounded by American land mines, artillery      shells, cluster bombs and other ordnance that failed to      detonate back then. They later exploded when handled by      scrap-metal scavengers and unsuspecting children.       The lesson is stark for today's war-torn countries. They      could reap the same whirlwind in coming decades.

171,topic-id,1424,"Mr.President, I rise today to honor the life of a truly remarkable man: Thomas Monson, the president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  On Tuesday night, at the age of 90, President Monson was called home by his Heavenly I expect that his reunion with his wife Frances was a joyous occasion, and I am confident that this reunion will provide comfort to his three children and eight grandchildren.  But President Monson's legacy is far greater than his family, even though that was of paramount importance to President Monson and his wife President Monson's legacy also includes the countless men and women whose lives were touched by him, as well as the confident, global church he helped to shepherd, to expand, and to strengthen.  Consider this: In the 54 years Thomas Monson served as an apostle, church membership swelled from 2 million to 16 million. That accomplishment is a blessing from God, but it was realized by saints like President Monson, who devoted their lives to serving Him--in his case, starting at an exceptionally young age.  Thomas Monson was born and raised in Salt Lake City in a large and devoutly faithful family. He attended Utah State He served with honor in the U.Navy Reserve, and he worked for a time in printing, including for the Deseret  By the age of 22, he was the bishop of a ward, a local congregation in Salt Lake City, charged with guiding over 1,000 people in their walks with  By 36 he was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, one of the youngest people ever to receive that special calling.  But Brother Monson did not give in to hubris as a result of those unexpected and, in many cases, early promotions. Quite the opposite, he was humbled by the very heavy mantle that had been placed on his shoulders with each of these callings.  Members of President Monson's ward remember the young bishop as a steady companion to people who were enduring struggles and hardship. There were 80 widows in his ward, and Bishop Monson took the time to visit every single one of them on a regular basis. Also in his ward were 18 servicemen fighting in the Korean war. Every month, he sent letters to those 18 men to remind them that they had not been forgotten, and even decades later, he would speak of these servicemen and widows during the church's General Conference meeting. His love for them could still be felt by those in attendance.  Those stories illustrate the kind of man President Monson truly was. I can testify to this fact through personal anecdotes of my own, including the fact that in 2010, shortly after I had been elected to the U.Senate, President Monson invited me, along with[[Page S38]]my wife Sharon and our three children, to visit with him in his office in Salt Lake He prayed with us, encouraged us, and offered us counsel. As much as anything, we just felt honored that he would take the time to meet with us and show interest in our lives.  This is perhaps the single most consistent thread in President Monson's life. He was someone who at every step of his life, at every stage of his service, was always willing to reach out to others, to visit them even without anyone else expecting it. He was known--famous, in fact--for routinely interrupting his daily routine just to visit someone who happened to be sick, who happened to be in the hospital, who happened to be going through something difficult. President Monson didn't always know the reason why he needed to visit the person in advance; he just knew it needed to be done, and he always did.  There are lessons that we can learn here in the U.Senate about this type of service--this type of service that is selfless, that is eternal in its scope and in its reach, this type of service that blesses the lives of other human beings without any expectation of remuneration. He was a leader who understood how even small, seemingly insignificant acts of kindness could affect people's lives in profound, lasting ways.  He always urged his brothers and sisters within the church and elsewhere to be on the lookout for signs that God was calling them to help. ``Never fail to follow a prompting of the Holy Spirit,'' he would say, and on a regular basis, he did just that. This could mean visiting a relative in the hospital or delivering a meal to a coworker who was mourning a loss or just checking in on a friend he hadn't seen in a while.  For President Monson, it was always about taking time for that personal connection. President Monson knew that little encounters build strong relationships--and strong saints.  In 2008, President Thomas Monson was called to lead the church. He proved to be a good steward of the church in a fast-moving world and in an expanding, growing faith community. Many obituaries have already noted how in 2012 he lowered the age requirement for missionaries, a decision that increased the missionary force in short order from 52,000 to almost 70,000. That is almost 20,000 more young people to spread the Gospel and daily serve in those communities around the world.  But President Monson did far more than that to strengthen the church's commitment to caring for the least in our community. Under his leadership, the church expanded its poverty and disaster relief programs. He even added ``caring for the poor and needy'' to the church's official mission statement.  President Monson lived in Utah almost his entire life, but his heart was with the church spreading throughout the world. During the depths of the Cold War, he helped lead the Latter-day Saints trapped behind the Iron Mormons in the Soviet Union were poor just like everyone else. They didn't have a temple, and their governments forbade them from traveling abroad. As a result, they didn't have access to temple ceremonies that are central to our faith. That didn't sit well with President  As he told his brothers and sisters from the pulpit during a trip to East Germany, he wanted them to share in ``every blessing'' of the faith. So he gave everything he had to help those people, even the shirt off his own back--quite literally. He returned from one trip to the Soviet Union in his house slippers because he had given his spare clothes to the less fortunate, a funny story that brings to mind the words of the Savior: ``[For] I was a stranger, and ye took me in: [I was] naked, and ye clothed me.''  Around that time, President Monson began two decades of quiet diplomacy with the Soviet authorities, including with Erich Honecker himself. His labor reaped a tremendous harvest. In a regime that was hostile to religion and to outsiders, he won approval for Mormon missionaries to come and spread the  In 1985, he won an even bigger triumph when a temple opened behind the Iron Curtain in Freiberg, Ninety thousand East Germans attended the dedication of that temple.  He had followed a prompting of the The result was nothing less than that dramatic, impactful tear in the Iron Curtain, one that had stifled religious belief, but religious belief was facilitated by this noble servant of the Lord Jesus  These are just a few stories from President Monson's life that I have shared, and I would like to conclude with just one more. Not long ago, President Monson was asked what he wanted for his birthday, which was coming up. Here was his simple response:       Do something for someone else on that day to make his or      her life better. Find someone who is having a hard time, or      is ill, or lonely, and do something for them. That's all I      would ask.  President Monson was always looking for little ways to help other people. That wish is as true in death as it was in life. In lieu of flowers for his funeral, the church has requested contributions be made to the church's Humanitarian Aid  President Monson's legacy will outlast his death because he chose to follow the One who conquered death, taking upon Himself the sins, the transgressions, the pains, the miseries of all mankind so that we, too, might return to live with  President Monson will be missed.

555,topic-id,580,"Mr.Speaker, I agree with Mr.Sensenbrenner for the reasons he has outlined that this bill should not become law. However, I am also speaking in favor of the Amash amendment that has been put in order that would fix the problems that he has so eloquently outlined.  Before 702 was enacted into law, the NSA and the FBI would need to get a probable cause warrant to collect this information. We made a major change that allows this information to be collected when a foreigner is communicating with an American, and when you go to the ``abouts'' collection, which the underlying bill would codify, even when that doesn't occur, when there is merely discussion of a foreigner. That is not what I think our Constitution requires. And we did not outsource to the judicial branch or the executive branch the decision on what the Constitution requires us to do.

It ends reverse targeting. It bans the ``abouts'' collection and prohibits the collection of domestic communications, prevents the misuse of information on Americans, and is something that we should support.  Now, in a letter to the Senate in October, a coalition of groups said this:       The USA RIGHTS Act, which is essentially the Amash      amendment, is markedly superior to all current legislative      proposals to reauthorize section 702.

We took that oath to defend the Constitution every day, in every way, and with every bill. And without the Amash amendment, this bill falls short.  Just a note on where we are in the timing. It is true that this has been delayed, I would say unconscionably delayed, for this proceeding. But we have more time than has been suggested.

It is the content of your phone calls, content of your emails, and the content of your text messages and video messages. Under section 702, you can search that for Americans for crimes that have nothing to do with terrorism. We should change that.

I am overjoyed to see members of the community empowering our veterans and I am honored to say that this organization was founded in my home State, in my hometown, by one of my high school classmates, John ``Big Daddy''  John founded the K94Heroes program after connecting with one of our other classmates, an elementary classmate, who specializes in service dog training for veterans. In 2015, John and his daughter established K94Heroes and raised private funds to mitigate training costs. Together, they work tirelessly to ensure every veteran who deserves a service dog receives one.  We owe it to those who protected us abroad the assurance of protection here at home. With upstanding citizens like John ``Big Daddy'' Lipscomb and with continued action on the Federal level, we will be able to better protect our veterans who sacrifice so much for this country. Still, this Congress must make continued efforts toward veteran suicide prevention, and I commend the efforts of organizations such as                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-09-pt1-PgH24.txt,2328,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2018.0,9.0,January

167,topic-id,1576,"Mr.President, I rise today as brave citizens in Iran are taking to the streets to exercise their fundamental right to freely express their opinions and protest against their government.  As a democracy founded on core values, including the freedom of speech, equal rights under the law, and basic human dignity, the United States must always stand up for those peacefully advocating for these principles. For decades America has championed these principles, not only because they are right but because they promote our interests. We know that nations whose governments respect human rights and freedom of expression, that uphold the rule of law, and that protect the civil rights and liberties of their people serve as America's most reliable allies, most strategic security relationships, and most prosperous economic partners. Our enduring belief in democratic values compels all of us to stand up, not as Democrats or Republicans but as Americans, and to support citizens around the world courageously protesting the regimes that oppress them.  We stand with those who speak out, and even risk their own lives, to make their voices heard in the struggle against oppression, inequality, and injustice. The fact that today's protests in Iran are against a regime that engages in activity that directly threatens our Nation, our allies, and our security interests is a separate matter.  Iran's leaders may try to blame the protests on outside forces, but in reality this unrest is homegrown. The Iranians marching in Tehran know exactly who is to blame for the hardship, inequality, and oppression they face in their daily lives. It is the regime itself. For those who have closely followed the developments in Iran for years, it is no surprise to learn that the regime continues to disregard the basic rights of its citizens. The regime has proven that it has no moral qualms with forcing the innocent to suffer. Already security forces are responsible for the deaths of more than 20 Iranian protesters. They have detained and imprisoned hundreds of people who are simply speaking their minds.  Of course, these abuses are just one example of the consistently odious behavior we have witnessed from Iran in recent years. This is a regime that has proven that it is more interested in building ballistic missiles than building bridges, that believes money is better spent on terrorist networks in Lebanon and Syria than on schools and hospitals for the Iranian people, that any revenue generated by Iran's international energy deals go directly into the pockets of those fomenting discord in the region and not into the hands of Iranian citizens trying to feed their families, and that will continue to engage in malign activity that isolates it from the community of nations, directly at the expense of the Iranian people. For these reasons and many more, I sincerely hope that the international community lives up to its responsibility to support all those who are protesting this repressive regime.  However, words go only so far. The United States must continue to lead international efforts to counter the Iranian regime's destabilizing behavior overseas. Unfortunately, this administration has yet to take the lead. We hear plenty of bluster from this President, but threatening tweets do not constitute policy nor can they hold Iran culpable. Putting a nation ``on notice'' means nothing if there are no policies put in place. We need a real strategy that addresses Iran's destabilizing activities in the Middle East, whether it is the regime's continued support for terrorist networks, illegal ballistic missile development, or human rights abuses and political interference in other countries.  These threats are what compelled me to work with my colleagues across the[[Page S36]]aisle last year to pass the Countering Iran's Destabilizing Activities Act, a bill to hold Iran accountable for its ongoing support for terrorism, ballistic missile proliferation, and human rights abuses. This legislation passed the Senate with an overwhelming bipartisan majority of 98 to 2. Ultimately, it served as the base text of the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which addressed a wide range of hostile behavior from not just Iran but from Russia and North Korea as well. This bill calls for the administration to develop a comprehensive regional strategy to deter conventional and asymmetric threats. We are fast approaching the deadline for that strategy.  More importantly, however, we have heard the President say for more than a year that he was going to develop a plan to hold Iran accountable. Thus far, we have seen nothing more than tough talk. The reality is that this administration has yet to fully implement critical provisions of this law that could substantively counter Iran's nefarious behavior. The bill gives the President the authority to target human rights abusers, including those complicit in the ongoing repression of protesters, but he has yet to use that authority. The bill also authorizes the President to go after those individuals and entities that are violating international arms embargoes, exporting hateful ideologies and weapons across the region and fomenting violence and chaos against innocent civilians in Syria and Yemen, but he has yet to go after these actors.  While the administration designated Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps under terrorism authority--something I applaud--it has not effectively targeted actors associated with the  All of my colleagues know that I was deeply skeptical and strongly opposed to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of I voted against the JCPOA precisely because I thought it was a mistake to roll back sanctions on Iran without the total dismantlement of its nuclear infrastructure. However, refusing to certify Iran's compliance with a deeply flawed deal, as the President did in October, does little to address its shortcomings. The President's move in October was a hollow attempt to fulfill a campaign promise while continuing to let Iran enjoy the benefits of the JCPOA and continue its non-nuclear malign activities throughout the region. Furthermore, this decision was carried without a clear path forward and without specific proposals that could have garnered critical international support.  At the end of the day, the Trump administration's actions may have actually left the United States with less leverage to address Iran's far-reaching, nefarious behavior in the Middle East, whether it be its support for terrorism, its human rights abuses, or its illegal ballistic missile development. None of these critical security challenges are addressed simply by not certifying the JCPOA, nor does it move us toward a comprehensive international strategy for the nuclear program Iran plans to resume immediately following this agreement's expiration. In short, the President's own lack of policy has squandered whatever leverage he may have hoped to gain.  Furthermore, the President has severely disadvantaged himself by gutting the very instruments in his national security apparatus that should be taking the lead on Iran and all foreign policy matters. As an architect of the sanctions networks that crippled Iran's economy and forced its leaders to negotiate with the international community, I know how essential our diplomatic arsenal is to confronting  The President, however, seems committed to hollowing out those agencies and offices that are in the best position to advance our diplomatic interests. The Trump administration, for example, has shuttered the office of sanctions policy at the State The Office of Foreign Assets Control at the Treasury Department is now woefully understaffed. As the President publicly talks about supporting democracy, his administration has scrapped funding for human rights and democracy programs and even removed the word ``democracy'' from USAID's mission statement.  Meanwhile, Iran continues to increase its presence in Iraq, to maintain support for the terrorist organization Hezbollah, and to take credit for Bashar al-Assad's murderous grip on power in  The United States must be willing to work with its allies if we are serious about holding Iran accountable. We should be corralling our allies in Europe to begin treating all of Hezbollah's entities as terrorist organizations. We should be moving our allies toward the development of a comprehensive international strategy for addressing Iran's nuclear ambitions once the JCPOA expires.  Finally, this administration must prioritize the release of American citizens unjustly arrested and detained in Today, Princeton University student Xiyue Wang, a scholar from one of the most renowned academic institutions in the world, in my home State of New Jersey, remains in prison under ridiculous charges of espionage. Similarly, Siamak Namazi, a former student of Rutgers University in New Jersey, remains in prison, along with his father, a former UNICEF employee. And Robert Levinson remains missing after more than 10 years.  In short, this President's approach toward Iran thus far has been a disjointed mix of campaign promises, bluster, and confusing signals to our allies--not a serious consideration of how to effectively confront an existing and growing threat.  So, as we approach a legally mandated deadline for the President to present Congress and the American people with a sound policy to confront a real threat, I call on the President to make use of our incredible national security establishment, to consult experts who can help formulate a strong, sound policy capable of confronting Iran's destabilizing behavior in the Middle East, and to implement a strategy that will effectively confront Iran's continued support for international terrorism, its belligerent ballistic missile tests, and its ongoing public and brutal abuses of human rights within its own borders and around the world.

769,topic-id,1787,"Mr.President, here we are at the start of a new year. Last year, the Republican majority decided to dedicate the year to government by and for the powerful and the privileged, but how about this year, 2018? We pay attention to our Constitution, which starts with that vision of government, not for the powerful, not for the rich, not for the privileged, not for the well connected, not for the wealthy but for the people of the United It is a vision where power is distributed, and power comes up from each individual citizen to create policies for their general welfare.  Last year, we saw this complete dedication to trying to wipe out healthcare for 20 million to 30 million Americans in order to provide tax benefits for the richest. How big were those tax benefits? Well, if you add up the provisions that are dedicated to the powerful corporations and those benefits for the wealthiest 10 percent, and most of that goes to the wealthiest 1 percent, those provisions stack up to over $2 trillion--$2 trillion.  It is very hard to get your hands around $2 trillion. Those are not numbers we use in ordinary conversation. Let's take that down to the amount of money per man, woman, and child--per citizen in Well, that is about $6,000--$6,000 taken from the community funds for every man, woman, and child in America to deliver to the wealthiest That was government by the Republican majority in 2017. It was not ``We the People'' but we the powerful and we the privileged.  How about we have a new year's resolution that pays attention to the vision of our Constitution, to that vision of government of, by, and for the people?  Ben Franklin once wrote in his ``Poor Richard's Almanac'':       Be at war with your vices,       At peace with your neighbors,       And let every New Year find you a better man.  Every new year is a chance to recreate and reenvision where we are headed. Certainly, it is a big vice to use this Chamber, in contravention of our Constitution, to pursue policies for the powerful and privileged rather than for the people. So let's set that vice aside and have a bipartisan year, dedicated to making a foundation for families to thrive and jobs and education and healthcare and a healthier planet.  Right now, we should have an immediate new year's checklist of things to get done, and that checklist starts with the budget. We have just 9 days until funding runs out for the Federal Government, and we all know from experience what that means--parks shut down, medical research stops, passports don't get processed, and businesses can't check in on their I-9 applications for employees. That is the type of conduct that happens in banana republics--basically, in countries that don't have a competent system of government. It should not happen in the United States of  We are deep into the financial year, which started on October 1. October passed. November passed. December passed. We are well into January and still the majority leadership of this body is unable to put together a process that addresses just key, fundamental issues. Why is that? Because they were so distracted by delivering trillions of dollars to the richest of Americans and trying to destroy healthcare for millions of Americans that they didn't tend to the fundamentals that need to be tended to. Let's take care of those things now.  The Children's Health Insurance Here we are. It expired on September 30 of last year. Nine million children across America depend on this insurance. This insurance was crafted in a bipartisan manner. It was forged in an agreement between Senator Hatch, a Republican, and Senator Kennedy, a Democrat, who had very different visions of America but who could agree that families who didn't qualify for Medicaid and weren't affluent enough to buy insurance for their children could still have insurance for their children. These are the working poor of America, the struggling workers of  It was forged in a bipartisan manner, but this year my Republican colleagues decided to make these children a bargaining chip for their effort to get more for the privileged and the powerful. That has to end.  When children do not have insurance, they don't get that dental benefit to take care of those cavities. They don't get that medical exam. They don't get those inoculations, those vaccinations. They don't get treatment when they are injured because their parents can't afford to take them to the doctor. They don't get treatment when they are sick for the same reason. Let's take care of children's healthcare.  This is not a partisan issue. It was forged in a bipartisan manner, and it should be so today.  What also expired on September 30 of last year was the legislation authorizing support for our community health clinics. Community health clinics are the front door to healthcare for millions of It is that friendly place in your rural community, in your urban neighborhood, where you can go through the front door and get assistance.  Talking about millions of Americans who go through those front doors, there are more than 1,400 clinics across the country. These are popular in rural areas. They are popular in urban areas. They are popular in red They are popular in blue There is nothing partisan about it, but the leadership of this body has no interest, has seen no urgency in reauthorizing the ability for those health centers to stay open.  In Oregon we saw, as a result of the Affordable Care Act, 30 more health clinics established. We saw a lot more resources go into both mental illness and into drug abuse during a period in which the opioid crisis joined the meth crisis and afflicted both rural and urban areas. Lots of folks come to this floor and say: We have to take on opioids. It is not just on the left-hand side of the aisle, but it is also on the right-hand side of the aisle. People base virtually their entire campaigns on taking on opioids. Yet the Republican leadership says this isn't important. Let me tell you, this is important, and we need to get it done.  Then let's turn to the Dream Dreamers are those children raised in our communities, now 16 through their midtwenties. They are productive members of our communities. They have gone through our high schools or are in high school now. They are in college. They are working. They are contributing. They know no other country than ours.  Across both sides of the aisle we hear folks say: We want to take care of them and establish a structure for this, a legal structure for the  The President yesterday hosted a bipartisan conversation at the White House to say: Let's get this done. He expressed his support. In fact, everyone in the room expressed support for getting this done.  Each one of these--the budget, the children's healthcare, the health centers, the Dream Act--are bipartisan efforts. These are things that should have been addressed long ago if my Republican colleagues instead weren't so[[Page S116]]obsessed with decimating healthcare for millions of Americans and ripping off the National Treasury to deliver benefits to the wealthiest  Let's get this done for our More than 100 a day are losing their status, which means they can no longer legally work in our country. It matters. It is urgent. It is productive for our communities. It is bipartisan. Let's get it done.  How about disaster relief? We certainly saw a powerful punch against our States from the raging forest fires in the West to the hurricanes in the South and Hurricanes have hit Texas and Florida and Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands--massive destruction. Fires have scourged States from Montana to Idaho, to Washington, to Oregon, to Those fires burned well into the winter months of November and  These afflictions hit Democrats and Republicans, red States and blue Why don't we get this done? These are basic, bipartisan, let's-get-it-done agendas. Let's get it done now.  Let's make sure, when we are addressing the impact of those storms in the South and those hurricanes--Harvey, Irma, and Maria--we simultaneously recognize the destructive impact forest fires have had that have been scourging the They have destroyed a lot of the infrastructure in the forest that needs to be replaced. They have affected a lot of communities that need economic help recovering.  Certainly, it made us recognize that we have millions of acres of forests that can become much more fire resilient if they are thinned, if we get rid of the fuel buildup on the floor of the forests. When they become more resilient, they stop the forest fires.  Thinning is a win-win. It produces a steady supply of sawlogs for the mill and stops forest fires when they are raging. There was a forest fire headed right for Sisters, OR, and it hit an area that had been thinned. Guess what. It stopped. The trees were farther apart. The fuels were removed from the floor of the forest.  Now we have created a real fire hazard with our clear-cut strategy of years past--the forestry grows very close together, often replanted. Trees are all the same height. It is very easy for the fire to get into the canopy, and once in the canopy, every tree is touching the next tree. It rages on, and there is no break.  But a natural forest is very different. We can more effectively replicate the fire-resistant nature of a natural forest by thinning these overgrown, second-growth forests. We can then create that supply of saw logs, keep our mills open, keep our people working, and strengthen our economies in rural We can do it by funding this reduction, these thinning programs in acreage that has already gone through the environmental process. In Oregon, we have 1.6 million acres already approved for thinning, if we can pass the funds to get it done.  So let's take this on in 2018. Let's dedicate 2018 to that vision in our Constitution of ``we the people.'' Let's stop passing legislation targeted specifically to help out the richest at the expense of everyone else in Let's turn over a new leaf from campaigns and policies and legislation by and for the privileged and the powerful to honor the vision of our Constitution, the vision of our Nation, a Nation of laws which distributes power that produces policies by and for the people of the United States of America, for making families stronger, for building those foundations of jobs and healthcare and education and a healthy planet.

539,topic-id,2039,"Mr.President, I was fortunate enough this week to attend the American Farm Bureau Federation's annual convention in Nashville, where I had the opportunity to headline a discussion of the farm bill, along with my colleague from Kansas on the[[Page S94]]Senate Ag Committee and the gentleman from Texas, Congressman Conaway, who is leading on the House Agriculture Committee, during the President's commodity meeting. The American Farm Bureau hosted other farm groups and commodity organizations from across the country to talk about the next farm bill and to try to bring consensus as to what agriculture is looking for in farm policy.  In my opportunity to visit with people at the Farm Bureau's annual meeting, in my remarks, I paid particular attention to the farm bill. It is a farm safety net. When we talk about a farm bill, I suppose we ought to highlight that only a small portion of the farm bill is actually related to farm programs. There are a number of titles to the farm bill, and most of the money in a farm bill is spent on nutrition programs and mostly SNAP, but there are other important components of a farm bill--rural development and conservation. In addition to that topic, which I have been on the Senate floor speaking about before, are food aid and support for those who are experiencing famine around the globe. My opportunity to be with farmers and ranchers from across the country gave me an opportunity to not only speak about my views as to what a farm bill should contain but, more importantly, for me to hear what they had to say that was important to them.  Farm Bureau members from across the country made it clear to me, first of all, that they would like to see Congress--Republicans and Democrats in the House and the Senate--and the administration work together in a bipartisan fashion to get a farm bill done and, prior to that, to get a disaster relief bill completed, which I hope we will do yet this month on the Senate floor--both the disaster bill that needs to get to the President's desk as soon as possible and also a farm bill that needs to be completed in a timely fashion. The current farm bill under which we are operating expires in 2018.  Of the things I want to highlight that I heard from Farm Bureau members while I was there is certainly the importance of crop insurance and the value it provides, particularly for those of us who live and farm and work in places where the weather is not often our friend, as well as just the challenges the current farm bill is creating in  Particularly, the safety net programs PLC and ARC don't work as well as they should or could. Part of that has to do with timeliness, and part is the inability and the difficulty in farmers having to choose between two programs and to predict for a long period--the life of the farm bill--which makes the most sense to them economically. Whether they are going to have high prices, low prices, good weather, or bad weather is a hard thing to know in the life of a farm bill. Again, because of the issues we have with the current farm bill, timeliness is important because those provisions that are less than satisfactory today will be extended if we aren't successful in completing a farm bill this year.  While the topic of conversation generally revolved around the farm bill, I want to indicate to my colleagues that so much of what I heard was about trade, particularly about The reality is, 98 to 99 percent of the mouths to feed are outside of the United Farmers and ranchers earn their livings by feeding a hungry world, and exports matter to us. There was a lot of concern expressed to me and among the farmers and ranchers who were gathered there about the potential of the withdrawal by the United States from Kansas is a good example. Our largest importer--the place to which we export the most agricultural commodities--is  It is not just about commodities. In addition to the commodities, there are manufacturing jobs related to food and food products. There are 36,000 jobs that generate more than $5.7 billion in economic activity, and approximately 14 percent of all jobs and 10 percent of all manufacturing jobs are tied to the food and agricultural sectors. So, when we talk about trade and exports, we are not just talking about shipping a ton of wheat or a carload of wheat to another country; we are also talking about all of the jobs here in the United It is not just in growing commodities and not just in raising cattle but all of the jobs that come from taking those commodities, turning them into food, and exporting the food to other countries as well.  I have had this conversation with people within the administration and with my colleagues in the U.I do believe the tax bill we passed will improve the economy and that farmers, lots of other business men and women, manufacturers, and others will experience greater economic opportunity as a result of the passage of the tax bill. I would highlight that the tax rates are a lot less important if we don't have income. If something would happen in which we would not be exporting--for example, if there would be a withdrawal from NAFTA--the outcome could be that the tax rates would become semi-irrelevant because the income levels of farmers and ranchers and those who would have jobs in the food sector would be significantly diminished. Less income means tax rates don't matter as much as they otherwise would.  Things are really difficult in agriculture today. Commodity prices are at low prices historically. The challenges are great. Weather, as I said earlier when speaking about crop insurance, is not always our friend. Across Kansas, the plea is for rain or snowfall or moisture. It is dry statewide. The challenges the producers in my State but really those across the country face are low commodity prices and weather, which are significant. What that means is, we need every additional market. We cannot afford to lose any market to which we sell those commodities. More markets mean higher prices, and more demand means higher prices. Today, we need every penny we can gain on a bushel of corn or wheat or soybeans or grain sorghum. We need to make certain we don't lose markets but that we gain markets.  I commend the President for traveling to Nashville and speaking and meeting with the American Farm I believe it has been 30-plus years since a President attended a Farm Bureau annual convention. I know, in my own experience both in the House and the Senate, reporters have often asked me to analyze what I have heard or haven't heard in a President's State of the Union It has always been my practice to listen to a State of the Union Address and hear whether a President speaks about agriculture, about farmers, about ranchers, about rural Here we had a President who traveled to Nashville and spent time with those farmers and ranchers of America, and I am pleased the President did so.  I continue to encourage the administration to remain mindful of the role agricultural trade plays in our economy. I would indicate that our withdrawal from NAFTA is a high-risk strategy--a negotiating tactic, perhaps. It is true we have the highest quality of agriculture products available in the world, but other countries are very interested in taking our markets, and any indication that our markets are not going to continue gives countries like Argentina, Brazil, and others the opportunity to make the case that they will be stable suppliers. The things we raise in the United States they can sell and provide in those countries as well. My point is, we don't have a corner on the market, and any suggestion that we are not a stable supplier or that the trading relationship is going to diminish or disappear between two countries means that others are eagerly seeking to take those markets away from us.  Given the impact on our Nation's economy, I urge those conference attendees, those people I visited with in Nashville, to continue to convey to all of those policymakers the importance of trade and the importance of trade agreements.  The administration has a desire to develop bilateral as compared to multilateral trade agreements, and I encourage those negotiations to be ongoing today. We don't have any time to waste when it comes to finding new markets and trading relationships with other countries.  Again, I appreciate the President traveling to Nashville and spending time with farmers and ranchers, and I appreciate the agenda he outlined in regard to regulatory relief, as well as the issue of broadband, on which the President spent a significant amount of time, providing technology to a part of[[Page S95]]the country that has, in many instances, been lacking or woefully inadequate.  But the bottom line is that rural America needs income. We can do lots of things to improve the quality of life in rural America, but in the absence of farmer success, in the absence of a farmer and rancher earning a living, the ability to attract our children or others to come back to the farm and the ability to retain our young people in the community to work on a farm diminishes greatly.  One of the questions I received was from a young lady studying in Texas, and this was her question: What are you doing to make certain that young people have a chance to be farmers? While my answer was less than perfect--it is a hard one to answer--it is an important question. The reality is that the chances of young people having the opportunity in agriculture to earn a living is totally dependent upon the economic success of those individuals in agriculture today and what the future holds. We can find a few programs that might encourage young people to be able to enter agriculture as a profession and as a career, but the reality is that it will only work when they are earning a good living, and that comes, once again, from the safety nets, including crop insurance, which will be included in a farm bill as it works its way through Congress this year, but also in the opportunity to see that every market around the globe is available to the U.farmer and rancher so that he and she will earn a living and so that they will increase the chances that their sons and daughters have the opportunity to work side by side with them into the future.  I especially want to thank a few people from the American Farm Bureau Federation for allowing me to attend and inviting me to attend and to speak--certainly, President Zippy Duvall, the president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, from Georgia; Dale Moore, a Kansan who is at the American Farm Bureau Federation; and Mary Kay Thatcher, their long-time government affairs person. All of those individuals at the American Farm Bureau Federation do their job so well, but I especially want to acknowledge the friendship and support of those three individuals.  I am reminded that no matter where we go, farmers and ranchers have a lot in common. In addition to their economic importance to communities across Kansas and around rural America, it is farmers and ranchers that still today provide a sense of what is right in America--an understanding of right and wrong, an understanding of the value of life, integrity, character, and values. It is something that is important not just to rural America but to our entire United States of So thank you to the farmers who visited with me. Thank you to the farmers who gave me the opportunity to speak with them and listened to me. Please know that I am happy and will continue to roll up my sleeves to work with my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats--the Senator from Kansas, the chairman of the Ag Committee; and the Senator from Michigan, the ranking member, ",CREC-2018-01-09-pt1-PgS89-2.txt,1507,STAND WITH THE DREAMERS,2018.0,9.0,January

1043,topic-id,1014,"Mr.President, on Tuesday of this week, I regained my previous held seat on the Senate Banking[[Page S146]]Committee, a committee I served on from 2011 until the beginning of this While this committee sometimes flies under the radar for many Americans, the oversight it conducts and the issues it considers under its substantial jurisdiction are of great consequence to America and to the American people.  The owners and employees of banking institutions have experienced success when their communities experience success. What I am saying is, how we lend money matters to every kind of person every day. So what we have experienced across Kansas, in many instances, is difficulty and really hard times.  I want to talk about community. Community financial institutions are of great importance to the folks I represent in What I want to do, in part, with my opportunity to serve on the Banking Committee is to make sure those financial institutions have a regulatory environment in which they can benefit their communities and benefit the citizens who live there.  Communities in Kansas are losing their hometown banks to consolidation and sales, and some of these banks that are moving in that direction have been family owned for generations. In order to better understand why these lenders are consolidating or selling, I have sought out the nature of this decline by speaking with financial leaders from across the country. The overwhelming response I received is that the costs associated with complying with new Federal regulations are simply too much to absorb in their business model.  In the aftermath of our country's significant financial downturn, a new regulatory framework was put in place to rein in those bad actors and punish bad behavior that led us down that path in 2007 and 2008. We have had more than 7 years to determine what the effects are of this new regulatory environment--Dodd-Frank--and what it has meant to our community banks and our community financial institutions. The most glaring aspect of these new regulations is the disproportionate burden placed upon those smaller institutions seeking to comply with their new responsibilities.  Rather than extending credit to best fit the needs of their customers, banks are exiting entire lines of business because the penalties for making a mistake far outweigh the economic benefits derived from extending a loan. I experienced this damaging news and reality during the Senate Banking Committee's consideration of legislation to reform the secondary mortgage markets in 2014. I was attempting to solicit feedback from Kansas lenders of the financial impact some of these proposed changes would have on their communities, and what I learned, unfortunately, was this: ``Jerry, we don't make home loans anymore.'' When pressed for a reason, they responded it just didn't make business sense for them to do that any longer due to the increased Federal regulators' crackdown on mortgage lending.  As a member of the Senate who cares deeply about rural America and the special way of life we enjoy in Kansas, this is a very damaging occurrence. If a community banker determines they can no longer extend credit to what would have otherwise been a creditworthy borrower because of the fear of making a mistake and the repercussions that follow, then they decide not to make the loan at all and not even to be in the business. What community would expect their financial institutions in their community to refuse to make a home loan? It is the American dream.  While community banks had been consolidating for a number of years due to shifting demographics and market conditions, we cannot nor should we attempt to discount the role the post-Dodd-Frank regulatory environment has played in the acceleration of the harming of our community banking structure.  I am not opposed to regulations, and neither are the community bankers working to serve their communities, but there has to be prioritization on the part of Congress to create an environment where local lenders can succeed because the success of these institutions means the success of their communities and the people who live there.  During the fall of 2015, I worked alongside a number of committee colleagues--both Republicans and Democrats--to see if we could bridge the divide and bring relief to our community lenders across the country. While these efforts did not then produce a result, these discussions demonstrated that the issues facing the financial service world need not be partisan, and they sowed the seeds for what has now resulted in legislation moving its way through the legislative process today.  I am happy to support 2155, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act recently reported out of the Banking Committee on a bipartisan vote. Many of the provisions in this bill originated in legislation I have promoted since I came to the Senate, first as the Communities First Act, and most recently as the CLEAR Relief While this legislation will not solve every issue that needs to be solved, it is meaningful progress that will make a difference.  It is Congress's responsibility to ensure that economic growth is not needlessly impeded, and it is our duty to ensure that economic opportunities flourish and that Americans have access to the tools necessary to pursue the American dream.  The Banking Committee can and will play an important role in providing these tools, and I feel fortunate to have the opportunity to lend the voice of Kansans to that effort. I look forward to working with the chairman, Mike Crapo, the Senator from Idaho, and the ranking member, Sherrod Brown from Ohio, as we work together to make sure good things happen in Kansas and across the country.  Again, I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Banking Committee and on the Senate floor to see that all Americans have the opportunity to have access to credit so we can continue to pursue growing economic opportunities for all Americans to keep the American dream alive and well.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

827,topic-id,622,"Mr.President, I would like to take a moment to remember and pay tribute to a pioneer of Alaska aviation, Cliff Everts, who passed away in December at the age of 95. One of the greatest compliments you can pay to a longtime Alaskan is to refer to that individual as a pioneer. Yes, Cliff was a pioneer, but that understates the reverence with which he is held in Alaska's aviation community. He is indeed an icon of Alaska aviation.  Place yourself in a remote Alaskan village in the dead of winter. The outdoor temperature is minus 25 degrees, and the village is running short of fuel. Imagine the sound of a fuel plane landing on your village's gravel runway, delivering thousands of gallons of fuel needed to sustain daily life in the bush and power remote work sites. Deliveries such as this make life in rural Alaska possible. This is the legacy of Cliff  Originally born in New York, Cliff's passion for flying began at a young age. He took his first flight at 12 years old. As a teenager, he delivered newspapers to pay for his flying lessons. Cliff trained on a Taylorcraft, a high-winged, two-seater aircraft, and was soloing within just 6 months.  Later Cliff joined the Civilian Pilot Training Program, supporting wartime efforts during World War It was not long thereafter that he made the decision to leave New York, to accept a position flying as a copilot for Alaska Star Airlines in Alaska Star Airlines was a predecessor of today's Alaska  Having grown to love Alaska, Everts embraced the pioneer spirit and accepted another position flying for Wien Airlines in He continued to fly for Wien Airlines for 35 years, logging over 30,000 hours of flight time. His flights carried mail, cargo, and passengers throughout the entire  While Cliff Everts was a pilot by trade, he was also a very savvy entrepreneur and was well known for his many business ventures, but he is best known for Everts Air Cliff started this business in the 1980s flying a C-46. The C-46 is a World War II era high-altitude, multiengine aircraft. He quickly built the fleet, running his business on the philosophy that providing for the unique needs of Alaskans can be done both efficiently and affordably by  Cliff's son, Robert, began his own aviation business called Everts Air Between Everts Air Cargo and Everts Air Fuel, the pair owned 21 airplanes. I understand that there are six C-46 aircraft remaining in revenue service. The Everts enterprises fly four of the six, and that is a testament to how well they treat their equipment. They are also known for treating their people exceptionally well.  Alaska was good to Cliff Cliff was great to In recognition of his achievements, Cliff amassed numerous awards and recognitions. In 2007, Cliff received the Federal Aviation Administration's Master Pilot In 2011, the general aviation side of Fairbanks International Airport, what we call ``East Ramp,'' was dedicated in Cliff's honor. In 2012, the Alaska Air Carriers Association designated Cliff as an ``Aviation Legend.'' Cliff was also inducted into the Alaska Aviation Hall of He holds the Alaska Aviation Entrepreneur All appropriate recognition for a man best known for these words, ``Flying has been my life, and I can't see joy in doing anything else.''  On Saturday, January 13, Alaskans from all walks of life will come together in Fairbanks to celebrate the life of Cliff Cliff's friends and admirers will be joined by his wife Betty and their large family. On behalf of my Senate colleagues, let me take this opportunity to share our condolences with Betty and the family and to thank Cliff Everts for his outstanding life of service to aviation and                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-10-pt1-PgS137.txt,1694,SCREENING AND VETTING PASSENGER EXCHANGE ACT OF 2017,2018.0,10.0,January

1084,topic-id,2351,"Mr.President, I would have joined Senator Sullivan in a round of applause. I thank him for sharing that inspiring story.                         Funding the Government  Mr.President, I come to the floor this afternoon just to talk very briefly about the real-world impacts of the decisions we are going to make in the next week or so regarding the future of the budget and to really implore my Republican colleagues here, most especially the Republican leadership, to get this job done and not put us on another continuing resolution. This is not a theoretical or a rhetorical exercise; this is about people's lives and our failure to do our job--our failure to pass a budget and to extend lifesaving programs, like the Children's Health Insurance It is not about politics, and it is not about headlines. It is not about point scoring. It is about making people's lives better.  I really just want to share three stories from Connecticut to talk about the impact of the decisions that we are going to make with respect to the Federal budget. Let me first talk about this often esoteric-sounding concept of parity. One of the most important things that we are discussing is how many additional dollars are going to be in the budget for 2017 and 2018 versus in the prior fiscal year.  There seems to be fairly widespread agreement that we are underresourced when it comes to the Department of We have a multitude of kinetic challenges that are presented to the United A group of us just got briefed, once again today, by our military leadership on the scope and extent of the North Korean threat. I agree with many of my Republican colleagues that we need to increase funding for national security, but national security is not just housed in the Department of National security is also about making sure that our families are secure and that our communities are secure.  We believe that we should increase funds for the Department of Defense, and we should also make sure that our schools have teachers. We should also make sure that we have cops on the streets. We should also make sure that our bridges aren't falling down. That is national security as well. It is not too much to ask to make sure that our security is taken care of internationally and domestically as well.  Let me give you a perfect example of how you can't just plus-up defense spending and leave the rest of the budget unattended to. We love defense spending in Why? Because we make a lot of big ticket items for the Department of We make the helicopters at We make the jet engines at Pratt & We make the submarines at Electric  We are proud of all of them, but let me tell you what happens at Electric Boat if you plus-up the Defense Department at the expense of all of the other discretionary accounts. We are going to be building a lot more submarines over the next 10 years. We are now building two fast attack submarines a year. We are going to start building the new ballistic submarines, the Columbia class, and Electric Boat needs to hire 14,000 employees over the next 10 years. Much of that is because their workforce is older, and so they are going to have a lot of retirements. They have to find 14,000 new employees over the next 10 years. If they can't, we cannot make the submarines in the United States, or we cannot make the parts that go into[[Page S164]]the submarines in the United Either the job will not get done, or the work will happen somewhere else in another country. You can't assemble the submarines anywhere other than at Electric Boat, but those parts will go to foreign companies rather than American companies.  The way in which we are going to fill the 14,000 jobs is through the Department of The Department of Labor has a partnership with an organization called the Eastern Connecticut Manufacturing That is a public-private partnership that seeks to train hundreds of individuals in the skills necessary to build the submarines. They received 4,500 applications over the past year. They can't place all those people because they only get a certain amount of funding from the Department of Labor, but they were able to train 500 new workers for Electric Boat, putting them right into those jobs that are necessary to build these submarines. The problem is the money for that program is running out, and with another CR, they can't get renewed funding for that program. So if you plus-up the Defense Department without increasing funding for the Department of Labor, you can't get the stuff that you want to build for the Department of Defense because you can't get the workers in order to fill the contracts.  If you don't renew this contract, if you don't renew this funding agreement with the Eastern Connecticut Manufacturing Pipeline, the work will not get done, and the jobs will go overseas. I just want my colleagues to understand that this isn't some philosophical belief that we need the same amount of money in the Department of Defense as we need in the rest of the budget. It is practical. It is practical because we need domestic economic security, but you also can't execute the Department of Defense contracts without funding in the rest of the budget.  Second, let me talk to you about the real-world implications of not funding the Children's Health Insurance You know that healthcare more than any other issue has become a political football. Democrats toss it to the Republicans, and Republicans toss it back to Yet there is no other issue that is more personal than this. If someone doesn't have healthcare for their family, nothing else in their life can happen.  I want to share one story. These letters and emails are flooding into our offices with respect to the real-world impact of not funding the Children's Health Insurance  In Connecticut, letters have gone out to families whose children are insured through CHIP, telling them that by the end of this month--that is 20 days away--they lose their insurance. So here is what Tara from Washington, CT, writes. She said:       Despite our full time employment--  She works as a small business manager, and her husband is a full-time electrical apprentice--     my husband and I do not make enough money to buy health      insurance for our children in addition to our other mandatory      expenses.  She explains that her children go to daycare, which costs $1,800 a month, which she says is more than their mortgage plus taxes and insurance.  To go back to her letter, she says:       This is where the [Children's Health Insurance Program]      comes into play in our lives. I cannot even begin to tell you      the anxiety I faced when I was pregnant with my daughter,      crying every day because I didn't know how we were going to      make ends meet. Thank God for a family friend who happened to      be an insurance agent. She told us about [CHIP] and suddenly      some of that anxiety was quelled.       We have been blessed to have [CHIP] in our lives.  I say She says in the letter HUSKY is the name of the CHIP program in       We have been blessed to have [CHIP] in our lives. Last      month my daughter got RSV and was prescribed a nebulizer. Two      weeks ago, my son caught it from her and that developed into      a double ear infection and pink eye, requiring two expensive      medications. The co-pays and premiums are manageable though      and they got the care they needed.       I read in the [local paper] this weekend that letters were      going out to parents of children . . . telling them that      their coverage will end on January 31, 2018.  She is writing this in       We are a week away from Christmas, and what should be a      happy time of year has now turned into stress and depression.      How am I going to get insurance for my kids? My daughter      turns two on February 10th, how am I going to pay for her      well visit? I can't just skip it, they won't allow her back      into daycare.       I cannot believe the dysfunction going on in this country.      I cannot believe tax cuts for the wealthy have taken      precedent over the health of my kids. . . . What is Congress      doing to ensure their continued healthcare?  This story is repeated literally millions of times over all across this country. People went through the holiday anxious and depressed because they were convinced that we weren't taking seriously the healthcare of their kids. When we debate the budget, it has to have attached to it a long-term, if not permanent, extension of the Children's Health Insurance Program because there are families just like Tara out there who are doing everything we ask them to. She is full-time employed, her husband is full-time employed, and they can't afford health insurance for their kids without  Let me talk to you about the importance of making sure that we get the right amount of disaster funding to Texas, Florida, and in particular Puerto Puerto Rico matters to us in Connecticut because we have the largest percentage of our population with Puerto Rican roots than any State in the country. We are so proud of that. The Puerto Rican community in Connecticut is vibrant, economically and culturally, powerful politically, involved in our cities and towns and in State government.  The Governor of Puerto Rico has requested $94 billion for Maria recovery and rebuilding, and I am just back from Puerto I can report to you that the island is still in crisis. One hundred days after the hurricane hit, more than half of the country--half of the households--still don't have electricity.  If that were happening in Connecticut, Alaska, or Louisiana, there would be riots in the streets, but for some reason it is acceptable in Puerto We are 100 days after the hurricane, and we still haven't approved a disaster recovery package, and the Trump administration is nickel-and-diming the island.  I walked through the poorest, most densely populated neighborhood in San Juan, the capital of the They have no power. Mold is growing in these homes because they can't dry out the moisture without electricity. Kids are enduring more frequent and more intense bouts of asthma. People are dying because they can't refrigerate their medication or keep their ventilation equipment running. This is what is happening in the United States of We need to authorize significant, robust funding for Puerto Rico and for Texas and We need to do it now.  We need to do it now because the day that I arrived on the island--I think it was January 2--it was reported to us that there was the highest volume of people leaving Puerto Rico since the hurricane--on that day, January 2. The exodus is getting more intense. More people are leaving, not less. Why? Because they don't think we are committed to rebuilding the island. Puerto Ricans don't think that Congress is serious about putting back on the electricity. They waited 1 month. They waited 2 months. They waited 3 months, and then they said: Enough, we can't put our kids in these conditions.  They started leaving in record numbers. They were leaving right off the bat, but they are now leaving in record numbers. While most of them are coming to places like Florida, many of them are coming to Why? Because when they make that move, they often go first to stay with friends. Because we have such a compassionate, large Puerto Rican community in Connecticut, many of these families are coming to  So let me just give you a couple of the numbers here. We asked our school systems to try to keep a rough track of how many new Puerto Rican students are showing up. Our cities are small in We don't have a city that is much bigger than 100,000. In Hartford, they have 388 new Puerto Rican students--``new'' meaning having come since the hurricane from the island. Waterbury, CT, has 268. New Britain, a very small city, has 213. Bridgeport has 179. These are kids who are glad to have shelter and schooling in Connecticut, but they don't want to be in They came under duress. They came to Connecticut as refugees. They want to be back in Puerto Rico.[[Page S165]]  The stress that this is putting on the schools is serious. We are in a budget crisis in Schools have already had their funding cut from Yet these schools are now having to staff up to deal with this influx of students from Puerto We are glad to do it. We see it as our obligation, and we know that these kids will be a part of Connecticut's strength. But it is not easy to do when we haven't authorized any money to help States like Connecticut to deal with this influx of students. At McDonough Middle School in Hartford, these kids are thriving, but they have had to set up a new immersion lab to handle all these kids coming in. They have had to hire new staff to teach English as a second language. These are schools that were already seeing their funding hemorrhage from the State government.  The impact is real on McDonough Middle The impact is real on Tara and her family from The impact is real for an important supplier in our industrial base, Electric If we just continue to push CR after CR, these families, schools, and companies will not succeed. This isn't about political headlines. This isn't about numbers on a page. This is about real-world impact for businesses, families, and schools.  So let's get the job done. Let's write a budget. Let's at least agree to the overall budget numbers. Let's fund the Children's Health Insurance Let's get Puerto Rico, Florida, and Texas everything they need. News flash: That is our job.

773,topic-id,932,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to talk about an issue that is critical to patients and families in my home State of Washington and across the country. Today, parents are wondering if they will be able to get the healthcare their kids need, and communities are wondering if they will be able to provide it.  That is unacceptable.  Congress has to swiftly and fully restore the Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, and funding for other services families need, like community health centers, which have been waiting more than 100 days for a long-term solution. They should do so without making deep cuts to successful prevention programs in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that tackle avoidable conditions like heart disease and diabetes.  Democrats have wanted to get this done for months. By focusing on pushing through partisan tax reform at the end of the year, Republicans instead put massive corporations and the wealthiest ahead of making sure our children and their families have the healthcare they need. I hope they are now ready to give these issues their full and immediate attention. In case they aren't, I want to make sure they know exactly what this is about.  It is about children like Stella lives in Washington She is 5 years old. She has two brothers. She has a love of the outdoors, especially swimming and kayaking. She has a typical kindergartner's boundless energy and excitement. But Stella was born with spina bifida, an issue with how her spinal cord was formed. In the past year of dealing with that condition, Stella's family went through 5 catheters a day, almost 2,000 in total. They went on 10 different occasions to have MRI scans. They went to get her new leg braces. Given the cost of all that, they went through their $5,000 deductible in the first 5 weeks of the year. That is right. It took just 5 weeks. Additionally, this year Stella is also scheduled to have bladder and kidney surgery.  As one can imagine, the expenses are really adding up. Even with both parents working, covering Stella's healthcare needs would be an unimaginable task. Fortunately, Stella does qualify for health insurance through CHIP has helped her family afford the treatment she needs, including physical therapy.  Stella's story is just one of many examples of families who rely on this program. There are 60,000 children in Washington State who are now insured through Nine million families nationwide rely on it to help address the healthcare needs of their children. Yet Congress has taken over 102 days and counting to restore it. There is no excuse for this inaction.  Families who rely on the CHIP Program are not alone in needing our immediate attention. Thanks to CHIP and Medicaid, the uninsured rate among children is now at an all-time low. Jeopardizing this accomplishment by letting CHIP twist in the wind is simply unacceptable. This Republican-controlled Congress has also failed to renew other investments that our families rely on for the care they need--programs such as community health centers, which serve 25 million patients, particularly in our rural and poorer communities; the National Health Service Corps, which brings doctors and other healthcare providers to underserved areas through scholarships and loan repayment; and the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education Program, which brings primary care and dental residencies to communities in need. Leaving these programs without long-term extensions a minute longer is utterly irresponsible because this lack of certainty for them is already bringing a negative impact on our communities.  For example, the Northeast Washington Health Programs serve some of most the rural areas in my State, including Ferry County, which has fewer than four people per square mile. They are struggling to hire needed medical staff and managers because of this uncertainty that is now there. Ferry County cannot wait.  The Community Health Association of Spokane runs 12 health center sites and sees more than 70,000 patients a year. They recently began offering very much needed opioid addiction treatment. If Congress does not reauthorize the community health center funding, those efforts will be jeopardized and expansions will be halted. Spokane cannot wait.  Yakima Neighborhood Health Services served over 22,000 patients in 2016. Almost all of those patients were below 200 percent of the Federal poverty line.  If Congress does not act soon, three different clinics, including a clinic in one of the poorest cities in Washington, will be at risk. Yakima cannot wait.  I have heard additional stories of similar hardships from across my North Olympic Healthcare Network has had to put expansions on behavioral healthcare on hold. Another health center in Washington may have to reconsider building a new children's dental residency program. A center serving Whatcom County may have to cancel a project for medical, dental, and behavioral healthcare facilities as well.  Across the country there are a lot of examples for community health centers just like the ones I mentioned. Healthcare that people of all ages and backgrounds rely on is being put in jeopardy, all because Republicans prioritized tax cuts for those at the top before the health needs of millions of people at the end of last year.  It is far past time to show these families that we are willing to work to get this done. We need to give them the peace of mind that they can get the healthcare they need. They deserve that.

881,topic-id,430,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in strong opposition to the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of 2017, which reauthorizes section 702 of FISA for 6 years without enacting adequate protections for our privacy.  Supporters of this measure want to convince us a new, incredibly narrow warrant provision actually constitutes reform. It does not. Our right to privacy does not begin when the Department of Justice has a fully formed criminal case against us, nor does it begin when prosecutors enter our emails and text messages into evidence against us in court.  The Constitution guarantees far more than this. Our right to privacy protects us when the government first makes its decision to search our private communications for information it might find useful. 139 falls well short of this basic guarantee. We, therefore, cannot--we must not--support this bill.  Make no mistake: 139 is not a compromise. The Judiciary Committee, the technology companies, civil society, and other critical stakeholders were shut out of this conversation long ago.  139 does not include a meaningful warrant requirement. The rule in this bill does not apply to most searches of the section 702 database. It does not apply to a query for any information that ``could mitigate a threat,'' an exception that threatens to swallow the entire rule. As a result, 139 allows the FBI unfettered access to this information for purely domestic nonterrorism cases without a warrant.  What does that mean in the year of Jeff Sessions and Donald Trump? It means that absolutely nothing stops the Department of Justice from trolling the database for evidence that you use marijuana or failed to pay your taxes or may be in the country unlawfully or possess a firearm that you should not have. None of these cases have anything to do with the core purposes of section 702, and all of them should require a warrant based on individualized suspicion and probable cause.  I agree with Chairman Goodlatte that section 702 should be reauthorized. I understand its importance to the intelligence agencies. But none of us should support this bill which pretends at reform while codifying some of the worst practices of the intelligence community in domestic crimes.  When we came to Congress, each of us took an oath to defend and protect the Constitution of the United I ask that each of my colleagues honor that oath today and that we work together to defeat this bill and to bring the right set of reforms to the floor without delay.

134,topic-id,465,"Mr.President, I would like to speak about net neutrality. If you don't know what that means, you really do when prompted because it means that when you turn on your phone, you go on the internet and you decide what you want to see, and what you want to see--or hear in the case of video--you have the right to have that access and to have it as speedily as any other content that is offered on the internet.  Entrepreneurs who are working out of the garage of their family home and who have a new idea and suddenly want to get it on the internet--because they are financially impaired since they are just starting out, they should have an opportunity, just as the big boys do, to get their ideas on the internet.  Within the obvious boundaries of what is appropriate in language, et cetera, you have a right to get the content that you want and to get that content unimpeded on these tablets we carry around in our pockets. That right to get that content is threatened, and it is threatened because the Federal Communications Commission, on a partisan vote of 3 to 2, has completely overturned the previous rules that had been set on a partisan vote the other way of 3 to 2.  At the end of the day, what it means is that those of us in this Chamber, led[[Page S6]]off first by the Commerce Committee, are going to need a legislative solution, but in the meantime, chaos has been thrown into the system.

135,topic-id,525,"This article points out that net neutrality is widely popular. Eighty-three percent of the American public supports net neutrality. The other 17 percent--some of them say they don't. I don't know how they don't. But it is a pretty overwhelming majority--83 percent. But even among Republicans in the surveys that have been done, 76 percent of self-identified Republicans say they support net neutrality.  Here is the flaw in the process the FCC used. Twenty-four million comments came in from supposedly ``Americans'' that were filed either for or against the rulemaking. There is a problem in this record that was built because 2 million of those comments featured stolen identities. It was not a real person; it was somebody else's identity. Some of those identities were people who have long since died. Half a million comments were from Russian addresses. Fifty thousand consumer complaints were inexplicably missing from the record.  Let's take the part about Russian addresses. Is this beginning to tell us something that we know--that there was Russian interference in the last election? We also know from our intelligence community that there was Russian entrance into the voting records of some 20 Now we are seeing the Russian influence enter into the making of law--in this case, the rulemaking--trying to influence comments, whether they were comments for the rulemaking or against the rulemaking. It is another indication that Russia indeed is intending on distorting and influencing the daily operations at the microscopic level--not at the level of an election of a President but at the microscopic level of influencing the development of rules to carry out laws--in this case, a rule that the American people feel quite strongly about. Eighty-three percent are in favor of net neutrality--the opposite of what the Republican majority on the FCC has enacted.  Now we have at least 19 State attorneys general who have raised concerns. They even wrote to the Federal Communications Commission asking that the agency hold off on its vote to eliminate the net neutrality rules, which the Republican Chairman and the FCC majority promptly ignored. The FCC is refusing to even work with law enforcement to get to the bottom of this issue.  Shouldn't the fact that there are Russian bots and people, directed by the Kremlin, trying to influence our government processes--shouldn't that be something we ought to be working on with law enforcement?

138,topic-id,2826,"Mr.President, on December 28, just 3 days after Christmas, the Department of the Interior and this administration sent the oil industry a belated Christmas present. They published a proposal to release offshore drilling companies from sensible rules designed to prevent a tragedy like the one we experienced back in 2010, the Deepwater Horizon oilspill, when 11 people lost their lives and almost 5 million barrels of oil were spilled as a result of a defective device called a blowout preventer. There were 5 million barrels of oil sloshing around in the Gulf of Mexico, much of which is still out there down at depths of 5,000 feet, where the actual well pipe came out a mile underneath the surface of the Gulf of  Of course, we know the economic damage that did all up and down the Gulf of The explosion was some 50 or 60 miles off of Louisiana, but the winds shifted and started blowing the oil to the east. It got as far east as Pensacola Beach, and those sugary white sands were covered up with black oil. The Associated Press and UPI photographs went around the world. The winds continued, and it went as far as the white sands of Tar balls floated as far east as the white sand beaches of Panama City Beach, and then the winds shifted and brought it back the other way. People all over the world, seeing the photographs, thought oil was on all the beaches of the gulf coast of Florida, and they did not come. The tourists did not come.  Now, I haven't even spoken about the economic and environmental degradation that occurred throughout the entire gulf and the fishing industries. Of course, the administration has proposed to now do drilling off the east coast of the United States, including off the coast of the State of the Presiding A number of us have come together who don't think that matches with our tourism industry. It certainly doesn't match with regard to our fishing industries, but it also does not match with the U.Department of Defense's training and testing mission.  If we look at the gulf coast off of Florida, the only place it is off limits in law is the largest testing and training area for the U.military in the world, but if you go up and down the Atlantic coast of the Eastern Seaboard, you will see training range after training range, and you get as far south as the Central East Coast of Florida and, lo and behold, is that area of protection for not only the U.Department of Defense but for NASA and other agencies. That is where we are rocketing our satellites into orbit, of which the first stages have to have a place to land. That is where, when we had the space shuttle--and soon we will be rocketing American astronauts to the International Space Station on American rockets. Many of the first stages will fall into the Atlantic Ocean below, just like the solid rocket boosters did on the space shuttle when it launched.  So there are reasons not to have drilling platforms out there, but let's come back to the Deepwater Horizon oilspill. What happened was deep below the seabed, miles farther into the Earth's crust, pressure had built up and an explosion had occurred. The safety mechanism is right where the pipe comes out of the seabed and goes up 5 miles to the surface to deliver oil.  The safety mechanism is a blowout preventer, which is like a huge set of pincers which comes through and cuts off the pipe. If that blowout preventer preventing the blowout of the well is defective--as it was in the BP oilspill, where 5 million barrels of oil spewed out 5 miles below the surface of the gulf into the waters of the Gulf of Mexico and rendered the havoc and economic damage it did.  In the turmoil and trauma that ensued, there was obviously a need in the Department of the Interior, in the Bureau of Safety, called BSEE, to change the rules to give additional safety mechanisms to make sure this wouldn't happen again. Lo and behold, there is now a change, and we are starting to see the first attempts at weakening those rules.  Sometimes the issue of regulatory reform feels abstract or arbitrary. This is technical stuff, and it is dry, but the safety standards created after the Deepwater Horizon oilspill are not dull and boring. They are life or death. They were written specifically to make sure families, like those 11 who lost their loved ones, wouldn't have to be notified again that there was a preventable death.  What are these new rules about? They are coming in on the blowout preventer, which is the system to control the flow of oil or to seal an oil well. A blowout preventer is what stands between the enormous pressure that builds up in the oil well pipe and the ocean around it. Its purpose is exactly what the name sounds like. It is to prevent the oil from blowing out into the sea uncontrollably.  It took several months to finally get that well capped 5,000 feet below the surface of the water. These are massive pieces of equipment. The blowout preventer for Deepwater Horizon stood 57 feet tall and weighed over 400 tons. That is how big that thing is. Then there is a piece of the blowout preventer system called a shear ram--a device with two blades that seals off a well in an emergency, and that is what failed to fully close in the BP oilspill.  What the Interior Department in this administration is trying to do is undo the updated standards for shear rams and blowout preventers, and it is trying to get rid of a required third party to certify the safety mechanisms.  Obviously, after what we suffered, it is common sense to have those safety mechanisms, and it means that for a third party to ensure the safety mechanisms by certifying that they are in place--it means that somebody other than the oil company needs to make sure their safety equipment is in place and functioning properly.  These rules require better training for workers, real-time monitoring of deepwater drilling operations, timely reporting of major problems with the equipment, and consistent testing and inspections to increase safety. These rules were also the product of a thorough and transparent discussion by scientists, engineers, industry representatives, agency officials, and the public.  It took 6 years after the spill for the well control rule to be finalized. The Trump Interior Department wants to pull a bait and switch, reversing the safety measures and giving the public a mere 30 days to review a highly technical rule. It took 6 years to develop this rule ensuring the safety devices, and now they have a rule to undo it, and they are going to give 30 days for comments. That is nothing more than a free pass to the oil and gas industry at the expense of everyone else, including folks who work on those rigs, who are going to have to suffer if there is another blowout. There are a lot of other things--communities, marine life, your State's economy, my State's economy, the Gulf States' economies. It is totally misguided and reckless.  Over the past year, President Trump has issued Executive orders cut straight from Big Oil's playbook. He has directed agencies to gut rules designed to protect the environment and the safety of workers if the rules interfered with an oil company's bottom line. That is what this one does. It saves them some $900 million. He directed Secretary Zinke to reconsider the well control rule, which was finalized in 2016. That rule stemmed directly from what we had learned in the investigation of the 2010 BP spill.  By the way, the agency that issued this proposed rollback is called the Bureau of Safety and Environmental It is separate now from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management--the agency that schedules lease sales in the Outer Continental  Before the 2010 spill, the folks who worked with the oil industry to auction acreage in the gulf were the same people who were in charge of inspecting the rigs later for compliance with the[[Page S9]]safety standards. Talk about a cozy relationship. That is why one of the first recommendations from the National Commission on the BP spill was to split those responsibilities into two different agencies--one that schedules lease sales and the other that does the safety. That was a very important step, both to clarify the mission of each agency and to restore public trust in offshore regulators. Yet over the summer, there were reports that the Trump administration wanted to recombine these two agencies. Only one stakeholder group would benefit from that, and you can bet what it is. It is not the consumers. It is not the tourists. It is not the scientists. It is not the environmentalists. It is the oil industry.  Now the Trump administration wants to smack down more recommendations from that investigation. From marine biologists to chambers of commerce, I can tell you, the people in Florida understand how important it is to keep drilling off the coast and, where there is drilling, to make sure the safety mechanisms that were corrected after the BP spill stay in place. But that is not what is happening right here in  When the Interior Department released this revised rule last week, my colleague, a Republican Congressman from Sarasota, FL, said ``It would be a huge mistake to weaken these safety regulations'' and that if the Interior Department doesn't rescind the proposal, Congress should intervene and codify the rules permanently.  He is right, and I agree with Congressman Buchanan, my colleague in the Florida delegation who has an ``R'' behind his name. That is why I plan to subject this misguided rule to the Congressional Review  The Congressional Review Act was once an option of last resort. It was meant to ensure that Congress could override the administration if a rule were widely opposed. In most cases, the Congressional Review Act wasn't necessary because if Congress opposed a rule strongly enough, there was enough consensus to pass a law to fix it.  At the beginning of this Congress, the CRA was a favorite tool of the Republicans who wanted to take a sledgehammer to the Obama administration's legacy through the rules that they had enacted. In 2017, the Senate took 17 votes on CRA resolutions of disapproval on everything from bear hunting in the National Wildlife Refuge of Alaska to drug testing of unemployment benefit recipients.  I think this dangerous proposal from the Interior Department deserves the same level of attention. This proposal is open to public comment until January 29. You are not going to get 6 years this time. You will get only 30 days, and it ends January 29. I hope the public understands that and starts registering some complaints.  I hope, during that time, every Floridian remembers what happened to us when the beaches of Pensacola were blackened with tar and oil and we lost a whole season of our guests--tourists who come to this extraordinary State of natural environment, the beautiful Florida beaches. I hope that every Floridian will remember--whether you were a hotelier, a restauranteur, whether you had the dry cleaners, whether you had the taxi services--when you got hit in your pocketbook; I hope every American who rightly has an interest in protecting our beaches, our oceans, our marine life, decides to write in and complain to Secretary Zinke exactly what he is putting at risk with this proposal.  The Interior Department claims the revised proposal will lessen ``unnecessary regulatory burdens''--those are their words--on the oil and gas industry, saving these businesses money. It is estimated it will save $900-some million for the oil industry. What about all the other businesses that will be hurt by a spill if that blowout preventer doesn't cut that pipe in two and seal off the well, which was the lesson learned from the BP Deepwater Horizon spill?  Do we want to go back and weaken these rules? The BP spill devastated my State's economy, and 11 people lost their lives. Louisiana's bayous were inundated with gooey oil.  I talked to two professors, researchers at Louisiana State University, They compared the critters that had developed in the bayous where the oil went into the bayous--the same kind of critter, a little fish that is about that big. Their progeny were stunning; they were mentally deformed. They could not act like normal killifish. It is a little fish about that big. They compared it to the bays and the bayous where those killifish hatched and grew in waters without oil sloshing around in those waters. For 87 days, 5 million barrels of oil gushed.  I bet folks don't even realize there is a spill that is happening right now. As a matter of fact, it has been leaking for 13 years. In 2004, Hurricane Ivan toppled an offshore drilling platform owned by Taylor Because of the way the platform slid, several of the wells were buried and have yet to be plugged.  We all know it is not a question of if there will be another spill but when--and, oh, by the way, the one that has been going on since 2004. How catastrophic will the next one be? Is it going to be off of the Carolinas? Is it going to be off of Virginia, with all of our military fleet in Norfolk? Is it going to be off of Jacksonville and Mayport, as well as the subbase for our Trident submarines? Is it going to be off of Canaveral, where our commercial government rockets are launched into space, dropping first stages, and where the testing for the Trident submarine that is based in Georgia is done, with the telemetry on the Air Force Eastern Test Range? That is why more than 41,000 businesses on the Atlantic coast have expressed opposition to drilling in the Atlantic Ocean, and that is why NASA doesn't want drilling anywhere near the Kennedy Space That is why the Department of Defense has said, time and again, that we should protect and extend the moratorium on drilling in the eastern gulf.  In 2006, bipartisan Senator Mel Martinez, a Republican from Florida, and I passed a moratorium for the eastern Gulf of Mexico, off of Florida, because of the military as well as all of the environmental things I have talked about.  Just at the end of last year, the Air Force came to us. It wants to put $60 million of new improvements for exquisite telemetry, as we are testing some of our most sophisticated weapons systems in the gulf testing range, which is the Gulf of Mexico, off of Florida, but they don't want to make that investment of $60 million to upgrade all of the telemetry unless they have the assurance it is going to be off limits to oil drilling, not just until 2022, which is in the law, but extended another 5 years until 2027.  We cannot get it done. This Senator tried to get it into the Defense bill--an appropriate place. The Acting President pro tempore serves on that distinguished committee, the Armed Services Committee, which is led by John We couldn't get it done because of oil interests not wanting to give the Air Force the security that its $60 million investment on advanced telemetry would be protected for not 5 years from now but 10 years from now.  The only reason the administration wants to take the time to write a new one is, the oil industry wants it to open up a whole lot more acreage to drilling and not just in the gulf; it wants the entire Outer Continental Shelf of the United States--on the west coast and from New Jersey south, as one goes down the States, including the ones I have already mentioned in the Southeastern United States--Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia,  I don't think we should expose even 1 acre of Federal waters to drilling until we have strong safety standards in place to protect against another spill, to protect the workers from losing their lives ever again, to protect the environment, to protect the coastal economies that are so dependent on the beautiful beaches, and to protect the national security interests of our testing and training ranges.  It took 6 years to finalize these rules, and now, in a matter of 30 days, comments are out there to undo these rules. That shouldn't happen. Will other voices in the Senate speak up? It is happening right underneath our noses.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.

837,topic-id,2036,"Mr.President, I must say, I have seen political games being played with trying to drill off of the coast of Not only am I appalled--I have recoiled at this political game--but unfortunately I am not surprised because of what we have seen happen in the last 15 hours.  It all started late last week when the Department of the Interior released a new 5-year drilling plan. It virtually had all of the coastal waters--the Outer Continental Shelf of the entire United States--included in this plan, including that area of Florida that is off limits to drilling in law--a law that Republican Senator Mel Martinez and I passed back in 2006 that keeps drilling off of the gulf coast of Florida until the year 2022.  This new proposal would open up nearly all of the Federal waters to drilling, including all of the coastal waters of Florida, both the west coast--gulf coast--and the east coast--the Atlantic--and also the Straits of Florida, those waters that come around the Florida Keys, which is the Gulf Stream that comes right up the southeast coast of The Gulf Stream then goes out across the Atlantic, past Bermuda, and ends up in Northern  Well, our colleagues have heard this Senator many times come and talk about how keeping oil rigs away from Florida's coast is an issue that is important to our State because of our tourism economy but also because of the military missions on the west coast--the gulf--as well as the  As a Floridian, this Senator has been fighting this fight ever since the mid-1980s when Secretary of the Interior James Watt intended to drill off the east coast of Florida where we were launching our space shuttle, dropping the solid rocket boosters, and where we were launching our military rockets, taking our clandestine satellites into orbit and dropping the first stages. That is how I beat it back in the 1980s, but lo and behold, here we are again in the same place.  We know you can't allow drilling in the Straits of Florida right off the Florida Keys because an oilspill there would be in the Gulf Stream, and that Gulf Stream hugs the coast of southeast Can you imagine what it would do to the beaches of the Florida Keys, Miami Beach, and all up the Gold Coast of Florida, all the way to Palm Beach, all the way north to Fort Pierce, where then the Gulf Stream heads farther in a northeasterly direction out into the Atlantic?  Well, let me show you what is happening in the gulf coast. All of this in yellow is what is off limits in the Gulf of Mexico as a result of the 2006 law.[[Page S140]]There is an obvious reason for all of this--because this line is known as the Military Mission Everything east of here is the largest testing and training area in the world for the U.military. That is why we put this off limits to oil activity.  Oh, by the way, the testing and training mission for the entire Department of Defense is located right here at Eglin Air Force Base, which is where they brought all the pilot training for many nations for the F-35, the new super stealth jet fighter.  Guess what is going on down here in Panama City at Tyndall Air Force That is where we have all the pilot training for our F-22, another one of our stealth fighters.  Down here in Key West, we have the Key West Naval Air They bring in the squadrons of F-18s for the Navy at Boca Chica, which is where the airbase is, and within 2 minutes of lifting off the runway, they are over restricted airspace to do their testing and training.  By the way, what about the rest of the Navy? They bring their amphibious ships in here, going onto the beaches up there by Eglin Air Force And all of the activity is not just on the surface; the testing and training mission is also subsurface because that is part of the Navy's mission as well.  There is ample opportunity to test because from here to here is 300 miles. From here to here is about 300 miles. So there is plenty of room to do this testing. This is the largest testing and training area in the world.  But painfully, over time, we have found another reason, and that was over here off of A little over a decade ago, there was an oilspill. It wasn't any little oilspill; it was the Deepwater Horizon, the BP well that spewed at the surface. At the bottom of the ocean, which was a mile below the surface, it spewed out 5 million barrels of oil before they got it stopped. That was a rig that did not work. There was supposed to be what is called a blowout preventer that was to go in and clamp off the well, and there was a blowout. It was defective. It didn't close off that well at the wellhead 5,000 feet below the surface of the gulf. As a result, 5 million barrels of oil spilled.  What happened to Florida's economy, not even to speak of all the fishing over in Louisiana and Alabama and Mississippi? I will tell you what happened to Florida's economy. Oil came as far east as Pensacola Photographs of oil completely covering the sugary white sands of Pensacola Beach went around the world. So what did people do? For an entire tourist season, they didn't come to any of the beaches of the gulf coast because they thought there was oil on the beach.  Painfully, that experience--not even to speak of what has been done to our environment and how much oil is still sloshing around down there on the bottom of the gulf--painfully, that experience got in the minds of the businesses all up and down the gulf coast of  By the way, over on the east coast--had that oil ever gotten into a current called the Loop Current that comes down and becomes the Gulf Stream, that oil would have ruined the tourism industry all along Florida's southeast coast, from the Keys to Miami Beach, and all the way up to Fort Pierce,  Floridians feel fairly strongly about this. That is why we were fortunate, over a decade ago, in a bipartisan way, to pass a law to keep all of that area I just showed you off limits. We knew what would happen to our tourism--what people subsequently found out with the Deepwater Horizon oilspill--and we knew what would happen to threaten our national security by hampering our ability to do our training and testing.  So, voila, all of a sudden, the Trump administration announces last week that it is going to drill off all of I have sponsored legislation in the past. I have introduced bills to expand the moratorium on the gulf coast. I have sponsored other legislation to protect And today I am introducing another bill that would be a permanent ban on drilling off of Florida's coast for exactly the reasons I have just said.  Last week, when the Secretary of the Interior, Secretary Zinke, announced that they were opening up nearly all Federal waters, including all of those around Florida, we, of course, went into fighting mode again. We will fight this, and it will be defeated. It turns out that was just a political stunt because late yesterday--1 day after officially publishing the plan in the Federal Register--Secretary Zinke flew to Florida, met with the Governor of Florida for 20 minutes at the Tallahassee Airport, and suddenly announced that he had now decided to take Florida ``off the table.'' That sounds like a political stunt.  While many in Florida have seen right through this shameless political stunt, it has opened up a long list of other questions that I have now asked Secretary Zinke to answer in a letter I sent today.  What exactly does ``off the table'' mean? Is it the whole Eastern Gulf? Half of it? Is it 125 miles off the coast? Does it mean both coasts of Florida? Does it mean just one? What about the Straits of Florida, Secretary Zinke?  What about the seismic surveys? You all have said you are proceeding with that. Are those off the table too? If you are going to take Florida waters ``off the table'' in this little political stunt that was done 1 day after the Federal Register published this proposed rule, does that mean you are going to eliminate the seismic surveys? There is no reason to expose marine life and endangered species to the harmful impacts of seismic surveys if there aren't any actual plans to drill in the area. So, Mr.Secretary, are you taking those off the table?  What about your statement--it also included another caveat, Mr.You said you were ``removing Florida from consideration for any new oil and gas platforms.'' Well, all of us know that platforms are different from wellheads. So tell me, Mr.Secretary, does that mean there will still be drilling off the coast of Florida, but the platforms themselves might be located just to the west of the Military Mission Line, and the wellhead is going to be underneath and far from that prohibited line? Mr.Secretary, does your change of heart mean that the administration now supports the bipartisan efforts of the Florida delegation to extend the moratorium on drilling in the Eastern Gulf? That is the bill that I am introducing today, and it has been introduced by Congressman Castor in the House of  For every day that goes by without answers to these essential questions, the Secretary needs to add that much more time to the public comment period.  The Secretary's promise last night at the Tallahassee Airport, one day after publishing in the Federal Register that Florida is off limits--right now those are just empty words because the only real thing out there that exists is the law that prevents drilling off the gulf coast of Florida for the next 5 years.  The Secretary has proposed a 5-year plan to drill the rest of Florida and to start drilling in 2023 off the gulf coast of  There is also a law called the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which spells out a very specific process for developing lease sales in Federal waters. With all of this rush, and now saying that Florida is ``off the table,'' I fear this announcement of Secretary Zinke's is going to discourage Floridians from commenting on the proposal that was published just this Monday--the one that opened up Florida's entire coastline to drilling--because Floridians have been given false assurances that they are all in the clear. That brings us back to this political stunt: Design a plan for the entire United States, publish it on Monday, and take it back on Tuesday for Florida for political reasons.  Floridians should be aware and they should make their objections known because if they don't, then the administration will try to say that they never heard objections from It goes on and on--more political games.  Floridians aren't the only ones who need to know what this means. What about all the other States that have been affected? Did you hear that there is an uproar among the Governors of other coastal States that are in this drilling plan of the administration? They asked: Why, one day later, would you go to Florida and say ``We are eliminating it,'' but, Secretary Zinke, you didn't exempt my State--all the way from Maine in the North, all the way to Florida on the Atlantic coast,[[Page S141]]all the other Gulf States, and then to the west coast of the United States, California all the way up to the State of Washington? It is more games.  People in Maryland, people in Massachusetts, people in the Carolinas are really upset. They ask: Why don't you eliminate the drilling that you are proposing off my State? What about out in California and Oregon and the State of Washington?  The administration and Secretary Zinke shouldn't be playing politics with an issue that is so important to all of our futures, especially so to Florida's future.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-10-pt1-PgS139.txt,859,PAYING TRIBUTE TO PHILLIP LYONS,2018.0,10.0,January

The Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act would exempt from the      protections of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)      workers employed by tribal-owned and -operated commercial      enterprises located on tribal lands. Under this bill, the      NLRA rights and protections would be denied to more than      600,000 tribal casino workers, the vast majority of whom are      not Native       This bill would overturn a 2004 decision by the Bush      Administration's National Labor Relations Board (Board), in      which the Board applied the NLRA to a tribal casino (San      Manuel Indian Bingo and Casino, 341 NLRB 138 (2004)). In      reaching this decision, the Board applied a test: the NLRA      will not apply if its application would ``touch exclusive      rights of self-governance in purely intramural matters.''      And, the NLRA will not apply if it would ``abrogate Indian      treaty rights.'' The Board also considered other factors,      including that the casino in question was a typical      commercial enterprise that catered to non-Native American      customers and employed non-Native While the Board      asserted NLRA protections in the San Manuel decision, it      ruled the opposite way, denying its jurisdiction in a      companion case (Yukon Kuskokwim Health Corporation, 341 NLRB      139 (2004)).       We understand the importance of tribal sovereignty and      support the principle in true self-governance matters. But      the fundamental human rights of employees are not the      exclusive concern of tribal enterprises or tribal      governments. While proponents of the bill falsely compare      tribal governments to state governments, they miss a glaring      truth: while state governments are exempt from NLRA      protections, their workers are eligible to vote for those who      set their labor laws. But the vast majority of the 600,000      casino workers who would be impacted by the Tribal Labor      Sovereignty Act are not Native Americans, and therefore have      no voice in the selection of those setting tribal policy nor      the ability to petition the tribal government to protect      their rights.       We object to a sweeping exemption of all tribal enterprises      from the NLRA, and believe the test used by the Board to      determine whether the NLRA is applicable should remain.

In 2015, over 37 million passengers traveled through Newark Liberty International Airport, including many traveling into the United States from abroad.  As a Member of Congress representing the largest port on the Eastern seaboard and one of the busiest international airports in the country, it is important to me that the Federal Government do everything in its power to push out our borders--to prevent dangerous cargo and dangerous people from coming into our country.  The DHS Overseas Personnel Enhancement Act of 2017 would do just that by directing the Department to develop and execute an overseas personnel assessment and enhancement plan.  As we speak, nearly 2,000 DHS employees are stationed around the globe, engaging in terrorism prevention, counternarcotics, and antihuman smuggling activities in more than 70 countries.  About half of DHS personnel deployed overseas are from Customs and Border Protection, who are responsible for screening U.S.-bound passengers at airports, inspecting cargo being loaded onto ships bound for the U.S., and training other nations' customs and border forces.  The Department also sends Immigration and Customs Enforcement special agents, Secret Service special agents, and Transportation Security Administration officials abroad to help prevent international criminal and terrorist activity from spreading into the United  These activities have a direct impact on the security of my district.

Mr.Speaker, H.1486 would authorize the Department of Homeland Security's Nonprofit Security Grant Program, which awards grants to nonprofit organizations at risk of a terrorist attack, in statute.  Since early last year, nonprofit organizations throughout the United States have experienced an uptick in threats, vandalism, and violent acts. According to the Anti-Defamation League, anti-Semitic incidents jumped 67 percent from 2016 to the first three quarters of 2017. Many nonprofit organizations, however, do not have the resources to make their facilities more secure by installing proper surveillance, hardening their facilities, and undergoing general preparedness activities.  The need for nonprofit organizations across the country to have access to the Homeland Security grants to bolster security is substantial. Given the security challenges associated with the current terrorist threat environment, it is important that this critical Homeland Security grant program be codified in law.  This bill goes further than just codifying the existing program. It expands it to include jurisdictions that are located outside funded UASIs but are still at risk of terrorism.  H.1486 authorizes the Nonprofit Security Grant Program at $50 million, a $25 million increase over its current funding level. Language similar to this measure was included in the Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017, which passed the House earlier this  I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.

The vulnerability of places of worship to violent homegrown      extremists (HVEs) is a growing threat in the United      According to a joint assessment by the National      Counterterrorism Center, Department of Homeland Security      (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, HVEs are      increasingly favoring softer civilian targets, such as houses      of worship, having judged them to have lower levels of      security (and, for some, as a result of encouragement from      overseas violent extremists, such as ISIL).       Last month, the FBI released its annual hate crimes report      for 2016, which found that Muslim bias crimes increased ,      and, for the 20th consecutive year, anti-Jewish hate crimes      amounted to the majority of all religious bias crimes      reported. This year, synagogues, churches, mosques, religious      centers, cemeteries, and other nonprofits have been subjected      to arson/fire-bombing, shooting/mass shooting, attempted      bombing, death threats, robbery, vandalism/destruction of      property, hate-based/anti-Semitic graffiti, assault,      intimidation, and the targets of incitement to violence.       According to DHS, religious facilities share a number of      common vulnerabilities that make them ready targets of      attack, including unrestricted access to facilities and      contiguous and peripheral areas, easy identification,      predictable schedules, and large congregations of people. To      minimize these vulnerabilities, DHS recommends protective      measures that include, access controls, barriers, monitoring,      surveillance, and other physical target hardening and      preparedness investments, such as planning and training.      Unfortunately, DHS acknowledges that common vulnerabilities      also include the limited resources nonprofit institutions      have for security.       Passage of the amendment in the nature of a substitute to      H.1486 would address the vulnerabilities of at-risk      nonprofit institutions, by authorizing a nonprofit security      grant program for the acquisition and installation of      physical target hardening, including fencing, bollards, and      other barriers; lighting, surveillance, and metal detection      equipment; blast proofing doors and windows; cyber-security;      and related employee training and awareness exercises.

That is the oath we take: to protect and defend. As we defend the Constitution, we defend the privacy and the civil liberties of the American people.  It is difficult.  Over 20 years ago, I was on the Intelligence Committee for the purpose of protecting civil liberties and privacy, and also to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, two really important overarching issues. So I come to the floor today as one who has worked on this issue for a very long time.  I thank our men and women in the intelligence community for the work they do. We are so proud of what they do.  In those days, almost 25 years ago, when I was first on the committee, it was about force protection and trying to have enough intelligence to avoid conflict, but if we were to engage, we would have the intelligence to protect our forces. It was about force protection. In the nineties, it became more about fighting terrorism and other overarching issues as well.  We live in a dangerous world and force protection on the ground, in theater, is still an essential part of what the intelligence community does. Again, I thank the men and women in the intelligence community for their patriotism and their courage.  The issue that relates to fighting terrorism is one that sometimes has a frightening manifestation on our own soil. But as we protect and defend the American people and the Constitution and their rights, we have to have that balance.

With all the respect in the world for the magnificent members of the Judiciary Committee, all of whom I respect, it is not right to say there is nothing in this bill that protects the privacy of the American people.  In fact, when I was supporting the Judiciary Committee bill, outside groups were complaining. They wanted the Zoe Lofgren amendment. They didn't want that bill. They were complaining about it. Now, today, they are saying that is what they want.  Studying the issue, I think one of the differences along the way is when it is appropriate in terms of a warrant.

The amendment, the motion to recommit, addresses concerns of people on both sides of the aisle, certainly in our Democratic Caucus, that seeks to secure the highest possible protections for American civil liberties. At the same time, it ensures that the intelligence community and law enforcement can continue to keep Americans safe.

A vote for this amendment--and I hope it would be bipartisan, especially from those who are objecting to the bill on the floor--is a vote for privacy protections and for civil liberties. We would have preferred to have this in the original bill that is coming to the floor. We couldn't get that in committee. Hopefully, we can get it on the floor.  Voting against the motion to recommit means fewer protections, less oversight, and more risk that Americans' rights will be violated.  In the course of this, I mentioned this issue about the warrant and arrest. I talked about the Judiciary Committee's bill. At the offset of all of this, we all opposed the first Intelligence Committee's bill. We supported the Judiciary Committee's bipartisan bill being criticized by some outside groups for supporting it, rather than the Lofgren amendment.  But changes were made in the Intelligence Committee's bill to this effect. We asked the Speaker to take out the masking provisions, which have no place in this bill. The chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Mr.Nunes, foolishly put that in this bill. It made it a complete nonstarter. I thank the Speaker for removing it.  By the way, somebody should tell the President because he thinks it is still in the bill. With that being said, I personally directed the unmasking process be fixed. It isn't fixed in the bill, Mr.That would be a second tweet of the day, confusing matters even worse, unfortunately. The administration, although they probably would like an extension of the status quo, understands we have to do more than that.  The other provision that was in the bill was an expansion of agents of foreign governments. Agents of foreign governments opened up more people who would be subjected to surveillance. We said: That doesn't fly. That has to be closed. The Speaker did that.  Then, on the ``abouts'' language, I think most people who understand that--it is a complicated issue--understand that it is really not a factor in this discussion. People don't want it mentioned, but the fact is that it had to be addressed. It is not being used and it is unconstitutional. Until it can be proven to be constitutional, it can't be used. When it is used, they would have to go to the FISA court to get permission, and then come to Congress for ratification of that. So there are many protections there.  It is hard, I know. I had a hard time when I was Speaker and we passed a bill to address the gross violations of Vice President Cheney doing the Bush-Cheney surveillance. It was appalling, in my view. I considered it unconstitutional, others did not. But, nonetheless, we put in many, many protections where there were none, and then renewed and improved them when we renewed the bill subsequently in its reauthorization.                              {time}  1015  This isn't about the other side of the aisle that is saying you don't care about privacy if you support this bill. It isn't about that. It is about where you strike the balance when you weigh the equities.  We have to come down in favor of honoring our Constitution and our civil liberties, but we cannot do that completely at the expense. And I believe that the Members and Mr.Nadler understand that full well, and I commend him for his deep understanding of the vital national security issues and the invaluable work that his committee has done to strike a balance between security and privacy and has made a difference.  But the choice we have today is to pass something that is--defeat this bill. You have done that, if you want to do that. Pass an amendment that won't go anyplace, you can do that, and we will be left with extension of the status quo of the current law.  As one who has participated in writing it those years ago, I understand its merit. I also understand the changes in technology, of tactics of terrorists who are out there, and that we have to improve the bill.  I don't consider it a reform bill. It is not that vast. It is some improvements in how we can collect, protect, again, keep the American people safe as well as protect their civil liberties.  Just a couple other things about it. Since this legislation was designed to address concerns related to the use of information collected under FISA section 702, an important foreign intelligence collection authority--we have to keep that emphasis on ``an important foreign intelligence authority.''  So, my colleagues, to that end, this modifies that it requires a court order based on probable cause for FBI criminal investigators to view Americans' communication in the section 702 database and mandates an inspector general study of 702 data. So let's keep the vigilance on, even as we go forward. It contains refined language related to ``abouts'' collection. It requires the executive branch to secure explicit approval from the FISA court for collection. It further objects ``abouts'' collections to--subjects a 30-day congressional review process. I know Mr.Sensenbrenner said nobody can do anything in 30 days, but I think we can.  The bill strengthens the privacy and civil liberties oversight board. That was something I was instrumental in establishing when I was on the Intelligence I know it is important, but I also know that it has to be strengthened and it has to be respected as a watchdog.  So, I mean, the list goes on requiring public reporting on the use of 702 data, just saying to the intelligence community: Don't try to minimize any violations that may have occurred; we want the facts; we want the truth.  And that is why I am so glad it has expanded whistleblower protections and briefings to the Oversight Committee, which we have required. Unlike the original House Intelligence bill, which I oppose, this bill does not include language that would have likely expanded the universe of FISA targets who are now, as I mentioned before, agents of foreign policy powers. It excludes the language on unmasking; somebody tell the  It gives me great pride in our Caucus, if you could have heard the beautiful debate between Mr.Nadler and Mr.[[Page H149]]Schiff on this subject. We are not that far apart. I think that the motion to recommit addresses most of the concerns we have been getting from the outside groups, and communities have dedicated their--whose organized purpose is to protect the civil liberties of the American people.  But, again, with great respect for everyone's opinions and whatever they have put forth, again, saluting our men and women in the intelligence community for the work that they do, we want to be sure we strengthen their hand in terms of protecting the national security of our country, which is our first responsibility, keep the American people safe, and, as we do so, to honor our oath of office to the Constitution, to honor the principles of the  Our Founders knew full well the challenge between security and civil liberties. They lived in a world when they were under attack. The War of 1812 came very soon after the establishment of our country, so this was not a foreign idea to them, and they bequeathed to us the responsibility to protect, defend, protect our liberties.  And, again, respectful of this debate on this issue, I myself will be voting to support my ranking member on the Intelligence Committee, Mr.Schiff, our ranking member, and Members will follow their conscience on this. I just wanted you to know, from my experience in all of this and with weighing the equities involved, that that is the path that I will take.

1081,topic-id,2374,"Mr.President, today I was honored to be invited to the White House and included in a small meeting with President Trump, and it was very clear that I was invited to the White House to stand firm with President Trump today. We talked about immigration, and today I was proud to stand with our  We have been crystal clear. Chain migration must end, period. Any solution to our current immigration crisis that the U.Senate will consider must include ending chain migration. Before I talk about the details of what chain migration is, I want to put it in perspective.  Our immigration crisis today has been longstanding. We had a law written in 1965 and other changes in 1986, but it has really not been since 1991 that there has been any meaningful immigration change.  Three times in the last 11 years, well-intended people in this body and in the House have done a yeoman's job of trying to solve the comprehensive problem of immigration in the United States--without success. Here we are, again, right now, facing a deadline that the President has put on, and rightfully so. We have a sense of urgency.[[Page S160]]The President has done a couple of things. He has defined the scope of the problem, and he has defined a sense of urgency for the people in  The legal immigration system right now is broken, but to deal with that, we have to deal with our entire immigration system in pieces. The reason I believe most past efforts have failed is that they tried to do a comprehensive solution.  Today, we are breaking it into three areas. One is our legal immigration system, and the next step might be our temporary work visas. Today, we bring in about 1.1 million legal immigrants a year, and I will talk about how that relates historically. But we issue about 2.2 million temporary work visas a year. Then the third issue is, of course, the people who are in the United States illegally.  President Trump had a meeting 2 days ago at the White In that meeting, he had Democrats, Republicans, Members of the House, and Members of this body, the Senate, and he drove consensus in that meeting.  It was very interesting that he had the media in there for almost 60 minutes for an open dialogue, and we heard from all people in that room about their position on these topics. I thought it was very interesting that the President had the courage to put this issue in front of the American people and create an air of transparency that we have not had on this issue in decades. In that meeting, he drove two conclusions: one, a scope of the problem and, two, a sense of urgency.  The scope is very simply defined as this: We have to address the DACA situation. The President has given Congress the date of March 5 to come up with a solution for these individuals who are in the country illegally--but not of their doing.  The second issue is border security. We know that border security is a national security issue as much as it is an immigration issue. The good news is that we know that illegal crossings of our southern border are down dramatically this year just because of a couple of reasons. One is the enforcement of current law, and the second is an understanding around the world that we are going to deal with this issue.  The third piece of the scope is chain migration. Any solution to the DACA situation or the legal immigration situation must include addressing the chain migration issue.  Then the last is this archaic diversity visa lottery we have in the United States that was related to at least one of the terrorist attacks, and chain migration was involved in both of the terrorist attacks we have recently experienced here in the United  With regard to DACA, the first item on the scope is that we know we have a March 5 deadline. There is a growing consensus in this body of how to deal with that, and there is great latitude on the part of Republicans in this body to deal with that in a way, with our Democratic partners here, to get a consensus bill that solves this once and for all.  The second is border security. Here, with the President's leadership and in these recent meetings with Democrats and Members of the House, there is a growing consensus that we can deal with the national security issues related to our southern border. We don't need a 2,000-mile wall, as even the President of the United States has said just this week. But there are things we need to do, and we need to do them quickly.  The President today said that his goal is to get this done this year. Coming from the real world, I know that is possible. This President, who comes from the real world and is an outsider to this community here in Washington, knows that is possible, and I think he is going to hold us accountable to that.  The third area I mentioned before is chain migration. I will say more about that in a minute.  The fourth is the diversity lottery. This diversity lottery has not served us well. It is not the number; it is the way it is being handled. We know there is fraud, and we know this is a loophole terrorists are now using to put people in their chain inside the United  There is a growing consensus on these four items of this scope that the President has defined, and we had a consensus in that room 2 days ago in the White There is consensus that we can get to a solution within the timeframe here, but let me be very clear. Any deal--whether it is in business, sports, or certainly in politics--has to have some symmetry. Therefore, any solution for the DACA situation must include a solution for our chain migration crisis.  We must continue working with the He is holding us accountable. He is moving at a business pace, but to do that, we really have to talk about chain migration. I understand there are other areas that we have to talk about, as well, but there is a lot of disinformation about what it really is.  Chain migration is nothing more than a law put in place in 1965 to allow legal permanent residents and U.citizens to sponsor people for U.citizenship. It was put in place in 1965. It has been updated a little bit. But today, a legal permanent resident--for the most part, this is someone who has come in qualified in our legal immigration system, who goes through a 5-year waiting period, who eventually can apply for U.citizenship. While they are a legal permanent resident, almost immediately they can sponsor spouses, minor children, and unmarried adult children. That is current law.  Once they become a citizen--and this is true of any U.citizen, whether they were a recent immigrant or were born here; a U.citizen can sponsor their parents, their spouses, minor children, unmarried adult children, married adult children, and siblings  The issue around this is pretty simple. We have a chart here which shows that in 1965, when this law was put in place, approximately 300,000 U.citizens were brought into the United States in that year under this system. Last year, we had, roughly, about 1.1 million. We had a high of somewhere close to 1.3 million. But we can see, this is a geometric progression that increases unbounded. It is not really the number here, but it is the balance that we have lost.  What happens, and the criticism I have as a business guy looking at this, is that the individuals who determine who future immigrants are going to be are current and recent immigrants.  We don't have many guidelines. We have a country cap system which says that most countries have a percentage of the total they have to have, and they can't exceed that. But there is no real cap here, such that if all these numbers were maximized, then over time you would see this number go up geometrically.  We have a second chart that shows this and demonstrates that over a very short period of time, the numbers can increase dramatically, as we have seen in the last 40 or so years.  There have been studies on this. Princeton has a study which says that right now, based on recent history, any immigrant who comes in sponsors somewhere around 3.5 future immigrants within a short period of time. We don't know what the 3.5 immigrants do when they get sponsored and become citizens or legal permanent residents, but if you extrapolate this out--let's say we start with 2 million as a starting point. They become citizens and they sponsor--let's just say the number is 3. In the first iteration, now we have 6 million people sponsored by the original 2 million; then the second iteration goes from 6 to 18; and in the fourth iteration we are at 54 million people. So all of a sudden, as you can see, there is no limit here, other than the country caps, and the country caps do not limit the total number. They limit the mix.  What is wrong with this system? The problem, as I said just now, is that future immigrants are determined by current immigrants without any regard to their ability to participate in the system.  The second one is that because you can bring parents in, immigrants who come in under this system and become U.citizens can bring their parents in, and all of a sudden, now we have an aged population coming in--not a younger population--and they then draw social services on an already bankrupt system.  Chain migration is not based on skill or the ability to participate in the current economic situation in the United Last year, we brought in 1.1 million immigrants. Of that, 140,000 were immigrants who were related to the worker; 70,000 were the workers, and the other 70,000 were their immediate family. So we can see that over 950,000 people were derivative iterations of what I am talking about.[[Page S161]]  The third thing is that if chain migration is not stopped, it continues to incentivize future illegal immigration because of what you can do once you get here.  Chain migration is another problem with the DACA situation because if you permit a pathway to some sort of legalized situation in the United States for the DACA population, you end up with a situation where those people who are then legalized can sponsor their parents. The problem with that is, the DACA population is not violating fair law, but their parents have.  The last issue I will bring up is, the national security issues are profound. We have seen two national security incidents just this past year related to chain migration and the diversity visa lottery. There is more than enough evidence to show this has to be addressed.  Again, any symmetric deal on immigration has to include, I believe, the four points the President talked about the other day. We have to deal with the DACA situation. We have to deal with our border security, and that means building a wall. We have to deal with the chain migration issues, and we have to deal with this diversity visa lottery. The President demands it. The American people demand it. Today, as a matter of fact, over 80 percent of America believes we need to deal with the DACA situation. Likewise, 72 percent of people in America believe the immigration law should be the worker, the spouse, and their immediate minor children only--72 percent. I can't think of another issue that has come before this body where we had those sorts of agreements in the American population.  The President wants results. He has charged leadership in this body and the House and those of us who have been involved in this for some time to get to it. There is a March 5 deadline looming. Some people say there is a January 19 date that has to do with funding the government. I personally believe the two have nothing to do with each other, but we want a sense of urgency. The President has demanded it. We need it.  We know there are going to be other steps. This is not the last step to this problem. We know we have to deal with how we bring people to the United We need a balance. Of course, we want to continue to be the open arms of the world today in terms of welcoming people to our shores. Just look at what is written on the Statue of Who can argue with that? At the same time, we have to have a balance. Right now, we don't bring in people who are contributing to the economy, for the most part, and we are eliminating--we are not bringing in people who can contribute. All we are asking for is a dialogue to bring balance back to that system.  I am excited to be a part of this dialogue because I believe we have a unique, historic opportunity with people on the other side and people on this side who generally have hearts that are not that dissimilar with regard to how to deal with the DACA population, how to deal with the Dreamers population, how to deal with future immigrant populations that are coming to the United We can have those debates, and we are having them now. I welcome input from all points. I am anxious to get to the bottom line of this.  I will close with this. It is exciting to have leadership from the executive branch on this issue that has put the responsibility back on this body to come up with something that will not allow us to be back here in the next 3, 5, or 20 years dealing with this same problem. We have a historic opportunity. It is time to get to it.  I yield the floor.

French fur trappers were the first Europeans to arrive in the area during the 17th century, and when they recognized the possibilities presented to them within the area's marshes, they sought new opportunities for trade. Moravian missionaries later established the first organized, non-native settlement in the area in 1782 as a refuge for Native Americans who had converted to Christianity along the banks of the Clinton In March 1780, Christian Clemens purchased a distillery, which is considered the first building on the site of the future city of Mount The next year, he bought 500 acres for development, and the site became known as High On January 15, 1818, Macomb County was formally organized as the third county in the Michigan territory and was named in honor of General Alexander Macomb, a highly decorated veteran of the War of 1812. High Banks was platted as the Village of Mount Clemens and named the county seat.  Starting in the early 1800s and continuing until 1840, settlers began moving into the interior of the county and carved out farms from the hardwood forests. Families began focusing on agriculture as the roots of county villages and towns began to be established by this time. Germans, Belgians, and other Europeans also began joining the original French and English settlers during this time. During the 1870s, mineral baths brought international fame to Mount Clemens as many thought the waters had healing powers, though interest in the spas eventually died out in the early 20th century.  Between 1920 and 1930, Macomb County saw its first population spike when it more than doubled from 38,000 to 77,000. This was caused by the establishment of Selfridge Field in 1917, now the Selfridge Air National Guard Base, and the beginning of the migration of automotive workers moving out of the city of During the 1940s and 1950s, the suburbs again saw a population increase but the largest instance of growth occurred between 1950 and 1970, when more than 440,000 moved to Macomb County and helped make it one of Michigan's largest counties.  Today Macomb County encompasses 27 local municipalities that nearly 1 million Michiganders call home. Like our country, its people come from different backgrounds and ethnicities and share many different cultures. There are robust urban clusters, a prosperous manufacturing and economic industry throughout that is home to more than 18,000 businesses, and beautiful natural features and agricultural lands in the north. All of this has contributed to Macomb County having over 865,000 residents, making it the third most populated county in our great  Macomb County has been an integral part of Michigan and our great Nation for 200 years.

585,topic-id,2315,"Mr.Speaker, I rise to oppose the bill before us that takes away National Labor Relations Act protections for hundreds of thousands of workers.  I support Tribal sovereignty. In my home State of Wisconsin, I am proud the Ho-Chunk Nation is in my district. Potawatomi, Oneida, Menominee, Croix, Stockbridge-Munsee, Lac du Flambeau, Lac Corte Oreilles, Red Cliff, Bad River, and other Tribes all reside in my home State, and I am glad to support the autonomy of those Tribal nations. But this bill isn't about Tribal sovereignty. It is about going after workers' rights.  Look at the track record of the majority in this The Republicans have continued to go after workers' rights, as they have so far. They have repealed the rule that required companies seeking large Federal contracts to disclose violations of labor law. They made it harder for people whose jobs are shipped overseas to get unemployment insurance. They have made it harder for workers whose employers don't offer retirement plans to save for retirement. They have repealed an OSHA rule requiring employers to maintain accurate records of serious workplace injuries for 5 years, while the administration drastically reduces the number of OSHA inspectors.  This bill isn't about meaningful sovereignty. It is about selective sovereignty, because it only goes after labor rights.  If this were a bill about sovereignty, it would include a number of other areas that Tribes are compelled to follow in addition to the National Labor Relations Act: the Occupational Safety and Health Act; the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, ERISA; the Family and Medical Leave Act; and the public accommodations of Americans with Disabilities Act, just to start.  If this bill was about sovereignty, it would exempt OSHA and ERISA and the FMLA and the ADA, for starters. But it doesn't do that. This bill only exempts labor protections for hundreds of thousands of workers, Tribal members and nonmembers, because the majority in this Congress isn't really worried about sovereignty. It is concerned[[Page H119]]about taking away the rights of workers, and that is what this bill is really about.  Mr.Speaker, if this body wants to help Tribes, I am here to help. Bring a bill to the floor that covers all exempted areas, and that is a bill that I could support. But that is not what is in front of us today.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record letters of opposition from the International Union of Operating Engineers, the United Auto Workers, United Food and Commercial Workers, and Unite                                            International Union of                                          Operating Engineers,                                  Washington, DC, January 8, 2018.     Paul Ryan,     Washington,     Nancy Pelosi,     Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: The International      Union of Operating Engineers opposes the Tribal Labor      Sovereignty Act, legislation contained in 140 (115-54)      that would eliminate the labor protections currently      guaranteed to hundreds of thousands of American workers.      Indeed, if enacted into law, this bill would constitute the      biggest rollback in labor law since the passage of the Taft-     Hartley Act in 1947.       The International Union of Operating Engineers (IUOE)      represents nearly 400,000 men and women across North      Members of the International Union of Operating Engineers      maintain and operate Native American and non-Native American      gaming facilities around the United States, from Connecticut      to California, and this legislation would have a dramatic      effect on their lives and livelihoods. The IUOE is the      second-biggest union in the hospitality sector. But this      legislation extends beyond casinos and gaming. IUOE members      work in mining and energy facilities on Native American lands      in a number of locations, and those workers eventually could      lose their rights as a result of this legislation.       In a few short words, this bill changes current law by      exempting the National Labor Relations Act from tribal      enterprises on tribal lands. Today, the National Labor      Relations Board (Board) implements a case-by-case review of      whether labor law applies to tribal enterprises.       The precedent-setting case that comes from the San Manuel      Band of Mission Indians is instructive. The Tribe operated a      92,000-sq.ft. casino (over two acres), with 1,400 employees.      Only five of the workers were Native The Board      determined that this large commercial establishment should      not receive the exemption from labor law provided to states      and local government because its operations were      fundamentally different than a government. The San Manuels      were not providing a public good to members of the tribe.      They were not behaving like a government. Instead, the Board      determined that when the tribal operation in question is      commercial in nature, employs significant numbers of non-     Indians, and caters to a non-Native American clientele, ``the      special attributes of sovereignty are not implicated.'' The      Board determined that private labor law applies to the San      Manuel casino, just as it would with any other commercial      operation. Federal courts have supported this interpretation.      Sovereignty does, however, apply to governmental functions of      the tribe, just as they would with any state government.       If passed, the exemption from labor law would unfairly      advantage commercial tribal operations at the expense of non-     Native American private-sector companies. Competitors with      Native American commercial operations must comply with labor      law; Native American operations will not. As mentioned above,      the bill's reach extends well beyond the gaming industry.      Tribes are engaged in a variety of commercial enterprises,      from mining and energy development, to manufacturing and      construction. Over time, it is reasonable to expect that      tribal enterprises will expand and compete more aggressively      with non-Native companies in a wide variety of commercial      sectors, without any concern for the rights of workers.       Tribal labor law is woefully inadequate--virtually non-     existent in most tribes around the country. It is no      replacement for the nation's basic legal framework that      protects workers' rights. Eliminating the NLRA for tribal      enterprises will strip away freedoms guaranteed to Americans      today, including hundreds of thousands of workers at tribal      casinos who are not Native 140 (115-54) would      immediately eliminate the rights of thousands of Operating      Engineers in workplaces all over the United       The International Union of Operating Engineers opposes      140 (115-54), which eliminates nearly one-million workers'      individual right to take collective action to improve their      working conditions, and respectfully urges you to oppose it      when it comes to the floor of the House of Representatives on            Thank you for your consideration.           Sincerely,                                                James Callahan,     General                                  ____         International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and            Agricultural Implement Workers of America--UAW,                                  Washington, DC, January 9, 2018.       Dear Representative: On behalf of the more than one million      active and retired members of the International Union, United      Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of      America (UAW), I urge you to vote against 140, because it      includes provisions from the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act      (H.986). This misguided bill would deny protection under      the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to hundreds of      thousands of workers employed by tribal casinos. This      legislation could also impact dozens of other businesses,      including power plants, mining operations, and hotels.       UAW believes strongly in tribal sovereignty and has a      strong record of supporting civil rights. This bill, however,      is misleading. It is an attack on fundamental collective      bargaining rights and would strip workers in commercial      enterprises of their rights and protections under the      Under the terms of this bill, when a labor contract expires,      a tribe could unilaterally terminate the bargaining      relationship with the union without legal consequence under      the NLRA, because the employer's obligation to bargain could      be eliminated. As a result of having a union and a legally      binding contract, hundreds of dealers have been promoted to      benefited and supervisory positions because of provisions in      the contract that maintain minimum percentages of full-time,      part-time, and supervisory positions. Work rules, wages, and      benefits have all improved because of the right to      collectively bargain. This bill would jeopardize these hard-     fought gains.       The Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act seeks to overturn a      decision by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in San      Manuel Indian Bingo and Casino, 341 NLRB 138 (2004). In      that decision, the Board concluded that applying the NLRA      would not interfere with the tribe's autonomy and the effects      of the NLRA would not ``extend beyond the tribe's business      enterprise and regulate intramural matters.'' The ruling does      not apply in instances where its application would ``touch      exclusive rights of self-governance in purely intramural      matters'' or ``abrogate Indian treaty rights.'' The NLRB has      taken a nuanced view on this matter and has ruled on a case-     by-case basis. Congressional interference is not justified.       Supporters of the bill argue that the bill creates parity      for the tribes with state and local governments who are not      covered under the However, there are some significant      differences. Tribes are exempt from employment laws (Title      VII of the Civil Rights Act) that apply to state and local      governments, whereas private sector contractors work      extensively on behalf of state and local governments and      generally must comply with the Non-tribal members      cannot petition a tribe for labor legislation, while workers      employed by a state or local government have a voice with      their elected leaders. This is significant because 75 percent      of Native American gaming employees are not tribal members.      At Foxwoods, where the UAW represents the workers, well over      98 percent of employees and patrons are not tribal members.      Hundreds of tribal gaming facilities make tens of billions in      revenue annually, and these employees are working for what is      simply a commercial operation competing with non-tribal      businesses.       At a time of growing wealth inequality and a shrinking      middle class, the last thing Congress should do is deprive      workers of their legally enforceable right to form unions and      bargain collectively. We urge you to oppose 140.           Sincerely,                                                      Josh Nassar,     Legislative                                  ____                                                         UFCW,                                  Washington, DC, January 9, 2018.     To All Members of the U.House of       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.3 million members      of United Food and Commercial Workers International Union      (UFCW), I am writing to express our strong opposition to the      Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act as rolled into a bill that will      be reported as 140.       UFCW is proud to represent 1,000 members at casinos that      operate on tribal lands. These workers have joined together      to bargain collectively for good wages, decent benefits, and      a voice on the job. Passage of the Tribal Labor Sovereignty      Act would take that voice away.       We support sovereignty for tribal governments, but the      Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act is so broad that it would      prevent any worker from exercising their freedom of      association under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).      The vast majority tribal casino workers are not tribal      members and therefore have no voice in tribal policy and are      not protected under tribal law.       Most federal laws protecting the workplace apply to tribal      businesses including the Employee Retirement Income Security      Act (ERISA), Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), the      Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), and The NLRA should      not be treated any differently than these other important      laws that protect workers.       There are many differences between state and local      governments and tribal businesses. State and local      governments do not operate multi-billion dollar commercial      Enterprises, nor manage enterprises where the majority of the      employees and customers are from outside of the jurisdiction.      If working people don't like state and local government      policy[[Page H120]]     they can change management by voting for different lawmakers,      while non-tribal employees and customers have no meaningful      way to influence tribal policy.       Congress should be working to expand the rights of American      workers, not take them away. We urge you to stand up for      American workers and oppose the Tribal Labor Sovereignty           Sincerely,                                               Anthony Perrone,     International                                  ____                                                  UNITE HERE!,                                                     Las Vegas, NV       Dear Representative: UNITE HERE represents over 275,000      hardworking men and women in the hospitality industry and      strongly urges you to oppose the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act      (H.986).       Like most Americans, our members have a deep respect for      Native Americans and their role in shaping our nation. Our      members also have a deep and abiding respect for the rights      of American workers and to uphold the laws that govern our      nation and all of its citizens.       This brings me to H.986. This bill would exempt all      businesses owned and operated by Indian nations from the      National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). Tribal businesses,      including but not limited to Indian-owned casinos, have      workforces and customers that are almost all non-If      this bill were to become law, American citizens working for      Native American businesses would lose their U.rights under      the NLRA, including ``full freedom of association'' and      ``self-organization'' without ``discrimination.'' Over the      last 30 years, as Indian enterprises entered the stream of      interstate commerce, a number of federal laws protecting the      workplace have been applied to Indian businesses: Employee      Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), Occupational Safety      and Health Act (OSHA), Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), and      National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). Congress should not      treat the rights Americans have under the NLRA any      differently than these other important laws that protect      American workers.       Much has been made of the need for this bill to give tribal      governments ``parity'' with state and local governments. This      comparison is misleading, if not absurd. States and local      governments do not typically operate multi-billion dollar      commercial enterprises. States and local governments do not      typically run enterprises where the overwhelming majority of      the government's employees are from outside of their      jurisdiction and the overwhelming majority of customers are      also from outside of their jurisdiction. In a state or      locality, if the citizens who live there don't like the      government's policies, they can vote for people to change      those policies. The non-tribal employees and customers have      no meaningful way to influence tribal policies.       In this time of incredible income inequality in our      country, Congress should be working to expand the rights of      American workers, not finding ways to take them away. H.     986 is no different than the laws signed by Governors Scott      Walker (R-WI) and Rick Snyder (R-MI): they attack the basic      rights of workers to organize and collectively bargain.       Please stand up for American workers and join our union to      oppose H.986.           Sincerely,                                                         ",CREC-2018-01-10-pt1-PgH114-2.txt,2171,ADJOURNMENT,2018.0,10.0,January

737,topic-id,201,"Mr.Speaker, I was gravely concerned last week when Attorney General Sessions removed the guidance of the Cole memo regarding the way that the Department of Justice treats marijuana in jurisdictions where it is legal for medicinal or commercial circumstances. I happen to represent one of those States, the State of Colorado, which has a regulatory system for marijuana that has now been called into jeopardy through a Federal overreach.  Effectively, Attorney General Sessions has left the entire fate of not just the industry and those who work in it but also consumers in my State in the hands of 93 U.attorneys, including the one for our State who, if they wake up on the wrong side of the bed one morning, could engage in a mass enforcement action against residents of Colorado who are following our State law.  I call on President Trump to overturn his attorney, and I call upon this body to put the appropriate funding restrictions, based on the McClintock-Polis amendment, into the final funding bill in the next few weeks to prevent the Department of Justice from using funds given to them by Congress to contravene State law in jurisdictions that have chosen to regulate marijuana.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-10-pt1-PgH96-2.txt,1910,RAPID DNA ACT OF 2017,2018.0,10.0,January
746,topic-id,1806,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, over 3 months ago, the funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, expired. Today, families throughout the country, including 90,000 children in my home State of Colorado, face great uncertainty about the future of their healthcare.  When CHIP was first passed, over 20 years ago, it was done in a bipartisan manner, and, until recently, CHIP has always been a bipartisan, nondivisive issue. It is unfortunate to see that, today, here, we are in this body under Republican leadership and, somehow, even children's health insurance has become a political football while we while away our time, our precious legislative time, on bills that have passed this body before and don't go anywhere.  In our most recent Band-Aid for government funding, House Republicans made a claim that CHIP was extended until March 31, but that wasn't the case. By some reports, States could run out of funding in the next few weeks. In fact, in Colorado, our own budget experts predict the State will run out of children's health insurance money by the end of Cancellation letters are literally scheduled to go out at the end of this month.  Mr.Speaker, this simply isn't a way to govern, crisis to crisis, ignoring the real issues people care about in order to consider special interest legislation. Republican leadership and the Trump administration continue to refuse to work on finding a bipartisan solution for the hundreds of thousands who have Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival--or DACA recipients--who are in limbo. We can simply put that bill on the floor today, the Dream Act, and I feel it would pass.  We have the votes to do so, Mr.Let's simply have a vote. It is a purely manufactured crisis.  I am happy to say we will be giving the opportunity for Members of this body to defeat the previous question and move to a vote on the Dream Act, shortly. My colleague, Mr.Correa, has joined us to offer that motion in a few minutes.  Many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle often say that the real deadline for a DACA solution isn't until March, but, in reality, every day, already over 100 Deferred Action recipients lose their protected status, are unable to work with their situation unresolved.  For those DACA recipients, the deadline isn't The deadline has already passed, hence, the urgency. Now is the time to pass the Dream Act, to allow these DACA recipients to continue to live and work and serve in the only Nation that many of them have ever known their whole lives.  All the while, congressional Republicans still refuse to work with Democrats on a long-term government funding solution. Here we are less than 10 days from another government shutdown. The Federal Government continues to move from quick spending patch to quick spending patch, costing taxpayers more in the long run by preventing our agencies from doing the planning necessary to improve efficiency.  Today we are only 5 legislative days away--9 actual days--from a government shutdown and the huge negative repercussions that would follow. As a former businessowner, I know, firsthand, the value of long-term budgeting and stability. Millions of Americans know how to plan their family budget and their home budget. Why can't Congress do it for the country?  Instead of working on a long-term budget solution, the House is spending its time on other legislation. Here we have a bill that undermines workers' rights and their protections under the National Labor Relations  In addition to this controversial bill, there are two attached pieces of legislation that were originally separate[[Page H98]]bills that easily could have gone on the suspension calendar and would have largely been noncontroversial. They passed on unanimous consent in the Senate and in the House Natural Resources Committee, but their fate is put in jeopardy by putting them onto a controversial bill.  The first bill amends the White Mountain Apache Tribe Water Rights Quantification Act of 2010. To clarify, that is a separate economic development fund known as the WMAT settlement fund that can be accessed to cover potential cost overruns for this rural water project.  The Interior Department has said it is unsure if the settlement fund could be used for additional costs, and so this clarifies that water-related economic development projects would specifically include the planning, design, and construction of the rural water system. This legislation could have passed and, likely, could have become law but, instead, has been put into jeopardy by affixing it to a bill that is unlikely to go anywhere.  The second uncontroversial bill that is wrapped up is regarding the authority of pueblos. It concerns two New Mexican pueblos and simply clarifies that they could lease their lands that are held in trust by the Federal Government for 99 years. This legislation ensures Native Americans have the right to their lands that they deserve. It respects their sovereignty and nations in a noncontroversial way.  I am fully supportive of these two technical and simple pieces of legislation, but, unfortunately, because they are attached to a bill that isn't going anywhere, are very unlikely to become law.  These are the types of bills that could go straight to the suspension calendar and straight through the Senate and should be signed by the President, but, instead, they are being put in jeopardy by lumping them in with a bill that is unlikely to become law.  There are so many of these types of Natural Resources Committee bills from both Democrats and Republicans that should be making their way forward as stand-alone items.  I am glad, for instance, that one that I authored, my Bolt's Ditch and the WEDGE Act--actually, two that I authored--were put forward and passed by this House and not attached to other controversial legislation.  I am also reintroducing, soon, a bicameral bill that I also consider noncontroversial, the Continental Divide Wilderness, Recreation and Camp Hale Legacy Act bill. It would preserve over 90,000 acres of wilderness and recreation lands in Summit and eastern Eagle Counties, and is endorsed by local businesses, commissioners, and towns across the area.  It was crafted with input from dozens of stakeholder groups, including the Wilderness Society, Vail Resorts, the Outdoor Industry Association, the International Mountain Bicycling Association, Conservation Colorado, and many municipalities and local businesses. It will help sustain our recreational economy in Eagle and Summit Counties, protect watersheds, and preserve important wildlife corridors and tourism opportunities.  These are the kinds of bills that we should be moving forward from the Natural Resources Committee, not controversial bills that actually take away the rights of American citizens, including Native American citizens.  And, while we are not today, we should never be moving forward on Natural Resources Committee bills that actually whittle away at the public lands we all own and the Antiquities Act by shrinking monuments like Bears Ears or making it easier to destroy lands we cherish and value.  All I ask is that we separate out these two Natural Resources bills, send them to the suspension calendar, and not let them be put in jeopardy by affixing them to the fundamental underlying legislation which is controversial, namely, the Tribal labor bill. That is the bill that is the main controversial bill in this package.  And, of course, I stand here as a supporter of the rights of every American to organize. I am a supporter of workers' rights, and I am also a strong supporter of Tribal sovereignty, not only principles under American law, but the right thing to do.  I, like many of my colleagues, place a great deal of importance in Tribal self-determination, autonomy, local control, and independent governance for our nations. In fact, I have been the champion of sovereignty, and I have long voted in favor of legislation that allows Tribal discretion in the judicial processes and in education.  But, of course, the right to organize is an inalienable right of every American, protecting our workers, including Native American workers, to fight for a safe working environment regardless of what entity owns the company they work for. Legislation balancing these two competing principles is possible.  Reconciling these two priorities can be difficult, but I think that there is a way to do it. Instead, this bill drives a wedge between issues or groups that have a history of working strongly together, such as Native Americans and labor unions.  We can balance critical rights to sovereignty with the protections that are due to every American citizen regardless of their race, ethnicity, cultural practices, membership in an Indian nation, or governing structures. This legislation does not find the right balance. It hurts workers of all stripes and colors, including many Native American workers.  Workers have the right to collectively bargain; otherwise, workplaces become unsafe, sexual harassment can go unchecked, and the income gap continues to widen. This legislation would strip Native Americans and non-Native Americans, many of whom work for Native American enterprises, of the right to collectively bargain.  Without the right to self-governance, we would not have the strong communities present across the country today. Without the right to collective bargaining, we would not have the strong and growing economy that supports our middle class. This legislation simply does not succeed in balancing both of these values.  I also want to point out that President Trump agrees with me, or at least he did last time he commented on this 25 years ago. In 1993, at a hearing before the House Committee on Natural Resources regarding the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, then private citizen Trump testified regarding the legal barriers facing labor unions at that time to organize workers employed at Tribal casinos. His testimony said, in part: ``At present, even union workers in States like New Jersey would have no federally or State protected rights or the ability to organize in casinos on Tribal lands. The unions hope to do something about this. They hope to gain the right to recognition, the right to organize if they so choose. Quite frankly, I hope they have better luck than we have had so far.''  Mr.Speaker, the last time the President commented on this, it is clear that he also believed that workers on Tribal land should have the right to collectively bargain. I hope that his administration would not be supportive of this legislation if it were to move through Congress, which it is unlikely to do.  Instead of policies that benefit those at the top, I have a number of ideas that I will be talking about later that we can move forward to empower workers and help make sure that the 21st century economy works for everyone.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2018-01-10-pt1-PgH96-5.txt,1910,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2018.0,10.0,January

752,topic-id,1385,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I want to address some of the things that my colleague, Mr.Cole, said. The big difference here between Tribal-owned and -run businesses and State and local governments is that State and local governments are not generally in the business of owning/operating companies. With very few exceptions, we don't have a socialist form of government in this country where cities or States are actually operating businesses in competition with the private sector.  Tribes, in addition to their Tribal workers, which are more analogous to State or local workers--and it is an appropriate discussion--also happen to own businesses, which is fine, and they produce revenue for the Tribes, which is great. However, they should play by the same economic rules as other businesses, which in no way impede businesses from succeeding in our country.  Of course, many of these Tribal-owned businesses are the main source of support and income for If our labor laws work for any other business, they should also work for them.  American citizens, including Native American citizens of our country, don't lose their rights as workers because of the ownership of the organization and company that they happen to be employed by. That is a key tenet that needs to be balanced with, of course, Tribal sovereignty, which I am a strong supporter of.  If the discussion were simply about Tribal employees, it would be a different discussion. To be clear, it is about businesses that are owned by Tribes, and we simply don't have an analogy on the State and local side with very few exceptions. I am sure there is one somewhere. But, in general, municipalities and counties are not the owners of operating businesses that compete in the private sector.  Now, I want to talk about what is possible with regard to enhancing the rights of workers and labor. Instead of these kinds of policies that take away the rights of workers, including Native American workers, we should be moving forward on policies that put workers first.  My bill, the Giving Workers a Fair Shot Act, would do that. The bill would provide reasonable solutions to address the growing inequality in the United States by helping workers and ensuring that companies follow the law, emphasizing the need for corporate accountability.  It would remove unfair obstacles to forming a union, enhance transparency from employers, and increase penalties for violating our labor laws, which are strong but often not enforced.  First, all too often, employers frequently drag their feet on a newly formed union's first contract for months, sometimes for years, often with the goal of avoiding an agreement. Sometimes that means a newly certified union that the voters have voted in fails to receive a first contract.  My bill would set up a first-contract arbitration system where the union or the employer has the option of seeking mediation if they feel one party is not responding adequately to a negotiation request.  It would also ensure that no taxpayer funds are used for union busting or persuaders, activities like planning and implementing activities that deter employees from joining or forming a union. Again, it simply makes sure that no taxpayer funds are used for that explicit purpose.  Third, the bill updates the National Labor Relations Act's definition of ``supervisor.'' Too often, workers are reclassified as supervisors for effectively gerrymandering bargaining units. This updated definition helps prevent that sort of manipulation and would make it easier for employees to be able to form a union if they so choose.  Fourth, the bill reaffirms the importance for the government to protect workers from having their rights violated by increasing criminal and civil[[Page H101]]penalties for individuals and executives who violate critical labor laws.  Injured workers and worker deaths should never be simply a cost of doing business. These robust protections help make sure that this is truly a criminal issue for the few bad actors that exist on the employer side.  Finally, the legislation empowers shareholders and creates new accountability for CEOs and executives by preventing the CEO and chairman at a publicly traded company from being the same person. We would all love to work for ourselves, but that is not in the long-term economic interest of the shareholders, the customers, or the workers.  The bill also expands insider trading restrictions for executives to 1 year after they leave a company.  In my district and across Colorado, people are clamoring for proactive policies that actually help address the income gap and put the needs of middle class families and workers first. Policies like the Giving Workers a Fair Shot Act would do that.  Now, this legislation that we are seeing here today is not the only controversial legislation we are seeing this week. Unfortunately, the next rule up will be one that takes away our constitutional rights as  The FISA reauthorization legislation has been described as a compromise, but that is not the case.                              {time}  1430  This legislation is not the necessary FISA reform bill that many in Congress, including myself, have called for, which is why I and so many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are opposed to it in its form and support the Amash-Polis amendment, cosponsored by many others.  It is also why the current FISA reauthorization bill is opposed not only by privacy and civil liberties groups and consumers but also technology companies and job creators across the political spectrum. Businesses are, rightfully, afraid that, if this bill passes, it will make it even harder for American companies to engage in international commerce.  Many countries in Europe, for example, will simply refuse to do business with a technology company that is housed in the U.because they are afraid of what will happen to their citizens' data, perhaps even in contravention of their own stronger privacy laws.  This bill does not make any steps in the direction of reform that are necessary. It falls short on several grounds. In fact, in some ways, it makes the FISA program worse by codifying the ``abouts'' collections term that refers to the NSA searching through the internet traffic to collect not only communications to or from an intelligence target but also those that simply mention an identifier used by a target, even though that has been declared unconstitutional twice. It could be the name of a city or State or even a country that can be used as an identifier; in theory, subjecting close to 100 percent of tax and emails and internet traffic to warrantless searches.  This bill fails to consider the core concern that I have and that many Members on both sides of the aisle share; namely, the government's use of section 702 information against American citizens in investigations that have nothing to do with national security and does not require a warrant or the due process of our  Instead, the bill codifies the ability of the government to access the content of our emails and telephone calls without a warrant. It creates an unprecedented and unworkable ``optional'' warrant, which is merely window dressing but does nothing to address the legitimate concerns.  These massive flaws could have been addressed, had we proceeded under regular order, but this version was reported only from the Intelligence Committee and bypassed the Judiciary Committee, which was cut out of negotiations when they agreed to go along with the Intelligence Committee railroading their committee. That is why I signed a bipartisan letter with dozens of our Members demanding FISA be handled under regular order.  I am proud to have offered the amendment that will be considered later with Representatives Lofgren and Amash and others that would provide a better path to keep American citizens safe and protect our privacy and ensure that American companies can remain competitive abroad. It will protect our constitutional rights and keep us safe.  My amendment, which is based off the USA RIGHTS Act, ends backdoor searches, ends reverse targeting, bans ``abouts'' collections, and strengthens FISA court oversight and transparency. I think these are all commonsense and necessary changes that Americans have been demanding for years.  Mr.Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to oppose the FISA reauthorization and support the Amash-Lofgren amendment when they are brought forth shortly.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

755,topic-id,589,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, I also want to address something my friend, Mr.Cole, said.  Again, I am sure you can find a few instances in municipal and State government, but I am sure the gentleman would agree that, relative to size, they are very few and far between. Even most municipal golf courses are run by private operators under contract to municipalities. I am sure the gentleman can find a couple that aren't.  I have interacted with businesses in my district that are owned by Tribal nations, and I worked with them. There are a number of provisions in law that help them. I support those.  But I do believe that workers don't give up their rights simply because they work for a company that happens to be owned by a Tribal nation, as opposed to an American or even a Native American citizen of our country who, in their personal capacity, is the owner of a company and would not have the same ability to deprive workers of their rights as a company that was owned by his or her  So, again, we want to make sure we support Tribal autonomy. And I do. Perhaps there is a bill to be had here, but it is simply not this bill.  I want to share a story of one of my constituents from Fort Collins, Colorado, that I think will bring this back to what our body should be doing.  I understand there are arguments on both sides of this. I understand there are people on both sides of the aisle who have concerns and also who support this bill. But it is not the urgency that we face with regard to deferred action or child health insurance.  In July of 2017, Carla and her husband from Fort Collins found out they were expecting another child. Both Carla and her husband work full time. Carla works at a local childcare center. Her husband works at a local retail store.  Even with their two full-time incomes, like many Americans, they felt the Children's Health Insurance Program was the only medical coverage for them, and Carla enrolled in  Carla is due to deliver her baby in March of this year, but she worries that, when the baby comes, she won't have medical coverage anymore. Unfortunately, Carla is right to worry. Right now, Colorado is expected to run out of CHIP funding at the end of February, just a few weeks before Carla is due.  That is why this issue is so urgent, Mr.For the tens of thousands of children and pregnant women, like Carla, we can't wait another minute to provide a permanent extension of the Children's Health Insurance  But instead of finding a bipartisan fix for the Children's Health Insurance Program or for deferred action or to keep the government open, instead, here we have yet another bill that people will have different opinions on, and I feel that it undermines workers' rights and is not supportive in the way that I would be of the rights of our nations. It is, unfortunately, another example of misguided priorities.  We have precious little time--I believe 4 days--until the funding of the government expires. We should have acted on the Children's Health Insurance Program last year. We should have acted on deferred action last year. We need to act now.

522,topic-id,2356,"Mr.President, I want to thank my friend and colleague, Senator Blumenthal, for his commitment to this issue. We started this caucus to end trafficking 6 years ago, and during that time period there has been some significant progress made here in the Senate and the We have been able to pass legislation to help crack down on trafficking.  Unbelievably, in this century in this country, sex trafficking is increasing, not decreasing, despite our good efforts. We have increased the penalties on those who purchase sex from underage children. We have changed the dynamic of how the Federal Government and HHS look at this issue and these girls who get engaged in trafficking and get trapped into the system and to treat them like the victims they are rather than as criminals.  We have done more to increase awareness of this issue. We have required for missing kids, which are probably the most vulnerable of all, that there be a photograph or another identifier, which, unbelievably, for the most part there was not prior to that. We have made some progress.  Senator Blumenthal and I have written legislation with regard to Government contractors who overseas engage in human trafficking--and our tax dollars go for that. So we have made some progress, but it is still increasing.  Why? Senator Blumenthal talked about it. The experts are unified on this. The main reason we see an uptick is because of the dark side of the internet. The Senator quoted the statistic earlier about an 850-percent increase in reports of sex trafficking over the last several years prior to 2015. The reason that was true was because we saw the emergence of these companies like backpage.com, which probably has about 75 percent of the commercial sex traffic on one site, and the ruthless efficiency of the internet getting engaged on this issue. So we have to address this issue.  Here is the tragic part of this. Not only are more and more lives being ruined and there are more and more heartbreaking stories, but it is because of a Federal law that provides immunity to these websites. So it comes right back here, right to these desks, right to this Congress, right to us as legislators to fix this problem, not to try to smooth it over but to actually fix the problem, which is that some of these online trafficking sites are immune from prosecution because of a Federal law. It was a well-intended law that was written 21 years ago, I think. It is the Communications Decency Ironically, it was put in place to make it a crime to send pornography to kids online, but it has been twisted and used by these trafficking sites to provide them the ability to say: You can't touch us; you can't go after us. That is so because part of what the law says in trying to promote the internet is that if you post somebody else's material on your site, you are not liable. All we are saying is that if you know this involved trafficking--and Senator Blumenthal talked about his experience as a prosecutor; this is a high bar, a known standard--then you can't get away with this. The standard we use, by the way, for Federal trafficking is the Federal law. So we allow victims to have their day in court, but they can't get it now.  The stories are really sad. Let me tell you one. We spent 18 months investigating this in the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, and what we learned was truly tragic. You had girls who were trafficked on these sites. In one case a mom testified that her daughter had gone missing for about 10 weeks, as I recall--missing. This is a 14-year-old girl. What would you do as a parent if your daughter was missing for 10 weeks? You would go crazy. She tried everything, and someone finally told her: There is this website called backpage.com; you might want to check it out.  She did, and she was aghast at what she saw, but she was relieved by one thing. She saw a photograph of her daughter, knowing, then, that she was still alive. So she picked up the phone and called backpage.com and said: I just saw my daughter. She has been missing for 10 weeks. I saw her on your website. Thank you for taking down that ad that is trying to sell my daughter for sex online. This is my daughter. She is underage.  Do you know what the backpage operator said at the other end of the line, according to this mom? They said: Did you pay for the ad, ma'am? She said: No, I didn't pay for the ad. This is my daughter. They said: Well, we can't take down the ad. We can't take down the ad.  What kind of evil is behind that kind of a business practice? Well, what we learned, as we increasingly dug into this issue, is that it is all about profit, and you can imagine this is a very profitable business. Profits came first, to the point that people would place ads with backpage that indicated that it was for an underage girl, and backpage would then get to the purchaser of the ad and say: You know what, we need to change your ad a little bit. You need to edit out this word ``schoolgirl'' or ``cheerleader'' or ``Lolita,'' referring to a novel about an underage girl. So they knew these ads were being run by people who were advertising underage girls, and they not only ran the ads but they sanitized the ads first.  That just shouldn't happen in this country. It shouldn't happen anywhere in the world, but certainly not with a Federal law providing protections for organizations like that.  That is all we are saying. We want Congress to pass a law that says that if you engage knowingly in facilitating this kind of activity, you are subject to liability. You have to be held to account. Is that too much to ask?  Senator Blumenthal talked about it as a former prosecutor. We allow State prosecutors to go after these sites, which they cannot now. They have to use the Federal standard. So we are not trying to create a whole new area of law. It is a Federal standard that has been passed by this body.  When these victims go to court, they are rebuffed: Sorry, ma'am. In one court last August, a Sacramento judge basically invited our legislation. He said to Congress: The way that law reads, even somebody who exploits women and children online has immunity. Congress, this is your job.  So that is all this legislation does.  Senator Blumenthal talked about the House legislation. There was strong House legislation that was introduced[[Page S87]]that still bears that same H.number. Then it was changed in the Judiciary Look, I am glad that there is more awareness and consciousness about this issue and that both the House and Senate want to act, but let's not water this legislation down. Let's not take away this core element of our legislation that simply says that under the Communications Decency Act, we should have the opportunity to allow people to sue and allow prosecutors to go after these evil websites.  We can set up new causes of action. That is fine. We can do more things as we have done in this body. As I said, over the last 5 or 6 years, we passed a number of important bills to try to raise the consciousness and to try to help on this issue, but if we don't deal with this internet part, we will continue to see an increase, which is a stain on our national character--that at this time in our Nation's history, we are seeing an increase in people being sold for sex online, often underage.  Another story came not from testimony before the permanent subcommittee where we spent 18 months studying this, but it came before the Commerce Committee, and Senator Blumenthal was there for part of this. This woman came forward. By the way, you could have heard a pin drop in that room when she talked about her 16-year-old daughter who was sold on backpage.com and was sold to a man who murdered her on Christmas Eve of 2016. This is what this mom said: My daughter never should have been on that site; that should never be allowed. She is right. It should never be allowed. How can we allow that to happen?  So Senator Blumenthal and I introduced this legislation. We had 24 cosponsors almost right away, and it was bipartisan from the start. This is not a political or partisan issue. As of yesterday, I think we had 64 cosponsors. These are thoughtful Members, including the Presiding Officer today, who looked at this legislation. They have heard the arguments from both sides. The other side of the argument is from the tech community, some of whom are supporting our legislation, some of whom are not. But for the people in technology who are concerned about this, I just have to state: I don't get it. This is very narrowly crafted for this issue. We are not trying to affect the freedom of the internet--just the opposite.  If you don't start cracking down on this obvious crime against humanity, which is what I believe trafficking is, I think we are going to see much broader legislation to deal with the internet. This just says: If you are violating a Federal law on trafficking and you are doing it knowingly, you are facilitating it, you are assisting it, then you have to be held liable and held to account.  In fact, we keep in the law a Good Samaritan provision that says if a website wants to clean up its site, it is protected. The good guys should be protected. We want them to clean up their site. We want to be sure that we continue to have freedom of the internet, but we don't want to allow--nor do I think it was ever intended in this law to allow--criminal activity to occur that affects our children and our constituents over the internet without any sense of accountability or responsibility. It is narrowly crafted. It is focused on a real issue that affects real people.  On Friday I was back home in Ohio, and I was at a drug treatment center. I had an opportunity to meet some of those who are recovering addicts. As often happens when I am in those kinds of settings, it turns to what kind of treatment options are out there for trauma. Why? Because there is a link between opioids--particularly heroin and fentanyl--and trafficking. This is what has been told to me many times by some of these women, sometimes underage: Senator, trafficking has moved from the street corner to the iPhone, from the street corner to the cell phone. That is a reality.  I met a woman on Friday who was going through treatment, and part of it is to treat the trauma that is associated with this. Drug treatment is one thing, but the trauma associated with sex trafficking, repeated rapes is a course that is a deeper and even more difficult road to recovery. I believe she will recover. She has a great attitude. She gets it. She is going to have to focus on it and dedicate herself to it.  I will just tell you that this is a real issue in our communities today. It is affecting every single State in this body, and we cannot continue to ignore the reality that while the internet has brought a lot of good things to us and the internet has helped our economy to grow, there is a dark side and this dark side of the internet is why we think it is so important for us to address this issue and address it now so that the next mom who is out there right now wondering, ``Where is my daughter? She has gone missing,'' will not find that she has been advertised online to multiple men, that her life is forever changed, and that she will never achieve her God-given potential in life because of the trauma she has experienced. That is happening right now today.  We have to pass this legislation. It will help. I am convinced it will help. It will help to avoid the reality today, which is that these websites in your communities don't care and they are not going to care until we make them accountable.  This month is National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month--President Trump just wrote a beautiful proclamation about it. It was a call to action. President Obama did previously. Thursday is the day in which a lot of the advocates will be here in town talking about this issue. I just urge my colleagues and their staff, if they are listening today, please sign up on this legislation if you haven't already. To our leadership, let's get this to the floor for a vote. This should not be an issue that we drag out. Let's deal with it. We spent years studying this. We know what the issue is. We know what the problem is. Then, to my House colleagues, let's work together to actually solve this problem.  For those in the tech community who continue to oppose this legislation, I ask you to look into your hearts and think about the impact this is having on families all across the country. Yes, we all want a better world, and that is part of what many of these internet companies are professing to want, and many of them, by the way, have spent considerable resources in fighting trafficking. But if you don't get at this issue--it has moved from the street corner to the smartphone. If you don't get at this issue, I don't believe we will see the progress that all of us desire.  Thank you.

Russia  Mr.President, I heard Senator Cardin earlier speaking about the threat that Russia poses not just to us--and the meddling that has been occurring here in our elections over the years--but also the threat that they pose to other democracies around the world, particularly in Eastern I appreciate his report. I appreciate the fact that he has worked with a number of us, including Senator Murphy, on the other side of the aisle, to put forward legislation to try to push back against this disinformation.  In fact, we have required that the State Department increase their efforts through what is called the Global Engagement I am meeting with the Deputy Secretary of State here after this speech, and I am going to speak more about that with him, but we really want to be sure that the United States is taking more aggressive action against the kind of disinformation that can destabilize democracies.  We heard some of the examples of what his report was able to uncover in terms of some of the Russian activity, particularly, again, in Europe and in Eastern This is an issue. It is a foreign policy issue that we have been, in my view, slow to respond to. It didn't start with the last Presidential election, and it will not end with this last Presidential election unless we take a more aggressive stance and step up.  So I appreciate that it has been a bipartisan effort that we should acknowledge as Americans that it is in our interests to push back against the disinformation and the propaganda and the destabilization of democracies.                               Tax Reform  Today, Mr.President, I wish to speak about some good news; that is, that here in Congress we actually did something with the tax relief and tax reform legislation that is actually creating a better economy and more hope for people.  There was news announced today, just a few minutes ago, that is in addition to the news we have heard over the last few weeks. This historic tax reform was created, we will remember, with two goals in mind. One was to cut taxes for middle-class families--so individual tax cuts. The second part of it was to make America a better place to do business. Let's ensure that there will be more jobs created here rather than elsewhere. Let's level the playing field so our workers aren't competing with one hand tied behind their back.  As I have said through the process and as we developed this bill, we had a bipartisan agreement that our Tax Code was broken, but we couldn't seem to come up with an agreement of how to fix it. Some Democrats said: Well, that is great that you guys have done this bill, but it is not going to help. I said at the time: The proof will be what happens, what happens to jobs, what happens to wages, what happens to the economy in general, and what happens to your paycheck.  I am here to announce today that the results have been pretty darn impressive, and they have been across the board--all of those things I talked about. We have already seen as a result of this tax legislation that America has become a better place to do business. All over the country there are companies and businesses, small and large,[[Page S158]]that have stepped forward to talk about that. I now have a list of 150 businesses--and I am sure there are many, many more--that have decided to do something. Either they announced a pay increase, a bonus, an increased 401(k) contribution, an increased pension contribution, or maybe a new investment in equipment and in technology to make workers more competitive. All of this is specifically because of the tax relief and reform bill. That is what is happening.  For those who haven't followed it, even today another company, Walmart--the largest employer in my State--announced that they are indeed going to increase pay and provide bonuses to over 1 million workers. Some companies have actually announced a combination of things, not just a pay increase but maybe a pay increase as well as an increased contribution to a 401(K) or an increased contribution to a charity.  So I think we are already seeing the direct effects--the direct and very positive beneficial effects--of this tax reform legislation, as many have hoped that we would see, given the fact that we wrote it to create these incentives for more jobs and better jobs.  But today we are going to begin to see the direct effects of the other part of the bill; that is, the tax relief directly to individuals. The IRS just announced about an hour ago that they are publishing updates to the tax withholding tables for employers. Now, what does this mean? This means that Uncle Sam is going to take a little less of your paycheck, and you are going to see it on your paycheck. So the withholding--the amount that is withheld from your paycheck with taxes--is going to be changed. The Treasury Department says that for 90 percent of Americans--90 percent--there will be a change in withholding that will be positive for them. In other words, they will have less money coming out of their paycheck.  Most people whom I represent in my home State of Ohio live paycheck to paycheck. This is really important. We talked earlier about how much this is going to be: $2,000 a family on average. That is the median income for a family in Whatever the amount is, this is significant, and it is something that people are going to be pretty surprised about because so many people have misrepresented what this legislation is about. They are now seeing that it is about jobs, it is about wages, it is about bonuses, and so on. But they are also going to see in their own paycheck that it is about more take-home pay. It is about having a little healthier family budget.  So, again, as we went through this process, when we would have these debates I would say: I encourage people to look online, to look at the professionals, to look at a tax calculator. I said: The proof is in your paycheck. I think the proof will be in their paychecks--more hard-earned money staying in their pocket rather than going to Washington is something that my constituents will like, particularly if we see this economy start to pick up because of this tax reform bill, which, by the way, will result in a stronger economy.  Therefore, there will be more revenue through growth. So the Federal Government will have more revenue coming in. Every 1-percent increase in GDP--a 1-percent increase in growth in this country--means about $2.7 trillion in increased revenue coming into the Federal coffers. So that is more revenue coming in, not from a tax increase but from growth. That is the kind of revenue we want to have to be able to deal with many issues we face on the fiscal side, including our large deficits and debt, and that we will also begin to see as we see a better economy grow and develop because of this tax reform legislation. That is my strong belief and, again, I think the evidence is pretty clear that we are headed that way.  I want to commend the IRS for moving so quickly because this is pretty quick for us to turn it around. We just passed the legislation at the end of the year. It became effective on January 1. Here we are on January 11, and we are already seeing them changing the withholding that is going to go to the employers so that employers will withhold less from people's paychecks.  I also want to personally commend the Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, because I know he has a passion to make sure that our hard-working taxpayers get this tax relief as soon as possible. My sense is that he is the one who has promoted our moving quickly on this, in a professional and careful way so that the withholding tables are accurate but ensuring that we do allow people to begin to have a little more in their paychecks to be able to help make ends meet. Again, with most people I represent living paycheck to paycheck this is a big deal. Steve Mnuchin has been, I think, essential to getting this done as quickly as it has been done, as he was essential in the tax reform legislation, along with Gary Cohn of the White House, and others.  So this law is going to help middle-class families in three main ways.  First, it cuts taxes across the board. As I noted, the IRS announcement means that about 90 percent of taxpayers will see more money in their paychecks. They do this in a number of ways in the tax reform legislation, and I am talking about the reform notice here. It is Notice 1036. For those who want to go online and look at it, just go on the IRS website, irs.gov, and you can see it, the new withholding tables. They lay all of this out. Depending on how much your paycheck is, whether you are paid weekly, biweekly, semimonthly, or monthly, you see what your benefits are going to be. But it happens because there is a doubling of the standard deduction, and most people already take the standard deduction in my State of Now more people will take it because there is a doubling and essentially a zero tax bracket. So it goes from about $12,000 a family to about $24,000 a family.  It also has a lowering of the rate of tax. So your tax rate is going to be lower relative to what it was before this.  Also, if you have kids, you get a doubling of the child tax credit, including part of that being an increase in the refundability of that if you don't have income tax liability. But if you still have expenses, if you still have payroll taxes, you get your benefit there.  So these are the kinds of things that, combined, end up with this notice going out saying: You are going to have a little more in your paycheck.  Second, the result of these tax cuts is going to take about 3 million Americans off the tax rolls altogether. I say ``about'' because the Joint Committee on Taxation doesn't have the final number yet but they have told me that it is at least 3 million Americans who now pay income taxes who will no longer have income tax liability. Now, they may have payroll tax liabilities, and they may have State and local taxes, but the point is that this was about Federal income reform and relief, and they are going to be out from under the IRS and again be able to help make ends meet. That is as a result of this legislation. I said earlier that about $2,000 per family is the average tax savings for a median family income in Ohio, $2,000 a year in tax relief is about the average.  This is important because as expenses have gone up over the last couple of decades--particularly, healthcare expenses in the last decade--wages have not. So wages have been relatively flat. In fact, on average, if you take inflation into account, they have been flat over the last couple of decades. We are beginning to see some increase in wages now. This is terrific, but with wages being flat and expenses up, people have had a real squeeze, and that middle-class squeeze is real in my home So this is extra money that families--many people living paycheck to paycheck--can use for expenses like healthcare, maybe make a car payment, save for retirement, or maybe help their kids.  The second goal of this tax reform, boosting the American economy, is also beginning to happen, as I said earlier. When the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act became law, immediately we saw a number of companies and businesses, small and large, around the country say: We are going to do something about this. I remember being home over the holidays and, actually, the day after Christmas, December 26, I was talking with friends, and a guy who owns a small manufacturing business, the brother of a friend of mine, said: Would you be willing to come out to our little company to talk about the tax bill?  I said: Sure, if we can figure it out schedulewise.[[Page S159]]  He said: Because I want to give my employees a bonus. I am looking at this tax bill, how it is going to affect our little business, and what it is going to do for us to be able to invest more in the company, and I want to give my employees a $1,000 bonus--everybody, 137 employees--and I also want to do something in terms of investing in my equipment because I want to make my people more competitive.  This is a small manufacturer in Cincinnati, OH, that makes a high-quality product, a precision product, and he wants to make sure that his people have the best equipment to be competitive. In his case, he has competition from overseas, as do a lot of American businesses, either directly or indirectly these days in an increasingly global economy, and he wants to be sure he is competitive. So I went there.  I went to the company, Sheffer Corporation, and I had the opportunity to talk about the tax reform bill and what it does across the board. He made the announcement, and I can tell you that people were very happy because these are folks who work hard and play by the rules. They aren't looking for any kind of a handout, but what they do want is to be able to know that if they work hard and do the right thing, they will be able to see a little better future for themselves and their kids and their grandkids and not have that middle-class squeeze we talked about, where wages are flat and expenses are up.  When the economy is not growing at a fast rate, which we have seen over the last decade, it is really a challenge. When we have an economy growing at 2 percent or less, it is tough to see that kind of open opportunity. Now, with this tax reform bill, I think we have a much better chance of seeing that. In fact, looking at some of the projections for next year, it looks like most people think the economy is going to grow at better than 2 percent--maybe 3 percent or maybe a little higher. We don't know. The point is that people are going to have more hope and opportunity.  It is not just Sheffer, though. In my hometown of Cincinnati, the Fifth Third Bank announced a companywide wage increase. So wages are going to go up for entry-level jobs and push all wages, as well as bonuses, for 13,000 employees in  Across the country we have seen this. Tomorrow I will be at a plant in Cleveland, OH, that is putting more money into their pension plan. I think it is going to be about $15 million into a pension plan, which isn't in terrible shape, but it could be a lot healthier. That is going to help those employees directly.  Last Friday I was at a plant in Columbus, OH, a small manufacturer, Wolf They do an awesome job there competing with people all around the globe, and they are going to make more investments in equipment. In fact, I like this comparison to the tax bill because one of the pieces of equipment--a $1 million piece of equipment they are going to replace with the tax bill savings--is 32 years old. The Tax Code that we reformed was 31 years old. So it is time, don't you think, every few decades to actually reform our Tax Code, to bring it up to speed and make it more competitive to give our workers the edge, just as it is time to replace that machine to give his employees, what they need to compete globally.  Nationwide Insurance in Columbus, OH, is going to reinvest in their workers. Western & Southern Financial Group, Boeing, Comcast, and AT&T are some of the big companies we have heard about. They have all announced increased investments in their workers and new investments in their operations as a result of this law.  With regard to Walmart, they employ about 1.5 million Americans now. As I said, it is the largest employer in Ohio, with over 50,000 employees. They are going to raise wages, provide bonuses, and expand benefits for the workers as a result of this tax reform legislation.  So these are the results. This isn't a hypothetical. This is not something we are just saying might happen; it is something that is actually happening.  I think every single American is going to see a benefit from this because a stronger economy helps everyone. The 90 percent of people who see their withholdings change so that they have more tax relief are obviously going to see it. The people who work in the businesses we have talked are going to see it. But all of us benefit.  President John Kennedy once said something I think makes a lot of sense. He talked about a rising tide. He said, ``A rising tide lifts all . . . [ships].'' In other words, it helps to have a growing economy.  These results are going to help with regard to our competitiveness too. Right now, we have a situation where, because of our Tax Code, jobs and investments are going overseas. Now, we may not hear as much about this, but what we are going to see is fewer foreign companies buying U.companies and, therefore, less investment in jobs going overseas.  In 2016, the last year for which we have numbers, three times as many American companies were bought by foreign companies as the other way around. Ernst & Young has done a study saying that over the past 13 years, 4,700 American companies were purchased by a foreign company that otherwise would still be American if we had in place this tax bill that we have now.  Part of the result of this tax reform and tax cut legislation we are talking about today is obvious. We will see better jobs, higher wages, more investment in companies, more investment in retirement--all the things we all want to see, Republican and Democrat alike. Part of it is the tax cuts. Today, with the IRS announcement, people will see this in their paychecks. If not this next pay period, they will see it before February 15 because that is what the Treasury Department is requiring companies to do. So it is coming soon.  The other part we may not see, but is very real, is that the decline we have seen in American competitiveness--the result being that jobs and investment go overseas--is going to start to reverse, and it is none too soon. We needed to do this years ago. Many of us have been talking about it for years.  Finally, we are putting American workers in a position where they can compete and they can win. Isn't that what it is all about? I don't want these 4,700 companies going overseas. I don't want three times as many American companies bought by foreign companies instead of the other way around. We don't want that. What we want is people to say: I am going to invest in America and American workers.  I believe we have so many advantages in this country, and we are so blessed to be We have great universities. We have the opportunity here, through our workforce, to be as productive as anybody in the world. But when we have a tax code that is holding us back, it is unfair. It is our responsibility as Members of Congress to fix it, and that is what we have done. We should have done this sooner, but now that we have done it, I think we will see continued good results, as we have talked about today. We are going to see the opportunity for more investments in American workers, in American jobs, in American families, and in American businesses, and that investment will pay off for all of us.

804,topic-id,2240,"Mr.President, I rise today to discuss my thoughts on recent protests in Iran and the important upcoming decisions by the President with respect to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or the  While I am mindful that we have limited visibility into Iran and continue to learn more about the circumstances and motivations of the recent protests, one thing is clear: A significant portion of the Iranian people are not satisfied with their government and are increasingly willing to make their dissatisfaction heard. It is important that we support their right to peacefully express their views and demand that the Iranian Government respond with constructive dialogue, rather than force.  It was notable that Iranian President Ruhani implicitly recognized the validity of the protests earlier this week when he reportedly said:       It would be a misrepresentation and also an insult to      Iranian people to say they only had economic demands. . . .      People had economic, political and social demands  That is according to President  Acknowledging the need for reform, Ruhani continued:       We cannot pick a lifestyle and tell two generations after      us to live like that. It is impossible. The views of the      young generation about life and the world is different than      ours.  Now is the time to support the Iranian people in their quest for a government that is more representative and supportive of their interests. Unfortunately, some have suggested that our response should be to withdraw from the JCPOA, an action that I believe would only serve to embolden the hardliners in Iran and leave the United States more isolated from our allies. Withdrawing from the JCPOA and reimposing nuclear-related sanctions on Iran would immediately change the narrative inside of Iran, uniting reformists and hardliners alike in their opposition to what they view as a hostile United  While some would argue that the recent protests in Iran are symptomatic of what they view as a flawed JCPOA, I would suggest otherwise. In reality, the nuclear deal exposed one of the Iranian regime's central vulnerabilities--namely, that the regime can no longer simply blame sanctions imposed by the United States and the international community for its economic woes at home. It is becoming clearer to the Iranian people that it is actually the regime's corruption, financial mismanagement, funding of malign activities, and hegemonic ambitions that are at the root of their government's inability to enable job creation and to ensure that necessities like food and gasoline remain affordable.  In the coming days, the President has several important decisions to make with respect to the In October, President Trump acknowledged that Iran is meeting its commitments under the JCPOA, but he chose not to certify that continued sanctions relief is ``appropriate and proportionate'' to the actions taken by Iran with respect to terminating its illicit nuclear program. By the end of this week, President Trump is again required to decide whether to issue such a certification. I expect he will again choose not to do so.  The more consequential decision for the President this week will be whether to continue waivers of nuclear-related sanctions, as he is required to do under the Choosing not to continue such waivers would immediately snap back U.nuclear-related sanctions, thereby putting the United States in violation of the Let me be clear. This would be a unilateral action on behalf of the United States that would put us in violation of an international agreement, not just with Iran but with the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and China, as well.  By all accounts, the JCPOA is working as intended, and Iran is verifiably meeting its commitments under the deal. It is important to remember what the JCPOA was designed to do and what it is now achieving. The JCPOA commits Iran to never seeking to develop or acquire a nuclear weapon; effectively cuts off all pathways for Iran to achieve a nuclear weapon during the period covered by the agreement; and increases the time it would take for Iran to acquire enough material for one nuclear bomb from 2 to 3 months to at least 1 year. When this agreement was signed, they were within months of having that capability. It dramatically reduces Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium and the number of installed centrifuges. It has prevented Iran from producing weapons-grade plutonium and has subjected Iran to robust monitoring by the IAEA to verify its compliance.  Withdrawing from the JCPOA at this point would provide no benefit and would actually leave us more isolated and less able to deal with the various challenges posed by The crippling sanctions regime that brought Iran to the negotiating table in the first place only worked because the international community was united in its determination to keep Iran from achieving a nuclear weapon. If we withdraw from the JCPOA unilaterally--and in the absence of a clear violation of the deal by Iran--there is no reason to believe that our partners in the P5+1 would join us. In fact, French President Macron has said that there is ``no alternative'' to the JCPOA and told the U.General Assembly that ``renouncing it would be a grave error.''  General Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Armed Services Committee last year:       I believe that the U.would incur damage vis-a-vis our      allies if we unilaterally withdraw from the Our allies      will be less likely to cooperate with us on future military      action to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and      less likely to cooperate with us on countering other      destabilizing aspects of Iranian behavior that threaten our      collective interests.  Our sanctions may snap back but not those imposed by the rest of the world, many of whom have begun building economic ties to Iran since the JCPOA was signed. Our international partners would then blame us, not Iran, for the failure of the deal.  Some, including President Trump, have argued that we can and should dissolve the JCPOA and renegotiate a better deal. This is a highly unrealistic proposal. We were only able to achieve the JCPOA after years of sustained multilateral diplomatic efforts and the imposition of aggressive international sanctions in concert with our partners. It will likely be impossible to replicate those conditions if the United States unilaterally withdraws from the  Contrary to President Trump's belief, threatening to walk away from the[[Page S127]]deal actually weakens our ability to address the JCPOA's perceived flaws by alienating our partners. Instead, we should remain committed to the JCPOA and lead the international community in imposing additional sanctions, where necessary, to change other Iranian behaviors--namely, their respect for human rights, ballistic missile development efforts, and other malign activities.  We must also seek to help enable the Iranian people to make their choices heard, including by encouraging the adoption of social media and other means of communication. We could start by building upon general licenses issued by the Obama administration designed to encourage the export of communications technology to  Secretary Mattis told the Armed Services Committee at his confirmation hearing: ``When America gives her word, we have to live up to it and work with our allies.''  If the President decides this week not to continue nuclear-related sanctions relief for Iran, he will be effectively choosing to restart the Iranian nuclear program, thereby making military conflict with Iran more likely.  Withdrawing from the deal would also be a devastating blow to our efforts toward diplomacy with North Korea--and for that matter, any future diplomatic efforts to constrain aggressive behavior by our adversaries. Why would any nation engage with us in serious dialogue to resolve differences if they fear we will later withdraw unilaterally, even when the other parties are complying with the agreement?  Regardless of whether you supported the JCPOA before it was signed, the truth is that it has removed the greatest threat we faced from Iran while also preserving all other means to address Iran's malign activities. Let there be no doubt--Iran continues to be a state sponsor of terrorism and an abuser of human rights. Iran continues to destabilize the region through its development of ballistic missiles and support of proxies in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, and elsewhere. If Iran behaves this way without a nuclear weapon, imagine how much worse a nuclear-armed Iran would be.  Fortunately, our nonnuclear sanctions on Iran remain in place and are unaffected by the In fact, Congress authorized additional sanctions in July to help deal with these issues. The administration should work with our international partners and use all tools at its disposal, including by ramping up nonnuclear sanctions, where necessary, to counter Iran's unacceptable behavior in these other areas.  Abrogating the JCPOA only invites another nuclear crisis like the one we are currently facing with North Korea--a concern echoed by General Dunford when he appeared before the Armed Services Committee and said: ``It makes sense to me that our holding up agreements that we have signed, unless there's a material breach, would have impact on others' willingness to sign agreements.''  Many have criticized the JCPOA as a ``flawed deal.'' For example, concerns have been raised that certain provisions sunset after a period of years, thereby delaying rather than permanently preventing Iran from achieving a nuclear weapon. If the concern is that Iran may seek to resume nuclear weapons development activities after these sunsets--a concern that I share--the appropriate course of action is not to throw out the deal but to work with our international partners to ensure that necessary restrictions on the JCPOA are appropriately extended or supplemented.  As I noted before, Iran has committed in perpetuity not to develop or seek to acquire nuclear weapons. We should not take them at their word; we should verify their adherence to this commitment, just as we are doing under the If at any point in the future we have evidence to suggest Iran is taking steps that would indicate a violation of that commitment, we should use that information to rally the P5+1 and other international partners to take a unified stand against such efforts. Unilaterally withdrawing from the JCPOA would seriously damage our ability to exert such leadership in the future.  Again, according to General Dunford, in the absence of the JCPOA, Iran would likely resume its nuclear weapons program and ``a nuclear-armed Iran would likely be more aggressive in its actions and more dangerous in its consequences.'' General Dunford also told the committee that ``the intel community assessment is, in fact, that Iran is in compliance right now [with the JCPOA], and therefore, I think we should focus on addressing the other challenges: the missile threat they pose, the maritime threat they pose, the support of proxies, terrorists, and the cyber threat they pose.'' I wholeheartedly agree with General Dunford's assessment.  Our troops in Iraq and Syria are operating in close proximity to Iranian-aligned militias, including those who previously targeted American troops. Unilaterally withdrawing from the JCPOA could embolden these hardline militias and possibly result in Iran giving them a green light to begin targeting U.forces once more.  Furthermore, while I have full confidence in our military's ability to fight and win wars when necessary, we cannot escape the reality that military contingencies to respond to both a nuclear-armed North Korea and Iran would result in massive loss of life and national treasure and greatly stress our military's capacity and capabilities.  In conclusion, I will return to where I began. Now is not the time to impose a self-inflicted wound upon our foreign policy and standing in the world. Unilaterally withdrawing from the JCPOA would empower Iranian hardliners and dramatically undermine the reform-minded protests we should be seeking to empower. Worse still, it would leave us more isolated in the international community and, by extension, less able to address the range of national security challenges posed by Iran, North Korea, and our other potential adversaries.  We must not abdicate the JCPOA or American leadership on these issues. Therefore, I urge the President to stay the course with respect to the JCPOA, while also rallying the international community to take effective actions intended to change other unacceptable behaviors by the Iranian regime to suppress dissent at home and sow instability abroad. We must not squander this opportunity by making the story about the United States rather than the courageous Iranians who at great risk to themselves have taken to the streets to demand a better future.

We are siding with you against tyranny. Do not think you are alone. The American people, our hearts and our souls, are with you; and, yes, we are proud of our President for making sure the world knows that we are officially on the side of those people who are struggling in the streets of Tehran, as we speak, to make sure that the mullah dictatorship is overthrown and replaced by a democratic government.  These people have a right to democratic government just the same as anyone else. We talked about it in our Declaration of We talked about rights that are given by God to every individual, and that government only has those powers that are granted to it by the consent of the governed.

So often the good will and good-heartedness of the American people is manipulated to achieve goals that sometimes are detrimental to our people and detrimental to our country as well.  Today, the American people are being told that there are young people who are here illegally, brought by their parents at an early age--they call them DREAMers--and that we must be concerned about them, as we are. Of course, we are concerned about them. Our sympathy is with young people anywhere who want a better life.  But what the American people are not being told is that there are 850,000 of these young people. That is being left out of the discussion. They are looking to be legalized. When they are legalized, that means they can apply for family reunification, which means that they then will receive government benefits and even more people will come in under their platform.  I suggest that we take a look to see what 850,000 more young people and the millions more who will come will do to the American people.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-09-pt1-PgH66.txt,979,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2018.0,9.0,January
457,topic-id,1931,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I also want to thank Mr.Gohmert for the great courage that he has had on this issue, the fact that he has been willing to speak up for something that the establishment in this country is trying to shut us up about, trying to put blinders on the American people about what is going on and how we are losing our country.  I was there with Ronald Reagan, and, yes, he was sold a bill of goods in 1986. He was told there were 3 million illegals in the country; and that is what we are going to do, we are going to legalize their status. He had a good heart, Reagan had a wonderful heart, and he saw these people were being exploited and living in the shadows. Three million people, you could take care of that, but the agreement has to be that we are now going to control our borders.  Of course, back then, there was never even any question about whether someone who is here illegally should be getting a government benefit or be able to be treated just like a U.citizen, that wasn't even in the works, but Ronald Reagan said: We will secure the border, and then we will make sure that we take these 3 million people and save them.  Instead, how did it end up? The border security was done not even halfheartedly. We ended up, when all was said and done, with not 3 million people, but 11 million people who eventually came here based on that amnesty program.  Well, today, it is a lot worse what we are facing. Today, the American people are being told a lie. Maybe someone is not just lying directly to them, but they are feeding them a false image of what the issue is today.  How many people have heard about the DREAMers, these wonderful young people, yes, who came here at an early age? The American people are not being told what we are talking about when we talk about the Most Americans think we are talking about 25,000 or 30,000 kids at the most. That is what most Americans think we are talking about.  What we are talking about is 850,000 young people, who, yes, have dreams, and most of them are fine young people, I am sure, but they are here illegally, they have been brought here illegally by their parents, and they want their status legalized.  What will that do? 850,000 young people, not 25,000, almost a million young people, and all right, what will happen when they are legalized? Well, what we are not being told is, as soon as they are legalized, they then have the rights of everybody else, as anyone who is residing here legally should, and, thus, they are eligible for family reunification, and their families that are now being brought in from other countries then have the right to bring in their families. So we have a family reunification that creates a snowball effect and millions and millions more.  Then, of course, we also have, with the legalization, the eligibility for government benefits, which, as I say, during Reagan's time, there wasn't any question you are not going to give benefits to illegal immigrants. Well, now we find illegal immigrants receiving education and healthcare benefits just as if they were American citizens.  In California, they have even treated criminals as if they are citizens, setting up sanctuary cities and sanctuary  Let me note that, with free education and free healthcare, there is no limit to the number of people around the world who will want to come here. By the way, there is no securing the border as long as we are giving education and[[Page H77]]healthcare benefits to people who have come here illegally.  In fact, what we are talking about now is basically opening up major, major expenditures in our budget, that right now we can't afford even to take care of our own people, yet we are going to have an obligation not just for these 850,000 young people, but all of the people whom they will bring in as well, not to mention the millions of other young people throughout the world who will say: My gosh, if I could get there.  And mothers and fathers throughout the world: We have got to get our child there so they can get the education and healthcare that is being provided to young people even when they come there illegally.  Now, let us note, for funds for our education system, our own young people are suffering from a lack of funds for their education; we lack money to have a very good healthcare plan for our people, yet the millions of other people who have come here illegally, we are going to let them drain that money and invite millions more people to come here from overseas.  This is the most dishonest debate that we have had. That whole concept of having millions and millions more coming in because of DACA, the DREAMers? No, no. This is being kept out of the debate; this isn't going to be part of America's vision of what is going on.  The idea that we now have veterans whom we cannot afford to take care of, we have children of our own people whom we cannot afford to educate, we have seniors whom we are trying to take care of, all of these are expenses that we have, and we are already in the hole, yet we are going to take care of millions of other people who have come here illegally, starting with the DREAMers?  There are not just 10 million, by the way, 11 million people here illegally. Let me be clear. We have got, I am guesstimating, 20 million, but I bet there are other people who are much more sophisticated in their analysis than I am on this who say it is even more than 20 million people who have come here illegally.  So what happens? We are draining our resources for people who have come here illegally.  What does that mean? We don't care enough about our own people. That is what we are really saying. Those people are more important than our own people.  Then, of course, you have the fact that people are coming here, and, yes, they are able-bodied, yet they still get education and healthcare, but they get jobs, and, yes, they bid down the wages of people at the lowest end of our spectrum.  I used to be an ice cream scooper at Marineland snack bar. That is what I did when I was in high school. I scooped ice cream.  You know what, those jobs now, what we have got are people who have gone into those jobs so that in order to get people to work for them, they haven't had to increase the wages of the people at that level. And if they have increased wages, they haven't increased the wages as much as they would have had to had they not had groups of people there who say: I will do that work at half the price.  Something else I was, I was a janitor in college. I was a janitor, and I cleaned toilets. There is nothing wrong with anybody, whatever work they have got. We know that we respect every working person in this country.  Yes, I cleaned toilets, and guess what? I looked back a few years ago and found that the salary, the wages, of people who clean toilets has not gone up, the janitors are not making more money.  Now, why is that? Are we saying that people who work at lowly jobs aren't worthy of having a pay raise, they shouldn't benefit? The income of our Nation now is three or four times higher than it was, yet those people in the lower scale have not been going up with that. The main reason is those lowly jobs that they get, they have been bid down, the salaries have been bid down by this massive flow of illegals.  Now, if we care about our people, we have to ask: What is America? America is not one race, not one religion, not one ethnic group. America is a country in which we believe in freedom and we have come from every ethnic group and race in the world.  What makes us Americans, then, is that we have to care for each other. We are an American family, but that being an American family means we must take care of those people who are less fortunate in our country before we spend and even borrow more money in order to take care of the needs of people who have come here illegally.  Let us just note the worst part of this whole debate is that Republicans and others who are concerned about this are being labeled like we are anti-immigrant. Well, in fact, we know that immigration is an important part of our country.                              {time}  1900  But this is the greatest lie of all because we believe that our country has been prospered by having a legal immigration system. We, in fact, take in a million legal immigrants a year. So anyone who is thinking about this should think about it. That represents more legal immigration into our country than all the other countries of the world combined, allowing people to immigrate into their country, all the other countries of the world.  Yet, because we don't want to destroy this system, we don't want it to go out of control, we are being labeled as anti-immigrant, even though we sing praises for those people who have come here legally.  In fact, the people who are the most anti-immigrant are the ones who mix the title ``illegal'' and ``legal'' together. And what we have got now is the worst possible outcome in that we have limited resources being drained away from our own people of every race, religion, and ethnic group, and jobs that are being bid down by illegals; and everyone, including legal immigrants, are being hurt.  But what we have now is a recognition that we cannot even enforce the law. We have sanctuary cities in which criminals are being kept from being arrested by Federal agents.  What is that all about? Who do we care for?  Now we are saying our police can't even protect our families; and that if there is some criminal gang from another country that comes here, that we are going to have a sanctuary State or a sanctuary city for these people.  This is absolutely ridiculous. It is a horror story, and it is up to us to alert the American people that we are losing our country. We are losing our country. And when I say ``our country,'' us, United States is us, every race, every religion, every ethnic group.  Let us care for each other. Let anybody who is saying we care more about someone who is coming here illegally from another country, I don't care how old they are, their children, yes, are less important than our children. Those people's well-being, yes, are less important than the well-being of all Americans, whatever their status in this society. We need to make sure we make that clear.  And DACA, if we bring in 850,000 young people and encourage millions more to come in by doing that, we have betrayed the interests of our own people, and they are looking to us to protect them.

Mr.Speaker, I rise today to speak out for the good people of Iran who are protesting against an oppressive regime that has imposed tyranny on them for nearly four decades. Scores of people have been arrested and some killed for daring to speak out against their government.  Mr.Speaker, they have good cause. For far too long, the authoritarian terrorists of Tehran have pursued an aggressive military buildup and a massive police state that oppresses its people.  Since the Iranian Revolution in 1979, their leaders have chosen global and regional conflict instead of promoting a healthy domestic economy and peaceful relations with their regional neighbors. I could spend a long time highlighting the litany of basic human rights violations of the regime as well, but the Iranian Government's malfeasance, public corruption, and betrayal to their citizenry needs to be brought to light on the world stage.  Mr.Speaker, as recently as last year, in the State Department's annual Country Reports on Terrorism, Iran was once again identified as the foremost state sponsor of terror. The crime and terror Iran spreads are conducted at the expense of ordinary Iranians whose taxes go everywhere but to themselves and their prosperity.  The unemployment rate is over 12 percent, according to the World Bank, and youth unemployment is staggeringly high. And all of this, despite Iran being rich in natural resources and having potential for having a great economy.  Two years ago, the U.entered a deal in hopes of encouraging a more peaceful Iran, not to mention passing along billions in direct cash payments to them.  Furthermore, if that wasn't enough, it has been recently reported that the Department of Justice, under President Obama, abandoned a massive international narcotics investigation against one of Iran's international terrorist clients, Hezbollah, just to not upset the Iranian regime during the negotiation of the nuclear deal.  That is right, Mr.Hezbollah is not just in the global terror business; it is a transnational criminal organization that is a major global drug trafficker, including right here in the Western Hemisphere and Latin  For anyone who has not read the recent article in Politico Magazine, titled, ``The Secret Backstory of How Obama Let Hezbollah Off the Hook,'' it is worth your time. You will learn how Hezbollah is operating throughout Latin America and, indeed, facilitating the transfer of drugs into this country.  Despite all of their contrition and dealmaking, the Iranian regime has[[Page H69]]not changed. This perilous regime is still exporting and smuggling weapons to its clients in Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, and Hezbollah and Iran continue to threaten Israel, among other nations, and are still a destabilizing force throughout the Middle  After all of the Iranian regime's terror, crime, and corruption, do you think the Iranian people would have benefited from this?  Mr.Speaker, all you have to do is turn on the TV to see the Iranian people's answer, and it is obvious that they have had enough. This kind of tyranny does not belong anywhere, especially in the 21st century.  The everyday people in Iran want the same thing the average American wants: freedom to live without fear of their government, to live and work in peace, to be with their loved ones, and to worship as they see fit.  The good people of Iran are standing up to tyranny, and we should stand with them. I want those protesters seeking freedom from oppression to know that we are with them, that the American people are with them.

This is unconscionable.  Stop using children's healthcare as a partisan weapon. Kids and parents deserve better.

164,topic-id,2343,"Madam President, despite Donald Trump's assertion last May that ``our country needs a good shutdown,'' the truth is, shutting down the government is a serious and dangerous action that we must do everything possible to prevent.  Shutting down the government would impact tens of millions of our fellow Americans who would be unable to access government services. It would severely impact Federal employees who would not get the paychecks they expected. It would also have a very significant impact on our Armed In other words, we must do everything we can to prevent a government shutdown, which is exactly what will happen if a budget agreement is not reached by January 19, when the short-term continuing resolution expires.  I am very disappointed, therefore, that the Republican Party, which controls the White House, the U.House, and the U.Senate, is pushing us closer and closer to a very dangerous government shutdown. The Republican leadership in Congress and the White House must not allow this shutdown to take place. They have to compromise. They cannot get it all.  As everyone knows, in 2011, Congress passed the Budget Control The centerpiece of that bipartisan legislation was that there would be parity in defense and nondefense spending. That agreement continued in the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. All of these bills provided equal amounts of funding for defense and nondefense purposes. Any future effort to increase the Budget Control Act caps must continue to[[Page S34]]adhere to this principle of parity. In other words, we have had a bipartisan agreement now for 6 years that has continued on four separate budgets. But now, threatening us with a government shutdown, the Republicans want to break that agreement.  I was very disturbed to hear Senate Majority Leader McConnell on the floor yesterday say:       Since fiscal year 2013, defense cuts have outpaced domestic      spending cuts by $85 billion. To fix this, we need to set      aside the arbitrary notion that defense spending be matched      equally by new nondefense spending. There is no reason why      funding for our national security and our servicemembers      should be limited by an arbitrary political formula that      bears no relationship to actual need.  That was Senator McConnell on the floor yesterday.  Unfortunately, what Senator McConnell said was inaccurate and misleading. His statement conveniently ignored the fact that mandatory spending on domestic programs like Medicare have been severely cut over this time period. He also ignored the fact that during this period, the Defense Department has also received tens and tens of billions of dollars in funding through the Overseas Contingency Operations funding, which is not capped at all.  If you include the Overseas Contingency Operations funding, the reality is that overall defense spending has gone up, not down, over this time period, while nondefense discretionary spending has been severely cut.  Further, Senator McConnell ignores a very, very important reality; that is, nondefense discretionary spending as a percentage of GDP is now at a 40-year low. This longstanding agreement regarding parity for defense and nondefense spending is not some kind of inside-the-beltway, esoteric issue. It is an issue that will impact tens of millions of working families in this country who, today, are struggling to keep their heads above water.  Over the last 40 years, while the middle class of our country has been shrinking, the people on top--the top 1 percent--have been doing phenomenally well. The actions of the Republican Congress in the last year have only made a bad situation, an unfair situation, even worse. In the United States today, some 28 million Americans have no health insurance. Yet, over the last year, the Republicans have attempted to throw an additional 32 million people off of the healthcare they have, including proposed cuts for Medicaid by up to $1 trillion over a 10-year period.  Tragically, the United States has the highest rate of childhood poverty of nearly any major country in the industrialized world. Instead of doing all that we can to end childhood poverty in this country, the Republicans have proposed to once again make a horrific situation even worse by cutting nutrition programs for children, cutting the WIC Program for low-income pregnant women, cutting the Head Start Program, after-school programs, and funding for public education.  There are millions of senior citizens in this country who can barely make it, and I sometimes wonder how in God's Name they do make it on $12,000, $13,000, $14,000 a year in Social How do you keep your house warm, how do you buy the food you need, how do you buy the prescription drugs you need to stay alive on $13,000 or $14,000 a year? There are millions of senior citizens in this country in that position. Yet, despite that reality, over the last year we have had to fight off one Republican effort after another to cut Social Security COLAs, to raise the retirement age, or to even privatize this life-or-death program.  Further, the Republicans have proposed massive cuts to LIHEAP, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which is keeping people warm in Vermont today when the weather goes below zero. All over this country, millions of people, often senior citizens, depend on this program. Yet President Trump, in his budget, proposes to wipe it out completely. Republican leaders are also proposing cuts to the Meals on Wheels program, senior housing programs, and  Today, in a highly competitive global economy, when we need to have the best educated workforce in the world, when the new jobs that are being created require a higher education, hundreds of thousands of bright young students desperately want to get a college education, but they are unable to do so because their families lack the income. But Republicans, incredibly, want to make that situation even worse by proposing massive cuts in the budget they recently passed to Pell grants--the major source of funding to help low-income young people get a college education--and other financial assistance programs for college. In my view, we should be making public colleges and universities tuition-free. Republicans today are proposing to make it harder for our young people to get the higher education they need.  During this budget process, when the Republicans want to expand military spending by some $100 billion--$100 billion--over the next 2 years, by far the largest increase in military spending in American history, we will not turn our backs on working families, the elderly, the children, the sick, and the poor. The U.Government must do more than greatly expand military spending and give tax breaks to billionaires. Our job is to protect the working families of this country, and that is what the new budget must do. That means we must have parity between defense and nondefense spending. That is why this budget--the proposed budget--that we are working on now must address the many crises facing the working families of the United That is what the American people want, and that is what we must deliver. Among many other things that must be included in the new budget that we are working on is full funding for community health centers, which provides primary healthcare, dental care, mental health counseling, and low-cost prescription drugs to some 27 million Americans in every State in our country. It has been more than 3 months since funding for community health centers has lapsed. Our Nation's 1,400 community health centers in roughly 10,000 communities throughout this country are deeply worried right now as to when they will get the funding they need.  I just spoke to the leadership of community health centers in Vermont the other day. They have had a longstanding problem--as have community health centers all across this country--in retention and attracting new doctors and nurses into their programs. What we are seeing now is a situation where many people who might want to work at a community health center are saying: Why would I want to go there when the Republicans are delaying funding for this vitally important program?  If we do not act soon, 70 percent of the funding for community health centers will be cut and 2,800 health centers will close their doors. Community health centers must be funded at the levels contained in the bipartisan legislation introduced earlier this year. I congratulate Senator Blunt and Senator Stabenow for their bipartisan work on this issue, and there are a number of other Republicans who are cosponsoring that legislation. We could pass it tomorrow if it were on the floor of the Let us do that.  The offsets to the prevention program of the Affordable Care Act that were included in the December 21 agreement are unacceptable, and they must not be repeated. The Blunt-Stabenow bill has nine Republican cosponsors. This bill represents a modest 5-percent increase in funding at a cost of just $2 billion over 5 years--the very least we can do to address the major crisis of primary healthcare in America, especially in rural  As you know, Federal funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program expired on September 30, 2017. If the CHIP program is not reauthorized, 9 million children in working families will lose their health insurance. Can you imagine that we have a Congress prepared and acting to give tax breaks to the richest people in this country, but somehow or another they have not gotten around to reauthorize and re-fund the Children's Health Insurance Program? That must be done immediately and, once again, without regressive offsets which take money from other health insurance programs.  We must keep our promises on pensions. If Congress does not act soon, the earned pension benefits of more than 1.5 million workers and retirees in multi-employer pension plans could be cut by up to 60 percent. We must not rescind the promise we made to 1.5 million workers.[[Page S35]]  We must expand Social Security services for seniors. Since 2010, Congress has cut Social Security's operating budget by 16 percent, and Republicans want to cut it another 4 percent this year. These budget cuts have resulted in the loss of more than 10,000 employees, the closing of 64 field offices, and reduced hours in many others. In Vermont, one field office has seen its staffing cut by 30 percent. According to a recent Washington Post article, 10,000 people died in the past year while they waited for decisions on Social Security disability benefits. We need to increase the funding for these vital services by at least $1.4 billion just to bring staffing back up to where it was in 2010.  We need to keep our promises to our veterans, the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend our country. Right now, we have tens of thousands of vacancies in the Those vacancies must be filled. Veterans must be able to get high-quality, timely healthcare.  We must fight the opioid and heroin epidemic that is sweeping this country. All over America, we are seeing tens of thousands of people, often young people, overdosing on opioids and heroin. States and communities all over this country need the resources for prevention and treatment. That is an issue that cannot be delayed. It has to be dealt with now.  Everybody knows that in the last several months, we have seen disastrous hurricanes impact Texas and Florida and Puerto Rico and the Virgin In Puerto Rico today, there continue to be many people who still do not have electricity. We must pass disaster relief right now that is adequate and that treats Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands just as we will treat Texas and We cannot continue to delay given the enormous suffering that is existing in Puerto Rico and in the Virgin  Very briefly, let me touch on another issue of enormous consequence which simply cannot be ignored. On September 5, 2017, President Trump announced that he would be rescinding President Obama's Executive order on That decision means that some 800,000 young people who have known the United States of America as their only home--this is where they grew up; this is where they went to school--are on the verge of losing their legal status in terms of education, in terms of employment, and in terms of serving in the military if that program is not reestablished. Without the legal protections afforded by the DACA Program, these young people live in a constant fear of being deported. Since the President's announcement in September, more than 11,000 people have lost the protections under DACA, with there being approximately 22,000 set to lose their legal protections by the March 5, 2018, deadline.  Any spending agreement must address the fear and uncertainty that has been unnecessarily caused by the administration's reckless actions, and a clean Dream Act must be signed into law as part of the budget negotiations. Protecting the Dreamers and moving these young people toward citizenship is not some kind of wild and radical idea; it is precisely what the American people want. A recent Quinnipiac poll showed that 77 percent of the American people support providing legal protections to the This is an issue that must be dealt with, and it must be dealt with now.  When history looks back on this period, I do not want it to see a U.Congress that worked overtime to protect billionaires and large corporations and a Congress that turned its back on working families and the children and the sick and the poor. I do not want history to look back on this period and say that Members of Congress thought it appropriate to spend $100 billion more on the military but were not concerned about veterans who did not get the healthcare they needed or some 800,000 young people who are now frightened that they will lose their legal status.  As the U.Senate, we must get our priorities right, and we need a budget that deals not only with military spending but with the needs of the middle class and working families of this country.

535,topic-id,2129,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak on behalf of nearly 800,000 Dreamers, young people who were brought to this country as children who today are living in fear and uncertainty. As a result of the Trump administration's decision to end the DACA Program, these young people are at risk of losing their legal status and, in fact, face deportation from the only home that most of them have ever known, and that home is the United States of  This is one of the great moral issues of our time, and it is an issue that must be dealt with now as part of the budget negotiations. It cannot be kicked down the road any longer. We must pass the Dream Act now as part of the current budget negotiations.  In the last 6 years since the DACA Program was established, these young people--again, people who were brought to this country as infants, in many cases--were finally able to breathe a sigh of relief. For the first time in their lives, they could walk the streets of this country without fear, without worrying about being arrested, without worrying about being deported. Think about what it means to live in this country every single day knowing that, at any moment, you could be arrested or deported. What DACA finally did is to give these 800,000 young people a legal status and a protection so they could go out and work, so they could go to school, and so they could serve in the U.military without fear.  As we all know, tragically, on September 5, 2017, President Trump announced the end of the DACA Program through Executive order. President Obama had established it through Executive order, and President Trump ended it through Executive order. In his announcement, President Trump noted:       I look forward to working with Republicans and Democrats in      Congress to finally address all of these issues. As I have      said before, we will resolve the DACA issue with heart and      compassion, but through the lawful democratic process. It is      now time for Congress to act.  That is Donald  The President was right. It is time for Congress to act. It is time for Congress to not kick the can down the road.  Our Republican President, Mr.Trump, told the Republican-led Congress to get to work on a DACA fix, and I say today to the Republican leadership: Let's do it. Let's do it now. That is what President Trump asked you to do. Listen to him, and let's do it--not next month, not in March, but right now--as part of the budget agreement.  People are working on this issue now. We can come to a consensus. We can pass the Dream Act if there is a political will to do it.  Let us also be very clear. Despite what some have said, this is an urgent matter that must be addressed now. Since President Trump rescinded the DACA Program in September, more than 15,000 Dreamers have already lost their DACA status and are now subject to deportation. Each day the Congress does not act, 122 people lose their DACA protections, and 851 people each and every week. This is a matter of urgency, and we have to act accordingly.  But I want to assure my Republican colleagues that not only is this the right thing to do from a moral perspective and from an economic perspective, but it is also exactly what the American people want. Nobody here is asking anybody in the Senate to rise up and to be extraordinarily brave and courageous. Why don't you just do what the American people want us to do? No profiles in courage are needed now. Poll after poll has shown that the overwhelming majority of the American people want to provide legal status to the Dreamers and to protect them from deportation. From a political perspective, this is not a difficult decision.  A Washington Post-ABC poll from September 2017, a few months ago, found that 86 percent of Americans support allowing Dreamers to stay in the United So 86 percent of the American people support providing legal status to This is not a tough political decision.  Another recent poll conducted by Quinnipiac found that 77 percent of voters and 65 percent of Republicans support legislation to protect Dreamers and provide them an opportunity to work, to go to school, and to pursue a pathway to citizenship.  Another poll conducted by CNN last month found that by an 83-percent to 13-percent margin, Americans support efforts to allow Dreamers to remain in the United States instead of facing potential deportation. Only 15 percent believed that Dreamers should be deported.  Passing the Dream Act is also in our national security interests. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates recently noted:       The United States faces extraordinary security challenges      that are placing growing pressure on our Armed That      is why we need legislation that will provide a pathway to      citizenship for those immigrants who, among other attributes,      are serving or have served in the military, whether they are      in America legally or were brought here illegally as      children.  That is former Secretary of Defense Robert  In addition, just last week three former Secretaries of Homeland Security wrote to House and Senate leadership expressing both their strong support for a DACA fix and for the urgency of acting now. Secretaries Chertoff, Napolitano, and Johnson warned of the need for Congress to act immediately and emphasized how the agency needs time to implement a new program. Without it, they caution that the delay will sow uncertainty in the business community and drive undocumented individuals further into the shadows, with immediate deportation looming for tens of thousands every single month.  Let us be very clear that when we talk about the DACA Program and when we talk about these young people receiving legal status, these young people are vetted, they pay a fee, and the vast majority of them are now at jobs important to our economy. They are in school or they are in the military. In order to get DACA status, they could not be convicted of a felony or a significant misdemeanor or pose a threat to national security or public safety. As almost everybody recognizes, these[[Page S92]]are fine young people whom we should be very proud of and should not be talking about deporting them.  DACA gave these young people a shot at the American dream, and having been given that opportunity, they seized it and they are excelling and contributing to our country--to their country--in so many ways. With 91 percent of DACA recipients in the workforce, they play an important role in our economy. Many hundreds of Dreamers have taken up the call to serve in our Armed Can my colleagues imagine a young Dreamer now serving in the Armed Forces, putting his or her life on the line to defend this country, and then reading about Members of Congress who think we should deport them? How outrageous is that?  Furthermore, there are some 20,000 DACA recipients who are currently teaching in our schools. We desperately need good teachers, and 20,000 DACA recipients are doing just that.  Yet, because of President Trump's cruel decision to rescind the DACA Program, as well as the Republican-controlled Congress's failure to act, these young people's lives and livelihoods have been thrown into chaos and uncertainty.  It is our job to enact a legislative fix now. The President has called for a fix. The vast majority of the people of this country want to see a fix. A fix is important to our national security. It is the right thing to do. Let us do it.  I am, however, very concerned that President Trump is using the 800,000 Dreamers as a bargaining chip to force the taxpayers of this country to pay for an $18 billion wall. Now, some may remember that during his campaign for President, Donald Trump told the American people that it was the Mexican Government that would be paying for the wall. Well, it turns out that it didn't quite work out that way, and now it is the taxpayers of this country who are supposed to pay for a wall.  Let me be as clear as I can be. We cannot and we must not hold the lives of 800,000 young Dreamers hostage in order to fund a wall that the vast majority of the American people oppose. We cannot and we must not allow Donald Trump to shut down the government to fund this wall, but that, it appears, may very well be--for whatever reason--what Donald Trump wants.  Let me remind my colleagues what Donald Trump said last August at a rally in Arizona, the Presiding Officer's home State: ``Believe me, if we have to close down our government, we're building that wall.'' August 22, 2017, Donald  Now, I do not know why Donald Trump may be pushing for a government shutdown. Maybe he thinks it will work well for him or work well for the Republican Party politically. I have no idea, but I do know that the idea of a government shutdown is a very bad idea. Maybe Republicans will gain from it, maybe Democrats will politically gain from it. I do not have a clue. What I do know is, the American people will lose from a government shutdown, and, in a bipartisan manner, we must do everything we can to prevent that shutdown.  A shutdown would harm tens of millions of Americans who would be unable to access vital government services; it would disrupt the lives of hundreds of thousands, or more, Federal employees who depend upon a check to provide for their families; and, in fact, it would endanger members of the U.military who are putting their lives on the line to defend our country.  The U.Congress has a responsibility to the American people to prevent a government shutdown and to work in a bipartisan manner to reach a budget agreement that is fair and that addresses the very serious problems facing not only DACA recipients but the working people of our country.  So I say to my Republican colleagues, you control the White House, you control the U.House, and you control the U.You have a responsibility to govern.  For President Trump and the Republican leadership to allow DACA to expire without a new program in place is not only a failure to govern, it is an act of extraordinary cruelty.  We know President Trump wants to build a wall, I guess somewhat like the Great Wall of The problem is, building walls may have made sense in the 14th century, but I would inform the President that technology has somewhat changed since then, and our job is to provide strong border security in the most cost-effective way we can, and that way is not building a wall. Ironically, while the President wants to spend $18 billion to build a wall, he is taking money away from other far more important and effective border security measures.  Let me quote from an article that appeared in today's New York Times:       The Trump administration would cut or delay funding for      border surveillance, radar technology, patrol boats and      customs agents in its upcoming spending plan to curb illegal      immigration--all proven security measures that officials and      experts have said are more effective than building a wall      along the Mexican border.       The wall also has become a bargaining chip in negotiations      with Congress as lawmakers seek to prevent nearly 800,000      young undocumented immigrants from being deported.       But security experts said the president's focus on a border      wall ignores the constantly evolving nature of terrorism      immigration and drug trafficking.  In other words, if we want strong border security, if we want to keep people out of this country who should not be coming into this country, if we want to keep drugs out of this country, building a wall is not the most cost-effective way. It may have been a great idea in the 14th century in China when they built their Great Wall, but it is not a great idea in 2018, in the United States of  So let me just conclude by saying, we are at a very important moment in history. If we do not do the right thing, if we do not do the moral thing, if we allow some 800,000 young people--people who have spent virtually their entire lives in this country, who know no other country, who see the United States of America as their home--if we betray them, if we take away their legal status, if we allow them to be deported, this will be a moral stain on this country that will never ever be wiped out.

583,topic-id,269,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I respect and support Tribal sovereignty. I also support workers' rights to unionize and collective bargaining to improve their workplace and the lives of their families. Those rights must be balanced, but they are not in this bill.  Union members have a collective voice to fight for higher wages, better benefits, safer workplaces, fewer injuries, fewer deaths, lower rates of gender-based violence.  After Unite Here, a union, found that 58 percent of hotel workers and 77 percent of casino workers in the Chicagoland, where I am from, had been sexually harassed, they won a contract that includes panic buttons to protect workers.  Labor rights are fundamental, but under this bill, workers at Tribally-owned businesses, casinos and hotels, construction, and other industries would lose those rights.  Remember, three out of four workers employed in Tribal casinos are not Tribal members. Those workers could end up with no way to bargain for fair wages, appeal unfair disciplinary action, or act against sexual harassment.  Looking at a similar bill in the last Congress, the International Labour Organization stated: ``It would appear likely that an exclusion of certain workers from the National Labor Relations Act and its mechanisms would give rise to a failure to ensure to these workers their fundamental freedom of association rights absent any assurances that there were Tribal labor laws that provide the same rights to all workers.''

It would make section 702 a far less effective tool at a significant cost to the national security of the United  The amendment would require a probable cause warrant or its equivalent before the government can query lawfully collected 702 data in an effort to find communications concerning someone who may be a U.person or a foreign person located in the United States even when such person is communicating with foreign terrorists or intelligence targets.  Probable cause will be lacking in many, if not most, intelligence and counterterrorism contexts. In such situations, the USA RIGHTS Act would prevent the government from detecting and disrupting plots against Americans or identifying and preventing foreign espionage on our soil.  It would also require publication of information related to 702 certifications that would disclose the sources and methods of intelligence gathering, imperilling our ability to obtain foreign intelligence information. That, to me, poses an intolerably high risk.  Instead, the underlying bill strikes a far better compromise. In the underlying bill, a warrant would be required in most nonnational security and nonterrorism cases when there is an open investigation. In the absence of such a warrant, the bill provides that evidence that would be obtained would be excluded from use in court.  That seems, to me, a very sensible balance: requiring a warrant in most nonnational security and nonterrorism cases and providing, in the absence of such a warrant in an open investigation, that information or evidence would be barred from use in court.

I was also very gratified to see two of the best former Vice Presidents we have ever had on the floor today for the ceremonies. I am glad to see former Senators Mondale and Biden--former Vice Presidents Mondale and Biden--as feisty and as strong as they have ever been and giving us their opinions.  It is also very exciting to welcome two new Members to this body who will be joining the Democratic caucus, Tina Smith from Minnesota and Doug Jones from In joining this esteemed body, both bring a wealth of experience and individual passions.  Former Lieutenant Governor Tina Smith brings with her several years of experience serving at the highest levels of State Government, where she focused on economic development and expanding access to rural broadband and affordable healthcare, issues she will continue to fight for here in the In that work, Governor Dayton praised her as ``extremely intelligent, quick to learn and always open to hearing others' views.''

As a second-year law student, Doug Jones skipped class to attend the trial of the Klansman ringleader of the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church, an event that shook the conscience of our country and helped launch a mighty movement for civil rights. That day a young Doug Jones was moved by the disposition of justice, but he was left with the impression that other members of the conspiracy had escaped the reach of the law. So 24 years later, when Doug Jones became the U.attorney for the State of Alabama, he pursued charges against two more Klan members involved in the bombing, winning their conviction and delivering a long-delayed but righteous justice. With his work, justice rolled down like a mighty stream.

122,topic-id,699,"Finally, a word on national security. The Senate has a role in conducting the Nation's foreign policy, but as head of state, the President of the United States represents our country to the world. That is a very serious and very sober responsibility that requires restraint, intelligence, sound judgment, and a respect for the moral authority that comes with the awesome responsibility of being the world's sole remaining superpower.  Over the course of the past year, President Trump, unfortunately, has progressively squandered the moral authority that comes with the Presidency[[Page S4]]of the United States--a moral authority that this country has taken generations to build, that helps us bring a light to the world and helps us economically in every other way, as the world has always looked up to America and our ideals.  Unfortunately, that moral authority is declining under President Trump's leadership--and declining rapidly. It may have reached the low point yesterday when President Trump, in tweet after tweet, offered a very poor representation of the United States to the world. More than that, President Trump's ``foreign policy by tweet'' is doing serious damage to the country. While we have serious issues to address abroad, President Trump seems happy with macho boasts and belligerent threats that get us nowhere. If any one of us were in a classroom with someone who behaved as President Trump has, we would ostracize them; we would straighten them out. We don't hear a peep from the vast majority of our Republican colleagues about this, many of whom are hawks.  We have serious issues to address abroad. President Trump's ``foreign policy by tweet'' will not advance our standing in the world. It will not reassure our allies or other nations that it is better to work with us than against us. What it will do--what it has already done, unfortunately, is unsettle our allies and embolden our adversaries. What it will do is cede leadership in the world to China, which is eagerly awaiting every opportunity to drive a wedge between our country and other countries around the world. Without a steady and reliable hand at the helm, our allies may be uncertain that they can continue to trust the United States to honor our commitments and maintain a steady course.  China and Russia are rushing to fill the void left by an unsteady United President Xi of China aspired to this position of being a world leader in his new year's speech when he said that China, not the United States, would be the ``keeper of the international order'' in 2018. If President Trump continues snubbing our allies, recklessly threatening other nations, and showing leadership on the world stage that can only be described as puerile, the world may look to Beijing, not Washington, for international leadership.  Again, I repeat: Where are our friends, the Republican hawks, who have been so concerned about America's leadership in the world, who have decried the fact that President Obama did not do enough for that leadership? If he were here, my dear friend, Senator John McCain, would typically stand up and speak about this, and hopefully he will be back soon to do so. But for the rest of my Republican friends, I would say with sincerity--not with partisanship, but out of love for the country and the leadership we have shown for decades and decades--that our Republican friends should, please, tell the President: Stop tweeting; start leading.  We are almost through a calendar year of the Trump President Trump can no longer be given the benefit of the doubt that comes with learning one of the toughest jobs in the world.

124,topic-id,954,"Mr.President, in the second half of the 115th Congress now, let's talk a little bit about a new direction. Let the induction of these two Senators this afternoon be the beginning of a new direction for the Senate in the second half of this  The first half of the 115th Congress was not a year to be proud of. Partisan legislation emerged from the majority leader's office and was dropped on the floor of the Senate, sometimes merely hours before we were asked to vote on its final passage. Procedural gimmicks were used to avoid the Senate's long history of debate and bipartisanship. An economy wracked by unfairness and inequality was made even more unfair and more unequal by the Republican majority, which almost delighted in revoking consumer protections to help big business, installed a pro-corporate Supreme Court, drove up healthcare premiums, and passed a tax bill dramatically skewed to the benefit of big corporations and the very wealthy. All in all, 2017 was a great year for wealthy Republican donors but a lost year for the middle class and the working men and women of this country.  We Democrats hope this year is different--focused on the middle class rather than the rich and powerful, focused on helping them in the ways we have done in the last decades, with both Democratic and Republican Presidents, rather than this trickle down that benefits the few at the top and does not benefit the very many in the middle.  In these first few weeks, we have a chance to start off on the right foot. We have 2 weeks to negotiate a budget deal that also must address a host of other issues, including CHIP, community health centers, disaster aid and, of course, the  Democrats would also like our country to make a downpayment on urgent domestic priorities like combating the opioid epidemic, a scourge that for the first time helped cause our life expectancy to decline because of the higher death rate from opioids.  We want to improve veterans' healthcare. They served us, and we must serve them. We must shore up pension plans for millions of hard-working, middle-class Americans who put money in every month and, because of the stock market crash and sometimes corporate misdeeds, aren't getting what they put in for. These items are crucial to the middle class.  Take opioids, for example. In 2016, a record 63,000 Americans died of drug overdoses, and two-thirds or more were opioid-related. It is a full-fledged epidemic that strikes the rich, the middle class, and the poor alike. It strikes urban America, suburban America, and rural America alike.  I had a father cry in my arms because his son a had decided to turn himself around and signed up for a treatment program, but the line was so long because the funding is so scarce that the young man died of an overdose before he could enter treatment. The opioid crisis is stealing our youth. We have known about it for years. It is not new. It is heartbreaking how much we know about it, but how little we have done about it.  The American people sent us here to do the Nation's business. That means addressing its greatest challenges. So let's make a real investment in this budget deal and how we treat this scourge. The budget is the right place to start.  A few years ago, we made a promise to hundreds of thousands of children who were brought to the United States through no fault of their own that if they registered with the government, we wouldn't deport them. We said: We want you to be Americans, learn in our schools, work in our companies, serve in our military. So 800,000 Dreamers came forward and did that because, above all else, they wanted to be They don't know another country.  Now we are faced with a deadline. In a few months, protections for Dreamers will evaporate. A thousand Dreamers are losing protected status each week. It is time that Congress passed DACA protections into law and fixed this once and for all.  Democrats, including myself, led by our great Senator from Illinois, a member of our leadership team, Mr.Durbin, have said over and over again: We are ready to negotiate a reasonable package of border security to pass alongside We believe in border security. We want to make it work. We want to make it real, not just be symbolic; we believe in it. If our Republican colleagues and the President engage in good-faith negotiations without unreasonable demands like an absurdly expensive, ineffective border wall that many Republicans publicly oppose--and privately many more do--I don't doubt we can reach an agreement on DACA that is acceptable to both sides. I would like to thank our Acting President pro tempore for his active involvement in this regard as well.  In contrast to a year of chaos and ineffectiveness--a year in which little was accomplished, and what was done was done for the wealthy and the narrow special interests--I hope this year can be one of bipartisanship, focused on improving the stock of the middle class. They are the ones hurting in They are the ones who need help. They are the ones who worry about the future of this grand, wonderful country.  We can start on the budget with opioids, veterans' healthcare, pensions, children's health insurance, and disaster aid. We can resolve the fate of the Dreamers and say to these hard-working kids that America has a place for them too.  Later today, the four congressional leaders will meet with Budget Director Mick Mulvaney and representatives of the White House to begin these negotiations in earnest--I hope--and will work for their success.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-03-pt2-PgS3.txt,1036,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2018.0,3.0,January

150,topic-id,1136,"Mr.President, yesterday the four congressional leaders had a positive and productive meeting with Budget Director Mulvaney and representatives from the White House, including Mr.It was a good first step, but there is a lot of work to do. Ultimately, the budget agreement must lift the spending caps with parity between defense and urgent domestic priorities, it must include disaster aid, a healthcare package, and an agreement to enshrine DACA protections alongside additional border security.  Like our Republican colleagues, Democrats want to make sure our men and women in uniform have the resources they need to do their jobs. There is not an argument about that, but we also want to make sure there are crucial investments in economic development and job creation here at home--programs that support the middle class and help it grow.  That includes a number of things, including funding needed for the opioid crisis. Life expectancy has gone down in America for the first time in years because of deaths from the opioid abuse by young people and middle-aged people. Are we just going to shrug our shoulders at that? There is a lot more to do. It affects rural areas, urban areas, and suburban areas. There have been 63,000 Americans who have died from drug overdoses. Those are deaths on the battlefield, in a sense, as well--often the flower of our youth, the prime of America, so many in rural areas. These are kids who were full of potential. Many were veterans dealing with the wounds of war. They served our country and didn't get what they needed when they came home.  I had a father cry in my arms. His son had been grappling with opioids. Finally, they had persuaded the son to sign up for a treatment program, but the treatment program didn't have the funding it needed so there was a long waiting list, and the son died of an overdose while waiting on that list. We can't have that anymore.  What about veterans' healthcare? These are people who risked their lives for us. We need to do it.  What about millions of hard-working Americans who need pensions? One of the issues Americans are most worried about is pensions and retirement. For years, they paid into these plans. They were told: You know, when you retire, you are not going to be rich, you are not going to be able to buy luxuries, but at least you will have a life of dignity. Now those pensions have been robbed from so many people throughout the country. Are we going to shrug our shoulders?  I hear the majority leader say he is not for parity. ``Parity'' is not just a word, it is veterans, people who need opioid relief, and middle-class folks and working people who need pensions. Are our Republican colleagues going to do what they just did in the tax bill and abandon the middle class? Are our Republican colleagues going to do what they tried to do in the healthcare bill and take away healthcare from millions of working people, people in the middle class? ``Parity'' is the term we use around here. I would rather call it defending middle-class Just as it is important to defend America from foreign enemies, which our military does so bravely and proudly, we have to defend America here.  I plead with Leader McConnell not to abandon the middle class in this bill. Funding the military is a worthy goal and so is helping the middle class. For the past year, unfortunately, our Republican colleagues have been doing what the very wealthy people want and ignoring the middle class and working people. That is one of the reasons right now so many Americans say they would rather have a Democratic Senate than a Republican I would rather have a Senate that helps the middle class, whatever the political outcome, but our colleagues don't seem to be going for that.  I say to Leader McConnell, my friend, you cannot let the hard right dictate what you want because the hard right and their wealthy benefactors are not where America is. It is not even where the Republican Party has always been.  Now, in addition to parity helping the middle class, we need to do other things. We should pass a disaster package that treats all States and territories fairly given the necessity of relief in Texas, California, Louisiana, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.Virgin By the way, we need to make sure we straighten out things in the West so the Forest Service isn't robbed of the funding they need to prevent future forest fires as they take the money out to handle present forest fires. We need to do that.  I know a lot of Congressmen from the House want aid. Even though many of them opposed aid when New York and New Jersey had a crisis, we are not going to play tit for tat, but we want a fair bill, and we want our priorities recognized as well.  Finally, there are the This must be done now. Leader McConnell seems to think there is no urgency. We disagree strongly--respectfully but strongly. There is an urgent need. We have hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of Americans who want America to be their country--who were[[Page S29]]brought here through no fault of their own, who are working in our factories and offices, who are going to our schools, and who are serving in our military. Right now, every morning they wake up with a pit of fear in their heart that they will be deported and separated from their families. There is a very strong urgency there, and we have to get the Dreamers taken care of as well as these other needs.  So our language, our proposal on this budget deal is to take care of the middle class in terms of pensions and opioids and veterans, take care of disaster relief, take care of the healthcare problems we face--we all know about CHIP, community health centers, and healthcare extenders--and take care of both the border and the We can do it all. We should do it all.  It is no secret that in each of these areas right now there are sticking points, but there are potential points of agreement. All five parties continue to have discussion groups on these four circles of areas--and to do them concurrently and come up with solutions quickly so we can meet that January 19 deadline because nobody wants sequestration to go into effect for the military or nonmilitary side of the budget. Our goal should be a global agreement on all these issues by January 19. That is the best way to resolve the issues we face.  I see my dear friend from Georgia waiting, and I yield the floor to him.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-04-pt1-PgS28-3.txt,1036,RAPID DNA ACT OF 2017,2018.0,4.0,January

512,topic-id,2626,"Mr.President, there are a number of outstanding matters before the Senate that must be addressed by January 19. We must pass an extension of government funding. We must reach a deal to lift the spending caps to spare devastating cuts to our military support and funding for urgent domestic priorities. We must extend the Children's Health Insurance Program and community health centers and the 702 FISA Court program. We must pass disaster aid, and we must resolve the future of the  Some of these issues, particularly CHIP and FISA, could have been dealt with by the majority a long time ago. There are bipartisan majorities that would have voted to extend those programs, but the majority leader chose not to put them on the floor because they were busy pursuing a partisan ``favor the wealthy'' tax bill.  Some of these issues still require further compromise. It is no secret that we haven't come to final agreement on the spending caps. Both Democrats and Republicans want our troops to have the resources they need to do the tough job we ask of them. At the same time, we Democrats want to make sure that we are making the right kinds of investments in the middle class. The whole campaign was about the middle class, and now we are going to abandon them because there are such needs for defense. The two are not mutually exclusive. We don't believe they are, and our Republican colleagues have sort of lost their grip on saying: Well, we can't increase the deficit, after a $1.5 trillion tax cut mainly for the wealthy and powerful corporations.  So we are fighting hard to make sure we are making the right kinds of investments in the middle class. That is why we are pushing hard to raise the spending caps on the domestic side, so we can do more in the fight against the opioid crisis, so we can do more to help our brave veterans get quality healthcare, and so we honor the promise made to over a million pensioners who contributed to and earned every penny of their pensions. These are all very important issues. Ask a mom or dad whose kid is addicted to opioids whether that can wait. Ask a pensioner who is so nervous that he or she will not get enough dollars to retire on and feed themselves. Ask a veteran who has been waiting in line for healthcare because the Veterans' Administration is not fully funded for the healthcare needs of our veterans. They all think those are just as important--not more, not less than funding defense. We will stand firm and strong that both are important. The only argument our colleagues seem to have against this is that it increases the deficit and, as I said, they lost all claim to that one with the tax bill.  Now, teamsters, carpenters, and miners have worked their entire lives under the expectation that they could retire with a sense of dignity afforded by a modest pension. These are the ones our colleagues seem to be just adamantly opposed to. Let them go home to their miners, to their teamsters, to their food workers and tell them: You don't deserve a pension even though you paid in every month.  We can't just shrug our shoulders and do nothing. We ought to fix it.  My friend, the majority leader, thinks defense is important, but the other is not. We Democrats believe both are important, and we must and should do both together. Surely, the deficit, again, can't be the problem after adding over $1.5 trillion in red ink. So let's make investments we know are essential in our military and in our middle class.  We will also have to make sure the disaster package treats all our States and territories fairly; that California and Puerto Rico and the Mountain West and the U.Virgin Islands get the aid they need, just like Texas and Louisiana and  We have to reach agreement on a new healthcare package that admits the new reality of our healthcare system. The Republicans repealed the individual mandate in their tax bill, an act that will raise premiums and lower coverage. The old healthcare compromise legislation was crafted before the Republican tax bill. Patty Murray has said, under new circumstances, we need a new proposal. We cannot just enact the previous Alexander-Murray bill because of the change our Republican colleagues made to the healthcare system.  Then, of course, there is the DACA issue. That is going to require further compromise. There are many Republicans in this Chamber who want to enshrine DACA protections into law--as every Democrat does--just as there are many Democrats who would pass additional border security measures into law--smart, reasonable, and practical border measures. A deal on this issue can be reached if both parties are committed to good-faith negotiations.  The problem thus far has been President Trump's insistence on a completely ineffective and absurdly expensive wall as part of any deal on  In fact, we learned this morning, in a stunning New York Times article by Ron Nixon, that the Trump administration is proposing to cut back from smart border security measures to pay for a border wall. I ask unanimous consent that the article by Mr.Nixon in the New York Times be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  According to the Times, which reviewed internal budget guidance from the OMB, the Trump administration would cut or delay funding for border surveillance, cut or delay funding for radar technology, patrol boats, and, maybe more crucially, Customs officers, all to ask taxpayers to pay for the wall--funding to upgrade surveillance aircraft, extremely effective at stopping illegal crossing at the border, particularly drugs, denied; funding to hire new Customs officers, denied; funding for video surveillance with infrared cameras in areas with high incidents of border crossings, cut to ``offset the[[Page S83]]costs of Presidential priorities.'' What an absurd proposition.  Security experts have testified for decades that effective border security includes a variety of technologies and resources, drones, infrared sensors, Customs and Border Patrol agents, and officers. In some places, secure fence is appropriate. We agree with that. These were all ideas included in comprehensive immigration reform. That the Trump administration would cannibalize funding for these smart border security measures to pay for a wall that will not work makes no sense.  He said he campaigned on it. Oh, no, Mr.You campaigned on a wall that Mexico would pay for. We are waiting, but, again, to take away the things that are needed to protect the border for a symbolic and ineffective political gesture is wrong. There is nothing to this than politics. President Trump is fighting for an empty symbol rather than smart policy that will actually produce better security at our borders. We Democrats are willing, able, and eager to work with our Republican colleagues and the administration on smart, effective border solutions.  As I have said, there may be a few defined places where a secure fence makes sense, but a medieval wall that you can't see through across the length of the southern border will not make us any safer. Walls can be scaled over. Walls can be tunneled under. There are, as I have been told, many tunnels under the wall in San Diego, some of which have not been detected.  There is also the issue of eminent domain. The Federal Government would have to conscript hundreds of square miles of land from American citizens to build a wall. The administration still hasn't produced plans for where to put it, and, of course, President Trump promised, once again, that Mexico would pay for it, not taxpayers. If you can read anything into the election, it was for that. The polling data shows the majority of Americans don't believe the wall is the right thing to do.  It is not responsible to insist that American taxpayers pay for an absurdly expensive and ineffective border wall or else the government shuts down. If the President goes down that path and insists on the wall or shuts down the government, which he said back in September, make no mistake about it, a government shutdown will fall entirely on his shoulders.  If President Trump can find a way to get Mexico to pay for the wall, while American taxpayers pay for things that really make a difference to secure the border, he should reveal that to the American people. Until that time, Democrats will work with our Republican colleagues on smart border security, effective border security, just as we fight to protect the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, 8, 2018]    To Pay for Wall; Trump Would Cut Proven Border Security Measures                             (By Ron Nixon)       The Trump administration would cut or delay funding for      border surveillance, radar technology, patrol boats and      customs agents in its upcoming spending plan to curb illegal      immigration--all proven security measures that officials and      experts have said are more effective than building a wall      along the Mexican border.       President Trump has made the border wall a focus of his      campaign against illegal immigration to stop drugs,      terrorists and gangs like MS-13 from coming into the United      Under spending plans submitted last week to Congress,      the wall would cost $18 billion over the next 10 years, and      be erected along nearly 900 miles of the southern border.       The wall also has become a bargaining chip in negotiations      with Congress as lawmakers seek to prevent nearly 800,000      young undocumented immigrants from being deported.       But security experts said the president's focus on a border      wall ignores the constantly evolving nature of terrorism,      immigration and drug trafficking.       ``People that are dealing with this issue know that a      third-century solution to a 21st-century problem is not going      to fix this long-term,'' said Representative Will Hurd,      Republican of Texas and a former C.I.officer. Mr.Hurd,      whose district includes more than 800 miles of border      territory with Mexico, has pushed for more funding for      sensors and other border security technologies.       Homeland Security officials have long and frequently      described border security as a holistic system, made up not      just of walls and fencing but also patrol routes, lighting,      cameras, sensors and personnel.       David Bier, a policy analyst with the Cato Institute, said      a border wall would do little to stop the drug trade. Most of      the cocaine, heroin and methamphetamines smuggled into the      United States come through legal ports of entry rather than      areas that would be stopped by a wall, according to the Drug      Enforcement       Nor would a wall stop illegal immigration, other experts      said. Data from the Department of Homeland Security and      research groups like the New York-based Center for Migration      Studies show that most undocumented immigrants now simply      overstay legally obtained short-term visas--and did not sneak      across the border.       ``So unless the wall is 35,000 feet high, it's not going to      do much to stop those overstaying these visas,'' said Robert      Warren, a fellow at the Center for Migration Studies who has      worked on immigration issues for Republican and Democratic      presidents.       Additionally, Mr.Warren said, many people who have been      stopped by the Border Patrol in recent years are seeking      asylum --including some who simply walk up to agents and      surrender.       Mr.Trump's budget request for a wall represents more than      half of the $33 billion spending blueprint for border      security over the next decade. It either eliminates critical      funding for border security programs or shifts money from      them, threatening to leave gaping holes. A Government      Accountability Office study released last February found that      Customs and Border Protection has not shown how much fencing      and walls bolster border security.       An internal budget guidance document for the 2019 fiscal      year shows that the White House Office of Management and      Budget asked officials at the Homeland Security Department to      reduce or delay funding requests for additional border      security technology and equipment. Instead, the document      instructed, Homeland Security should dramatically increase      funding for a wall on the Mexico border.       Homeland Security officials said the plans are subject to      change. Still, the document underscores the priority that a      border wall remains for Mr.Trump, who promised its      construction during his presidential campaign. It also      instructed the department to seek $1.6 billion in the      upcoming fiscal year to build 74 miles of a border wall--     about $700 million more than Homeland Security officials felt      they needed to build that.       Parts of the document were viewed by The New York Times;      the rest of it was based on reports by the Democratic staff      of the Senate Homeland Security       The cuts include money for a remote video surveillance      system in the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas, an area known      for high numbers of border crossings and drug smuggling. The      system is composed of infrared cameras mounted on poles,      towers and buildings, allowing Border Patrol agents to track      attempted smuggling and border crossings.       In the internal document, the White House budget office      called the surveillance system important but said its funding      requests were lowered ``to offset the costs of presidential      priorities not funded in the D.H.request.''       Customs and Border Protection faces several cuts.       Its $7.9 million request for technology upgrades to its P-3      surveillance aircraft--which operates thousands of miles      beyond American borders to track narcotics being shipped from      Colombia, Peru and other drug producing countries--was      denied. In 2016, the latest data available, the P-3 aircrews      contributed to 145 drug seizures, helping American and      foreign authorities capture a combined 34,108 pounds of      marijuana and 193,197 pounds of cocaine.       The internal document also suggested delaying a request to      buy 15 new Coastal Interceptor boats to catch drug smugglers.      The agency had sought nearly $15 million to replace its aging      fleet to keep up with drug smugglers' smaller, faster boats.       It also would cut nearly 200 of the 500 canine units that      customs officials say play a key role in programs to prevent      terrorism and drug smuggling. The dogs' handlers would then      be reassigned to ports on the southwest border to help with      staffing shortages.       ``The lack of funding and the elimination of the canine      teams is shortsighted and poses a serious threat to border      security,'' said Tony Reardon, the president of the National      Treasury Employees Union, which represents customs officers.      ``If you are going to focus on border security, you can't do      that without talking about the men and women who man these      ports of entry.''       Perhaps most significantly, the proposed budget would not      fund the hiring of new customs officers--the agents who      denied 200,000 people from entering the United States at      ports of entry in fiscal 2017 and who stopped 600,000 pounds      of drugs, including cocaine, heroin, meth and fentanyl.      Customs officers also intercepted nearly $70 million in      illicit currency, much of it headed back across the border to      fill the coffers of Mexican drug cartels.       Experts said the absence of hiring funds could potentially      have the most impact on border security; the agents form a      crucial line of defense against smugglers and terrorist      threats. An internal Customs and Border Protection review      showed that the agency's ranks were about 3,700 officers      below required levels, according to the National Treasury      Employees       By comparison, Mr.Trump has called for hiring 5,000      additional Border Patrol agents[[Page S84]]     and 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.       ``A wall is the single most expensive thing you can do in      terms of trying to secure the border, and not necessarily the      most effective on its own,'' said Doris Meissner, who was the      top immigration official during the Clinton administration.      ``If you want to be strategic about it, you want to invest in      technologies and programs that can stop threats well before      they can actually get to the border.''

768,topic-id,1188,"Mr.President, we have barely over a week to negotiate a broad package of must-pass items, including an extension of government funding, a deal to lift the spending caps for both defense and urgent domestic priorities, a healthcare package, disaster aid, an agreement to protect the Dreamers, and to provide additional border security.  The path forward on some of these issues is very clear. There are significant bipartisan majorities that would vote to extend CHIP, or the Children's Health Insurance Program, and community health centers. There seems to be a growing consensus on how we can pass the 702 FISA Court program.  I am also confident that we could assemble a disaster aid package that addresses the needs of all of the States and Territories--Texas, Florida, Louisiana, California, the Western States that have been plagued by fires, Puerto Rico, and the U.Virgin Islands--as well as modifying what the Forest Service does so they don't spend all of their money simply fighting forest fires and not do the job they are intended to do, which is to prevent future forest fires by careful forestry programs.  Even where the path is murkier, the outlines of a deal exist. If we don't lift the spending caps in short order, the sharp ax of sequestration will fall on the military side of the budget and on the domestic side of the budget. That is a scenario everyone wants to avoid.  The majority leader continues to insist that we should raise the budget caps unequally, sparing our military but not critical domestic programs that create jobs, grow our economy, and help the middle class. We Democrats believe we absolutely must provide the resources our men and women overseas need to protect our country. We believe that strongly, but we also know that there are many important issues here at home--combating the opioid crisis, improving veterans' healthcare, shoring up pensions for millions of hard-working Americans who are approaching retirement, and dealing with rural development and rural broadband. These items are all crucial to the middle class.  The deadly scourge of opioid addiction has contributed to the first consecutive-year decline in life expectancy in the great United States of America since the early 1960s. That is an astounding and alarming fact that should rouse everyone in this Chamber to action. It is not occurring in most of our Western country allies.  Some of our veterans have been waiting in line for healthcare at veterans hospitals for over a year. These men and women served our country bravely. We have a solemn responsibility to serve them when they come home, and we are not living up to that responsibility right now.  Over a million Americans paid into pension plans with the expectation that they could retire with basic dignity. For so many of them--teamsters, miners, food workers--pensions have fallen short, and a lifetime of careful savings may be ripped away from pensioners at the last moment. We could make progress on each of these issues through a budget that lifts the spending caps equally for defense and nondefense.  The Republican majority, which conveniently forgot its long history of opposing deficits when passing a $1.5 trillion tax bill, cannot, in good conscience, turn around and complain about deficits here. So let's make the investments we all know are essential in both our military and in our middle class.  Even on the most challenging issue we face, the fate of the Dreamers, there appears to be a path forward. Yesterday's immigration meeting at the White House was encouraging for two reasons. First, practically everyone at the table--including some of the most conservative voices on immigration, like the Senator from Iowa--agreed that we must resolve the future of Dreamers by passing DACA protections into law. That is a very positive development.  Second, President Trump appeared to endorse a narrow deal to protect the Dreamers, leaving the thornier issues for a later debate on comprehensive immigration reform--a debate that, personally, I would welcome, the sooner the better.  But first, we have to do this narrow deal. President Trump also backed off his demand that a DACA deal include an expensive and ineffective border wall across the entire length of the southern border. Of course, the devil is in the details. We Democrats have repeated time and again that we are ready, willing, and eager to support an effective, practical border security measure in a deal that enshrines DACA into law. The President yesterday seemed to agree with that. We agree with that. For these reasons, the meeting was encouraging.  Last night, a Federal judge ruled against the Trump administration's handling of the termination of the DACA Let me be very clear. The ruling last night in no way diminishes the urgency of resolving the DACA issue. On this we agree with the White House, which says the ruling doesn't do anything to reduce Congress's obligation to address this problem now. A court case, of course, is no guarantee of lasting security. A higher court can quickly overturn it. Unsurprisingly, the Department of Justice responded to the ruling last night by saying that it ``will continue to vigorously defend [this] position, and looks forward to vindicating its position in further legislation.'' So the fact remains that the only way to guarantee the legal status for Dreamers is to pass DACA protections into law and to do it now. For that reason, a resolution to the DACA issue must be part of a global deal on the budget.  We cannot tolerate delay. Delay is a tactic employed by those who do not wish to see a deal. Let me just say, promises that maybe in the future we will do it--particularly on immigration--have vanished by the wayside.[[Page S115]]Unless DACA is on a must-pass deal--a must-pass bill--in terms of a global agreement, people are rightfully skeptical that it will ever happen. Somehow, somewhere, someone will say: I can't do it.  Let's not forget that the House has been a graveyard even for immigration proposals that have had bipartisan consensus here in the So it must be on a must-pass bill. Otherwise, we are not going to get it.  Congressional negotiators and the valiant group here in the Senate led by Senators Durbin and Graham are focused on this issue right now. The meeting they had yesterday--I talked to both Senators Durbin and Graham last night and this morning--provides a clearer picture of the parameters of the deal. The iron is hot. We should strike now. Delay will snuff out the hope of getting an agreement that both sides can live with. Let us press forward. Each side is going to have to give.

1033,topic-id,885,"Mr.President, we are inching ever closer to the government's spending deadline of January 19, when we will have to address a host of unresolved issues. We must lift the spending caps equally for defense and other domestic priorities, such as opioids, veterans, pensions. We must pass an aid package to give relief to disaster stricken areas of our country. We must pass the healthcare package that extends CHIP--children's health insurance--and community health centers.  Just this week, the CBO projected that CHIP will actually save the government money if it is extended for 10 years. We could ensure that kids continue to get quality health insurance for longer and save the government money if we extend it for 10 years. That is a no-brainer.  Of course, we must settle the fate of the A deal to pass DACA protection alongside a package of border security measures is finally within reach. As the immigration meeting at the White House showed, almost everyone in this body is interested in passing DACA protections into law.  Democrats are interested in effective, practical border security measures. We want what secures the border the most, not what sounds the best, not what was a political slogan in a campaign but what actually protects our border as drugs flow in and other things come across. We are working as hard as we can to find an agreement both sides can live with. The only folks who didn't get the memo were some House Republicans who continue to push hard-line immigration bills that are outside the scope of the negotiations. I am referring to Representative Goodlatte's proposal, which is entirely counterproductive and completely unacceptable.  If Speaker Ryan is going to listen to the hard right in the House and coalesce behind Representative Goodlatte's proposal on DACA, we will have no deal. Let the American people hear that. If Speaker Ryan is unable to resist Representative Goodlatte's proposal--he has never been for Dream to begin with--we will have no deal.  If Speaker Ryan bends to the hard-right faction of his caucus--which is far away from what most Americans think; the hard right doesn't like Dreamers, and 70 percent of Americans do--and if they ask for immigration measures outside the scope of our negotiations, then so will we. Deal with chain migration outside of the scope of Dreamers? Let's deal with the 11 million who need a path to citizenship--a tough but fair path. We can play that game too. We can go beyond the confines of this deal, which has been Dreamers and border security, and then the whole thing won't happen.  There are people on my side who aren't going to want to make any compromises. I know that. There are people on both sides who won't want to make any compromises. As responsible leaders, we have to come to an agreement, and we can't make everybody happy. That is why we have a House and That is why we have legislators.  The whole reason we narrowed the scope of our negotiations is so that we could accomplish something for the Dreamers, rather than relitigating comprehensive immigration reform in such a compressed timeframe.  This body passed a very fine bill, in my opinion. It was really tough on the border. It was tough on benefits. It was tough on a path to citizenship. For the first time, for instance, green card holders had to learn That was in our bill that passed this body--led by Senator McCain and myself and the Gang of 8--68 to 32. The House didn't dare take it up for the same reason they seem to have trouble today: The hard right said no immigration reform. And we are stuck. That hurts everybody.  I am sure my good friend is hearing from farmers in his State, as I hear from farmers in mine, and businesspeople. We have to tighten up our borders. We have to make sure we have a rational system of immigration. We can't assure that every person who wants to come here comes here. We all agree with that. But that is comprehensive immigration reform, because we also believe that the 11 million here should be given a difficult but fair path to citizenship. We can't start litigating all of that.  Some of my friends on the other side of the aisle say: I have to have this provision outside DACA and border security. They are hurting the cause of getting something done.  If we can reach an agreement by the end of this week or over the weekend, we can pass it into law as part of a global deal on the budget by next I believe that is still the best way to resolve the issue. I am hopeful we can get this done. Any later than that, we won't have time to do it by the 19th.  Let me assure my colleagues, accept the majority leader in good faith and the Speaker in good faith--their intention is to put a bill on the floor in February or We have heard that before, and it never happens. So we feel passionately that we should get this done--both tighten up the border and help the We have to do it as part of the must-pass bill, and that must-pass bill is this global spending deal.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-11-pt1-PgS144-2.txt,1036,WASHINGTON BUSINESSES GIVING BACK,2018.0,11.0,January
1035,topic-id,836,"Mr.President, now a word on the Russia investigation. Over the past weeks, several events have shaken my confidence that our Republican colleagues are committed to an independent investigation in Congress and at the  A rightwing smear campaign is being waged to discredit the investigation and the investigator. Absurd attacks have been launched on Special Counsel Mueller, one of the finest men that I think we have ever come across in this body. I remember when he was FBI Director; everyone loved him. He is a man of utmost integrity. A Republican Congressman went so far as to suggest his investigation was a ``coup'' when that Member spoke on the floor of the  Here in the Senate, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee--I have great respect for him; we are the only two Charles E's in the Senate--referred Christopher Steele to the FBI and recommended criminal charges, even though Mr.Steele was a whistleblower--something that our chairman of Judiciary has always protected. He came to the FBI with concerns that Donald Trump was subject to blackmail. Any American would worry about that. The chairman took that action[[Page S145]]unilaterally--that is, asking for criminal charges--without consulting with or providing notice to the minority. Yet he still expressed outrage when the ranking member of his committee released a transcript of his committee's interview with the chairman of Fusion GPS even though that was what was in contention. There is a fundamental double standard here. You can't complain, Mr.Chairman of Judiciary, about our side doing things unilaterally if you do them unilaterally. We want to work in a bipartisan way.  I applaud my friend, the senior Senator from California, for releasing that transcript. It contained information that was crucial for the American people to read and understand in order to judge for themselves the allegations my friends across the aisle have made. You make a serious allegation against someone but say no one can see the information? That is not fair. That is not how we work here in  Now, in the Foreign Relations Committee, my friend Senator Cardin was compelled to release a minority report about Russia's interference in foreign elections because the majority would not join him. Think about that. Senator Cardin's report showed something we already know to be true--no one disputes that; well, maybe a few--that Russia maliciously and persistently interferes in elections around the globe and will not cease without unified and strong countermeasures.  Senator Cardin's report is another compelling reason that the Senate act on election security legislation. Before we left for the holidays, Senators Lankford, Klobuchar, Harris, and Collins introduced the Secure Elections It is a good piece of legislation that would help shore up election security. Midterm elections are just around the corner, and, as Senator Cardin's report tells us, Russia will no doubt endeavor to sow confusion and chaos into our democracy once again. That is what they do. That is what Putin likes to do. We have to stop it. And making information public about it is very important. This should be a unifying, nonpartisan issue.  Why would the Republican majority on the Foreign Relations Committee refuse to join that report? It is because--in my judgment, at least--for partisan reasons, Republicans in Congress and some in some parts of the media--the conservative parts of the media--have sought to undermine the Russia investigation in countless ways. They have hidden behind secrecy and innuendo to cast aspersions on the investigation and erect roadblocks in its path. Their goal, it seems, is to discredit the investigation so that ultimately they can discredit any findings that are detrimental to their party or their  President Trump makes the strategy manifest, clear as day, almost every day on his Twitter feed. Yesterday, he tweeted that the Russia investigation was ``the single greatest witch hunt in American history.'' That is a little self-centered. How about Salem? Those people were burned at the stake. And he wrote that ``Republicans should finally take control.'' That last line should send shivers down our spines, that ``Republicans should finally take control.''  From the very beginning, this investigation has been about an issue most sensitive to our national interests--interference in our elections, the wellspring and pride of our wonderful and great and grand democracy. If ever there were an issue that transcends party, this is it. Yet here is the President of the United States imploring his party to ``take control'' of the investigation. You never thought you would hear a President say something like this. Frankly, you never thought you would hear such silence from the other side of the aisle when he does, but that is where we are. Republican lawmakers ought to shout down that kind of appeal. We all must commit to the essential truth of the matter, which is that the investigation into Russian interference in our election must remain as bipartisan and as nonpartisan as possible. The interests of the Nation are at stake. All of us--all of us--must choose country over party.

I fought for reforms in 2015 with the USA Freedom And now here we are debating the latest need to balance privacy and security.  Since Congress last reauthorized section 702, we have learned a great deal about the operation of this program. These revelations have highlighted the risks that it poses to privacy and civil liberties. This program needs to be reformed, but, Mr.Speaker, this is not the bill to do it.  Rather than provide meaningful reforms, the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act would reauthorize section 702. However, as we are all well aware, the program routinely sweeps up millions of innocent Americans' emails.  The warrant requirement in this bill applies to only fully predicated, official investigations and not to the hundreds of thousands of searches the FBI runs every day just to run down a lead or check out a tip. The loopholes are too great to ensure proper protections.  In this morning's Washington Post, on page A4, an article says, in part, FBI officials told aides of the gentleman from New York (Mr.Nadler), last week ``that under the proposed bill, they anticipate rarely, if ever, needing permission from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to review query results, according to one of the aides.'' And this was not denied by[[Page H106]]the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, the gentleman from California (Mr.Schiff).  We are going to hear an awful lot about warrants on the floor and how this fixes the problem, but here the FBI has said in no uncertain terms to one of our congressional aides that they are never going to have to use this warrant requirement, which was drafted by the Justice Department that has opposed warrants all along. If ever we have seen the fox not only watching the henhouse but inside the henhouse, this is it. It isn't even a fig leaf being small or otherwise. It is simply a way to divert the attention of this Congress away from what is really going on.  Furthermore, the bill would provide a path for the NSA to restart the practice of ``abouts'' collection, which has been described by the ranking member. The proposal grants some committees 30 days to review any effort to turn ``abouts'' collection back on, giving Congress little or no say on this matter. We all know that we can't do anything in 30 days around here, and yet the bill restricts us from doing that.  Finding a bipartisan and balanced solution is very possible.

That is why this bill opens the door to something that the NSA has closed itself.  We will hear from people who support ``abouts'' collection that Congress has got a chance to review it.

926,topic-id,283,"Mr.Speaker, when James Madison wrote the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, one of his overriding concerns was to prevent any branch of the three in government from becoming too powerful. That is why he put the checks and balances in the Constitution, so that the other branches could oversee and make sure that a branch that was trying to push the edge of the envelope would not be able to succeed in that.  The warrant amendment that has been talked about quite a bit today during the debate really is not effective. It is nothing at all. It ends up putting James Madison's legacy into the trash bin of history, and it does not deserve to go there.  Yesterday, The Washington Post reported that FBI officials told aides of Mr.Nadler that, under the proposed bill--meaning the underlying bill--they anticipate rarely, if ever, needing permission from the FISC to review query results.

It is something that I know, in a bipartisan way, we care about in this Chamber, and it is one place in which I think we could come to some agreement about increasing resources as we come to an agreement on the budget for the upcoming year. So I thank the Senator for her comments.        Special Counsel Mueller, Department of Justice, and FBI  Mr.President, I come to the floor this morning because I believe the United States is a nation of laws. The bedrock of our democracy is the rule of law. We are blessed with a judicial system and Federal law enforcement agencies that are respected worldwide for their integrity, impartiality, and professional excellence.  As the lead Democrat on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, I have a responsibility, along with my chairman, Senator Shelby, and our colleagues, to ensure that the Department of Justice, including Federal law enforcement agencies and Federal prosecutors, have the resources they need to do their jobs. I also have a responsibility to ensure that they are independent and shielded from political interference.[[Page S149]]  On that score, I am deeply troubled by a rising chorus of partisan attacks on the integrity of the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and in particular Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election.  Actually, this is the cover of the report from our intelligence agencies on that interference in the 2016 election.  I believe these attacks against Special Counsel Mueller are part of a broader campaign, orchestrated by the White House, to undermine the investigations into Russia's interference in the 2016 campaign, including the possible collusion by the Trump campaign. This effort to discredit the investigation has profound national security implications for the United  Yesterday, Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, released a report on behalf of the minority of the Foreign Relations Committee that documents Russian President Vladimir Putin's two-decade assault on democratic institutions, Western values, and the rule of law. This report complements a finding by the U.intelligence community that was issued last January that Russia interfered in the 2016 election and will continue to interfere in our elections if it is not deterred. This was the unanimous conclusion of all 17 U.intelligence agencies. Yet President Trump continues to be dismissive of claims that Russia interfered.  This is not about partisanship. This is not about who won the election. This is about whether Russia is trying to disrupt our democracy. President Trump's comments about what happened here are an extraordinary abdication of the President's duty to defend our country and safeguard our democracy.  Our Foreign Relations Committee's report concludes: ``Never before in American history has so clear a threat to national security been so clearly ignored by a U.president, and without a strong U.response, institutions and elections here and throughout Europe will remain vulnerable to the Kremlin's aggressive and sophisticated malign influence operations.''  Meanwhile, the campaign by the White House and certain Republicans in Congress to discredit and deflect the investigation continues. Indeed, it is a campaign that has become even more bizarre. Republicans on the Judiciary Committee refuse to release testimony by the cofounder of Fusion GPS--testimony regarding Russian efforts to collude with the Trump campaign. Last week, Senator Grassley and Senator Graham took the unprecedented step of calling on the Justice Department to investigate former British MI6 intelligence officer Christopher Steele, the author of the Fusion GPS report. Think about that. Instead of calling for an investigation of the serious charges in the so-called ``Russia dossier,'' these Senators are demanding an investigation of the author of the report. Meanwhile, the President is becoming increasingly aggressive in attacking the investigations. Yesterday, he again called them a ``witch-hunt'' and demanded ``Republicans should finally take control.''  The partisan attacks on Special Counsel Robert Mueller are especially shameful. A decorated marine Vietnam veteran, he is a Republican who was nominated to be FBI Director by President George Bush and was approved by the Senate, at that time, 98 to 0. In 2011, when his 10-year term was up, President Obama, a Democratic President, asked the Senate to extend his term for an additional 2 years. Director Mueller was confirmed for another 2-year term by a unanimous vote of 100 to 0.  When Mr.Mueller was appointed special counsel in May, he was greeted with bipartisan praise for his integrity and professionalism. Here are some of the quotes we heard at the time.  Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said:       I have a lot of confidence in Bob I think it was a      good choice.  Senator Rubio said:       I believe [Mueller] is going to conduct a full and fair and      thorough investigation that we should have confidence in.  Senator Isakson said:       [Mueller's] been appointed for a purpose. Let him carry      that purpose out, and let the evidence take us where it may.  Yet today, in the wake of indictments of key Trump campaign officials, some Republicans in Congress are joining with voices in the conservative media in smearing Robert Mueller as ``corrupt'' and ``dishonest.'' Those are quotes.  In early December, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said:       Mueller is corrupt. The senior FBI is corrupt. The system      is corrupt.  The day after Christmas, a prominent House Republican called for top officials in the Department of Justice and FBI to be ``purged.''  It is unfortunate that many Republicans appear to believe that in order to support the President they must attack and discredit not only Special Counsel Mueller but also the career employees of the Department of Justice and the These partisan attacks are baseless and reckless. They are undermining trust and confidence in the rule of law, and this must not be tolerated. It is time for responsible Senators on both sides of the aisle to speak up in defense of these institutions that are at the heart of our democracy. It is time to come together on a bipartisan basis to demand that Mr.Mueller be allowed to follow the facts wherever they may lead.  The FBI is also under attack. President Trump has said that the agency's reputation is in ``tatters'' and its standing is the ``worst in history.'' The truth is that the FBI continues to be the gold standard for law enforcement agencies worldwide.  The prosecutors in the Department of Justice are superb professionals who adhere to a strict ethic of honesty and impartiality, as do the nearly 37,000 employees of the They put their lives on the line every day to protect the American people from violent criminals, terrorists, and foreign agents who mean our country great harm.  Just last month, as the agency was being attacked on FOX News as equivalent to the Soviet-era KGB, undercover FBI agents were hard at work stopping an ISIS supporter who was planning a Christmas Day terrorist attack on Pier 39, the iconic San Francisco tourist attraction. This is just one example of more than 720 potential acts of terrorism that were disrupted and prevented by hard-working FBI agents last year. We can see the headlines from some of those plots that were thwarted in New York, San Francisco, Florida, and Oklahoma  On June 13, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein testified before the Appropriations Because the Attorney General has recused himself, Mr.Rosenstein is the top DOJ official overseeing the special counsel. At the hearing, I asked him if he had any evidence of good cause for firing Special Counsel He answered: ``No, I have not.'' In response to my further questioning, Mr.Rosenstein responded: ``You have my assurance that we are [going to] faithfully follow that regulation and Director Mueller is going to have the full . . . independence that he needs to conduct that investigation appropriately.'' More recently, on December 13, testifying before the House Judiciary Committee, Mr.Rosenstein was again asked if there is good cause for firing Special Counsel He responded with a firm no.  Members of Congress and commentators in the media who are now attacking the special counsel, the Justice Department, and the FBI for partisan political purposes are making a grave mistake. They will not succeed in deflecting law enforcement from its duties and missions, but they may well succeed in undermining the American people's faith and confidence in these institutions so vital to a healthy democracy. That is not only deeply unfortunate, it is shameful.  This is a remarkable moment in our Nation's history. A hostile foreign power has interfered in our Presidential election. Our law enforcement agencies and special counsel are working diligently to uncover the scope and methods of that intervention so that we can prevent a recurrence in the future. Supporting these efforts isn't about party or partisanship; it is about patriotism and defending America's democracy, which has been attacked and continues to be vulnerable to attack.  Our democracy is being tested, our law enforcement agencies are being tested, and we as Senators are being tested. Our responsibility is clear. We[[Page S150]]have a duty to come together, Senators of both parties, to defend the independence of the Justice Department and the FBI, and we must insist that Special Counsel Mueller be allowed to conduct and complete his investigation without political interference.

In fact, last year alone, the House of Representatives passed more than 470 bills and resolutions, 90 percent of which are bipartisan.  In Congress, I focused on important legislation to grow our local economy. I recently introduced two bills that will increase access to rural broadband and help our north country farmers bring their production into the 21st century.  I also helped the House pass legislation to strengthen career and technical education programs. This bipartisan bill updates Federal career and technical education policies to help more students gain the skills they need to compete for in-demand jobs.  I have also introduced bipartisan legislation to boost north country tourism by extending the time Canadian visitors can spend each year in the United  We have also made significant strides when it comes to education. For the past 3 years, I have worked to ensure that our students have the educational opportunities to achieve their limitless potential. In my first year in Congress, I introduced a bill to expand Pell grant access so that students can access this critical financial aid resource during summer months. I was pleased to see my initiative for year-round Pell signed into law this past May, meaning students and families in our district now have another important tool to achieve their higher education dreams.

New York's 21st District is the proud home of more veterans than any other district in New York My district offices have been hard at work on their behalf helping to recover over $2.25 million in hard-earned VA benefits for our veterans.  Congress also passed an extension of the GI Bill education benefits that lifts the expiration on when they can be used, giving veterans more flexibility to attend higher education institutions.  Last summer, Congress passed the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, which President Trump signed into law. This important law makes it easier to terminate failing VA employees and provides stronger protections for whistleblowers who raise the alarm over wait lists or medical malpractice.[[Page H28]]                                {time}  1100  No veteran deserves to be denied care, and this law brings needed accountability to the  Healthcare is another issue I hear frequently about when I speak with families and businesses across my district, especially ensuring our rural communities have the access they need.

874,topic-id,893,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of 139.  On January 19, the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 will expire. This vital legislation includes section 702, which permits the government to target foreign citizens located overseas to obtain foreign intelligence information. Section 702 is one of the most, if not the most, critical national security tool used by our intelligence community to obtain intelligence on foreign terrorists located overseas.  Now, some claim section 702 vacuums bulk information without due regard to the intended target. This assertion is simply false. Section 702 is a targeted program, with roughly 106,000 foreign targets worldwide. Given that the worldwide population is about 7.5 billion, this program can hardly be described as bulk collection.  Section 702 targets spies, terrorists, weapons proliferators, and other foreign adversaries who threaten the United States, and locating them is crucial to protecting our troops and our homeland.  As an example, Hajji Iman, who was the second-in-command of ISIS, was located via section 702 and later removed from the battlefield. While the vast majority of examples remain classified, this is just one instance that demonstrates the necessity of this authority.  Subject to multiple layers of oversight by all three branches of government, section 702 is one of the government's most rigorously overseen foreign intelligence collection authorities. To date, while compliance incidents occur and are dealt with appropriately, there has never been a known, intentional abuse of this authority. Nevertheless, the program should be subject to regular adjustments, as necessary, to ensure the effectiveness of privacy protections.  Therefore, after careful consideration of the best way to strengthen privacy protections without hindering the program's effectiveness, the committee supports 139, a bipartisan bill that includes provisions and addresses concerns raised by the House Judiciary Committee and the  The bill's reforms include:  Requiring specific section 702 query procedures, separate from existing minimization procedures, which must be reviewed by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court every year;  Limiting the instances in which the government can use section 702 information to prosecute U.people;  Requiring the inspector general of the Department of Justice to conduct a review of the FBI's interpretation and implementation of the FBI's section 702 query procedures;  Temporarily codifying the end of the NSA's section 702 upstream ``abouts'' collection until the government develops new procedures and briefs the congressional Intelligence and Judiciary Committees;  And, finally, improving transparency by mandating the publication of section 702 minimization procedures and requiring additional reporting to Congress on how the intelligence community is using other FISA authorities.  Mr.Speaker, during discussions over the past several months, both the House and the Senate have made several concessions to achieve this compromised language in order to reauthorize this critical national security authority. Accordingly, 139 now includes a probable cause-based order requirement for the FBI to access the content of a section 702 communication during FBI criminal investigations on Americans, unrelated to national security.  This order requirement does not reflect the committee's belief or intent that law enforcement access to lawfully acquired information constitutes a separate search under the Fourth The Fourth Amendment, as interpreted by numerous Federal courts, does not require the FBI to obtain a separate order from the FISC to review lawfully acquired 702 information.  Though not required by the Constitution, this compromise is meant to provide additional protections for U.S.[[Page H143]]person information that is incidentally collected under section 702. Along with the restrictions on the use of section 702 information in criminal prosecutions, this should provide further assurances to the American public that this vital national security tool is used strictly to discover and mitigate foreign threats to the United States, and the handling and use of any incidental U.person information is carefully controlled and monitored.  Mr.Speaker, America faces an array of international threats more complicated than anything we have endured in the past.                              {time}  0930  Speaking for the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, I cannot emphasize enough that now is not the time to draw back on key national security authorities.  I am dismayed by the amount of disinformation being propagated by those who oppose section 702 for purely ideological reasons. When Congress must reauthorize this program again in 2023, we hope those who debate these issues, both inside and outside this Chamber, do so with intellectual honesty and integrity.  The USA RIGHTS Act, which has been offered as an amendment in the nature of a substitute, is an attempt to kill this compromise. In its place, the amendment would begin resurrecting the information-sharing walls between national security and law enforcement that the 9/11 Commission identified as a major factor in the failure to identify and thwart the 9/11 plot.  If individuals in this body cannot learn from history, they are doomed to repeat it. There is no support for this bill in the majority of the committees of jurisdiction whose members understand that this amendment would render section 702 inoperable.  Therefore, in order to keep the U.interests and troops abroad safe from harm, we must ensure that the intelligence community has the tools it needs to provide intelligence to our soldiers abroad. Section 702 is critical in that regard, and 139 provides the intelligence community with the authorities needed to protect the homeland while implementing key privacy enhancements.  Mr.Speaker, I urge passage of 139, and I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2018-01-11-pt1-PgH137-3.txt,2168,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2018.0,11.0,January

879,topic-id,359,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, some of my colleagues believe that Congress should go above and beyond what is required by the Fourth Amendment and institute additional safeguards on how the government handles any potential U.personal information that may be incidentally collected under section 702. While the varying committees may have different ideas as to how to strike the right balance between additional privacy measures and national security, the art of the compromise brings us to the current junction.  Under 139, if the bill conducts a U.S.-person query into its database during a criminal investigation not related to national security and conducts a section 702 communication, the FBI must obtain an order from the FISA court prior to assessing the content of the communication.  The committee does not believe that such an order is necessary under the Fourth Amendment, but it is adding more protections, as a matter of policy, in order to address unfounded concerns by opponents of section 702 that the authority is being used to investigate U.people.  Proponents of the USA RIGHTS Act amendment will say that 139 does not go far enough in its current form and that they have crafted a great compromise that allows the intelligence community to do its job.  Unfortunately, they are selling a poison pill that is extraordinarily harmful to our national security. Per the office of the Director of National Intelligence, under the USA RIGHTS Act amendment, the FBI would not be able to look at lawfully collected data related to suspicious activities similar to that of the 9/11 hijackers. This is unethical to the 9/11 Commission Report, and anyone who thinks about voting for the USA RIGHTS Act amendment should pick up a copy and skim it prior to voting.  Unlike the USA RIGHTS Act amendment, 139 is able to balance national security and privacy while adhering to the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission reporting. I echo the White House statement last night strongly opposing the USA RIGHTS Act amendment, and I urge all of my colleagues in the House to support 139.

914,topic-id,319,"Mr.Speaker, before I begin, I want to emphasize how dismayed I am by the amount of disinformation being propagated by opponents of section 702. I have heard some things over the last couple of days, and I just wonder, how in the world can someone believe that.  Let me tell you why this amendment must be opposed. Under the USA RIGHTS Act, the intelligence community would not be able to query the name of the suspected terrorist supporter in the United States to see if he is in contact with terrorist recruiters. It would not be able to query the name of a person in the United States who has been suspiciously approaching U.Government employees with security clearances to determine if that person is part of a foreign espionage network.  We would not be able to query the name of a registered owner of a suspicious vehicle parked in front of the Washington Monument to see if that person is in contact with terrorist operatives overseas. We would not be able to query the name of a person in the aftermath of a mass casualty attack on the United States to see if he has terrorist connections, or as a follow on, if potential follow-on attacks are imminent.  We would not be able to query the name of a foreign national who travels to the United States to take flight training but doesn't care about learning how to land.  Individuals in this room who want to end section 702 know that they have an opportunity to do with their vote, but they would be putting troops and American lives at risk. And if that is okay with you, then go ahead and vote for the USA RIGHTS Act amendment, but I promise you, you will regret it when, some day, in this dangerous world we live in, we have to answer to our constituents for our votes here today.

I know the pages love them. I come to the floor to talk about my State, really brag about my State, and recognize an Alaskan who has made a difference--made a difference in their community, whether it is a small community or a big community in the State, in the country.  I have repeatedly stated--I am sure not all my colleagues agree, but maybe some of them do--that Alaskans live in the greatest State in the greatest country in the world. We certainly have the most beautiful landscapes and all the seasons. I was in Fairbanks and Anchorage over the holidays. It was wonderful. Winter is such a great time in the great State of For those who love snow, Alaska is the place to be, so we want everyone to come visit. But it is truly the people and strong communities throughout Alaska that make our State so great--such a welcoming place.  For those of us who live in Alaska, sustainable community is everything. Living in one of the most magnificent places on Earth, also, certainly has its challenges. We depend on each other. Our traditional knowledge, our ingenuity, our warm-hearted nature, and our determination to overcome these challenges is what makes our State great and is often the theme of our ``Alaskan of the Week'' speeches.  Today I wish to transport you to the village of Tuntutuliak--a village of about 400 people, southwest of Bethel, AK, on the 700-mile long, mighty Kuskokwim River--and introduce you to a truly amazing elder who, for 77 years, has worked tirelessly for his community and for our This is James Charles, who is our Alaskan of the  Over the past decades, when there has been a meeting on the Kuskokwim concerning fish or wildlife or subsistence, James has been there helping to create and shape a fishing and hunting community and regulations, not only for the region but for the entire State of  James was born in 1940 in a fish camp below Helmick Point on the Kuskokwim During that time, Alaska was being devastated by a tuberculosis epidemic. In fact, in the mid-20th century, Alaska Native people experienced the highest incidence of tuberculosis of any population ever. This is one of the many challenges we talk about.  Sadly, the epidemic took James's father, his uncle, and both grandparents, leaving his mother and the community[[Page S44]]to care for her three children. The community--like many still, unfortunately, in Alaska--didn't have hospitals or clinics. They didn't have medicine. The Federal Government basically turned a blind eye to the havoc that this disease was wreaking over all of Alaska, particularly in our small villages.  What the community did have was each other. They had food, and they had the bounty of the land. They had elders to help teach the young people in the village the true meaning of subsistence living.  James's mother, Emma, hunted and fished to feed the family, and she and James's uncle taught James how to be a conservationist, only taking enough fish and wild game to survive and ensuring enough was left for other villagers--lessons he has passed on to the younger generations of Alaskans, year after year.  James met his wife Nancy 50 years ago. She lived in another village. He met her when he was out trapping for food. He said:       I walked 52 miles and found my wife at the end of my      trapline. It was my best catch [ever].  James's accomplishments are legion. He spent 22 years in the Alaska National Guard, like so many Alaskan Natives who serve at higher rates in the U.military than any other ethnic group in the country. He has served on the Federal Subsistence Regional Advisory Council, the Fish and Game Advisory Council, and the Kuskokwim River Salmon Management Working  James travels all around our great State, attending different meetings and testifying at the Board of Fish and He has dedicated his life to fish and wildlife conservation so he can set an example for Alaskans today and future generations, including his own family.  He has 5 children, 15 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren. He is so committed to keeping the culture and tradition alive that none of his kids or great grandkids are allowed into his house unless they are able to speak Yupik, the traditional language of his people.  For all his work to help continue a vital tradition of subsistence and conservation in Alaska, James was awarded the conservationist of the year award by the Fish and Wildlife Service this past summer, which he accepted at this year's Alaska Federation of Natives  For his work, James is our Alaskan of the  Thank you, James, for all you have done for the great State of                        Tribute to Alex Schenck  Mr.President, I wish to say a few words about one of the members of my staff, who happens to be on the floor with me right now. Alex Schenck, unfortunately for me, is leaving my office on January 5 to pursue another opportunity in Washington,  Alex has been in my office since 2015. He has been a legislative correspondent and rose to be a legislative aide where he oversaw issues related to my work on both the Environment and Public Works Committee and the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Most notably and importantly for this body and, I believe, for the entire country, Alex was the key member of my staff who drafted 756, the Save Our Seas Act, the SOS Act, an important bipartisan piece of legislation we worked on with Senator Whitehouse and others. It passed the Senate last year.

What Alex was able to do in terms of this bill is very impressive. He brought together an impressive coalition of industry and conservation groups to support the bill.

It is a beautiful, wonderful place. Fairbanks is hot in the summer. My wife and I were married there many years ago. It was over 90 degrees when we got married in August, but it is really cold in the winter. We spent January 1, 2000--the millennium celebration--in Fairbanks with our kids and our family. It was 50 below zero without the windchill--cold. It is a place I love, where my wife was born and raised, where we lived, where my in-laws still live, and the place Jeff Cook, our Alaskan of the Week, calls home.  Jeff has been in Fairbanks his whole life. His parents moved to Fairbanks in 1938. He went to college in Oregon, and his wife Sue was there, but the couple moved back to Alaska, to Fairbanks, and started a family. He is now 74 years young. He and Sue have four children, two of whom have settled in Fairbanks, and they have five grandchildren. He is the patriarch of not only a great family but of many community organizations throughout Fairbanks and, really,  Throughout the years, Jeff has had a career in real estate, in business. He has sat on numerous boards--community boards--and been in community groups. Let me just give a couple of examples of his community work, of his sitting on the board of the Fairbanks Chamber of Commerce, the University of Alaska Board of Regents, the Rotary Club of Fairbanks, the Greater Fairbanks Community Hospital Foundation board, the board for the State of Alaska Chamber of Commerce, the Rasmuson Foundation board, and the boards for Alaska Airlines and Wells Fargo This is an individual--a leader--who has been involved in his community for decades. He is a perfect example of the community-minded individual whom we call our Alaskan of the  We could be done right here. It is a pretty amazing career--a great example of someone who is dedicated to his State, to his country, to his community. Yet Jeff has done a lot more. He recently used all of his energy, all of his experience, all of his community involvement to embark on what really has become an extraordinary fundraising campaign to raise money for cancer research--so important for our Nation, so important for This became a personal issue for Let me tell you this story.[[Page S163]]  Last March, he and Sue received, really, a devastating phone call from their youngest daughter Chrissy, who is 34 and lives in Las Vegas with her husband and 2-year-old daughter. She called to tell them the bad news--really, the horrible news that millions of American families hear every year--that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer and that she had a positive match for the BRCA2 gene, which increases one's risk of developing breast cancer or ovarian cancer.  Jeff and Sue felt powerless against this disease when they heard this. He said: ``When you're a parent, it doesn't matter how old your children are; you're supposed to slay the dragons and conquer the monsters'' and protect your kids.  If that were not devastating enough, weeks later, he and his wife made sure that everyone in the Cook family got tested. Unfortunately, five other members of the family tested positive for this gene. They are all being monitored now.  Here is what Jeff said: ``We couldn't conquer the cancer, but we just had to do something.'' He said he had heard about the American Cancer Society's ``Real Men Wear Pink'' campaign--a fundraising program that is held in October, as everybody knows, is Breast Cancer Awareness About 3,000 men from across the country participated in the program this year, the ``Real Men Wear Pink'' campaign.  So Jeff started. He started with the pretty impressive goal of raising $5,000 for cancer research and an email list of about 70 people, most of whom were in Within 90 seconds after sending his first email, he had raised $1,000. Pretty good. Then what happened? The community of Fairbanks, of Alaska--really of the whole country--started opening up to his plea. Donations kept coming in. The more donations he received, the more Jeff worked at raising funds. Many of the people he knew were donating, but what happened? Strangers from across Alaska and from across the country started to send money for this very worthy cause of breast cancer research--often with heartfelt stories of their loved ones, of their own struggles with cancer, or of those of their kids. Someone from a small town in New York State sent him $250.  As the weeks passed, he began to pay attention to how he was stacking up against others across the country. Jeff is a competitive guy. He is very successful. When he reached 10 in the country in terms of fundraising for this very important matter, he told one of his friends there was no way he could beat the 1 person ahead of him who had raised $30,000--no way. That was a high number. Now, Fairbanks is not a very big city, and the other people on the list above him were from much bigger cities from across the country and had what he thought were larger connections and larger networks. Yet his friend told him: ``Don't underestimate yourself, Jeff.'' After he read that, he said: ``I'm going for broke.'' This is what he did.  He was all in. He started fundraising everywhere. When it was all said and done, on this campaign, Jeff Cook, from Fairbanks, AK--a town of a little over 30,000 people in Alaska's interior--was the 1 fundraiser in America for breast cancer research this year--1. In terms of the American Cancer Society's ``Real Men Wear Pink'' campaign, Jeff Cook raised over $120,000.  If my colleagues were down here, I would ask them for a round of applause.  That was for the entire country. Think about that. We come down to this floor a lot and debate cancer research, medical research--very important. Here is one individual in America who raised over $120,000 through his own energy and passion and for the love of his daughter. This is a testament to Jeff's perseverance, but it is also about the good people in Fairbanks, throughout Alaska, and really throughout the country.  As Jeff said, ``It says so much about our community. There was such an outpouring of love, goodness and generosity. That was the most touching part of [this entire experience].''  What else did Jeff learn? He learned that his daughter Chrissy, who underwent chemotherapy and a double mastectomy, is stronger than he ever imagined. She is recovering well, but she is still in recovery.  I am going to humbly ask my colleagues and those who are watching here and those who are watching on TV to put a prayer in for Chrissy and other cancer victims like Senator Hirono, who was just on the floor. Put them on your prayer lists as they are in recovery--all of them.  I want to end with a big thanks to everybody in Alaska and across the country who are part of the ``Real Men Wear Pink'' campaign who are literally raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for breast cancer research.  I thank Jeff, of course, for not underestimating himself but for another--another--mission well done as a community leader in Fairbanks and throughout  Congratulations for being our Alaskan of the  I yield the floor.

They challenge their failed government. They have done so in the face of violent repression, imprisonment, torture, and even death.  Why?  They are fed up.

The United States and our allies should use the menu of sanctions available to us to target human rights violators and the Ayatollah's thugs who forcefully repress their fellow citizens.  We must ensure the protesters have access to social media, and we must let them know that we support them. Ayatollahs must know that the free world is watching.

581,topic-id,1182,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Scott for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to 140, which would strip protections from workers who are employed by a Tribally-owned business but are not Tribal members. This includes protection from harassment and discrimination in the workplace.  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits employers from discriminating against employees, does not apply to Tribal enterprises. A non-Tribal worker employed by a Tribally-owned casino, for example, cannot file a harassment or discrimination claim in Federal court or with the Equal Employment Opportunity Instead, collective bargaining agreements fill the gap by including provisions that enforce their right to a fair workplace.  By stripping their collective bargaining rights, this legislation eliminates the only recourse that these workers have against discrimination and harassment. This is one of the many unacceptable consequences of this bill.  Now, I have two letters. One from the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and one from the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, both of which raise strong objections to the majority's attempt to exclude workers from the rights enshrined in the National Labor Relations  Mr.Speaker, I include these letters in the                                         International Brotherhood                                                 of Teamsters,                                 Washington, DC, December 6, 2017.     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.4 million members      of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, I am again      writing to[[Page H117]]     express our strong opposition to H.986, the Tribal Labor      Sovereignty This legislation would exempt all Tribally-     owned and -operated commercial enterprises on Indian lands      broadly defined from the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).      We urge you to vote no when the House considers this      legislation.       If H.986 were to become law, hundreds of thousands of      workers at these enterprises, including Teamsters, would be      stripped of their protections and rights under the NLRA,      including the right to organize and collective bargaining. It      would deprive both Tribal members and non-member employees of      the right to form or join unions and to bargain collectively      for better wages, hours, and working conditions. We should be      working to expand the rights and ability of workers to earn a      decent living for themselves and their families and to secure      a safe and healthy workplace.       While Tribal casinos have been the focus of discussion,      this legislation affects not just casino workers. Since the      1980's Tribes have expanded business interests beyond      casinos. They now operate many different revenue producing      commercial enterprises--construction companies, mining      operations, and power plants, to hotels, water parks and ski      resorts, to name a few.       In 2004, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) (in San      Manuel) ruled that Tribal casino workers should have NLRA      protections. Shortly after the San Manuel decision,      legislation, in the form of amendments, was twice offered to      block the NLRB from enforcing the San Manuel decision.       These amendments were rejected. Since then, the NLRB has      proceeded in a measured fashion asserting jurisdiction on a      case-by-case basis. The NLRB will not assert jurisdiction      where it would interfere with internal governance rights in      purely intramural matters or abrogate treaty rights.      Otherwise, the NLRB will protect workers' rights at tribally      owned enterprises by asserting jurisdiction. With its case-     by-case approach, San Manuel takes a careful approach to      balancing of tribal sovereignty interests with Federal labor      law.       It should be noted that other important federal laws that      protect workers apply to Indian businesses, such as the      Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Fair Labor Standards      Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and Title      III of the Americans with Disabilities Indeed, courts      have denied attempts to gain exemptions on numerous occasions      ruling commercial tribal enterprises should not be excluded      from such laws. NLRA rights and protections should not be      treated differently.       Proponents assert that they are seeking the same exemption      as state and local governments. However, this is inaccurate,      The NLRA only exempts actual government employees and not      private sector employees performing contracted out government      functions. Also, a substantial majority of workers at these      enterprises are not Indian or Tribe members, and thus have no      ability to influence tribal governance, since non-tribal      members are prohibited from petitioning a tribe.       The bill could also undermine enforcement of existing labor      contracts and the decision workers made to organize and      bargain collectively. When a collective bargaining agreement      expires, a Tribe could unilaterally terminate the      relationship with the union without consequence under the      The employer's obligation. to bargain could be      eliminated.       Employees of tribal enterprises have no constitutional      rights to protect against employers. Only the NLRA gives them      free speech rights. Absent the NLRA they have no protection.      Workers cannot be left without any legally enforceable right      to form unions and bargain collectively just because they are      employed at tribally owned enterprise.       Finally, the United States requires its trading partners to      implement and abide by internationally recognized labor      standards, while H.986 deprives workers at these tribal      enterprises of these core rights--the right to organize and      bargain collectively.       To focus solely on the NLRA raises the question of the true      motivation for this legislation. It is regrettable that the      principle of tribal sovereignty is being used to cloak an      attack on the basic rights of workers to organize and bargain      collectively. The Teamsters Union respects tribal      sovereignty. However, we do not believe that this principle      should be used to deny workers their collective bargaining      rights and freedom of association. We urge you to oppose the      Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act and to VOTE NO on H.986 when      the legislation comes to a vote in the House of                Sincerely,                                                   James Hoffa,     General                                  ____         American Federation of State, County and Municipal            Employees, AFL-CIO,                                  Washington, DC, January 9, 2018.     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.6 million members      of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal      Employees (AFSCME), I am writing to urge to oppose 140, as      currently amended to expand the exemption of employers under      the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).       140, as amended, is Just another attempt at passing the      so-called Tribal Sovereignty Act, which would deny protection      under the NLRA to many workers employed by tribal-owned and -     operated enterprises on Indian land. A great majority of      these workers are not Native Americans and in recent years      there has been a substantial expansion of enterprises that      would be impacted by this legislation, including not only      casinos, but mining operations, power plants, saw mills, ski      resorts, high-tech firms, hotels, and spas.       AFSCME supports the principle of sovereignty for tribal      governments, but does not believe that this principle should      be used to deny workers their collective bargaining rights      and freedom of association. We oppose any effort to exempt on      an across-the-board basis all tribal enterprises from the      NLRA, without regard to a specific review of all the      circumstances, as is currently provided by National Labor      Relations Board (NLRB) standards. Workers must not be left      without any legally enforceable right to form unions and      bargain collectively, especially in instances where they are      working for commercial operations competing with other      businesses.       AFSCME strongly urges you to oppose 140, as amended,      when it comes before the House for a vote.           Sincerely,                                                       Scott Frey,                           Director of Federal Government  ",CREC-2018-01-10-pt1-PgH114-2.txt,2110,A NEW DIRECTION,2018.0,10.0,January

523,topic-id,1335,"Mr.President, the beginning of a new session of Congress provides a good moment to look back at the previous year and take stock of the challenges ahead, and today what I would like to do is just take a few minutes to talk about the national security challenges facing our country and the importance of equipping our military to meet them.  By the end of the Obama administration, our military was facing a serious readiness shortfall. The Obama administration's failure to prioritize defense had left our armed services with manpower deficits and delayed the acquisition of 21st century weapons and equipment. Military effectiveness had been compromised by a culture of micromanagement in the Obama administration that seriously hampered the ability of troops and commanders to respond to conditions on the ground in a timely fashion, but within days of his inauguration, President Trump made clear that all this was going to change.  You can look at the situation we faced in the Middle The timeframe I am referring to right here, the mound of ground that is held by ISIS, that is in January of 2017.  Well, just a week after his inauguration, President Trump issued a Presidential memorandum on rebuilding the military. He directed a review of our military's readiness, and he set out an action plan to address manpower shortfalls, maintenance backlogs, acquisition costs and delays, and other drains on our military capabilities. President Trump also acted to free up military commanders to make decisions and to respond to conditions on the ground.  The fruits of his commitment to rebuilding our military and trusting our military leaders are already evident, most notably in the significant gains made against ISIS in 2017.[[Page S88]]  If you look at the chart I just showed, in January of 2017, and then you look at December of 2017, in terms of territory held, ISIS has been routed. In the first 11 months of the Trump administration, over 15,000 square miles were liberated from ISIS control, exceeding the total area freed in the preceding 2\1/2\ years. ISIS has lost over 98 percent of the territory it once held, and it hasn't gained any back.  Just a month ago, Iraqi Prime Minister al-Abadi declared his country ``fully liberated'' from In Syria, ISIS has lost control of its strongholds and now only remains in small pockets of the country.  All told, in the last year, more than 5.3 million people have been freed from the brutal grip of ISIS--more than double the previous gains. Families who have spent years fearing for their lives are seeing a chance for stability, peace, and order. If this year has shown us anything, it is that we can trust our military to do its job and deliver results.  President Trump delegated tactical authority and permitted our military to take action when action was needed, and military leaders credit this tactical authority for significant gains made on the ground.  The swift rise of ISIS was enabled, in part, by the Obama administration's shortsighted desire to withdraw from the fight against terrorism in the Middle The withdrawal of U.troops--on a timeline the Obama administration announced to our enemies--left a power vacuum in the region, and ISIS stepped in to fill the void. This is a mistake we cannot repeat.  While we have made tremendous strides against ISIS in the last year, we cannot simply take these wins and let our guard down. We know ISIS and other dark actors can operate in the shadows of the internet and social media, using their extensive networks to recruit and influence other would-be attackers in the United States and around the world.  As chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, which shares jurisdiction over some of these matters, I am committed to looking at what steps we can take to thwart terrorist recruitment and planning efforts and to keep America safe. Next week, I am holding a Commerce Committee hearing on what social media companies can do in this fight.  While we focus on combating terrorism, we cannot forget the conventional threats faced by our Nation and our allies. I mentioned gains against ISIS and Syria, but there remains the alarming challenge of growing Iranian influence there. Syria provides a convenient land bridge to connect Iran with Hezbollah in Lebanon, which is well on its way to being a proxy for the Iranian  Of course, we continue to see the deadly consequences of Iran's continued smuggling of arms to Houthi rebels. Iran is a serious threat to stability in the Middle East and to our allies there, and we need to keep that in mind as we consider the failed Iran nuclear deal and the ongoing protests in  We also have to stay focused on the threat posed by North South and North Korea reestablished communications and just met to discuss the upcoming winter Olympics in South They announced, in addition to North Korea sending a delegation to the winter games, the two countries have agreed to hold military talks, but North Korea said it will not discuss its nuclear program at this time.  I think North Korea's nuclear program has to be addressed as a condition of any lasting peace, and the United States should lead its allies in making that crystal clear. While the talks are a notable development after 2 years of no communication between the two countries, we obviously need to be wary of North Korea's motives. We will have to see what actions follow and if the talks lead to any substantive steps by North Korea to dismantle its nuclear program.  President Trump and Ambassador Haley have made it clear that North Korea must abandon its dangerous ambitions, and increased sanctions are providing additional pressure. We should make no concessions without fundamental progress. Of course, this will require cooperation from China to help exert pressure on North Korea and uphold U.resolutions.  China has sought to tip the regional balance in its favor by objecting to the installation of missile defense platforms that would defend the United States and our allies against North Korean missiles. Meanwhile, it has been simultaneously expanding its own military, continuing to develop islands in international waters and exercising economic coercion.  President Trump's national security strategy correctly acknowledges both China and Russia as challengers to American influence, interests, security, and prosperity.  I have spoken on the Senate floor more than once to denounce Russia's continued annexation of Crimea, its subversion of Ukrainian sovereignty, and its efforts to undermine NATO, not to mention its continued denial of attempting to meddle with our election. Both the conventional challenges that our Nation continues to face and the persistent threat of radical terrorism underscore the perennial need to ensure that our military is the best prepared and the best equipped fighting force in the world.  I have said it before, and I will say it again. If we don't get national security right, the rest of what we do here is just conversation. We have to be able to defend our country and our allies.  Yes, investing in our national security and restoring our military, especially after years of neglect, will come at a cost, but as Army Chief of Staff GEN Mark Milley has said, ``The only thing more expensive than deterrence is actually fighting a war, and the only thing more expensive than fighting a war is fighting one and losing one.''  In the next few weeks, the Senate will have a chance to vote to increase funding for our troops and to take real steps to restore our military readiness. I hope my colleagues across the aisle will work with us. If there is any issue--any issue--in this Chamber that should be bipartisan, it is this one. It is not an exaggeration to say the security of our Nation, our ability to live as a free people, depends upon the strength of our military.

295,topic-id,396,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in support of H.4577, the Domestic Explosives Detection Canine Capacity Building Act of 2017.  In recent years, the volume of air travel has steadily risen, with 42 million people traveling domestically in the last days of 2017 alone. Last year, the worldwide number of people flying rose to a historic high of 4 billion passengers.  The high visibility of the aviation sector makes it a persistent target for terrorists who wish to carry out attacks and inflict harm upon U.citizens. As such, the TSA must continue to collaborate with stakeholders and better incorporate proven security tools into security operations. One of the tools that we know to be effective is canine detection teams, particularly in detecting and protecting against explosive threats.  In a May 2017 hearing before the Committee on Homeland Security last year, the Director of the Threat Assessment Division within the Transportation Security Administration attested to the value of aviation screening canine teams, saying: ``Canines are incredibly effective. They can do things we can't even measure with machines.''  The legislation before us today, H.4577, would require the TSA to establish a working group of stakeholders to determine ways to develop a domestic canine breeding network to produce explosives detection canines and modernize canine training standards.  Today, the demand for trained and certified dogs is huge, with more and more security stakeholders coming to appreciate the explosive detection capabilities of our four-legged friends. This heightened demand has led to a shortage, presenting challenges for the U.Government in the procurement of suitable canines.  In testimony before the committee, the TSA and various stakeholders have cited these challenges and expressed concern regarding how to best address this shortage. That is why this legislation is so important.  The working group mandated in this legislation draws from authorities on explosives detection canines and homeland security missions, including the Transportation Security Administration, the Department of Homeland Security's Science and Technology Directorate, national domestic canine associations, academic experts, and domestic canine breeders and vendors.  The knowledge and expertise offered by this diverse group of representatives will ensure that the DHS can implement an effective and impactful strategy to further the development of explosives detection canine teams.  For these reasons, Madam Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.

H.4577 will jump-start conversations on how to increase the supply of canines and better integrate them in the TSA's layered security at airports[[Page H34]]and surface transportation hubs. Canines have become an invaluable asset to the DHS in fulfilling its many important missions and goals.  Even prior to the inception of the Department, canines were utilized by law enforcement and first responder agencies for decades, proving to be one of the most effective and versatile tools in detecting threats and protecting the homeland.  Terrorists are working hard to exploit vulnerabilities in our transportation system, and the U.must utilize all of our available resources to combat these threats. Canines are undoubtedly one such resource, providing a robust and reliable layer of security and giving Americans peace of mind.  If enacted, H.4577 would better position the TSA to achieve and maintain a reliable supply of canines to deploy to not only airport terminals, but also to cargo operations and mass transit systems.  As such, Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support H.4577, and I yield back the balance of my time.

304,topic-id,578,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in support of H.4567, the DHS Overseas Personnel Enhancement Act of 2017.  Madam Speaker, the DHS Overseas Personnel Enhancement Act of 2017 would require the Department of Homeland Security to submit to Congress an overseas personnel assessment and enhancement plan.  Today, roughly 2,000 DHS personnel have been deployed to more than 70 countries around the world. These DHS employees are involved in a diverse range of overseas operations targeted at terrorism prevention, counternarcotics, and preventing human smuggling.  I am particularly interested in the efforts of the National Targeting Center, which is housed within U.Customs and Border Protection, to embed intelligence analysts in overseas information sharing operations with international partners to prevent terrorist and other criminal networks from carrying out attacks and criminal operations with impunity.  In fact, in a short while, the House will be debating H.4578, the Counter Terrorist Network Act, which, among other things, authorizes overseas deployments from the  About half of overseas DHS personnel are from the CBP and are involved, among other things, in screening U.S.-bound passengers at airports, inspecting cargo being loaded on ships bound for the U.S., and training other nations' customs and border force.  Additionally, the DHS also assigns Immigration and Customs Enforcement special agents, Secret Service special agents, and Transportation Security Administration officials to overseas posts to engage with international partners on counterterrorism, counternarcotics, information sharing, and criminal investigations, as well as security screening and vetting programs.  Just last month, CBP personnel were credited with helping Ecuadoran authorities interdict and arrest seven people and 800 pounds of cocaine. Specifically, a CBP team participating in an aerial surveillance mission in drug transit zones near South America tracked a low-flying aircraft that intelligence reports indicated had not filed a flight plan and, with a long-lens camera, snapped images of the plane's tail number and other identifying details and radioed Ecuador who were waiting when the plane landed to arrest the smugglers.                              {time}  1245  According to CBP, its P-3 plane program patrols more than 42 million square miles in the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, and the Pacific Ocean and last year contributed to 145 drug seizures, helping American and foreign authorities capture a combined 34,108 pounds of marijuana and 193,197 pounds of cocaine, according to Customs and Border Protection records.  More broadly, DHS personnel stationed overseas make important contributions to the Department's efforts in securing the homeland and keeping the American people safe. As such, it is imperative that these individuals are utilized efficiently and effectively. This bill seeks to ensure just that.  In 2016, Congress enacted legislation that the Committee on Homeland Security, on a bipartisan basis, approved to direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to issue a strategy for the Department's international programs.  Among other things, the law required DHS to provide the committee with an inventory of personnel and resources deployed abroad and a 3-year, risk-based strategy to ensure strategic overseas employment of personnel.  The statutory deadline for this strategy was June 2017, 7 months ago. This critical strategy has not been submitted to Congress, as mandated.  H.4567 incorporates an amendment from Ranking Member Thompson that expands the bill's briefing requirement to include information on efforts to implement the strategy. Enactment of this bipartisan legislation should help enhance the effectiveness of DHS personnel at foreign locations.  Madam Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.

The men and women of DHS face an immense challenge in responding to the ever-changing terrorist threat landscape. It is imperative that DHS personnel stationed overseas serve as an effective force in this mission, and enactment of this legislation would be a positive step towards this goal.  In fiscal year 2016, CBP officers inspected over 390 million travelers at 328 ports of entry, of which over 119 million flew into air ports of entry. Deployed overseas CBP officers, through programs such as Preclearance and the Immigration Advisory Program, utilize a risk-based, intelligence-driven strategy to extend our border security efforts outward to detect, assess, and mitigate, at the earliest possible point in the travel continuum, any risk imposed by travelers before they reach the United  Today, ICE agents are assigned to 66 offices in 49 countries and work with their overseas law enforcement counterparts to detect, disrupt, and dismantle transnational criminal groups[[Page H36]]and individuals who seek to harm our country and people.

In fact, the annual cost of deploying an ICE agent overseas can be four times the cost of deploying the agent domestically. As such, it is critical that DHS have a strategy for its overseas programs and execute it.  Congress has an important oversight role to play to ensure that DHS carries out these programs in a risk-based, strategic manner.

316,topic-id,394,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.4561, the Security Assessment Feasibility for Equipment Testing and Evaluation of Capabilities for Our Homeland Act, and I encourage my colleagues to support its passage, which would require the Department of Homeland Security to develop a new, third-party testing program for Transportation Security Administration screening technology.  We have heard, time and time again, from vendors that it takes far too long to get their technologies through TSA testing processes. TSA's testing and evaluation must be improved not simply to improve management efficiency, but to address the constantly evolving threat landscape.  In November, TSA Administrator David Pekoske testified before the Committee on Homeland Security about the need to accelerate deployment of innovative security enhancements, as terrorist groups are becoming more sophisticated. These bad actors are learning about our aviation security countermeasures and have even gone so far as to post instructions to build devices to evade screening technologies on the internet.                              {time}  1300  As terrorist and criminal organizations become more sophisticated, we must remain one step ahead. H.4561 seeks to do just that and move TSA forward in overcoming technology stovepipes that have hindered state-of-the-art security technology from being integrated into our Nation's transportation systems in a timely manner.  H.4561 is predicated on the view that, by establishing alternative avenues to test transportation screening technologies, TSA will be positioned to introduce innovative security enhancements into checkpoints sooner, and businesses, regardless of their size, will be better positioned to compete.  The committee has repeatedly heard from small security manufacturers about how financially draining it is to wait out TSA testing in the hopes of a contract. H.4561, if implemented effectively, has the potential to get innovative technology produced by small businesses in airport security checkpoints and enhance the effectiveness of TSA's screening operations.  During consideration of this measure in committee, the majority accepted amendments offered by committee Democrats to the bill to ensure that the third-party testing receives scrutiny from the Government Accountability Office and to build integrity into this new program.  Given the changes that were made to the legislation in committee and the potential positive impact this legislation could have on ensuring innovative technologies are integrated into TSA's security operations, I urge my colleagues to support H.4561.

319,topic-id,303,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, I would first like to point out that this series of bills that we have presented today has been worked on in a strong bipartisan fashion.  I would like to thank Chairman Katko and Ranking Member Watson Coleman for their strong leadership on this subcommittee, Mr.Bilirakis for his hard work, and, of course, Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson for their leadership on the Homeland Security committee.  On behalf of both Members and staff on this side of the aisle, we also wish Krista Harvey the best of luck in her future endeavors.  Mr.Speaker, H.4561 is commonsense legislation. This bill promotes the incorporation of innovative technology in airport screening capabilities. It does so by requiring DHS to stand up a third-party testing program to accelerate the evaluation of promising transportation security technologies, including 3D-imaging computer tomography, or CT technology.  CT scan technology holds great promise in enhancing the effectiveness of TSA screening operations insofar as transportation security officers would have the benefit of seeing a full 3D multicolor image of whatever the screener is inspecting and getting better detail about any suspect items.  Presently, TSA is testing a number of systems in the lab and in the field and has said that it expects to be able to begin deployment of this new tool to airports by early 2019.  Given the known ongoing terrorist threat posed by electronic devices, CT technology should be introduced into the airport environment in an expedited fashion. If done right, the establishment of a third-party testing program within TSA has the potential of getting innovative technologies into our transportation security systems quicker and improving the overall effectiveness of security screening. As such, I encourage my colleagues to support H.4561.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2018-01-09-pt1-PgH36.txt,1184,102ND ANNUAL PENNSYLVANIA FARM SHOW,2018.0,9.0,January

Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.4578, the Counter Terrorist Network  Mr.Speaker, I introduced H.4578, the Counter Terrorist Network Act, to support U.Customs and Border Protection's ongoing efforts to prevent individuals who pose a known threat to our country from entering the United  Over the years, the CBP has pushed out our borders through various programs, including international partnerships where officers are posted overseas.  The CBP's National Targeting Center, or NTC, uses the latest technology and analytical tools to identify threats and share that information with both domestic and international law enforcement partners.  The CBP vets foreign nationals traveling to the United States prior to arrival through the use of various sophisticated screening techniques. Time and again, we see terrorist acts carried out by individuals who were not on the Federal radar for terrorism.  In the 17 years since the September 11 attacks, we have made huge investments in this country in intelligence to better connect the dots about those risks.  My legislation seeks to ensure that the NTC is positioned to continue embedding its analysts in overseas operations so that individuals associated with terrorist and transnational criminal networks are prevented from operating with impunity.  H.4578 authorizes the NTC to continue building its collaborative intelligence and law enforcement partnerships to stay one step ahead of those individuals who wish to do us harm or commit other criminal acts.  The bill also authorizes CBP personnel to be posted abroad to perform critical preemptive operations to make sure the travelers and visa petitioners coming to our country are thoroughly screened and vetted.  Mr.Speaker, it is imperative for the DHS and its law enforcement partners to do everything practicable to screen and vet individuals before they arrive at our borders.  H.4578 underscores this imperative by authorizing the CBP to counter terrorist and criminal networks' efforts to infiltrate our borders in a way that has proven effective and adaptive.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.4578.  In closing, H.4578 is a bipartisan bill that was unanimously approved by the Committee on Homeland Security late last year.  The partnerships that the CBP has established to disrupt and dismantle terrorists and other criminal networks are valuable and merit congressional support.  H.4578 provides the CBP with statutory authority to continue these partnerships and it enables CBP personnel to be posted within different Federal and international entities in furtherance of their antiterrorism and homeland security missions.

Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong support of 140, the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act, a provision in the pending legislation that will end the National Labor Relations Board's alarming overreach into businesses operated on sovereign Tribal lands.  In March of 2017, the Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions, which I have the privilege of chairing, held a hearing on this legislation and heard from Native American business leaders on how the NLRB's arbitrary use of its jurisdiction had been harming businesses large and small on Tribal lands.  Leaders of the Native American community testified before the subcommittee on how the NLRB had meddled in the day-to-day operations and management of Native American businesses, often dragging out matters for years.  To make matters worse, the proceedings led by the NLRB are creating burdensome legal costs for businesses who are seeking to provide high-quality goods and services to Native American communities.  While members of the NLRB have changed and have begun to make great progress in reversing some of the Board's most damaging decisions, Congress needs to make it clear that Tribal labor sovereignty must be safe from future Washington overreach.  The Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act will clarify the National Labor Relations Act and reverse the troubling encroachment of the Federal Government on Tribal lands.  Congress has the opportunity here to stand up for sovereign rights of Native Americans and the businesses they own and operate on their lands.

Again, I think the key question here, as has been asked by so many colleagues: Are Native American Tribes government entities; are they sovereign? The only answer that we can respond with is: Absolutely, yes. They are sovereign. This is not an issue debating NLRB or It is going back to what we have established already that, in fact, a sovereign nation, just like a State or local government, is free from the intervention of  In this case, a sovereign nation has that right. Just as a reminder, over 150 Native American organizations have asked for this legislative effort to be achieved. Why? Because it was working fine up until 2004, and NLRB then came arbitrarily in--sometimes yes, sometimes not--intervening, but, ultimately, they were changing the system in place.  While we are moving back to letting the sovereignty reign in these Native American Tribes, yet we need to make it very clear for the future and not go back to what has precipitated this change.

1062,topic-id,532,"Mr.President, let me join my friend and colleague Senator We and some of the folks who are in the Gallery today were not sure if this day would ever come. Even in the U.Congress and the U.Senate, occasionally we get things right. And, boy oh boy, this is a day where we get things right on a civil rights basis, on a moral basis, and on a fairness basis.  To our friends who are representatives of some of the six Tribes who are finally going to be granted Federal recognition, we thank you for your patience, your perseverance, and your willingness to work with us and others.  This has become an issue over the last 20-plus years. Democrats and Republicans alike in Virginia have acknowledged the fact that these six Tribes, whose history predates any European settlement in this country, whose history goes back, as Senator Kaine mentioned, where they were recognized by the United Kingdom and recognized by the British Government when they controlled our country--but through a series of circumstances, in many cases abetted by a backwards-looking government earlier in the 20th[[Page S153]]century in Virginia that discriminated against these Native Americans in ways that were outrageous, where in many ways records that told of their proud history in our Commonwealth were destroyed after the Civil War in fires and courthouses--these Tribes have persevered.  Today, finally, they are going to be granted Federal recognition and the respect that goes with that Federal recognition, and they will be granted certain additional opportunities in terms of special education, housing grants, affordable healthcare services, and most importantly, the ability to recover important artifacts in their history.  As has been mentioned, this bill has already passed the Rob Wittman, a Republican Member, has been a champion.  Senator Kaine and I, both as Governors--in that role of Governor, one of the things that happen every day--every Thanksgiving day, these Tribes come in and, in effect, pay their taxes to the Commonwealth of While Virginia has recognized these Tribes for some time, every year when we would have this ceremony--one of the most moving ceremonies that I know I have participated in as Governor, and I think Senator Kaine and Senator Allen, who was also a champion on this issue before us--these Tribes would come in and say: When will the U.Government recognize our existence, our history, and our legacy?

64,topic-id,1333,"Mr.President, I rise today to discuss the nomination of John Rood for the position of Under Secretary of Defense for  I am concerned about the influence of different industries on key positions in government. Today, the specific problem under discussion is the influence of the defense industry over the The defense industry in America is powerful and profitable. The big five defense contractors together represented more than $100 billion in government contracts in 2016 alone. Think about that--5 corporations, $100 billion in taxpayer money in 1 year.  The defense industry in America is powerful. President Trump has stocked the Pentagon with an unprecedented number of nominees from defense industry. These nominees will oversee all those government contracts. They will influence which companies get billions in taxpayer dollars and what exactly those companies have to do to collect their checks. Without strict ethics rules and oversight, these nominees have the power to significantly influence the profitability of their former employers--the same companies that may, once again, be the nominees' future employers after they have finished their government service.  Mr.Rood may be a decent man, but he is the latest example of this trend. He will come to the Defense Department directly from Lockheed Martin International, where he was most recently a senior vice president. Lockheed is the biggest of the big five defense contractors. In 2016, the U.Government awarded the company over $40 billion in contracts. That was in 1 year.  According to his official bio submitted to the Senate Armed Services Committee, Mr.Rood's responsibilities included ``developing and executing strategies to grow Lockheed Martin's international business'' and ``managing marketing and government relations activities'' overseas. In other words, he was responsible for selling Lockheed's products to other countries, and it seems as though he was pretty good at it. Lockheed made over $12 billion--or more than one-quarter of its net sales--from its international customers in 2016.  Here is why that matters. According to Lockheed's most recent annual statement, the international division that Mr.Rood managed made about 66 percent of its sales to foreign customers through the Pentagon's Foreign Military Sales This is a program that allows for the sale of U.defense products overseas.  In that same report, Lockheed acknowledges that its foreign sales are ``highly sensitive'' to changes in regulations and ``affected'' by U.foreign policy. In other words, government officials influence whether Lockheed's foreign military sales barely break even or whether sales shoot through the roof and bring in billions of dollars for  If confirmed as Under Secretary of Policy, Mr.Rood will play a significant role in setting U.defense policy and overseeing the regulation of foreign military sales of those very same products to those very same countries. If he is given this job with no constraints, Mr.Rood could implement policies that increase Lockheed's profitability, whether that is in the interest of the American people or not.  Chairman McCain and I questioned Mr.Rood about this conflict of interest during his confirmation hearing. I asked him a simple yes-or-no question: Would he commit not to seek a waiver from his obligation to recuse himself from Lockheed Martin business, as required by his ethics agreement? That is all I asked.  He hemmed, he hawed, and finally made it clear that, well, no, he would not make that commitment.  So I asked him another simple question: Would he at least recuse himself from policy discussions about the sale of Lockheed Martin products through the Foreign Military Sales Program?  The answer was again clear. No, he would not make that commitment either.  I followed up with additional written questions. I asked: ``Mr.Rood, will you commit not to seek or accept a waiver from your recusal obligations under your ethics agreement?''  Here is his response. ``I am concerned that a commitment never to seek or accept a waiver could unnecessarily restrict my ability, if confirmed, to take an action that is important to U.national security and defense interests should a circumstance arise that is currently unforeseen.''  In other words, no, he would not commit to abide by his own ethics agreement. Just think for a minute about what that means. President Trump has nominated an industry executive to one of our most senior national security positions, and that individual is unwilling to steer clear of the conflicts of interest involved in doing that job.  I think the standard here should be pretty simple. If a nominee cannot do the job to which he has been nominated without seeking a waiver from his ethical obligations, then he should not have that job.  Mr.Rood is not the only Trump nominee with this problem. The President has nominated many other executives from industry to the most senior positions at the Department of The Deputy Secretary of Defense was previously a senior vice president at He now runs the Pentagon's budget process, including making the final call on which defense programs get funding and which do not.  The Secretary of the Army was a senior lobbyist for Raytheon and even ran Raytheon's political action committee. The Under Secretary of the Army, the 2 position, was also a vice president at The Deputy Chief Management Officer previously ran XCOR Aerospace, now a bankrupt developer of rocket engines and space launch systems. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics spent her career at Textron, an aerospace and defense contractor.  I could go on with this list. I don't doubt that many of these individuals are service-minded, and I know that many have also served honorably in government, both in and out of uniform. I also believe that a strong partnership between government and industry is important to our national defense.  Industry experience, in and of itself, does not disqualify someone from public service, but there must be balance. When too many top government jobs are filled by industry insiders, we risk corporate capture of the whole policy making process.  The overrepresentation of defense industry officials at the highest levels of the Department of Defense has real consequences. It suggests to the American people that only one viewpoint or one experience will dominate our policy making decisions. No outsiders, no one with a competing point of view need apply, and the revolving door between industry and government raises questions about who our government serves.  No taxpayer should have to wonder whether the top policy makers at the Pentagon are pushing defense products and foreign military sales for any reason other than the protection of the United States of No American should have to wonder whether the Defense Department is acting to protect the national interests of our Nation or the financial interests of the five giant defense contractors. No man or woman in uniform should have to wonder whether their civilian leaders are putting the private financial interests of themselves and their friends ahead of the safety and the interests of our military servicemembers.  The American people have a right to know who their government works for and that the senior leadership of the Department of Defense is putting our national security first. Everyone has a right to know that. The readiness and safety of our men and women in uniform is too important for any of us to have to ask those questions.  As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I will not vote to confirm any nominee from industry[[Page S19]]who does not agree to fully recuse himself or herself from matters involving their former employer for the duration required by their ethics agreement, without waiver and without exception. I think we owe our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines at least that much.  Because he will not make the commitment to abide by his own ethics agreement without waiver or exception, I will be voting against Mr.Rood as Under Secretary of Defense, and I urge other Senators to do the same.  I yield back.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Lee). The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

1056,topic-id,1279,"Mr.President, I rise today to discuss the Trump administration's recent proposal to expand offshore drilling to more than 90 percent of U.waters. This handout to Big Oil executives puts short-term corporate profits ahead of the long-term health and livelihood of America's coastal families, and it ignores the growing threat posed by climate change.  This administration is too weak-kneed to stand up for American families, too weak-kneed to say ``enough is enough'' when Big Oil executives demand more, and Big Oil executives keep demanding more because they don't like being told that any area is off limits.  Big Oil didn't like being told that the extraordinary natural, cultural, and historical value of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante made them off limits for fossil fuel development. So President Trump opened up much of the previously protected land for future drilling and mining.  Big Oil didn't like being told that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, one of America's last untouched expanses of wilderness, was off limits. So President Trump and this Republican Congress included a provision in the Republican tax bill to allow drilling for the first time in this pristine reserve.  Big oil didn't like being told that our coasts, which provide the homes and livelihoods for millions of Americans, are off limits. So the Trump administration, faithful as ever to whatever Big Oil wants, issued a proposed offshore drilling plan that would allow drilling in more than 90 percent of America's coastal waters. In doing so, the Trump administration is threatening the Atlantic coast with unwanted oil drilling for the first time in more than 30 years, threatening to introduce new drilling rigs to the Pacific coast for the first time in 30 years, threatening the eastern Gulf of Mexico with drilling for the first time in more than 10 years, and threatening to illegally reopen portions of the Arctic for drilling in areas that were permanently protected in 2016.  Our coasts are working waterfronts supporting hard-working families. This unprecedented expansion of offshore drilling endangers hundreds of thousands of jobs that depend on the health of our oceans. In Massachusetts, there is shipping in and out of Boston, fishing from Gloucester to New Bedford, and tourism and small businesses on the Cape and the The ocean is our lifeline, as it is for so many coastal States and towns around the country.  The multibillion-dollar coastal economy has been a key part of the American economy since our Nation's founding. Our coastal communities are united in opposition to an expansion of offshore drilling. They understand the risks that Big Oil imposes on them.  Our coastal communities remember when the BP-Deepwater Horizon oilspill occurred in 2010. One offshore oil well blew and caused the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig to explode, and what was the consequence? It killed 11 workers, injured 17 more, and unleashed one of the worst environmental disasters in human history. Nearly 5 million barrels of oil gushed into the ocean, contaminating more than 1,300 miles of coastline and nearly 70,000 square miles of surface water. Millions of birds and marine animals died from exposure to the oil and other toxic chemicals. The gulf fishing industry lost thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue, and the spill devastated the gulf's coastal tourism economy. The environmental and economic devastation hit working families and small businesses across the entire region.  A commission formed to investigate the BP oilspill concluded that there were ``such systematic failures in risk[[Page S152]]management that they place in doubt the safety culture of the entire [offshore drilling] industry.'' The Federal Government vowed to crack down on the offshore oil industry that had been cutting corners at the expense of worker safety and environmental safety. The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement studied ways to improve oil rig inspections and issued new rules of the road to try to prioritize safety.  But President Trump has abandoned that safety-first approach. He ignores the lessons of the BP oilspill. Instead, he listens to his Big Oil friends. Last month, the administration began rescinding key safety regulations designed to protect our coastlines from another BP spill disaster. I just want to give one example.  In 2016 the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement implemented new rules to require independent, third-party certification of safety devices on oil rigs. It is not a bad idea to get someone independent to take a look at oil rigs before people put their lives at risk and hundreds of thousands of people could lose their livelihoods if an accident occurred--not a bad idea. But the Trump administration has said that this commonsense approach is an ``unnecessary . . . burden'' on industry. Just to be clear, this so-called burden would amount to less than a penny on the dollar for an industry that already enjoys tens of billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies. That is less than a penny on the dollar to protect the livelihoods and maybe the lives of people living on our coasts.  The Trump administration's insistence on padding the pockets of Big Oil while small coastal towns are left carrying all the risk is a perversion of how government is supposed to work, but this is what happens when the Republican Senate allows leadership positions at the Department of the Interior to be filled with industry insiders who reward their past--and, in many cases, their future--employers, rather than serving the American people.  American families deserve forward-looking leadership that builds for the future and ensures that America will lead in the necessary fight against climate change, but President Trump thinks leadership is handing over management of our public resources to the Big Oil executives who are looking to stuff their pockets while they can, and he chooses to ignore the writing on the wall.  Our planet is getting hotter, and 16 of the last 17 years were the hottest on record. Our seas are rising at an alarming rate. Our coasts are threatened by furious storms that can sweep away homes and devastate even our largest cities. Many communities are just one bad storm away from complete devastation. Our naval bases are under attack, not by enemy ships but by rising seas. Our food supplies and our forests are threatened by an endless barrage of droughts and wildfires.  The effects of man-made climate change are all around us, and things will only continue to get worse at an accelerating pace if we don't do something about it. Will addressing climate change be tough? You bet it will. We will need to retool, to install offshore wind turbines instead of President Trump's offshore drilling rigs. But there is no country and no workforce in the world that is more willing and more able to tackle the challenges of climate change head-on than the United States of Yes, it is hard, but it is what we do. It is who we are.  The American people deserve leadership that knows the strength of the American people; leadership that believes in the innovative resolve of American workers ready to build clean energy infrastructure of the world; leadership that will deliver a clear message to the Big Oil executives, hell-bent on protecting their own short-term profits and who don't like being told that a place is off limits; leadership that will not chain our economy to the fossil fuels of the past; leadership that does not ignore the realities of climate change; and leadership that does not put our coastal communities at further risk of another devastating oilspill. The American people deserve leadership that works for their interests, not for the interests of Big  I yield to my colleague.

54,topic-id,2035,"Thank you, Mr.President, and happy new year to you.  For my 191st ``Time to Wake Up'' speech, I want to take the change of years to reflect on what 2017 meant for our carbon pollution of the Earth's climate and what 2018 may bring.  Our human use of fossil fuels continued to pour carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in 2017. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere now stands at almost 407 parts per million--the highest in human history and more than 100 parts per million above the safe range in which human development for millennia has flourished. Each year brings a new record concentration of CO2 in our atmosphere, and this will continue to worsen until the world weans itself off fossil fuels.  Of course, the contamination of our Earth and atmosphere by carbon pollution is matched by the contamination of our politics by unlimited and often hidden fossil fuel industry money, threats, and promises. When the accounting comes for what they have done to the Government of the United States, there will be a lot to answer for.  We are in a heck of a cold snap now, as the boundaries of normal weather get blown out in all directions by climate change, but the underlying, steady warming trend through all these new extremes of hot and cold and wet and dry is obvious.  Here in the United States, everyone in the lower 48, except for a few pockets up in the Northwest where things stayed fairly steady, has seen hotter than average temperatures. This represents hot. This represents cold. As you can see, most of the map matches the hot end. These are the mean temperature departures from average for January to November 2017.  Residents of the desert Southwest and of coastal Texas and Louisiana and much of the Southeast lived through their hottest year ever in 2017. Record warming is this color. You see it all through these areas, record warmest temperature.  Up in the Arctic, where temperatures are rising twice as fast as the rest of the globe, 2017 was the second hottest year ever. In Barrow, AK, the temperature rose so rapidly that computer algorithms kicked in and flagged the underlying data as suspect. The computer felt something must have gone wrong with the equipment and flagged the data as suspect. In fact, the readings were extraordinary, but they were real. That was the temperature.  We also saw a punishing onslaught of extreme weather in 2017, making it the most expensive disaster year in U.history, costing nearly $400 billion in damages. The United States had averaged fewer than six billion-dollar weather-related disasters a year. Between January and late October 2017, we experienced 16, which killed 282 people. Final estimates of the devastation during 2017 aren't complete. It may prove that 1,000 lost lives are attributable to Hurricane Maria and its aftermath in Puerto  The 2017 Atlantic hurricane season brought 17 named storms, 10 hurricanes, and 6 major hurricanes--those with average wind speeds exceeding 115 miles per hour.  In August, Hurricane Harvey roared ashore with winds over 130 miles per hour, dropping more than 60 inches of rain over the Houston and Port Arthur areas. Areas that aren't even on the[[Page S14]]flood maps found themselves flooded. Scientists agree that the unprecedented Texas deluge was only made possible by a warming atmosphere.  September brought Hurricanes Irma and Maria, which ravaged the Caribbean, including the U.Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Bahamas, as well as Much of Puerto Rico is still without power months after the storm. Abnormally warm waters in the tropical Atlantic fueled this punishing succession of storms.  Out West, 2017's high temperatures and low rainfall created conditions ripe for wildfire.  As of November, more than 6.4 million acres had burned--an area roughly the size of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts--making 2017 the third most active fire year in history.  In October, fast-moving wildfires laid waste to the California wine country, destroying almost 9,000 structures and killing more than 40 people. They were the costliest fires in U.history, bringing $9 billion in damage and $85 billion in economic loss.  In December, the Thomas fire exploded across coastal California, burning over 280,000 acres on its way to becoming the largest wildfire in California history. Notably, fire season should have been over by then in California, extinguished by December's customary winter rains, but not in 2017. Southern California had near-record low rainfall this winter, leaving vegetation desiccated and ready to ignite.  The evidence continued to pile up in 2017 of the connection between climate change and this extreme weather. The American Meteorological Society released a report showing that a majority of extreme weather and climatic events in 2016 were influenced by human-caused climate change. Indeed, the report found that the record average global temperatures in 2016, the record warm waters in the North Pacific, and the record temperatures in Asia simply would not have occurred without human-caused climate change.  We should not--as we too often do--overlook the oceans. The added carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that has run up the concentration to 407 parts per million alters the ocean's very chemistry. The added heat trapped by that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere gets picked up by the oceans, and it raises ocean temperatures. Warmer, more acidic seas destroy coral reefs, displace fisheries, and rise along populous shores. We measure all this already.  With all these alarm bells ringing, how did the United States respond in 2017 to the climate crisis? Our newly inaugurated President, Donald Trump, pointedly ignored the global political and scientific consensus that climate change poses a grave risk to our way of life--a prediction shared by our State universities, our National Laboratories, our major scientific associations, and even our military. President Trump nominated fossil fuel stooge Scott Pruitt to run the Environmental Protection For Energy Secretary, Trump nominated Rick Perry, who uses his office to promote fossil fuel, even announcing a plan to subsidize the coal industry after private meetings with big Trump coal company donors. Then there is Ryan Zinke, Trump's Secretary of the Interior, who decided to reopen public lands to coal mining and wants to roll back the rule limiting methane emissions from oil and gas drilling on our American public lands. It is literally the three stooges.  In May, President Trump announced America's withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, leaving the United States the only country on Earth to reject this landmark pact.  This is not leadership; this is its corrupted opposite. This administration is in hock to the fossil fuel industry like no other. Trump and his pals haven't drained the swamp; they have jumped right in with the biggest swamp monsters of all.  The U.Chamber of Commerce pays for a phony ``study'' claiming the Paris Agreement would cost jobs and economic growth; Trump pulls us out of The American Petroleum Institute complains about rules limiting methane emissions; Pruitt and Zinke try to roll them back. The Auto Alliance complains about fuel efficiency standards that the auto companies agreed to for American cars; Pruitt starts a project to water them down. Trump takes money by the shovelful from fossil fuel donors, and Pence dances on the Koch brothers' strings.  Yet 2017 offered reasons to remain optimistic. First is the explosion in renewable energy.  In 2017, renewables provided nearly 20 percent of electricity generation in the United As wind and solar costs fell, utilities across the country--even in red States--invested heavily in wind and solar. The renewable energy industry hit 3.3 million jobs--more than all fossil fuel jobs combined.  More good news: The leadership void left by the corrupted Trump administration was filled by thousands of State and local governments, businesses, academic institutions, and faith organizations which pledged to honor the Paris Agreement and reduce their carbon emissions. The States of California, Connecticut, Hawaii, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Virginia, Washington, and, I am proud to say, Rhode Island, have all declared that they are still in. Alaska announced it would meet its goals. What is more, California and Washington joined with Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Mexico to announce a plan to put a price on carbon to rein in emissions.  Businesses in 2017 exercised climate leadership in the marketplace. Leading asset manager BlackRock helped break the back of Exxon's and Occidental Petroleum's opposition to shareholder resolutions requiring them to report their climate risk to their shareholders. Multinational insurance firm AXA announced it would divest from its tar sands holdings and stop insuring pipelines that transport tar sands oil. Credit rating agency Moody's announced it will consider climate risk in rating coastal communities' municipal bonds. Companies like Microsoft and Unilever have their own baked-in, internal carbon price to help them reduce the carbon intensity of their operations.  Then there are the court battles. In 2017, multiple California municipalities sued fossil fuel companies under the State public nuisance law to seek help with the huge adaptation costs they face as sea level rises and extreme weather becomes more common.  State attorneys general in Massachusetts and New York defeated attempts by ExxonMobil to disrupt their fraud investigation into whether the company has been covering up what it knew about the risks posed by fossil fuels. By the way, at the very end of last year, we discovered there were reports through the American Petroleum Institute of the dangers of climate change from renowned scientists, including Edward Teller, going back to 1959. That is how long this coverup may have been going on.  So these various things that are happening among businesses, among States, among leaders, among other countries, among State attorneys general, and the courts give me hope for 2018. The renewable energy revolution will continue. It is unstoppable as prices drive the market their way. Forward-thinking business leaders will realize they must fight for good climate policy not just within their own companies but also here in They need to start showing up. America's courts will provide a forum for truth and disclosure--two things very scarce in climate denial--which fossil fuel companies, for that reason, have for years fiercely fought to avoid, but judges will insist on answers, plaintiffs are entitled to discovery, and lying in court gets you punished.  World and State and local leaders have picked up the mantle abandoned by Washington Republicans and, who knows, there is always hope. Republicans and Democrats in Congress just might reflect on 2017--on the hurricanes and the wildfires and all the changes already taking place in our home States; may reflect on what all of our home State universities are telling us; may look at where young and independent voters are on this issue; may heed the longstanding warnings of our U.military and maybe--just maybe--step out from under the bullying shadow of the fossil fuel industry and come together to solve our climate crisis.  Here are my 2018 resolutions: Let's put a price on carbon emissions so their release into the atmosphere reflects the true cost, as market theory says it should. This market-based solution is endorsed by leading thinkers and analysts on the left and the right.[[Page S15]]Let's also launch carbon capture and storage, including direct air capture. Let's launch carbon-free advanced nuclear technologies. Let's help America lead the world in the fight to stave off irreversible climate catastrophe with the new technologies that we are the world's best at developing. Finally, for coastal States like my home State of Rhode Island--which faced the irrevocable upward march of warming seas on a warming planet--let's make sure coastal communities have the resources they need to predict and prevent or prepare for the future that looms.  We owe this to our children and to our children's children. We owe it to all future generations that will look back at us and ask: When it was so obvious, how is it possible that the Government of the United States--how is it possible that this city on a hill--could do nothing but the bidding of the most conflicted industry on the planet?

In just 10 months, Americans will go to the polls to exercise their franchise, believing in the integrity of our democratic process. I am here today to discuss a threat to the integrity of that process, which is getting little attention here in Congress--nothing near what it deserves. We really ought to be acting with some expedition to safeguard our elections this Yet, instead, the effort is one of chasing down partisan investigative rabbit holes.  What ought to be our job?

I ask unanimous consent that an article entitled ``CIA's Pompeo says Russia and others trying to undermine U.elections'' be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.

802,topic-id,1516,"Mr.President, the Trump administration has come up with a name for its energy policy. The energy policy amounts to, basically, a big, fat cascade of gifts and special favors for oil, gas, and coal companies, which, in turn, make big political contributions. Trump officials call the policy ``energy dominance.'' More accurately, its name would probably be ``fossil fuel industry political dominance'' or one might actually call it ``ignorance dominance'' since the administration willfully ignores scientific understanding, basic economics, market theory, and even the warnings of our national security community.  The situation is not pretty from an environmental point of view. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt is busily trying to roll back rules that limit, for instance, emissions of methane, which is a more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. He is considering walking back fuel efficiency standards that save drivers money at the pump. President Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris climate accord and was promptly ignored by every other nation on  Last month, on the Interior Secretary's recommendation, Trump took big areas of the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monuments, in Utah, away from the public and opened them, instead, to big mining and oil and gas interests. Zinke has even proposed to open almost all U.coastlines to drilling by oil and gas companies. That includes drilling in protected areas in the Arctic, drilling up and down the Atlantic coast, expanded drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, and drilling along the Pacific coastline. The plan even includes Georges Bank and other crucial fishing grounds for New  This drilling scheme is likely dead on arrival. Republican Governors in New Jersey, Maryland, and Florida have all denounced the plan, as have Florida's Democratic and Republican It even runs into objections from the When President Obama considered opening the southern Atlantic coast to drilling 2 years ago, the Defense Department told the Obama administration that offshore energy development could interfere with military readiness and missile testing.  Given the dominance of fossil fuel political interests in this administration, the whole Trump energy dominance scheme, of course, neglects the warnings of our national security experts about climate change--climate change as an accelerant of global instability and conflict and climate change as a direct hazard to military installations and infrastructure, from the Naval Station Norfolk to faraway facilities like Diego Garcia in the Indian  In 2008, the National Intelligence Council reported more than 30 U.military installations facing risk from rising sea levels. A vulnerability assessment directed by the ``2010 Quadrennial Defense Review'' found that at around 3 feet of sea level rise, 128 military installations are at risk. Naturally, many of those belong to the Navy--indeed, 56 out of those 128. It is a significant share of the Navy's global footprint, totaling around $100 billion in value.  In 2011, the National Academy of Sciences report, ``National Security Implications of Climate Change for U.Naval Forces,'' recommended the continued review of how sea level rise and changes in storm frequency and intensity would affect coastal installations.  The National Defense Authorization Act, which we just passed, directs the Department of Defense to study how climate change will affect our most vulnerable military bases over the next 20 years, including ``the effects of rising sea tides, increased flooding, drought, desertification, wildfires, thawing permafrost,'' as well as how climate change may drive new requirements for combatant commanders.  The law includes a sense of Congress statement that ``climate change is a direct threat to the national security of the United States and is impacting stability in areas of the world both where the United States Armed Forces are operating today, and where strategic implications for future conflict exist.''  That is a sense-of-Congress statement that has passed this Republican-controlled Senate and the Republican-controlled House and was signed into law by this administration. Thank you to the author of this language, my friend and fellow Rhode Islander, Congressman Jim  Even the U.Government Accountability Office has engaged. The independent oversight agency issued a report titled, ``Climate Change Adaptation: DoD Needs to Better Incorporate Adaptation into Planning and Collaboration at Overseas Installations.''  I think that title gives away the punch line. Surveying our bases and installations across the world, GAO found that weather and climate change pose operational and budgetary risks to infrastructure. GAO recommended that DOD's climate planning efforts be expanded and increased; specifically, that the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force require defense installations to ``systematically track the costs associated with extreme weather events and climate change'' and that DOD better coordinate addressing climate change risks across different DOD installations.  This picture in the GAO report shows an unnamed military facility in the Pacific that has at times been cut off by flooding from access points to its munitions storage complex. If you have a military facility that can't get access to its munitions storage, you have a problem.  This is the picture of the flooded entryway, and this is the picture of the similar entryway under normal circumstances, able to be traveled.  A 2014 typhoon caused flash flooding here that trapped and imperiled American personnel. The point is, when climate change effects inhibit military base operations, defense preparedness requires climate preparedness.  Naval Station Norfolk, the largest Navy base in the world, is a poster child for the devastation that awaits our coastal military bases if we continue to pump out the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving sea level rise. A tide gauge operated at the base since 1927 has shown nearly 15 inches of vertical sea level rise so far. In the broader Hampton Roads metro area, home not only to the Navy but also to facilities of the Air Force, the Marine Corps, the Coast Guard, NASA, and NOAA, high tides are already regularly forcing seawater back through storm drains and flooding roadways.  DOD's own environmental research program, the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program, used Norfolk as its case study for sea level rise and extreme storm risks to coastal DOD installations. The study found a ``tipping point'' of about a half meter, 1.6 feet, of sea level rise, at which point ``the probabilities of damage to infrastructure and losses in mission performance increased dramatically.'' This is mapping of the flood hazard around Naval Station  This tipping point at which the mission performance losses increase dramatically is only a few decades away. Retired RADM David Titley, a former oceanographer and navigator of the Navy and leader of its Climate Change Task Force, said Norfolk has about 10 to 15 years to get serious about sea level rise in the region before ``we're really cutting it close.''  In 2017, CAPT Dean Vanderley, who leads infrastructure engineering at the Norfolk Naval base, admitted that sea level rise is ``something where I don't know that we've fully defined the problem. And we have definitely not fully defined the solution.''  Retired CAPT Joe Bouchard, a former base commander, told InsideClimate News that Naval Station Norfolk would need significant improvements to nearly every piece of infrastructure, from electrical and drainage systems to pier improvements, not to mention a seawall. He estimated this work could cost more than $1 billion and take as long as a decade to complete. That is just one base with $1 billion and a decade's worth of work. The DOD has identified over 128 bases that would be at significant risk with 3 feet of sea level rise. I think NOAA's current estimate is for 6 feet of global sea rise by the end of the century.[[Page S126]]  Even though our President is clueless about the basics of climate change, his Secretary of Defense understands and acknowledges the risks. In response to congressional questioning last year, Secretary Mattis said, ``Climate change is impacting stability in areas of the world where our troops are operating today. . . . It is appropriate for the Combatant Commands to incorporate drivers of instability that impact the security environment in their areas into their planning.''  Well, for political reasons, the White House can't acknowledge the problem so the recently published ``National Security Strategy'' totally disregards all of these recommendations. It will not even mention the forbidden words. We know these words are forbidden in the Trump administration because over and over again the memos leak out about people being told don't say the words ``climate change.''  Instead, with all these warnings from GAO, from senior military officials, from the National Intelligence Council, from a decade of Quadrennial Defense Reviews, and the testimony of Secretary Mattis--instead of listening to that, Trump parrots climate change denial talking points that come from the phony fossil fuel front groups. It is pathetic. Calling this deliberate ignorance ``energy dominance'' may be a fine fossil fuel flourish, but it is completely disconnected from actual safety, security, and military readiness--and don't get me started on what the fossil fuel industry's systematic corruption of our democracy means for America's fabled status as that ``city on a hill.''

While he spent his entire time in Congress in the minority party, he made a priority of seeking out opportunities and friends on both sides of the aisle.  Representative Winn served on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs for many years, ultimately becoming the ranking member on the committee. During his time working on the Foreign Affairs Committee, the United States grappled with major world events such as the Cold War, the Vietnam war, and conflict in the Middle In addition to his role on the Foreign Affairs Committee, he also represented the U.as a congressional representative to the United Nations, appointed by President In all of these roles, he was an excellent representative of our country to the rest of the world.  Larry took tremendous pride in serving the people of the Third Constituent service was always one of his top priorities, and he believed that solving problems for his constituents was one of his most important responsibilities. If someone had an issue with a Federal agency, Larry and his staff would make sure that it got resolved. This principle of valuing and serving each individual constituent in the district is one that I try to follow to this day trying to fill his shoes.  He lived a great life outside of Congress as well. Larry was an alumnus of the University of Kansas school of journalism and a proud I have even heard that he taught lifelong Wildcat current Senator Pat Roberts how to ``Wave the Wheat.''  When World War II began, he was unable to join the military due to the loss of one of his legs in an accident; however, he still served his country admirably by building airplanes in Kansas Other accomplishments of his included serving as the director of the National Association of Home Builders and the founding of the Kansas City, Kansas, Chamber's Congressional Forum, which I have the privilege of regularly addressing and is still going on today, starting its 50th year.  Larry was a mentor to me and so many aspiring elected officials in Kansas, dispensing valuable advice, and old war stories to help guide us along. He had a gift for humor and an ease with people that served him well in all of his endeavors. And most of all, he was a great man.  While we will mourn the loss of Larry, I take comfort knowing that he is now being reunited with Joan, his beloved wife of 73 years, who passed away in 2015. Larry also leaves behind a large and loving family. His legacy will live on through his four children--Larry Winn III, Douglas Winn, Janet Payne, and Cynthia Burr--plus 8 grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren.  Larry's legacy will live on in other public servants whom he mentored and inspired.

Today, we passed several bills about One was 676, calling out the Iranian regime to stop suppressing and oppressing their citizens who just want those things that are innate to all human beings on this planet, that we believe in as Americans, and that are those inalienable rights that come from our Creator: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  The Iranian people are staging legitimate protests to condemn the Iranian regime for corruption of the economy and funding of terrorist organizations while neglecting the basic needs of the Iranian citizens, only to have their protests in opposition of the corruption by the Iranian regime be shut down and crushed through unwarranted bloodshedding and arrests.  If you look at the Iranian regime over the last 30 years since they took control of Iran, it has been nothing but bloodshed and mayhem. And if you look at the conflicts that we have been involved in in the Middle East since the entry of Afghanistan and the Iraqi wars, if you look at our servicemen and -women who have been harmed in those battles or injured or died, 70 percent of those were caused by Ninety percent of those IEDs were supported and produced by the Iranian regime.  The people of Iran stood up in 2009. The administration of the United States at that time refused to back the Iranian people who wanted those basic rights that we just talked about: freedoms and liberties.  Our Nation was founded on the idea that every individual is granted three basic rights: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And again, we, as Americans, believe in these inalienable rights. I find it appalling that the Iranian regime is using deadly force in order to deny the Iranian people their basic freedoms.  We are in the 21st century in the world, and you see a clear divide: the Western ideologies that believe in these God-given rights that we have, and then you see the regimes and dictatorships around the world that are suppressing the very innate abilities that we are all born with. They are trying to suppress these innate abilities. By doing that, they do it through intimidation, coercion, torture, death.  The leader of the IRGC came out in a statement, and it is in Ed Royce's resolution that we voted on today, 676, that said they will investigate it, they will bring it to an end, and they will quash these protests and it will be done with. So that is the intent of the Iranian regime, to bring this to an end through force because they fear free-thinking people.  We are so blessed in our country of having the ability to speak out, to be able to protest peacefully, to assemble peacefully; and that is something I think sometimes we, as Americans, take for granted. This is something that all you have to do is look at what is going on around the world to see a despotic regime that is afraid of empowering its people.  The Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, must be recognized for what he is: the dictator of an oppressive regime which once again showed the world its true colors by its horrific response to the peaceful and legitimate protests that began on December 28, that saw thousands in prisons, with the leaders being threatened with death, and over two dozen having been killed.  I want to send the message that we, the United States, support the rights of those brave Iranians who are peacefully protesting the oppressive Iranian regime; and they are peacefully protesting, again, for the right to pursue life, liberty, and happiness.  Again, I want to thank Mr.Garrett for putting this on and thank him for allowing me to participate.

379,topic-id,181,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in favor of this resolution demonstrating our support for the Iranian people's cry for democracy.  On December 28, 2017, tens of thousands of Iranians courageously poured into the streets to protest the brutality of President Rouhani's regime. Instead of caring for its own people, the Iranian regime focuses all of its energy on suffocating their cry, murdering protestors, while choking off communication via the internet and social media apps.  We have been down this road before. This is our second chance.  The Iranian people, smothered by their own government, look to us, and, instead of the chill of silence, this time, they are rightfully met with the full, immediate, and resounding support of the United We stand in solidarity with millions of Iranians desperate for support to help them turn the tide in Tehran and all throughout  The people of Iran will be losing a great champion with the retirement of Chairman Royce, who has served over the course of the last three terms as chairman of our committee. The fight continues.  Mr.Speaker, I support this resolution.  ",CREC-2018-01-09-pt1-PgH51.txt,2261,SUPPORTING THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE OF IRAN TO FREE EXPRESSION,2018.0,9.0,January
