        ABSENCE OF PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP ON RUSSIAN AGGRESSION

  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise with deep concern in the wake of 
President Trump's failure to levy economic sanctions on more of 
Russia's oligarchs, allowing Putin's repressive regime its continued 
illegal aggression on Ukraine.
  In his State of the Union, the President used the single word, 
``Russia.'' That was it. And then he decided to call it ``a rival.''
  A rival? How about enemy of liberty? How about that?
  In stark contrast to every other President going back to Ronald 
Reagan, read what wasn't said in this State of the Union. This raises 
serious questions as to why President Trump is letting Russia off the 
hook.
  Why would President Trump reject the advice of all U.S. intelligence 
offices, including that of his own CIA Director, especially when the 
United States intelligence agencies know Russia interfered massively in 
our elections and European elections, our most important alliance, and 
uses its military assets to undermine liberty?
  Thankfully, Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team seeks answers, but 
Trump's most troublesome financial connections with Russia-linked 
investors and intermediary banks remain questions that need to be 
answered.
  Speaking as co-chair of the Congressional Ukrainian Caucus, I urge my 
colleagues to act in the national interest and in the absence of 
Presidential leadership on Russian aggression.
