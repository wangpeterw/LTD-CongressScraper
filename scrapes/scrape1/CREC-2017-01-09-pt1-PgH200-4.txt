                   FAKE NEWS INCLUDES CLIMATE CHANGE

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, a good example of fake news appeared 
in Sunday's New York Times. It is a column headlined, ``As Trump Denies 
Climate Change, These Kids Die.'' This may be a new high--or maybe a 
new low--for climate alarmists and their exaggerations.
  Two facts: first, most severe and persistent droughts occurred 
decades ago, not recently; and second, there is little connection 
between climate change and extreme weather, in general, according to 
numerous studies.
  Climate alarmists tend to ignore scientific evidence and encourage 
media hype, and, of course, the liberal media is all too willing to go 
along. Climate discussions should be based on good science, not 
politically correct science.
