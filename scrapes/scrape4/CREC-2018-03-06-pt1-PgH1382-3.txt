                    HONORING CALIFORNIA FIREFIGHTERS

  (Mr. CARBAJAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, last December, the Thomas fire raged 
through Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties, eventually becoming the 
largest wildfire in California's history. Our heroic firefighters left 
their families behind during the holiday season to fight tirelessly on 
the front lines, saving homes, businesses, and lives.
  A few short weeks later, our first responders were called back into 
action when heavy rains brought debris flows that tragically claimed 
the lives of 23 people in Montecito. As residents were evacuating, 
these brave firefighters ran towards the disaster without a second 
thought, pulling people out of the mud and debris for days afterward.
  I would like to thank all our first responders who so bravely 
answered the call of duty in these difficult conditions.
  Mr. Speaker, with us here today are firefighters from IAFF Local 
2046, CAL FIRE Local 2881, and the Ventura County Professional 
Firefighters Association, and the California Professional Firefighters.
  I thank them all for their unparalleled level of service to keep our 
loved ones on the central coast safe.
  Thank you for your service.
