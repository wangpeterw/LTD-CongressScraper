                            VOTE EXPLANATION

 Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I was necessarily absent due to a 
flight cancellation out of my control when the Senate voted on the 
motion to invoke cloture on Executive Calendar No. 370.
  On this vote, had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on the 
motion to invoke cloture on Executive Calendar No. 370.
