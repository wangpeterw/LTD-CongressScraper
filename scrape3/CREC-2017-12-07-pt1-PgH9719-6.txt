                              GOP TAX BILL

  (Ms. ROSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROSEN. Mr. Speaker, this week, Republicans are continuing to work 
behind closed doors to put finishing touches on their disastrous tax 
bill that will hurt countless families in Nevada and across this 
country.
  Let's be clear: This monstrosity of a bill would eventually slam many 
of Nevada's hardworking families with a tax increase, while adding more 
than $1 trillion to our national debt. To make matters worse, the 
Senate version of this bill would spike healthcare premiums and cause 
millions to lose their healthcare coverage. Also, billionaires and 
giant corporations can receive an unnecessary tax cut.
  Mr. Speaker, Americans can clearly see that this is a bill that is 
just a giveaway to wealthy campaign donors and giant corporations at 
the expense of hardworking families. We need a Tax Code that is focused 
on putting money back in the pockets of all families, not one that 
creates even worse wealth and income inequality--and certainly not one 
that puts profits before people.
