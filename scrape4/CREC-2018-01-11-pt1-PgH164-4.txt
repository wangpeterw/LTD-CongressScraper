                  RECOGNIZING JAVASCOUTS ROBOTICS TEAM

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the JavaScouts, a 
youth robotics team from my hometown of New Hartford, New York.
  In December, the JavaScouts competed in the regional qualifier for 
the FIRST Tech Challenge at Sauquoit High School, where they qualified 
for the regional championship in New York.
  The JavaScouts also received the FIRST Tech Challenge Inspire Award, 
which is presented to the team that judges feel acted as a positive 
role model to other teams and embraced the challenge of this program.
  I would like to extend my congratulations to the JavaScouts team 
personally: Keegan Birt, Liam Evans, Kyle Grover, Ari Sprague, Kyle 
Tuttle, Jimi Wadnola, and Leon Zong.
  I wish the JavaScouts continued success as they move forward to the 
regional championship. I take great pride and it is a great honor in 
representing these young constituents who place such an emphasis on 
determination, ingenuity, and education in achieving these many worthy 
goals.
