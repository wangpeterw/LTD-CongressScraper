       CLINTON HIGH SCHOOL HONORED AS A LEADER IN SOUTH CAROLINA

  (Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I want to take a moment to 
congratulate Clinton High School in my home county of Laurens, South 
Carolina, for being named one of the Best High Schools by U.S. News & 
World Report's school rankings.
  Congratulations to my friend Maureen Tiller, the teachers, the 
students, and the parents. This really is an honor that goes to all of 
you for all of your hard work that you put forth in educating the next 
generation of leaders in South Carolina.
  U.S. News compiled and analyzed data from over 22,000 public high 
schools, and Clinton High was recognized as a leader in South Carolina.
  I want you to know how proud I am of you for all that you have 
accomplished and wish you the best as you continue to work to educate 
our children.
  So congratulations, Principal Tiller, on getting this great 
recognition.
  Now, as a side note, both of my sons, Graham and John Philip, have 
graduated from Clinton High. My third son is currently a sophomore at 
Clinton High. He is also all-region and all-State for the Red Devils 
boys soccer team.
  Congratulations to Parker and Clinton High.
