                    RECOGNIZING NATIONAL POLICE WEEK

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize police officers and our 
law enforcement community during National Police Week.
  It is these brave men and women who put their lives on the line every 
day for us and for our communities; and it is a special time to 
remember those who have fallen in the line of duty who have actually 
made the ultimate sacrifice. Police officers from around the country 
are gathering this week at the national memorial as a part of that 
remembrance.
  We must also never forget that serving in law enforcement is a family 
affair and requires strength and dedication from loved ones as well.
  As a member of the Law Enforcement Caucus, I know that our 
communities are better served, and served well, thanks to the 
unwavering commitment from our police officers who take on countless 
risks for other people and not just themselves. The badge is not just a 
symbol of authority but one of selflessness and commitment to the 
greater good.
  Mr. Speaker, we owe so much to these police officers for the many 
difficult decisions and situations that they face every day, and we 
thank them for keeping us safe.
