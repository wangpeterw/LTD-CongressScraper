                      PENN STATE'S THON FUNDRAISER

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate 
one of Penn State's finest events, THON, a 46-hour dance marathon. THON 
began in 1977. It is the largest student-run philanthropy in the world, 
and it raises money to fight pediatric cancer. THON ran from February 
17 to 19 as dancers stood for 46 hours without sleep at Bryce Jordan 
Center.
  THON is a year-round fundraising and awareness campaign for the fight 
against childhood cancer, with proceeds going directly to Four 
Diamonds, which benefits the Penn State Children's Hospital in Hershey, 
Pennsylvania. Four Diamonds ensures that families who are battling 
pediatric cancer are not faced with any costs, allowing them to fully 
focus on the needs of their child. THON 2017 raised more than $10 
million, and since its inception, THON has raised more than $146 
million.
  This truly is an event like none other. It shows the power of what 
Penn State students can do and have been doing to cover the treatment 
costs for pediatric cancer patients as well as support cancer research. 
Thank you to all the Penn State students who take part in this 
spectacular event.
