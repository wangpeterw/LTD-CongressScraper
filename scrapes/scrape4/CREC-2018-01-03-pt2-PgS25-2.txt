                 MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 4667

  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I understand that there is a bill at 
the desk, and I ask for its first reading.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bill by title for the 
first time.
  The legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (H.R. 4667) making further supplemental 
     appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, 
     for disaster assistance for Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and 
     Maria, and calendar year 2017 wildfires, and for other 
     purposes.

  Mr. McCONNELL. I now ask for a second reading and, in order to place 
the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to 
my own request.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection having been heard, the bill will be 
read for the second time on the next legislative day.

                          ____________________
