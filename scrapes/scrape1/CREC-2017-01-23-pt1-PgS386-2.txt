                  REMEMBERING JAMES H. ``JIM'' SKAGGS

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I wish to remember the life of 
James H. ``Jim'' Skaggs, a Louisville resident, who passed away in 
December at the age of 94. To his family, his church community, and to 
those who knew him, Jim was a man known for his kindness, patience, and 
compassion. As a member of this Nation's Greatest Generation, he was an 
example of commitment and devotion.
  Like so many other brave men and women, Jim answered his country's 
call in the Second World War. Kentucky has a proud history of military 
service, and Jim is a fine model of that tradition. As a staff sergeant 
in the 755th Railway Battalion, U.S. Army Transportation Corps in 
England, France, and Belgium, Jim showed the deep passion he held for 
his country.
  Jim leaves behind a legacy of love and family. His daughter Debbie is 
my personal friend and archivist. If it is possible to measure a father 
by his daughter, Jim will surpass all standards. She is impressive in 
her own right, and she is surely a reflection of him. He will be 
remembered fondly. Elaine and I send our deepest condolences to Jim's 
family and friends.
