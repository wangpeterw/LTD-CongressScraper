  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
  Stated for:
  Mr. HURD. Mr. Speaker, I was unable to vote on the bills and 
subsequent amendments this afternoon due to travel to Sutherland 
Springs, Texas, to meet with the victims, their families, and the first 
responders of the attack that took place on November 5th, 2017. Had I 
been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 621.


                          personal explanation

  Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been 
present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 619, ``yea'' on 
rollcall No. 620, and ``yea'' on rollcall No. 621.

                          ____________________
