                  NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL

 Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, due to ongoing and urgent recovery 
efforts from Hurricane Irma, which devastated many parts of Florida, I 
am staying in my State to assess the damage and help marshal the full 
capacity of recovery resources available to us. Congress

[[Page S5477]]

has passed authorizations for use of military force, AUMFs, that the 
President is using to fight the war on terror and conduct 
counterterrorism operations against our enemies. This includes the 
Islamic State, which the State Department recently reaffirmed is guilty 
of genocide, and other terrorist groups that continue to pose grave and 
persistent threats to the United States and our allies.
  Paul amendment No. 871 would repeal these critical congressionally 
passed AUMFs, so I therefore oppose this amendment.
  (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered 
to be printed in the Record.)
