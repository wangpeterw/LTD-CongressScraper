                   FISCAL YEAR 2018 REPUBLICAN BUDGET

  (Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the Republican 
spending plans.
  Republicans in Congress have passed a tax giveaway to corporations 
and left behind everyday Americans. Now Republicans are refusing to 
address constituents' urgent priorities: from children's healthcare to 
disaster relief, to certainty for DREAMers, and more.
  They refuse to bring a clean reauthorization for the Children's 
Health Insurance Program--CHIP--which serves 9 million children and 
370,000 pregnant women. They want to drastically cut other healthcare 
funding while saying they support CHIP.
  Republicans are also planning to cut Medicare and Medicaid. These 
cuts would be devastating for millions of people who depend on Medicaid 
for essential health services: children, seniors, low-income 
individuals, and people with disabilities.
  Mr. Speaker, this budget will hurt children, women, and all Americans 
just to pay for a tax giveaway, and it is simply unacceptable.
