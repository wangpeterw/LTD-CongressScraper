                              H. Res. 151

       Whereas the death of the late Minority Leader of the House 
     of Representatives, Robert H. ``Bob'' Michel, on February 17, 
     2017, has created not only a personal loss to his family, his 
     many colleagues, and friends, but also a great loss to the 
     Nation;
       Whereas Bob Michel led a remarkable life, personally 
     blessed with four children, eight grandchildren, and two 
     great grandchildren;
       Whereas Bob Michel was born and raised in Peoria, Illinois;
       Whereas as a young man, Bob Michel joined the United States 
     Army at the height of World War II, landing on the beaches of 
     Normandy and fighting across Europe through the Battle of the 
     Bulge, earning two Bronze Stars, four Battle stars, and the 
     Purple Heart for his wounds;
       Whereas Bob Michel returned home from Europe, graduated 
     from Bradley University, and embarked on a career in public 
     service that would span 44 years;
       Whereas Bob Michel was then elected to Congress, going on 
     to serve honorably for 38 years representing Peoria and much 
     of Central Illinois with great distinction, and was chosen by 
     his colleagues to serve them as House Minority Whip, and for 
     14 years as the elected Republican Minority Leader of the 
     House of Representatives;
       Whereas Bob Michel's formidable legislative skills were 
     invaluable in enacting key initiatives of President Reagan 
     and President George H.W. Bush on behalf of the people;
       Whereas Bob Michel will be long remembered by all for his 
     strong dedication to responsible public service and his love 
     of the people of the United States;
       Whereas Bob Michel conducted himself as a leader with a 
     commitment to civil discourse, personal dignity, political 
     consensus, and adherence to fundamental human values;
       Whereas Bob Michel's public service culminated in the award 
     of the Nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential 
     Medal of Freedom; and
       Whereas in the House of Representatives and in his life, 
     Bob Michel's uncommon decency and generosity of spirit were 
     evident to all who knew and worked with him: Now, therefore, 
     be it
       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
       (1) honors the life, achievements, and distinguished public 
     service of Bob Michel; and
       (2) expresses its condolences to his family on his passing.

  The resolution was agreed to.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
