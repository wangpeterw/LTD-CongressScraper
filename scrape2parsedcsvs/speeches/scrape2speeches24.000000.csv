2952,topic-id,320,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.  I proudly stand today in support of H.1808, the Improving Support for Missing and Exploited Children  This bipartisan legislation reflects both Democrats' and Republicans' desire to protect and care for our greatest resource: our children.  In my home State of North Carolina, the trafficking of young women has become an epidemic. There were 181 human trafficking cases reported in North Carolina in 2016, and Charlotte was home to more of them than anywhere else.                              {time}  1430  That figure gave us the dishonor of being ranked among the top 10 States in the Nation in the number of trafficking reports, and that doesn't even account for those children who have not yet been identified as victims of this shameful practice.  In North Carolina, lawmakers have sponsored efforts to establish pilot programs to help victims and train law enforcement to recognize the signs of trafficking. It is time Congress does its part and passes H.1808 to support States in their efforts.  This bill would improve efforts by both law enforcement and the general public to combat trafficking, and it would enhance the identification and location of missing children and their abductors.  It would protect children from being victims to online predators and keep a promise that was made 33 years ago, when Congress first passed the Missing Children's Assistance Act and we vowed to assist the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children in protecting and recovering our missing and vulnerable youth.  I am a parent, I am a grandparent, Mr.Speaker, and I am a concerned member of my community; and my district and my State have been torn apart by human trafficking.  This is an opportunity for us to come together as Americans and support an initiative that could save lives. I urge my colleagues to pass H.1808 and prove that we can all put politics aside when it comes to protecting our children.

The text of the amendment is as follows:       Add, at the end of the bill, the following (and amend the      table of contents accordingly):     11. AFFIRMATIVE       (a) In General.--In the case of a health care lawsuit, it      shall be an affirmative defense to any health care liability      claim alleged therein that the defendant complied with a      clinical practice guideline that was established, published,      maintained, and updated on a regular basis by an eligible      professional organization and that is applicable to the      provision or use of health care services or medical products      for which the health care liability claim is brought.       (b) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:[[Page H5282]]       (1) Clinical practice guideline.--The term ``clinical      practice guideline'' means systematically developed      statements based on the review of clinical evidence for      assisting a health care provider to determine the appropriate      health care in specific clinical circumstances.       (2) Eligible professional organization.--The term      ``eligible professional organization'' means a national or      State medical society or medical specialty society.

3132,topic-id,485,"Mr.Chairman, I first want to commend Chairman Goodlatte and Congressman King and others who worked on H.1215, the Protecting Access to Care Act, which aims to address the real problem of junk lawsuits in the context of medical care.  Seventy-five percent of the doctors will face a malpractice lawsuit over the course of their careers, and many of these claims are frivolous, which drives up the cost of healthcare, encourages defensive medicine, and contributes to the Nation's severe shortage of doctors and nurses, especially in high-risk areas such as obstetrics, neurosurgery, and emergency medicine.  We need to enact sensible medical malpractice reform, and given the clear Federal interest in reducing taxpayer costs wherever Federal policy affects the distribution of healthcare, I support H.1215.  However, H.1215 does not go far enough to discourage the practice of defensive medicine, the provision of health services, tests, and procedures designed to shield the provider from legal liability but which may not be medically necessary or in the best interests of the patient.  Defensive medicine is a major driver of healthcare costs and also reduces the quality of patient care.                              {time}  1615  In that spirit, I offer this amendment, which would expand upon the reforms in H.1215, to protect physicians from frivolous lawsuits, while promoting the practice of evidence-based medicine to lower costs and improve healthcare quality.  My amendment offers a legal safe harbor in the form of an affirmative defense for defendants who can show that they adhered to clinical practice guidelines in their area of medical practice. Rather than Washington-based care, the guidelines would be developed by the physician community-based on the best available scientific evidence. This allows doctors to focus on practicing medicine and improves healthcare quality by encouraging the practice of evidence-based, not defensive medicine.  A New England Journal of Medicine study on clinical practice guidelines and tort reform stated that ``Safe harbor rules hold promise for realigning legal incentives with good medical practice and promoting fast uptake of proven modes of care.'' By promoting adherence to clinical practice guidelines that are already maintained by medical specialty groups, this amendment would encourage physicians to provide higher quality care, while reducing medical errors and waste.  Several States have already adopted safe harbor legislation and have significantly lowered the length and costs associated with medical malpractice cases. My amendment would build on the success of State safe harbor laws by expanding it to a national level, while not infringing on States' ability to implement additional tort reform.  Americans deserve healthcare reform that will help lower the cost of care and protect the sacred doctor-patient relationship. The current reforms within H.1215 are an important first step to reducing the high costs of medical malpractice claims. My amendment will further strengthen this legislation to promote affordable evidence-based patient care, reduce defensive medicine, and allow health professionals to focus on patients' actual needs.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-06-28-pt1-PgH5263.txt,2238,COUNTERING IRAN'S DESTABILIZING ACTIVITIES ACT OF 2017,2017.0,28.0,June
3135,topic-id,55,"Mr.Chairman, in brief response to my friend from Tennessee, the safe harbor legislation would not supplant the standard of care, but it would allow for evidence-based medicine to improve healthcare quality. Those standards would be developed by local doctors participating in their medical societies.  Mr.Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr.King), my friend.

2920,topic-id,1842,"Mr.President, Republicans continue to come to the floor to talk about the urgent need that we have to reform America's healthcare system. The reason we continue to do this is because the pain of ObamaCare is getting worse.  We are seeing it all across the country. The healthcare system in this country has been devastated by a law known as Every weekend, at home, I hear, as Republicans all around the country hear, about the costs that have been spiraling out of control--double on the ObamaCare exchange, we hear across the country, but in many States even more than that.  In Wyoming it has gone up 107 percent over the past 4 years. We also hear from people at home about their specific premiums on the exchange and how they are worried about them going up even higher next year. Not only have they doubled, but they are worried about them going up again. Just this past week, we have heard stories about numbers that have been requested for increases in New Hampshire, New York, and We are hearing it all across the country. I hear it every weekend in  People are very concerned about the impact that ObamaCare has had on their lives personally. Many will tell you that they believe that the insurance they bought under ObamaCare has been of less value than they would have liked, and many people are not buying because they see that the value is not there.  When we hear about these increasing rates and we hear about the fact that it is going to only get worse, people are saying: The cost has gone up; maybe we ought to try to shop around, and maybe we can find more choices.  The problem is the choices are going down as well. Insurance companies are continuing to drop out of the ObamaCare plan. So people around the country are having fewer and fewer choices under  Last Friday, a headline in the Wall Street Journal read: ``Another Area Loses Last ACA Insurer.'' It is not just that they have fewer choices. Now we are looking at places in the country where there are no choices.  In Wyoming we had two. One of the companies went out of business. We are down to one. That company has lost money. The question is, How long will they stay? How much higher will they have to raise rates under ObamaCare? Will we be at a point where the counties in our State, instead of having one, have none?  This article in the Wall Street Journal last week says: ``Washington state has no insurer willing to offer Affordable Care Act plans next year,'' in some of its 39 counties.  A few days earlier, we heard the news from people in a similar situation in There are 18 counties in Ohio next year with no plans offered. So with ObamaCare you are going to get a subsidy, but there is no place to use the subsidy. You have no choices. But we warned from the beginning about the ObamaCare death spiral, and we are seeing it happen here. For those people living in those counties in Ohio and those counties in Washington, the insurance death spiral is complete. There is no insurance market. There is no one offering to sell insurance because of the damage done by ObamaCare to the insurance market in the United  We have millions of people across the country who have been harmed by the higher costs and the fewer and fewer choices available under They have lost the coverage they had. Care is not available to them in the sense that their insurance is not available to them. The options are shrinking all across the country and have completely gone away in certain places.  Now, someone who is living with a preexisting condition is so much of the debate, and I hear my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who come to the floor, talk about preexisting conditions. If you are someone in any of these counties and you have a preexisting condition and the company you buy your insurance from goes out of business and there is no one to sell you insurance in the county in which you live and you have a preexisting condition, under ObamaCare, you are out of luck. You may get a subsidy, but you cannot buy a policy. Under ObamaCare, preexisting conditions are not covered if there is no one available to sell a policy, and we are seeing more and more counties falling into that situation.  There was almost a full-page map in the New York Times earlier this week of the number of counties across the country in which there are only two insurance companies selling or one or none at all. That is the problem we have all across the country.  We predicted this. This disaster of ObamaCare was entirely predictable. Republicans came to the floor as it was being debated, as it was being discussed, as Democrats were voting on it, and we continued to point out that we would be in a situation of free fall, and we are now in that situation with ObamaCare.[[Page S3481]]  Republicans know what we need to do. We are trying to stabilize the market. We want to protect people with preexisting conditions. We want to lower the cost of premiums. We do not want the rug to be pulled out from anyone, and we are trying to reform Medicaid in a way that provides long-term stability to that program.  Finally, after all of these years of talking about the problems with ObamaCare and with so many Democrats having blinders on, wanting to just apply a blank check to the problem and say: ``More money. More ObamaCare,'' finally, now some Democrats are saying, yes, that there are problems with The problem is that their solution is the wrong solution.  What they want to do is make the problem even bigger, and we have seen it in California this past year. Actually, just a week ago, the California State Senate--and it is a Democratic-controlled Senate--after calls from people throughout their political party and at their political convention a couple of weeks ago, said that we know what to do--single-payer healthcare. That is what they proposed, and it passed along party lines.  Who is that single payer? It is the American taxpayer. The Democratic-controlled Senate in California passed a single-payer healthcare bill. From cradle to grave, everyone is covered. Anything you need, you have it, says  I served in the Wyoming State Legislature--and I served at the Presiding Officer's level in the legislature--where we did something called a fiscal note. What is something like this going to cost? They did the same thing in The fiscal note was $400 billion a year. Put it in perspective. How does that fit into the State budget? The general fund for the State of California for a year, when they have just passed a bill for $400 billion, is only $190 billion. The total cost of what the State Senate of California passed is twice the entire general fund for the State of In other places, when they have said that they have needed a single-payer plan, as they have done in Canada and England, what has happened is that it has led to longer lines, waiting periods, and the rationing of care. That is not what the American people want, but it is what the Democratic Party is proposing and actually voted for in the State of  This was a headline in the New York Times just the other day, ``The Single-Payer Party? Democrats Shift Left on Health Care.''  The article goes on to read in terms of the Democrats:       Cast out of power in Washington and most State capitals,      Democrats and activist leaders seeking political redemption      have embraced an unlikely-seeming cause: an actual government      takeover of health care.  This was from the New York Times about what has passed in California and what Democrats around the country are proposing.  In the U.House of Representatives, which is right down the hall of this building, a majority of the Democrats has cosponsored legislation to go to a single-payer healthcare plan--for the majority of the Democrats in the House, a single-payer healthcare plan.  That is not what hard-working Americans want. That is not what struggling small business owners want. That is not what the people of Wyoming want. The people at home already cannot afford to pay for the insurance that has been mandated that they buy under the Obama healthcare law. They cannot afford the penalties. They cannot afford the insurance, and they want healthcare--care they need from doctors they choose at lower costs.  How in the world is this country going to afford higher taxes to pay for the Democrats' single-payer fantasy? Yet that is what they are looking at in To double the cost of the State's general fund, you are talking about raising taxes as well as, probably, eliminating some services. Would you have to eliminate teachers, firefighters, public safety workers? Those are the things that you have to wonder about when they make such an irresponsible decision in the California State  Ronald Reagan, I think, said it best when he said that you cannot be for big government and big taxes and a big bureaucracy and still be for the little guy. Ronald Reagan had it right. Now Washington Democrats want to ignore that.  Small business owners know what Democrats in Washington, DC, and in California refuse to acknowledge right now. The small business owners know it, and the Democrats will not acknowledge it. People around the country realize ObamaCare is not working. It is why they elected a Republican House, a Republican Senate, a Republican President--because of the pain caused to the American people under the Obama healthcare law, which mandated that everybody buy a government-approved product. The costs have gone up, and the choices have gone down. People have been left in a state in which this is not what works for them.  So here we are. We are on the cusp of coming out with a Republican plan. We are trying to do it with our legislation. We are writing a reform plan to reduce healthcare costs and improve access to insurance without the mandates and the restrictions we have seen under the Obama healthcare law.  I think Democrats should join us in finding the best solutions for the American people.

3214,topic-id,509,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.2834, the Partnership Grants to Strengthen Families Affected by Parental Substance Abuse  This piece of legislation is responsive to countless pleas of youth and families seeking necessary assistance and support without fracturing critical family bonds and relationships.  The majority of children who are removed from home are actually removed for neglect and not physical or sexual abuse. Over 60 percent of children are removed for neglect, and neglect is secondary to substance abuse, mental health issues, and abject poverty.  In the 1990s, when the crack cocaine epidemic hit, we didn't understand much about addiction, and so we were angry. We punished the mothers. We imprisoned the mothers. We took the children away, and we didn't realize that actually not addressing the underlying substance abuse issue would really be more harmful to the children than removing them and putting them into foster care.  Now that we are experiencing another epidemic related to drugs, both with meth and with heroin, at least our knowledge base has grown a lot. We have drug courts. We have evidence-based treatments. We have a lot of ways that we can address families.  One of the things that we have learned is that, if you can put the entire family in treatment, then, that way, one, the parents are not separated from their children, the children can get help, and the parents can get help as well.  What often happens if you remove the child from the parent is that you set the parent up to relapse or to never actually go into treatment because they will cycle into depression, and they will continue their cycle of addiction.[[Page H4968]]  We have had many children who actually wound up growing up in foster care because their parents were removed ask us, why didn't we help the family, why didn't we help their parents. Sadly, what has happened to many of these children, when they grow up, they continue the same cycle of going into depression, winding up in addiction.  Over the years, the National Foster Youth Institute in conjunction with the Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth have organized many different delegations and trips around the country looking at the different foster care systems. Our very first listening tour was in Los Angeles, and we visited a program called SHIELDS for  SHIELDS for Families is a very large drug treatment program that has functioned for over 20 years by keeping the entire family together, and some of these families can remain in residential care for as long as a year. They have been able to reduce the number of children who were removed and go into the foster care system because they provide treatment for the family as a whole.  This bill would modify the award criteria for Health and Human Services to consider whether a partnership has a track record of selective collaboration among child welfare, substance abuse disorder treatment, and mental health agencies. Simply put, this bill is designed to keep families together.  I urge my colleagues to support H.2834.

2896,topic-id,737,"Madam President, I thank my colleague for yielding.  When Senator Coons and I came to the Senate about 6 years ago, it was about the time we formed the Law Enforcement Over that 6 years, we have been continually reminded of how those who run toward danger when others run away protect us. They don't know on any given day what they may be dealing with that day, and their family doesn't know either. They are here to protect those who might be the victims of crime.  What we saw today was a horrific and cowardly attack at baseball practice--someone who takes a weapon and decides they are going to harm people they don't know for whatever cowardly reason that person had.  Of course, we continue to pray for the swift recovery of those who were injured and for the caregivers who are helping them right now.  Every day, when I come to the Capitol grounds, the first person I see is almost always a member of the Capitol No matter how late it is when I leave at night, the last person I see is almost always a member of the Capitol They have a hard job to do. They do it with the highest level of professionalism and dedication. Their families see them leave for work at whatever time of the day their assignments have them leaving for work and are hopeful that those they love will come home. That accounts for all of our law enforcement officers all over the country--the law enforcement officers and other first responders--who rush into dangerous situations not knowing what could be there.  We were very fortunate today. Our Members of Congress were there--Members of the House, Members of the Senate--and the people who were volunteering to make that game work the way it needs to work in order to have a bipartisan annual event to look forward to and to use that event to raise money for charity. There were staff who were there, supporting. Fortunately for all of them, Steve Scalise, who is the majority whip in the House, was there, which meant that there were Capitol Police and security people there with him. It is hard to imagine what might have happened if they had not been there. The Alexandria police would have done a great job and gotten there as quickly as they could, but we have these people who are committed to providing for the safety of Members of Congress, people who are visiting the Capitol, and people who are in the area of the Capitol when anything might happen. Over and over again, Senator Coons and I and others have seen the Capitol Police have to step forward.

We owe them a great debt of gratitude.  Today, we owe the Capitol Police, followed up by the Alexandria police, because of the countless lives that might have been taken if the Capitol Police had not been there at the instance this cowardly attack started.

2918,topic-id,1374,"Mr.President, I am here today to urge support for the act that counters Iran's devastating and destabilizing activities. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the bill. This bill would expand sanctions on individuals who are contributing to Iran's ballistic missile program, supporting international terrorism, or violating the arms embargo against  Iran is one of the key principal state sponsors of terrorism in the world. In fact, the Obama administration said it was the 1 sponsor of state terrorism in the world. It is a destabilizing force for its neighbors, and it is[[Page S3479]]a destabilizing force for a more peaceful world. The Iranians provide financial and material support to groups such as Hamas, Hezbollah, militias in Iraq, and a host of other terrorist groups. They have threatened to wipe out our closest ally in the Middle East, They said they would wipe them ``off the map.'' They continue to violate international restrictions by advancing their ballistic missile program.  Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, when he testified in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee in February of 2016, said: ``Iran's ballistic missiles are inherently capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction, and Tehran already has the largest inventory of ballistic missiles in the Middle East.''  By one estimate, Iran may have conducted as many as 14 missile tests since the Obama administration's nuclear agreement, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, went into effect. Apparently, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action meant that Iran could take any action it wanted, if you look at what Iran is doing today. They have violated multiple legally binding arms embargoes established by the U.Security  On a trip to Saudi Arabia in April, Defense Secretary James Mattis noted that Iran continues to violate multiple arms embargoes, saying: ``We see Iranian-supplied missiles being fired by the Houthis into Saudi Arabia.'' I think that, at one point, Secretary Mattis said that anywhere you look in the disrupted Middle East, Iran is there. This action and others directly violate what Iran agreed not to do when they agreed to the behavior that they said would be their future behavior.  As to their ongoing support of international terrorist organizations, the Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, testified in front of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in an open hearing on May 11, 2017. Just to double down on what his predecessor said, Director Coats said: ``Iran continues to be the foremost state sponsor of terrorism.''  If Iran is the principal state sponsor of terrorism--the foremost sponsor of state terrorism--certainly, we should take some action. This bill does that. Whether it is action supporting the rebels in Yemen or the brutal dictator Bashar al-Assad in Syria, Iran is clearly there and clearly a force for bad, not good.  The legislation the Senate is considering this week would go a long way toward holding Iran accountable. The Countering Iran's Destabilizing Activities Act codifies sanctions that are directed at all three categories of illicit activities and behavior that we should condemn from Iran--ballistic missile tests, arms embargo violations, and support of terrorism, as well as Iran's own systemic abuse of human rights in its own country. There is no way to criticize that government without fear of abuse or worse.  Specifically, the bill directs the President to impose sanctions on any person who knowingly engages in any activity that materially contributes to the Iranian ballistic missile program activities or to any other program for which a system to deliver weapons of mass destruction is involved or any person who contributes to the transfer of certain arms to or from The bill also directs the Secretary of State to submit to the appropriate congressional committees a list of people the State Department has determined to be responsible for gross human rights violations against individuals who seek to promote human rights. The bill further provides that the President may block any property these human rights abusers have in the United  This measure also addresses Iran's continued support for terrorism. Executive order 13224, issued soon after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, sanctions entities determined to be supporting international terrorism.  Let me remind the Presiding Officer that the last two Directors of National Intelligence have both said that the 1 supporter of international terrorism is Several Iran-related entities have already been sanctioned under that order, but not, surprisingly, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard This bill makes a finding that that corps is responsible for supporting terrorism and requires that the sanctions of the Executive order that I mentioned be applied.  This bill does not violate the nuclear agreement with As the Obama administration said repeatedly, the nuclear agreement was about providing Iran ``relief from nuclear-related sanctions.'' I may come back to that later, but this nuclear agreement does not require the United States to look the other way as Iran continues to violate international norms on ballistic missile testing and violates the arms embargo.  Let me also say that the Iran nuclear agreement was just an agreement between the leaders of the two governments. It isn't a treaty. The President never tried to defend it as a treaty. The Congress didn't approve it as a treaty. It is no more of a binding treaty than anything else that the President on his own would decide they would enter into, hoping that the next President would also agree with their decision.  Secretary of State John Kerry, in the final days of his service as Secretary of State said: ``We still have serious differences with the Government of Iran, and will continue to push back on its support of terrorism, disregard for human rights, and destabilizing regional activities.''  This bill delivers the pushback that Secretary of State John Kerry called for.  Despite the hopes that the previous administration had for moderation--remember that debate about how, once we entered into this agreement, it would strengthen the forces of moderation in Iran?--Iran has increased its destructive activities since the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Strengthening sanctions on Iran is an appropriate response in Iran's continued aggression. Again, because these sanctions are directed only at actions outside of the nuclear sphere, the legislation in no way violates the letter or spirit of that agreement. The Iran sanctions regime is the best tool we have to hold Iran accountable and one that we should continue to keep at the forefront of our policy.  In April, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson sent to Congress, as required by the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, the latest certification that Iran is implementing the nuclear agreement. In his message, Secretary Tillerson pointed out that ``Iran remains a leading state sponsor of terror.''  How could we ever have put a leading state sponsor of terror on a path to having a nuclear weapon? All the things we are concerned about in North Korea we have guaranteed in Iran, unless some future President--President Trump or some future President--decides that this is not the direction in which we can continue.  Secretary Tillerson also said that President Trump has ordered an interagency review to evaluate whether suspension of sanctions related to Iran, pursuant to the JCPOA agreement, is vital to the national security interests of the United  He concluded by saying that, when this review is complete, ``the administration looks forward to working with Congress on this issue.''  This is a positive step. That review need not constrain the use of sanctions to hold Iran accountable for its other bad behavior.  I would just like to remind everyone that under President Obama's nuclear agreement, Iran has already gained access to more than $100 billion in sanctions relief, some of which is likely to be fueled to terrorists aligned with Remember the delivery of cash to Iran and where our government said that some of that cash would likely go--what an outrageous thing for us to be a part of.  The 1 sponsor of terrorism in the world deserves to be sanctioned. Individuals who are part of those activities deserve to be specifically sanctioned. This bill will do that. I urge my colleagues to support the bill and the amendment that was voted on today, and look forward to that action being taken later this week.  I yield the floor.

3049,topic-id,2560,"Mr.President, I will speak in a few minutes about the business before the Senate today, but first I wish to speak about what is happening at the White House today.  President Trump is expected to sign an Executive order to protect religious freedom. Many times during the last year, the President has talked about his commitment and our commitment as a nation to religious freedom, but I expect that today he will lay down, specifically, by Executive order the policy of this administration to protect and to vigorously promote religious liberty--not to vigorously promote religion but to vigorously promote religious liberty.  Reports are that the President will tell the IRS that we can't challenge churches and what they say, as well as challenge their not-for-profit status, simply because of what that pastor or that rabbi or that imam believes in the place where they deliver their message and how they live out their faith. It also tells Federal agencies to stop forcing religious organizations to pay fines if they don't want to cover certain healthcare items that conflict with their faith views.  In fact, just this week, Senator Strange and I sent a letter to the Attorney General after we saw that in the Fifth Circuit the Attorney General's office had said that they want 60 more days for all of these pending cases on this very matter. In the letter that Senator Strange and I sent to our former colleague, the Attorney General, we just pointed out to him that the President repeatedly said, as a candidate for President, that this sort of[[Page S2736]]continued action of taking religious organizations to court that simply want the ability to practice their faith is going to stop, and we hope it stops and we hope it stops now.  Lastly, I think this order has the potential to be either more specific or to really instruct the Attorney General to look throughout the agencies of government and issue guidance, so that in all of those agencies, as they go about the work that they do, one of the things they want to be sure they are doing is promoting religious liberty; so that religious organizations that have traditionally or are hoping in the future to be delivery services for adoption, delivery services for addiction, delivery services for other problems that people face, would continue to have the ability to be competing to provide those services.  We know this hasn't happened over the last several months. Religious groups that have had contracts for a long time and the availability to provide those services, even when they scored the highest on the scoring of the competitive bids for these contracts, were not given the contracts because they were faith-based.  Well, if there is any country in the world that has understood the importance of religious liberty, it has been the United Religious freedom is the first freedom in the First Amendment to the Constitution, the first right in the Bill of Rights, and I don't believe that is by accident. No other country in the history of the world ever committed itself to religious freedom as our country did from the very first weeks of the government under the No country ever held this as a principled tenet of what they would stand for as a country prior to the United States doing that.  We might recall how we come to the place today where the President has to issue an Executive order protecting religious freedom. In 1993, President Clinton signed into law the Religious Freedom Restoration That act really affirmed that the Federal Government shouldn't infringe on individual religious beliefs unless there was an overriding public purpose to do so. If, in fact, it was found to be necessary to infringe on somebody's religious beliefs because of that overriding public purpose--if there was justification that there was one--then we should really only interfere with it in the least intrusive way and we should do the minimum necessary to meet whatever that greater public need might be.  It is unbelievable to me that in recent years, groups like the Little Sisters of the Poor, Christian colleges, or other groups that are traditionally providing services are suddenly finding themselves in court defending who they are and who they hope to be. The order issued today would finally provide that relief in a case like the Little Sisters of the I looked a few months ago at their stated purpose and it is, for the Little Sisters of the Poor, to receive older people without means, regardless of their faith, and treat them like they were Jesus Now, that doesn't sound like a group that the Federal Government would have to crack down on. But the Federal Government, in recent years, decided that, in fact, they should force this group to do things that violate its faith principles. There is no possible greater good to be accomplished by that. Hopefully, this Executive order makes it clear today that harassment of religious groups is going to stop and that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act principles are still principles in our country and, more importantly, that the First Amendment is still a founding principle in our country.  There is no question in the mind of any American, I think, that the U.Government should do everything in its power to defend and protect religious freedom. Whether you are a person of faith or a person of no faith at all, you should be able to pursue those beliefs.  When Jefferson was asked in the last year of his Presidency which freedom is most important, he said that the right of conscience is the freedom that we should most vigorously defend--the right to believe what we believe and pursue what we believe. That has been further defined over the years by this: If there are times when that creates a true hazard to others, others have a right to come in and explain that, and the government has a right to see what can be done about that and still maintain in every way possible the essence of belief that people have.  So I commend the President for the action that he is reported to be taking later today. I continue to be not only supportive of the President's view that religious freedom is a critical tenet of who we are, but also I look forward to working with his administration as they further put this Executive order into place throughout the agencies of government.  Mr.President, I also wish to speak for a few minutes while I am here about the bill before the Senate today. I think the fact that we are moving forward with an update on how we spend our money and a prioritization of how we spend our money is incredibly important. I would have been and would be, if somehow we failed to do our job today, very disappointed if we think that the priorities of a year ago have to be the exact same priorities today.  Now, many of them will be the same, but many of them will not. So all of these appropriating committees have worked together, House and Senate, and have come to a process where we will have 12 bills--not debated on the floor as intensively as I would have liked to have seen them debated--that should be our goal for this year--but 12 bills where House Members and Senate Members, Republicans and Democrats, came together and decided what our priorities should be.  The subcommittee that I chair--the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee--dollar-wise, after we take Defense off the table, that is the biggest of the committees and, in some ways, it has the most challenging debates as to where we wind up in these areas, but I think we have made good choices that hopefully can be improved on next year, but I am absolutely confident they are better than last year.  It is really important for the people we work for to understand that we had to make choices. There is very little difference in the money that will be spent this year and the money that was spent last year, but there is a difference in priorities. I think in the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, we have either eliminated or consolidated in a dramatic way 28 programs so that we could find that money and use it for what we now believe to be a better purpose.  One of those better purposes would be an increase for the second year in a row, and the second year in the last 14 years, in health research at the National Institutes of There were 12 years with no increase at all, and now, for 2 back-to-back years, we are trying to get us back to the research buying power we were at 12 years ago. Again, as to the programs that weren't performing, many of them wound up with zero appropriations in both of these last 2 years so that the NIH appropriation could increase.  At a time when we are looking at precision medicine, when we are looking at immunotherapy, when we no longer look at cancer as just cancer and throw everything at it we want to throw at it, in fact, we look at the individual cancer, and we are at that moment because we understand now what we didn't understand a decade ago. We can look at the individual cancer and the individual patient and figure out how that patient has a unique potential to fight that cancer in their body. We looked at things that may not be required for people with cancer and other diseases, and if we can figure out which people need this procedure and which people don't, not only do you not pay for the procedure for people who don't need it, but also people don't go through the physical challenge of procedures they don't need.  As to Alzheimer's, one of the growing concerns in American families today--right up there now with cancer as one of the things that people worry about most as they look to the future--if we could reduce the onset of Alzheimer's by an average of 5 years, we would be spending almost 50 percent less in 2050 than we will be otherwise. In 2050, spending of tax dollars on Alzheimer's care will overwhelm the budget, but research commitments can do something about that.  The Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee bill puts us back, for[[Page S2737]]the school year that begins next fall, where we will be back to year-round What does that mean? What is year-round Pell as opposed to what we have now? Right now, we have two semesters where you can qualify for the Pell grant. A Pell grant is given based on income and need. If you qualify for a full Pell--I believe, in the Acting President pro tempore's State and, I know, in my State--there is no community college where full Pell doesn't pay for all tuition, all books, all fees. If you are at the level of need where you qualify for the full Pell grant, you have other things you have to worry about to sustain yourself, but paying for school is not one of them. As an adult going back to school and someone paying for your own school with your own effort, if you are the first person in your family to hope to graduate from school, anything that disrupts whatever pattern you are in minimizes the chances to achieve your goal. So if you have things working in the fall and the spring and you can also stay in a summer term, not only do you get done quicker, but you don't disrupt the pattern you found yourself in.  For 8 years now we haven't had year-round This vote we will take today allows that to happen, and it will make a big difference. It will also make a difference when you are in a program where you are being prepared to do a job that is uniquely available or available in your community. It is pretty hard to explain why we can do this and we have ways to pay for it through the fall and spring, but by the summer we just have to take a break. That is not a very easy thing to explain to an employer who has come to the community because you have that training potential in your community.  The third major allocation of money that had to come from somewhere else is opioid abuse. This bill will increase by 430 percent our commitment on this issue. It is not because we had 650 million new dollars to spend on opioid abuse. It is because in many places in our country today and in many States in our country, more people die from opioid overdoses than die from car accidents. It is because many families are destroyed by addiction to prescription drugs that leads to other drugs when those prescription drugs can't be available and, frankly, the abuse of prescription drugs, in some cases, where they are available. So we are looking at new ways to deal with pain and looking at new ways to deal with this growing problem.  In 2014 and 2015, each year more than 1,000 people in Missouri died of drug overdoses. In my State and most States, a fire department that also has a first responders unit is three times more likely to respond to a drug overdose than the average fire department to a fire. So there is a third area where this bill prioritizes what needs to be done.  In the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, title I, charter schools, all those things have a new focus as this bill passes. The mental health initiatives, rural healthcare, and Head Start are all benefited by a reprioritization of what happens here, as are veterans workforce issues and Job Corps issues.  I think this bill is far from perfect, but it is better than the way we are spending our money today and better than we were spending our money a year and a half ago. Hopefully, it will not be quite as good as the way we spend our money starting October 1.  So we need to get this work done and get started immediately doing the business of setting priorities, making difficult choices, and spending people's money in a way that has a long-term plan to benefit them, their families, and our growing economy. I look forward to that vote later today, and then to have, I would hope--as I know the majority leader hopes--a greater effort this year than ever before to get these bills on the floor and to have them fully debated. The best possible thing would be to pass them one at a time and put them on the President's desk one at a time. But the next best thing is to look at the bills and reach individual conclusions about these individual bills. That is what the bill before us today does, and I urge its passage.

3093,topic-id,223,"Mr.Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to H.1215, a misguided and misnamed bill that will limit access to justice, especially for women.  The bill caps the amount of compensation a jury can award to a victim who suffers medical injuries, even catastrophic injuries, because it creates a lifetime cap of $250,000 for noneconomic damages.  This means that women, or men, for that matter, who are at home raising their families, or children who are victims of devastating medical malpractice are told that the value of their injuries and their lives is less than that of their wage-earning counterparts. That is patently unfair. It disproportionately penalizes people who are family caregivers--a very important job, but one that does not involve wages.  Furthermore, many women across the country have been victims of medical malpractice that has left them unable to bear children.  How can we say to these women that the loss they have suffered, the loss of an opportunity to be a mother is without value?  That is unacceptable, and it is cruel.  Many medical errors are preventable. We should be focusing on improving patient safety, not taking away rights from victims.

2886,topic-id,4030,"Mr.President, let me return the compliment to Senator  Senator Corker announced in his opening remarks about the bipartisan vote in our committee on the Iran sanctions bill. In the last Congress, we were able to get a unanimous vote on the Iran bill. We, under the leadership of Senator Corker, fully recognized that particularly on foreign policy, our country is much stronger when we speak with a united voice, so bringing Democrats and Republicans together is in our national interest.  Senator Corker has listened to different views. He and I do have different views on many issues concerning foreign policy, but in almost every one of those cases, we have been able to reconcile those differences. That is true and it was very clear on the Iran sanctions and it is also very true on the Russia sanctions amendment that we will be voting on later today.  To Senator Corker, I just want my colleagues to know we have a leader on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who puts America's national interests first and has respected the rights of every Senator, not only in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee but in the U.Senate, that can add to the richness of our discussions and debate. I think we are much stronger today because of that. This is a good example of that, and I am very proud to be supportive of all these efforts and supportive of how this came about because I think it is important for our colleagues and the American people to know about that.                Congressional Baseball Practice Shooting  Mr.President, Senator Corker and I both want to express, before we start our debate on this issue, our concerns for our colleagues who were victimized by the shooting that took place in Virginia--an outrageous event--and for our security people as well as the innocent bystanders who were struck by the gunfire. Our prayers are with those who are recovering. We hope they will have a complete recovery. We are committed to making sure we keep our Senate and congressional family safe, and we will do everything we can to make sure that takes place. We will continue to work to make sure we preserve the democratic ideals of this Nation and the free society we live in. We know there are rifts, and we know we can do service and stand by those democratic commitments but also keep America safe.[[Page S3463]]  I think the work on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee had those goals in mind, and Senator Corker, through the Chair, I thank you for your attention to those details.  Mr.President, let me talk for a few minutes about 722, the Countering Iran's Destabilizing Activities This bill will impose new sanctions on Iran for its nonnuclear violations. I want to make that clear--nonnuclear violations. Their responsibilities on the nuclear side is now judged by the nuclear agreement that was entered into. We had a great debate about it last year, and we are not going to rehash that debate. I think every Member of this Chamber wants to make sure Iran complies with its nuclear obligations, but that is a separate debate.  The debate we have here is on the nonnuclear activities of Iran that violate international norms and international agreements. We saw, for example, ballistic missile tests that violated their U.obligations that took place in January and in  We have seen a significant increase in illicit arms shipments being done by Iran, causing destabilizing activities in many parts of the region. We see it in We see it in We see it in We know they are supporting Hezbollah in We see they are supporting Hamas in Gaza, and we know about their activities in support of the Assad regime in This all violates international norms.  Iran today has violated, in an incredible way, human rights issues that violate international norms. Yesterday we saw a part of the impact of that as we had a debate on the Saudi arms sale, and we can argue the Saudi's culpability with what is going on in Yemen, but there is no question about Iran's activities supporting the Houthis in Yemen causing atrocities in that country. They are clearly very actively engaged in violating internationally recognized human rights. We also see cyber attacks on the United States that have come from Iran, and they are detaining at least five U.citizens today illegally.  There are increased activities in Iran in relation to the nonnuclear side of their activities. For that reason, 722 looks at strengthening the sanctions regime so we can make it clear, yes, we will comply with the JCPOA, the nuclear agreement, but we need to have better activities--improvement on the nonnuclear side.  Basically, the bill increases the sanctions menus that are available for ballistic missile violations, for support of terrorism, for human rights violations, and for violating the arms embargo. Those who knowingly do those violations or materially assist will be subject to additional sanctions by the United  We codify the IRGC, that was done by Executive order, and we codify some of these other Executive orders as it relates to We coordinate. This is done in a way that it coordinates with what Europe is doing and making sure it is a consistent approach that we have taken in the past.  We ask the administration to develop a regional strategy so the Congress and the American people know our policies in the Middle That provision was drafted before the Trump administration. This is a desire by Congress to have a better articulated regional strategy, recognizing the dangers in that region. Iran is a major player in the region against U.interests, and we need to know what our strategy is in confronting those challenges. Quite frankly, with the Trump administration, we haven't heard that coordinated strategy, and this legislation will require that report be given not just to Congress on a regular basis but to the American people.  I want to underscore how this agreement is totally consistent with the nuclear agreement that was entered into 2 years ago--the JCPOA, as it is referred to. I want to go through quickly how this came about. Senator Corker talked a little bit about it.  Senator Corker is absolutely correct. Senator Menendez has been a leader on Iran sanctions way before this He was very much involved in the original sanctions legislation passed by That led to putting enough pressure on the international community to join us, which ultimately led to Iran having no choice but to negotiate. Senator Corker and Senator Menendez had introduced legislation that was out there, and we had a chance to review it, which is how the process should work. As a result of that review, both Senator Corker, Senator Menendez, and I--all three of us--reached out to interested groups to understand what the Congress has done. Many of the people we talked to were involved in the negotiations with Iran who had different views than we did on the final outcome of that agreement, but we wanted to make sure we weren't violating any of the provisions of the JCPOA so we sought their input. As a result, there was revised legislation that was offered known as Corker-Menendez-Cardin, which incorporated the ideas of all three of us, but really the outside groups working with us, to make sure it was totally consistent with the JCPOA and consistent with the intent of the original bill. I think that bill was well scrubbed. I think it did not violate the JCPOA, but we went through another process, another review, another opportunity for those who could perhaps see things we don't see quite as clearly when it comes to Iran and our European allies. We went through a second scrubbing, and we had a managers' amendment that was offered in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that tightened the bill up even more dealing with those issues.  I think I can state very confidently that there is nothing in the underlying bill that violates the U.commitment under the JCPOA nuclear agreement. It is my intent, and I think the intent of almost every member of this committee that the United States should comply with the Even though I didn't support it, I think it is important we comply with it today.  The other aspect I wanted to go through is that--and I don't want to give the wrong impression. There are people who are involved in the negotiations of the nuclear agreement who would state--some would say they oppose the bill, some might say it is not helpful, some might say Iran might take it the wrong way. Any one of those arguments aside, I do not think you will find anyone who says that it violates the  I want to give a little bit of history here because this was anticipated, that we would need this bill, when we acted on the JCPOA, by those of us who supported and opposed the nuclear agreement.  As the chairman will recall, shortly after the failure to reject the JCPOA--that action--I filed additional legislation that I thought was necessary, along with many of my colleagues, who voted for and voted against the I voted against it. Those who voted for it thought it was necessary. It included the regional strategy so that we would know what the administration was doing. We expedited procedures to deal with nonnuclear violations if Iran used the sanction relief they got under the nuclear agreement to increase their terrorist activities or ballistic missile activities or human rights violations. In fact, they have done that, and that is why we filed the bill right after the action on the nuclear agreement.  This is consistent with what we thought would be necessary. Yes, we had hoped Iran would change its activities, but we were not naive about it. We knew that this was going to be a long road. We knew that Iran did not respond to niceties and that we were going to have to keep the pressure up for them to be able to take the action that was needed.  I know many of us were encouraged when we saw the votes a couple of weeks ago in Iran whereby the Iranians voted for a more open society, a more transparent society. I must say that Iran has a wonderful history of very talented people who want democratic principles, and I am sure that is true among many of the people in Iran today. It is their leaders with whom we have an objection, not with the people of The people of Iran want a more open, democratic society. This legislation will help get to that point by making it clear to the leaders in Iran that they must change their behavior as it relates to terrorism, as it relates to human rights violations, as it relates to their other international obligations. That is the reason this bill has become so important.  Let me give one more example on the consistency.  There are many provisions that we have changed. One is that we all acknowledge that the United States and[[Page S3464]]our partners are fully at liberty to take action against Iran for terrorist activities, which is not part of the nuclear agreement, but there is some confusion as to how that is done in relationship to the sanctions relief that is provided under the In listening to their concerns, we will set up an independent review process within the next 5 years that will resolve that issue before we hit the 8-year mark so that we are not jeopardizing thwarting a crisis in the future that might occur. I really just want to point that out because this bill is totally consistent with the obligations of the United States under the Iran nuclear agreement.                     Amendment 232, as Modified  I talked briefly yesterday about the amendment that is pending. I want to spend just a moment, if I might, in underscoring some of the details of the amendment that is passing.  I am for 722, and I am for the amendment that was crafted in the same spirit as was the underlying bill--in a bipartisan agreement. It involved not just the Senate Foreign Relations Committee but the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee because the jurisdictions on sanctions do overlap between the two committees.  As I said yesterday, I thank Senators Crapo and Brown--and Chairman Corker has already mentioned this--as they were extremely helpful in making sure that we tailored the financial sanctions in a way that is workable and consistent with that of our European partners so that we can make sure we have collective strength.  I am sure the Presiding Officer has been in meetings with our European friends and knows how they feel about He knows how they feel--that they are the direct bull's-eye with regard to what Russia is doing. They want the United States to be strong, and they want the United States to provide leadership, but we need to provide it in a manner that is consistent with their security interests. With regard to the way this bill has evolved, I think we have a better bill that is consistent with those concerns.  With Russia, we know their activities. We know their cyber activities against our democratic institutions. As we have said frequently, all countries collect cyber information, but the use of that cyber information to attack our democratic institutions is an attack on our country. That cannot go unchallenged. We have to protect ourselves and take action when we have been attacked. This bill does that.  We also know, not just recently but historically, that Russia has been very aggressive in its interfering with the sovereignty of other countries. Today, in Moldova and Georgia, you see the consequences of Russia's aggression. Of course, in Ukraine, with the annexation by Russia of Crimea and its continued activities in eastern Ukraine, Russia has violated every single commitment of the OSE's Helsinki Accords and has violated the sovereignty of other countries.  We also know about Russia's activities in support of the Assad regime in Syria and, by the way, in other countries in that region. It has assisted in horrible human rights violations--just terrible. We have seen some of the videos of the tragedies of innocent children as a result of Mr.Putin's support of the Assad regime.  In January of this year, Senator McCain and I introduced legislation that would have imposed new sanctions on Russia because of these activities. We wanted to make sure that this was bipartisan, so we had 18 Senators cosponsor the bill with us--10 Democrats, 10 Republicans--to make it clear that this was not an attack on one administration but that this was America and that we had to be together in a strong message against the Putin regime. That bill included sanctions on cyber activities. It included sanctions on their Ukrainian activities. It included sanctions in regard to their Syrian activities. The legislation also incorporated what has been known as the Democracy Initiative, which provides ways in which we can provide a more unified front with our European allies in defending against the cyber attacks we have seen coming from  At the same time, Senator Graham filed a bill, with my cosponsorship, that would require congressional review before the President could give sanction relief to The review was patterned very similarly to the review we had under the Iran nuclear agreement.  So those two bills were pending, and there has been a lot of debate about them.  We then received a draft bill from Senators Crapo and Brown as it related to the sanctions. It was focused--I would not say exclusively but primarily--on the financial and energy sectors in order to make sure those sanctions were drafted in the proper way, and we went through considerable negotiations. Senator Corker, as I pointed out before, brought additional text to the discussion in an effort to try to bring this together.  Although I am mentioning Senators' names, we know it is the staff. Our staffs have been working around the clock to try to make sure we get this done right. So I thank the majority and minority staffs on the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee and on the Senate Foreign Relations  There are many parts to the amendment that will be voted on at 2 p.m. One part codifies additional sanctions against I have already mentioned Senator Menendez's role in He was very instrumental as it relates to Senator Durbin has been very active. I must tell you that there has been no Member on the Democratic side who has been more vocal than Senator Shaheen on the need to take action against There are many Members on our side who were active on this. I thank my colleagues for their contribution.  We do codify the Executive orders that were issued that were related to both Ukraine and cyber attacks. With the adoption of this amendment, we would be codifying--giving congressional support for what took place by President  It expands the list of where sanctions can apply to the energy projects and foreign financial institutions that facilitate such projects. For actors who try to undermine cyber security, it provides for their being subject to sanctions, and it provides secondary sanctions for those who materially assist those actors in undermining our cyber security. It provides sanctions against suppliers of Russian arms to It goes after the actors who are involved in the corrupt privatization of Russia's governmental assets. We do not support those who are supporting Mr.Putin's corrupt regime. It deals with sanctions against Russia's activities on pipelines, the Russia railway, metals, mining, and shipping. So it is comprehensive, and most of these sanctions are mandatory. It is not ``may''; rather, it is that the President ``shall'' in most of these circumstances.  As is the tradition, the President also has the ability, if there is a significant national security issue, to weigh whether that sanction should be applied. Yet we use a different standard in most of these sanctions that requires the President to certify before he issues those waivers that there has been, basically, significant progress made by Russia in removing these sanctionable activities. So we have a pretty strong hand that we are giving President Trump in his negotiations with Mr. In addition, this bill provides for congressional review. We talked about that--a bill that was originally introduced by Senator Graham and me. As I indicated, it is very similar to the Iran Review I think this is very important in that it puts a lot of transparency into the negotiations between the Trump administration and the Putin administration.  As Senator Corker was talking about earlier as to how one President can do something by himself--and I hope that the amendment is adopted and that the bill passes the House and becomes law--the President cannot by himself remove a sanction until he has given Congress notice and an opportunity to review that. We can have congressional hearings. We can put a spotlight on it. Then we will have an expedited process whereby we could reject the President's decision to give relief, and all during that process the sanctions will remain in place.  It is a very strong congressional review, and it is our responsibility to do that, but it also brings in the American people and brings in a more transparent process. What we have found is[[Page S3465]]that, with that transparency, it is a much stronger hand that President Trump has in his negotiations, knowing that he has to go through this process at the end of the day in his negotiations with  Sometimes we call it the strength of our independent branches of government. The executive branch can say ``Look, we would like to move faster, but we have to do this with the legislative branch'' or ``We would like to do this, but we cannot get it through Congress.'' Use the independence of the We are certainly very strongly against what Russia is doing. Use that to increase the pressure on Russia to do the right thing. That is what this bill does. This is why it is helpful to the President of the United States to have this congressional review.  It would reply to anything from cyber sanctions that had been imposed under the Obama executive order to the attempt to return the compounds that are located in Maryland and New All of that would be subject to a congressional review before the action by the President could become effective.  I mentioned earlier that the bill does include the authorization of democracy funds, as I call it, that assist our allies in their fight against Russia's aggression, particularly in cyber. It authorizes $250 million, and it applies to our work with the EU member states, the NATO member States, as well as with candidate nations. It is a pretty strong opportunity for us to work together.  I have had many meetings with our European colleagues and friends. Yes, every country recognizes that it is vulnerable against Russia's attacks--believe me, they do--and they are doing everything they can to protect themselves. What I find disappointing is that there is not enough coordination. We know how they acted in the United States and how they acted in France and now how they are likely to act in Germany and what they did in We know how they are likely to proceed, but do we have a common strategy to prevent this type of manipulation by Russia of our democratic institutions?  This authorization and the funding--I thank Senator Graham and Senator Leahy for putting money into the fiscal year 2017 budget to start this process going forward. We have approved that, and that is now in the budget. It allows us to coordinate those efforts among the United States and our European friends to protect against what we know is going to be continued activity by  There are obviously investigations going on. Part of the investigation is to understand what Russia is doing, quite frankly, so that we can protect ourselves. I think that will be very helpful, this information, and the role of the United States in working with our European allies to protect against certain continued malicious activities by the Russian  There is a provision in this bill that deals with We make it clear that we will not recognize Crimea's annexation of Ukraine, that we will continue to stand with the people of Ukraine in regard to their sovereignty, and we ask for a plan to reduce Ukraine's dependence on Russia energy imports.  We know that Ukraine is vulnerable because of energy, and we know that we have to develop a plan to deal with that. There are many Members involved in that, and I wish to acknowledge my friend from Ohio, Senator Portman, for his work in regard to the Ukraine provisions.  There are new counterterrorism financing provisions, which are pretty comprehensive, so that we make sure that we have all the tools we need in order to track the financing of terrorism activities. That is in there.  So let me just tell my colleague how proud I am to be associated with the underlying bill as well as the amendment that we are going to vote on at 2 o'clock. Both the underlying bill and the amendment were developed in the best of the bipartisan manners of the U. I wish to thank, again, all of those who were involved to give us this opportunity to speak with a strong, united voice against the activities that Iran is doing globally and that are destabilizing so many countries through their terrorism and ballistic missiles and human rights violations and arms embargo violations, and to make it clear to the Russian Federation that we are not going to let them attack our country, that we are going to stand up to that and work to be sure to keep our allies safe.

I specifically commend the Capitol Police for all they do, and, again, Agents Bailey and Griner for their bravery and quick actions to protect those in danger. We are blessed by the service of the Capitol Police and fortunate they were there to prevent this attack from being even more tragic.  Where do we go from here? Frankly, we as a country need to come together to try and reinject civility into our political rhetoric. We can disagree on policy. It is that disagreement and our ability to discuss and debate these differences that makes democracies successful.  The key word here is ``debate.'' There is a difference between debate and attacking the motives and good faith of another. Debates are healthy, productive, and you respect those in opposition. You discuss ideas, not perceived intentions. When respect and good faith in the intentions of the other are lost, though, perhaps it does more to hurt than to heal.  We as individuals need to look at how we use rhetoric--rhetoric that can cause someone who is unbalanced to commit an act of violence, as we saw this morning. Anyone saying things to vilify another or portray them as evil, we have to recognize that can drive some, again, to acts of violence. Let's do what we can to move this country to the era of respectful debate.  Now let me end where I began. We cannot let political terrorism win. We must stand firm in support of our democracy and democratic institutions. We must carry on, not letting evil triumph. We do that by recognizing that we are all, first, children of God, then all We come together, stand united, doing that which is best for our country and for each other.  I yield the floor.

3021,topic-id,220,"Mr.Speaker, yesterday, Senate Republicans delayed a vote on their bill to repeal the Affordable Care This is a bill that Republicans wrote in secret. They allowed no input from the public or members of the Democratic Caucus, yet they still could not find the votes to pass their bill.  Maybe that is because it eliminates health insurance for 22 million Americans; it imposes an age tax on older Americans; it allows insurance companies to discriminate based on preexisting conditions; it slashes Medicaid and leaves Medicare to wither on the vine. But no matter the reason, the lesson is clear: it is time for Republicans to give up on their effort to repeal the Affordable Care  The American people are benefiting from this law. Seniors like that they are saving money on prescriptions. Parents like that their kids can stay on their plan until they are 26. Workers like that their employers have to offer healthcare coverage.  It is not perfect, but let's work together to approve the Affordable Care Act to make sure it works even better for the American people. Democrats are willing to do that. If Republicans will give up the idea of repeal, we can work together to make the Affordable Care Act even better. Let's get this done for our constituents and the American people.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-28-pt1-PgH5288.txt,2055,CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS,2017.0,28.0,June
3080,topic-id,327,"Mr.Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I rise in strong opposition to H.1215, which should be more accurately called the taking away access to care and justice act. This bill will do nothing to strengthen patient protections and will make careless healthcare providers less accountable.  It will severely limit when an injured person is allowed to bring a healthcare lawsuit by shortening the time that injured people have to seek relief. It will also impose a one-size-fits-all cap on how much compensation victims of medical malpractice can receive for pain and suffering, regardless of the severity of a person's injury--in order to benefit insurance companies and wrongdoers.  This cap even applies to intentional acts of misconduct. This bill would unfairly limit a patient suing a healthcare provider for sexual assault, as well as a veteran who has received substandard medical care. The bill is written so broadly, it shields both negligent doctors and manufacturers of dangerous drugs and medical devices from liability.  H.1215 is before us at a time when Republicans in the Senate are working hard to pass a bill that eliminates health coverage for 22 million people in order to give the wealthiest Americans and insurance companies a huge tax cut. The American people deserve better than this.  Our legal and healthcare system should work for the benefit of hardworking Americans, the people we represent, not for the powerful special interests. Republicans are chomping at the bit for the opportunity to eliminate health coverage for honest, hardworking Americans and are making deep cuts to Medicaid just so they can give the richest people in this country a $600 billion tax cut.  And now, they want to prevent injured people from getting justice when they are hurt. Middle class families need to see that we are on their side. They don't need bills like H.1215, which will rig the healthcare and justice systems against them.  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.1215.

3184,topic-id,2245,"Mr.President, I am pleased to commend Emmett Chassaniol, Jr., and the Chassaniol family of Greenwood, MS, for 100 years of service and contributions to the U.cotton industry.  Mr.Chassaniol and his family are the subject of a profile published recently by the Delta Business The profile not only reviews a century of influence by an agricultural family in the Mississippi Delta but also the changes in the cotton industry over the decades. Mississippi remains one of the leading cotton-producing States in the country. Farmers in my State produced more than 1 million bales of cotton in 2016.  Since its founding in 1917, the Chassaniol and Company has helped producers move cotton from the farm to the marketplace. Three generations of the Chassaniol family have engaged in the business of buying, shipping, or selling cotton. I am pleased to recognize their continuous role in meeting the needs of cotton farmers in this important and challenging industry.  Today Emmett Chassaniol, Jr., continues the family cotton business established by his grandfather. Since 1996, he has expanded Chassaniol and[[Page S4023]]Company's reach, selling cotton for producers in Arkansas, Louisiana, and areas of the State beyond the Mississippi Emmett, Jr., like his grandfather, father, and other family members, has served in leadership positions that have helped to maintain cotton as an important commodity crop in my  I am pleased to join cotton producers throughout my State in commending Emmett Chassaniol, Jr., and the Chassaniol family for 100 years of business in the cotton industry.  I ask that the June 15, 2017, article from the Delta Business Journal magazine, titled ``A Century of the Cotton Business--The Chassaniol Family,'' be printed in the  The material follows:            [From the Delta Business Journal, June 15, 2017]        A Century of the Cotton Business--The Chassaniol Family                          (By Mark Stowers)       Cotton has been king in Mississippi since the early 1800s      but has seen its reign diminish since the late 1980s. The      majestic crop has seen a rise in its ranks with an increase      in acres planted the past decade. For the past century, the      Chassaniol family of Greenwood has been part of the cotton      kingdom and its rise and fall and rise again. Emmett      Chassaniol Jr., still works in the family cotton business his      grandfather started in the early 1900s. He explained the      family history in the cotton business by gathering      correspondence from his grandfather, family input and his own      recollection.       In 1917, the Chassaniol and Company cotton business opened      its doors in the Cotton Capital city when the transplanted      cotton shipper Herbert Spencer (H.S.) ``Pop'' Chassaniol      decided to stay in his adopted home town. His original office      was on 117 Front street but then he later moved to 110 Main      Street--the corner of Ramcat Alley and Main Street in the      ``Cotton Row'' area. He stayed in that building until he      retired in 1963 and then he passed away in 1966. In 1968, the      family sold the building to Mr.Charles       In 1956, H.recounted his career in a letter he wrote to      the vice president of the Hibernia National Bank in New      H.had known the VPs father and uncles in the      cotton business in the New Orleans Cotton       ``My first job was at the age of 12, with Kline Wilson and      Company and your Uncle Peter Stoube was the manager of the      New Orleans office. Through my mother's family, Mr.Stoube      gave me my first job as his office boy.''       From there Chassaniol worked his way up from the bottom of      the cotton business to owning his own cotton business.      Emmett's grandfather was later moved to the Delta in 1910--     first to Greenville and then Greenwood with the English firm,      Alexander Eccles and But they then decided to close      that office and move Chassaniol to But H.knew      he had found a business home, so he stayed in Greenwood and      opened up the Chassaniol and Company cotton business in 1917.       The Greenwood Cotton Exchange got its charter in 1927 and      H.was the first president serving the 1927-1928 term. He      later served again from 1940-1941.       Since then, H.S.'s sons--Pershing and Emmett (Sr.)--a      cotton buyer--each worked the business together before      Pershing started his own company--The Pershing Chassaniol      Cotton Factor--in 1955 after serving time in World War He      also served as president of the Greenwood Cotton Exchange for      the 1970-1971 term. Pershing was then joined by his nephew      Emmett and Pershing's daughter, Sally Chassaniol      Emmett served as the Greenwood Cotton Exchange      president on three occasions--1992-1993, 1999-2000 and 2006-     2007. The Cotton Exchange's final year of existence was in      2009 and then it was dissolved.       ``Pershing was in that business from 1955 to 1995,'' Emmett      said. ``My dad was in with my grandfather at Chassaniol      and Sam Adams came in as partner with my grandfather      in 1931 but they never changed the name. That lasted until      1953 when they dissolved the partnership. My grandfather      retired in 1963 and passed away in October of 1966.''       One of H.S.'s sons, Herbert Chassaniol, Jr., worked with      him in the business until June of 1939, when at the age of      25, he died in a diving accident on the Mississippi Gulf      Also, one of Pop's sons, Lloyd, worked in the cotton      business for different companies but never with       ``Uncle Lloyd went to work for the George Wolfe and      Company in Greenwood representing J.Stevens out of South      In 1963, they moved Uncle Lloyd, his wife and four      daughters to Greenville, South Carolina where he stayed with      them until he retired. He passed away in January of 2000. His      widow and four daughters all still live in South Carolina.''      Emmett Chassaniol said. ``Doris Chassaniol Mallette, one of      my grandfather's daughters, worked for him as well. My      grandfather's son-in-law, J.McCurdy was married to      Blanche, was a cotton factor but didn't work for my      grandfather. Also, my grandfather's nephew, Herbert      Chassaniol, ended up as sales manager over at Staplcotn and      retired in 1965.''       Pershing retired in 1995 and sold his building to Viking      Then in January of 1996, Emmett incorporated his      business, Chassaniol and Company and moved into the historic      McBee building that dates back to 1880.       For more than a century, the Chassaniol family has blessed      farmers and the family alike as the Chassaniols kept to the      foundational value as stated by Pershing quite often to his      daughter.       ``He said it doesn't matter if the farmer comes in and has      one bale of cotton or if a farmer comes in and brings in 100      bales of cotton--you treat them just the same because they      are both cotton farmers,'' she said. ``That was one of the      things I always remembered.''       McSpadden, like the rest of the family, grew up in the      cotton office as well.       ``We would be up there working with them, especially during      the busy season,'' McSpadden said. ``I came back in 1979 and      took momma's place doing the bookkeeping and worked until      1997.''       With no computers, McSpadden had plenty of paperwork to      tend to that she included her children's help with as well.       ``I would bring work home at night and we'd be sitting in      the middle of the living room floor--me and my two boys--and      we would have all the class cards spread out and they would      help me put them in order,'' she said. ``But just to be able      to work with your daddy every day for 18 to 19 years is a      true blessing,'' she said. ``We had a wonderful relationship      and I went home every day with him to each lunch with      momma.''       McSpadden invoiced and paid famers while Emmett graded out      and sold the cotton.       ``I can't say enough nice things about the farmers, the      buyers and the other sellers,'' McSpadden said. ``They were      true to their word and it was just a pleasure to be in the      cotton business as long as I was.''       Emmett explained his job as ``I sell cotton for the      farmers. That's all I've ever done as well as my Uncle      My father and grandfather were shippers and buyers      but I don't buy a bale of cotton. I just represent the farmer      and get the price for him and sell cotton for him.''       Three generation of the Chassaniol family have worked with      the Bank of Commerce and continue do so today, according to      Emmett The Chassaniols have experienced plenty of      technology changes on the cotton selling side as farmers have      seen in the field. As field hands used to pick cotton by      hand, all of the bookkeeping and cotton samples were all done      by hand with what now would seem to be primitive tools.       ``The buyers would actually come by, look at the cotton and      grade it themselves and pull the staple on it and give you a      bid on it,'' Emmett said. ``Now, I don't ever see a farmer      come by the office. It's all done electronically. We get our      data electronically and we get our warehouse receipts      electronically. I've done business with a guy down in      Louisiana for 30 years and we've only seen each other      twice.''       McSpadden's early days involved two daily trips to the bank      with cotton receipts.       ``I invoiced every bale of cotton. In a year's time, we're      talking thousands of bales of cotton. In the beginning the      receipts were kept at the bank (in the main safe) and every      morning we would have to go to the bank and pick up all the      cotton receipts and bring them back to the office and I would      invoice them out. The ones I didn't finish with, I had to      take back to the bank before they closed at 2:00 p.m.,'' she      said.       But then Pershing got his own safe so his daughter could      work a few more hours each day.       ``That way we couldn't stop and talk to people on the way      to the bank every day,'' she said.       For Emmett Jr., the introduction of technology made selling      cotton a 24/7/365 business pretty much.       ``When I first started, the cotton market would open up at      9:30 a.m. and close at 1:30 or 2:00 p.m. Now it opens at 8:00      p.m. at night and closes at 1:15 the next day. While I'm      sleeping, the foreign markets are trading cotton. Sometimes      when I wake up at night and punch my phone to see what the      markets doing. It's really changed,'' he said. ``In 2008,      they went to electronic trading and its changed the cotton      business for ever and ever. They used to trade it manually in      the pits in New York but now it's just punching a button.''       Chassaniol is gearing up for a busier year this year as      more farmers are adding acreage.       ``One thing in the cotton business is that no two years are      alike weather-wise or marketwise,'' he said. ``In 1963 and      '73 we had good falls and big crops. In '73, we had the flood      and two million acres of the Mississippi Delta under water.      The price of cotton was around 28 cents and with the flood it      shot up to around 90 cents. But in February of '74 it fell      pretty good. When the water fell, people started planting      cotton and beans. We also had a lot of crawfish that year.''       Chassaniol's reach extends beyond the Cotton Capital as      he's sold cotton out of Louisiana and Arkansas and in the      hills of Mississippi beyond the       ``My favorite part of the business is in the fall when      we're busy but with the markets it's a year-round business      and you have to watch it every day. When my father and      grandfather did it, it was three months--October to      December,'' he said. ``It's been a challenge as I've seen my      acres decrease over the years but I've got some people coming      back who haven't planted cotton in five[[Page S4024]]     years. You're going to lose some customers and you're going      to pick some up.''       As the Chassaniol women married, many of those joined the      cotton business including the McCurdy part of the family.      McSpadden knows that the kingly crop brought and kept her      Chassaniol family close together.       ``I am extremely proud of my entire Chassaniol family. They      are wonderful people and we've stayed close over the years.      Daddy had six brothers and sisters. We have all stayed close.      There were 22 grandchildren. Even though we are scattered      around we always know what's going on and we keep in touch.''       With the parents working long hours in the business, they      made sure the kids made it to their extracurricular events      over the years as well.       ``They had this older man, Sidney Matlock (a porter who      worked in the sample room) started with momma and daddy. He      was somebody that was big in our lives. Momma couldn't get      away to take us to Girl Scouts, well they'd send Sidney to      take us,'' she said.       ``I worked with Sidney for a number of years and he was      there until his health failed and he retired. We probably      opened 100s of thousands of samples of cotton,'' Emmett      said. ``That's how you sold cotton back then. He was a pretty      good judge of cotton himself.''       Chassaniol has relied on his secretary, Penny Kesterson for      the past 16 years to keep his office a success and running      smoothly.       ``She is invaluable in the office she pulls in our      electronic data warehouse receipts and classing info. She      does the recaps invoicing and sees to wire transfers, plus      other clerical duties,'' he said. ``I could not do without      her.''       100 years of working in the cotton business with plenty      more to come--the Chassaniol family of                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-17-pt1-PgS4022-2.txt,213,CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS,2017.0,17.0,June
3069,topic-id,558,"Mr.Chairman, I thank Ranking Member Conyers for yielding me time. Mr.Chair, I share your grief over last night's loss. Sorry about that.  Mr.Chairman, this bill is a loss, too. It is a loss to people who have been injured by defective drugs, defective medical devices, been harmed in nursing homes, or been harmed by medical malpractice because it sets a cap on noneconomic damages of $250,000, no matter whom the person is, whatever their position was, no matter what damages they suffered.  Trial lawyers aren't the most liked people in They are a little bit above Congress people, I think, but it is right in there with used car salesmen. None of the three of us are doing real good. So it is easy to kind of beat us up.  But people like their doctors. I see Roe over there. People like doctors. Doctors provide healthcare, if they are allowed to by Federal law and given the opportunity to get reimbursed and have a system. People don't generally like trial lawyers. But the fact is, trial lawyers do a public service because they represent people. When they do it on contingency fees, they do it for people who wouldn't have the money to hire a lawyer, necessarily, but have been harmed. And they go in on the idea that sometimes they will get nothing, but if they win, they get a contingency fee, and they give representation to people who otherwise couldn't afford it.  When they win, they win because a jury--which is like a little focus group of America--says there was a duty that the doctor breached and a harm done to the patient and the patient should be compensated.  My chairman says this is just like California, and there he goes again with that Reagan stuff. Reagan was 40 years ago, I think, 35 years ago. Californians thought this isn't California's law. This goes further than California on joint liability. The fact is, when you eliminate joint and several liability in certain places, a certain part of it is California, a certain part of it isn't, it is less likely that the injured party is going to be able to collect.  It goes further in terms of setting a statute of limitations, but the big picture is States' rights. Normally, the folks on the other side of the aisle are all for States' rights. They are for States' rights when it comes to voting rights. They are for States' rights when it comes to civil rights. They are for States' rights on all kinds of things that generally tend to tamp down the lower economic folk in our country, particularly in the  But here on medical malpractice, which has always been a province of the States, they want to usurp it and make a Federal standard that applies to everybody.  If a State hasn't set a cap on damages, then the Federal cap of $250,000 would go into place. So if you have a State that says it is unconstitutional to have a cap because you have got a right to a jury trial, then you might not be able to have that cap, and you will have this $250,000 cap set.  There are all kinds of problems with Federalism, all kinds of problems with people who have been injured getting compensated, and other problems.

3104,topic-id,669,"Mr.Chairman, the amendment does even more damage than the bill does because it makes it possible that there will be even less time for a plaintiff, once they are aware of their injury, to bring action.  This is something that lessens the statute of limitations. That is what the bill is trying to do, is to see that less people get their opportunity to get to court, which is what statute of limitations are intended to do. That is the purpose.  When somebody has been injured from a medical malpractice case or negligence from a nursing home, we should encourage people to get relief and let a jury decide.  These bills--and I suspect these amendments because they are aimed at the same thing--are opposed by the AFL-CIO; the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees; the American Bar Association--not exactly a liberal lion--the Center for Justice and Democracy; and the National Conference of State Also, because this is a foray into federalism--unheard of before, making this a Federal issue, not a State issue--the Consumer Federation of America, the Consumers Unions, Public Citizen, and Vietnam Veterans of There are many other groups as well.  This amendment does more to see that folks don't get access to a jury. And the irony of it is that the national Republican effort seems to be to talk badly about Washington and Congress and drain the swamp and believe in the individuals back home and folks at home.  Well, the most pure form of justice comes from a jury where you have a jury of your peers in your own community who are chosen to determine what happened, to determine the facts, and to determine the damages. Instead, they are proposing that the Republicans in Congress know better what to do to put limits on what a jury can award their fellow citizens.  And they are also putting limitations on the statute of limitations and lessening that, and on joint and several liability, which go toward helping people who have gotten judgments be able to collect on judgments, which is so important. A judgment is no good unless you can collect on it. It is just counter to what the Republican Party philosophy generally is and has been, that I have kind of perceived recently, about being against Washington and laws coming on down high from Washington, D.                             {time}  1530  Much of what we heard at our discussion from a gentleman from West Virginia was about a West Virginia law. That is what you are supposed to have is a West Virginia law. Then somebody else talked about a Texas law, and they are holding up a California law.  Each State is supposed to make its own laws. We have got 50 They[[Page H5276]]talk a lot about the 50 States and the electoral college, and the States have an important function in our system of government. They are supposed to be areas where they have provinces and act. Juries, jury trials, and trial courts, that is all State law, and that should be determined by West Virginia, Texas, California, and Florida, not up here.  This bill, when it went through committee, passed by one vote because a couple of folks--I think it was Judge Poe and Judge Gohmert; I am pretty sure it was the two of them--two judges from the State of Texas felt it went too far in encroaching on the States' province dealing with tort law. This amendment just goes the same direction.  This is just unfortunate that what we are trying to do is help, really, insurance companies; it is not so much doctors. Doctors might benefit some, but it is the insurance companies that would benefit the most, and that is who this is about.  So we oppose the amendment and we oppose the bill. We support the American people and the right of the people and the juries to dispense justice that the facts dictate and that justice demands.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr.Chairman, this is called the Protecting Access to Care Act, but that is really a misnomer because the purpose of these amendments in the bill takes as a given that there are going to be allegations that doctors, medical device companies--not exactly limited financial resources or in potential for harm--and nursing homes are going to be alleged to have committed torts against individuals and that when that happens, if this becomes law, there will be less opportunity for individuals to get their day in court.  Because most people in the United States are not wealthy, most of the people that get injured not being wealthy are going to bear the brunt of this when they don't get to court within the statute of limitations or they don't collect because of the joint and several liability changes in the law or they get less with noneconomic damages because of the $250,000 cap.  Who is going to benefit from this? Who is going to benefit? It is going to be the person who a jury has found to have been negligent and violated their duty of care: a nursing home, a medical device company, or a physician. They are going to have less damages, less judgments against them, and less costs. Insurance companies can then make more money, and doctors will have lesser premiums.  Who loses? People who have been injured by medical device defective merchandise, nursing home negligence, or medical malpractice.  We are not talking about limiting damages and the ability to recover by having a lesser joint and several liability law. We are not talking about people who have not gotten a judgment. We are talking about people who have gotten a judgment for negligence.  Just like the Republican healthcare bill, this gives billions of dollars to the richest people in America with tax cuts at the expense of poor people who get Medicaid, people with disabilities, pregnant women, poor people, and seniors in nursing homes. They suffer.  This is a microcosm of the healthcare proposals that the Senate can't get 50 votes for--and they didn't even try for 60, which they normally do, because they knew it was not going to be that sufficient, but now they can't even get 50 under reconciliation--and it is a microcosm of hurting the poor and enriching the rich.  These are cases where there will be judgments--juries finding negligence, harm, and damages--if you get to the courthouse on time, and then you won't be able to collect as much.  So who wins? The rich, the medical device companies, the nursing homes, and the physicians. Who loses? Those who have suffered, those whom juries have found to be victims, and victims who should be able to collect but we are limiting how much they can collect and we are making it more difficult for them to collect.  That is not what this Congress should be doing is enriching the wealthy and hurting those who have been harmed by negligence.

It also says you have got to be in practice for the previous year. If somebody is not in practice and they are a professor at a medical school and maybe the outstanding expert on cardiovascular diseases, and they happen to be someplace like Harvard, they wouldn't be able to go to a State that is not contiguous to If they weren't practicing, they wouldn't be able to be an expert at all.  These arbitrary time limits, arbitrary requirements, and arbitrary demographic limitations are not aimed at justice or saving costs. They are aimed at reducing the number of experts who might be available.  In a State, it is more difficult to get an expert to come testify because you may get ostracized by your fellow professionals. It might be easier for a plaintiff to find an expert from a State that is a little bit of a distance.  I am not that familiar with Does it touch maybe Vermont and New Hampshire? It kind of limits itself, too. In Tennessee, you would have 9 or 10 States; in Alaska, none; Hawaii, none; Maine, two. Minnesota has got to be limited because we wouldn't go to Canada because that is not part of our system.  Of course, this isn't really part of our system either because our system is a Federal system, where we give States the right to make these decisions and not make them up in Washington with a one-size-fits-all way to stop people who have been damaged by medical malpractice, medical device defects, or nursing home negligence from getting whole compensation.

3126,topic-id,906,"Mr.Chairman, this amendment prohibits the introduction of apologies as evidence of liability, imposes on States the qualifications for expert witnesses in a healthcare lawsuit, requires plaintiffs to obtain a certificate of merit from a healthcare professional in order to pursue a healthcare lawsuit, and has a 90-day pre-suit notification requirement.  This amendment is very, very difficult in that it says that, if you apologize, a doctor apologizes, the hope is that the doctor can apologize and the patient may think: Oh, he apologized. That is nice. I won't sue him. But then if you decide to sue him or her, you can't put that apology in evidence against him. So it is kind of maybe crocodile tears, a crocodile apology.  But it also requires a plaintiff to get a certificate of merit from a healthcare professional to pursue a healthcare lawsuit--not from a lawyer, but from a healthcare professional. You have got to go to the fraternity to sue a fellow fraternity brother. That is a strange one.  This amendment would add numerous problematic provisions that significantly expand this bill beyond what was even discussed in the Judiciary Committee and in Rules, and it violates State sovereignty, all without any proper legislative vetting before coming to the floor. This is the first I have seen it or I think anybody has seen this proposal--not necessarily regular order.  Its apology provision is overly broad and undermines the legal right of patients. This provision states any apology by a healthcare provider given to a patient or their family is inadmissible for any purpose as evidence of liability or an admission against interest. If it is a true apology, it should be admitted, but it won't be.  The purpose of so-called apology laws that occur sometimes at the State level, which is where they should be, is to encourage a doctor to apologize to the patient for any harm while preserving that patient's ability to offer evidence of wrongdoing. Yet this amendment upends this balance by prohibiting the admission of all expressions of empathy or apology for any purpose of evidence or admission of liability.  This overbroad language undermines the patient's ability to offer evidence that he or she was harmed by wrongdoing. By making inadmissible admissions of fault by the provider, the amendment goes further than many State laws that do not prohibit admissions of fault and would still allow apology evidence to be used for purposes other than proving liability, such as impeaching a witness.[[Page H5281]]  Second, the amendment imposes highly restrictive expert witness qualifications on State courts, which we just discussed with Mr.Roe's amendment. This amendment requires the expert witness to be an exact carbon copy of the defendant. The expert must teach or practice in the same specialty and must have been doing so at the time of the occurrence that forms the basis of the lawsuit and for 1 year preceding the occurrence.  Under this provision, someone with 30 years of professional experience may not qualify; whereas, a person with 1 year of experience could qualify as an expert. Indeed, this rule excludes retired professionals, many academics, and researchers from testifying as experts. It should be up to a judge in the courtroom or to a State that has province over this jurisdiction, not the Federal  Third, this amendment imposes further burdens on injured plaintiffs beyond the already onerous requirements of the underlying bill before they can even file a lawsuit. The amendment requires an injured patient to obtain a certificate from a healthcare professional attesting to the legal merit of the case. This requires injured plaintiffs to find a healthcare professional, not a lawyer, to evaluate the legal merits of the case at the time of filing--closed frat house.  Certificates of merit are a costly, unnecessary obstacle and only serve to block injured plaintiffs access to the courts. There is little proof that such requirements reduce frivolous litigation or costs to medical providers, and certainly they don't help people who have been harmed by negligent treatment.  This requirement overrides State supreme court decisions in Arizona, Arkansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Washington, which held that similar lawsuit certification laws violated their State constitutions.  The amendment also requires an injured plaintiff to provide a healthcare provider 90 days' written notice before commencing the lawsuit. This notice requirement is another unnecessary hurdle intended to increase the cost of litigation for injured plaintiffs and dissuade them from filing suit. There is scant evidence that such notice reduces frivolous litigation or facilitates the compensation of the injured party.  Finally, the amendment represents the extreme intrusion on States' rights, which this whole bill does, and is such a flip from the normal Republican thought processes.  Each previously described provision includes the so-called State flexibility provisions in an attempt to brush off federalism concerns that these provisions are mostly one-way preemptive. They only preserve State laws that mirror the amendments' requirements and State laws which include requirements in addition to those imposed by the amendment. While it preserves State notice requirements, it overrides State laws that do not have such.  The States, not Congress, should determine the qualifications for appearing as an expert witness in State court proceedings, determine the appropriate uses of apology evidence, and decide whether certificates are proper or not.  For these reasons, I, unfortunately, have to oppose the amendment by my good friend Mr.Hudson, who is a great Tar  I yield back the balance of my time.

3134,topic-id,661,"Mr.Chairman, this is incongruous with the rest of the discussion we have had. It is consistent in that it is an attempt to say that people who have been harmed won't be able to recover, and it makes it harder to recover; and it protects the physicians--and the people--who basically are determined to have been negligent.  But, it says that, it is an affirmative defense to any healthcare liability claim--that is not just to a doctor. A healthcare liability claim could be to a nursing home or a medical device company--where the defendant complied with a clinical practice guideline developed by a national or State medical society or medical specialty society that is applicable.  They have just argued that for the plaintiff to have an expert witness, that expert witness has to come from the State where the action is brought, or a contiguous But, for the defendant, you can have a national practice guideline as an affirmative defense. So when you are in Memphis, you can't get an expert witness from Harvard or the University of Michigan or the University of Southern California because those States aren't contiguous, but the physician could get a medical society's or a national society's perspective and have it be an affirmative offense.  It is inconsistent. The whole purpose of this law is inconsistency, to give an advantage to those who have much and who do harm at the expense of those who have been harmed and have less. We see this continual attack on the poor and the injured.  In the healthcare bill, we talk about less opportunity because of diminution in Medicaid for the poor, disabled, seniors, and pregnant women to get healthcare. Here, we are talking about people who have been injured--actually, in fact, injured. And we are saying that a medical society's rule should be an affirmative defense, no matter where they are. We limit the experts you can have, and we limit the damages you can collect.  And this isn't to some specious group. This is to people who have actually been injured, and the juries in their home districts have found them to be plaintiffs who proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant tort fees, or doctor, nursing home, or medical device company, breached the standard of care to which they were held to. It is giving them protections of the law given by Washington, almighty  Once again, I submit to you that the swamp is not being drained but is overflowing to flood the courthouses and not allow justice to come to those who have been harmed by negligence. For time and memorial, it has been the province of the States, the Tenth Tort liability and court systems should be determined by legislators and bar associations, maybe medical societies, but back home, not national medical specialty societies or national medical societies as defenses, which is what this particular amendment brings forth.  I heard my friend from Tennessee say that in Tennessee, 60 percent of the verdicts go to lawyers. That is not true. He first talked about a law passed in 2008, that limits attorneys' fees. So since then, it certainly has not been 60 percent, and even before then it wasn't 60 percent. The typical contingency fee is a third, and nothing if you don't win, and there are great expenses incurred.  This is closing the courthouse door to injured parties who juries have found to be injured and limiting their access to recovery. This allows a national medical society to be a part of a fraternity to give an affirmative defense to another frat brother.  I oppose the amendment, I oppose the bill, and I am in favor of an open and free court system that punishes malfeasance and rewards those who have been injured by people who do not practice up to the standard of care that is dictated for them in their own  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

As a teenager, he often found himself in reform school after committing petty crimes. By the age of 20, he was serving time, as Mr.DeSantis said, in a California prison. It was that experience, however, that helped him turn his life around.  In prison, Merle Haggard rediscovered his love of music, and later put his talent to work on the Bakersfield club circuit. By singing about poverty, the struggles of the ordinary man and woman, and how music saved him during dark times, he captured the imagination and the attention of the entire country, and had 38 number one country hits.

Mr.Speaker, when you take a look back at American history, you can see figures standing tall who spoke for the everyday working man. Following the long tradition of Whitman and Twain, Merle Haggard was a man who knew America instinctively because he lived an American life. It wasn't a life of the movies, but it was all the more compelling because it was all the more real. That is the reason they called him ``The Poet of the Common Man.''  Merle Haggard didn't have it easy. At the height of the Depression, his family searched for opportunity out Merle grew up with little means and lived with a past of mistakes and regrets.  So he sang. He sang in ``Branded Man'' of the stigma of prison, crooning ``I held my head up high, determined I would rise above the shame.''  He sang in ``Working Man Blues'' of the grind of doing his duty to his family, ``working as long as my two hands are fit to use.''  And he sang of his roots, not of power or wealth or status, but of pride in being ``an Okie from Muskogee,'' a place of leather boots, football, and Old  He found success and, more importantly, redemption in the music he shared with his country.  Now, the Bakersfield Sound changed country music, and it is a testament to Merle Haggard's talent that when you listen to his hits, from ``Branded Man'' to ``Mama Tried,'' to ``Big City,'' to ``Working Man Blues,'' or even to ``Okie from Muskogee,'' you not only hear the hardship and wisdom of a well-lived life, but you can hear the roots of so much of the music we still listen to today.  From a man who went from Bakersfield High School to San Quentin prison, to the Country Music Hall of Fame, a building doesn't seem like much. But I hope that when people pass by the Merle Haggard Post Office Building in[[Page H5403]]downtown Bakersfield, they will remember an icon of our community, an artist who never backed down, a man whose honesty above his own failings and willingness to pick himself back up inspired music that lifts our spirits and feeds our souls.

3065,topic-id,364,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, H.1215 will do little to protect Americans' access to safe and affordable healthcare. Instead, it will deny victims of medical malpractice and defective medical products the opportunity to be fully compensated for their injuries and to hold wrongdoers accountable.  This legislation imposes various restrictions on lawsuits against healthcare providers concerning the provision of healthcare goods or services that would apply regardless of the merits of the case, the misconduct at issue, or the severity of the victim's injury.  There are so many problems with this bill, but to begin with, this bill would cause real harm by severely limiting the ability of victims to be made whole. For instance, the bill's $250,000 aggregate limit for noneconomic damages, an amount established more than[[Page H5264]]40 years ago pursuant to a California statute, would have a particularly adverse impact on women, children, the poor, and other vulnerable members of our society.  These groups are more likely to receive noneconomic damages in healthcare cases because they are less able to establish lost wages and other economic losses. Women, for example, are often paid at a lower rate than men, even for the same job. Also, they are more likely to suffer noneconomic loss, such as disfigurement or loss of fertility. Imposing a severe limit on noneconomic damages, therefore, hurts them disproportionately.                              {time}  1415  Finally, this bill is particularly harmful for veterans, members of the military, and their families. Because the bill prevents State tort law in any healthcare-related lawsuit that includes any coverage provided by a Federal health program, all cases arising from substandard care received in a Veterans Administration facility or a military hospital would be subject to the bill's restrictions.  As a diverse coalition of veterans organizations noted in their letter of opposition, H.1215 would limit the ability of veterans and military families to hold healthcare providers, drug manufacturers, and medical products providers accountable for pain and suffering and death that result from substandard care, preventable medical errors, and defective drugs and devices.

2885,topic-id,823,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak about the Countering Iran's Destabilizing Activities Act of 2017, which passed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last month by a vote of 18 to 3.  I would like to thank the members of our committee and the coauthors of this bill for working in a constructive, bipartisan fashion to craft this legislation. I think it is a good example of how the Senate can still work together to tackle complex and difficult issues.  I was in the SCIF recently--it is a place where Senators go to read classified information--reviewing intelligence. It truly is astounding--I know the Acting President pro tempore knows this well--what Iran continues to do around the world. For a people who are capable of so much, their foreign policy is shockingly counter to their own interests. We see destabilizing act after destabilizing act, from missile launches to arms transfers, to terrorist training, to illicit financial activities, to targeting Navy ships and detaining American citizens. The list goes on and on, and it is past time for us to take steps to protect the interests of the United States and our allies.  This bill is the first time Congress has come together since the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear deal, to do just that. For far too long the agreement--which I strongly opposed, as did our ranking member, as did our Acting President pro tempore--has dictated U.policy throughout the Middle  It is worth noting that the JCPOA is not unlike the Paris climate accord. I don't think many people in our country nor many people in this body realize it is a nonbinding political agreement that was entered into by one man using Presidential Executive authority and can easily be undone by one man using Presidential Executive authority. In fact, in many ways it is easier than the Paris accords, considering the President doesn't have to take action to exit this agreement. I don't think most Americans understand that he doesn't even have to take action to exit the agreement. All he has to do is decline to waive sanctions. I think that has been missed. I know the Acting President pro tempore is very aware of that. I know the ranking member is very aware of that. No matter what the President decides, this bill makes it clear that Congress intends to remain involved and will hold Iran accountable for their nonnuclear destabilizing activities.  What the nuclear agreement failed to do was allow us to push back against terrorism, human rights issues, there are violations of U.Security Council resolutions relative to ballistic missile testing, and to push back against conventional arms purchases which they are not supposed to be involved in. As many of us predicted at the time, Iran's rogue behavior has only escalated since implementation of the agreement, and this bipartisan bill will give the administration tools for holding Tehran accountable.  Let me say this. I don't think there is anybody in this Chamber who doesn't believe the Trump administration--and I know there has been a lot of disagreements recently about foreign policy issues in the administration--but I don't think there is anybody here who believes they are not going to do everything they can to push back against these destabilizing activities. What we will be doing today and tomorrow with passage of this legislation is standing hand in hand with them as they do that. It also sends an important signal that the United States will no longer look the other way in the face of continued Iran aggression.  I want to recognize the important work of my colleagues in making this legislation possible. Senator Menendez has been a champion for holding Iran accountable in this bill but also in decades of work on this issue. He is truly an asset to the Senate, and I thank him for his commitment to many issues but especially this one. Senators Cotton, Rubio, and Cruz all played an important role in crafting this legislation as well.  Finally, let me say this. This would not have been possible without the support and tireless effort of the ranking member, Senator Cardin, and his great staff. It has truly been a pleasure for me to work with him on the Russia bill that we will be voting on today at 2 p.m. but also this legislation--we have come from two very different places, representing two very different States, and yet are joined by the fact that we care deeply about making sure the foreign policy of this country is in the national interests of our citizens and that we as a Congress and as U.Senators are doing everything we can to help write positive foreign policy. I thank him for that, and I am proud of the strong bipartisan momentum behind this legislation, which his leadership has helped to happen, and I look forward to passage of this bill.

SENSE OF SENATE ON THE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF                    ARTICLE 5 OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:       (1) The principle of collective defense of the North      Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is immortalized in      Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty in which members      pledge that ``an armed attack against one or more of them in      Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against      them all''.       (2) For almost 7 decades, the principle of collective      defense has effectively served as a strategic deterrent for      the member nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization      and provided stability throughout the world, strengthening      the security of the United States and all 28 other member      nations.       (3) Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in      New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania, the Alliance agreed      to invoke Article 5 for the first time, affirming its      commitment to collective defense.       (4) Countries that are members of the North Atlantic Treaty      Organization have made historic contributions and sacrifices      while combating terrorism in Afghanistan through the      International Security Assistance Force and the Resolute      Support       (5) The recent attacks in the United Kingdom underscore the      importance of an international alliance to combat hostile      nation states and terrorist groups.       (6) At the 2014 NATO summit in Wales, the member countries      of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization decided that all      countries that are members of NATO would spend an amount      equal to 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense      by 2024.       (7) Collective defense unites the 29 members of the North      Atlantic Treaty Organization, each committing to protecting      and supporting one another from external adversaries, which      bolsters the North Atlantic       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate--       (1) to express the vital importance of Article 5 of the      North Atlantic Treaty, the charter of the North Atlantic      Treaty Organization, as it continues to serve as a critical      deterrent to potential hostile nations and terrorist      organizations;       (2) to remember the first and only invocation of Article 5      by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in support of the      United States after the terrorist attacks of September 11,      2001;       (3) to affirm that the United States remains fully      committed to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and will      honor its obligations enshrined in Article 5; and       (4) to condemn any threat to the sovereignty, territorial      integrity, freedom, or democracy of any country that is a      member of the North Atlantic Treaty  ",CREC-2017-06-14-pt1-PgS3462-3.txt,1825,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,14.0,April

SHORT       This Act may be cited as the ``Vietnam Human Rights      Sanctions Act of 2017''.     2.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The relationship between the United States and the      Socialist Republic of Vietnam has grown substantially since      the end of the trade embargo in 1994, with annual trade      between the countries reaching more than $36,000,000,000 in      2014.       (2) However, the transition by the Government of Vietnam      toward greater economic activity and trade, which has led to      increased bilateral engagement between the United States and      Vietnam, has not been matched by greater political freedom or      substantial improvements in basic human rights for the people      of       (3) Vietnam remains an authoritarian state ruled by the      Communist Party of Vietnam, which continues to deny the right      of the people of Vietnam to participate in free and fair      elections.       (4) According to the Department of State's 2014 Country      Reports on Human Rights Practices, Vietnam's ``most      significant human rights problems . . . were severe      government restrictions of citizens' political rights,      particularly their right to change their government through      free and fair elections; limits[[Page S4058]]     on citizens' civil liberties, including freedom of assembly      and expression; and inadequate protection of citizens' due      process rights, including protection against arbitrary      detention''.       (5) The Country Reports also state that the Government of      Vietnam ``continued to restrict speech that criticized      individual government leaders; promoted political pluralism      or multi-party democracy; or questioned policies on sensitive      matters, such as human rights, religious freedom, or      sovereignty disputes with China'' and ``sought to impede      criticism by monitoring meetings and communications of      political activists''.       (6) Furthermore, the Department of State documents that      ``arbitrary arrest and detention, particularly for political      activists, remained a problem'', with the Government of      Vietnam sentencing 29 arrested activists during 2014. Of      those, 6 activists were convicted on national security      charges in the penal code for ``undermining the unity      policy'', 17 for ``causing public disorder'', and 6 for      ``abusing democratic freedoms''.       (7) At the end of 2014, the Government of Vietnam      reportedly held more than 125 political prisoners.       (8) On September 24, 2012, 3 prominent Vietnamese      bloggers--Nguyen Van Hai (also known as Dieu Cay), Ta Phong      Tan, and Phan Thanh Hai (also known as Anh Ba Saigon)--were      sentenced to prison based on 3-year-old blog postings      criticizing the Government and leaders of Vietnam and the      Communist Party of Nguyen Van Hai served 2 years of      a 12-year prison sentence on charges of ``conducting      propaganda against the state'' but was later released and      departed from If he were to return, he would likely      have to complete his prison sentence.       (9) United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi      Pillay responded to the sentencing of the bloggers on      September 25, 2012, stating that ``[t]he harsh prison terms      handed down to bloggers exemplify the severe restrictions on      freedom of expression in Vietnam'' and calling the sentences      an ``unfortunate development that undermines the commitments      Vietnam has made internationally . . . to protect and promote      the right to freedom of expression''.       (10) On March 21, 2013, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State      for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor Daniel Baer      testified before the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific      Affairs of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate      that ``in Vietnam we've been disappointed in recent years to      see backsliding, particularly on . . . freedom of expression      issues . . . people are being prosecuted for what they say      online under really draconian national security laws . . .      that is an issue that we continue to raise, both in our human      rights dialogue with the Vietnamese as well as in other      bilateral engagements''.       (11) Although the Constitution of Vietnam provides for      freedom of religion, the Department of State's 2013      International Religious Freedom Report maintains,      ``Government practices and bureaucratic impediments      restricted religious freedom. Unregistered and unrecognized      religious groups were often subject to harassment, as well as      coercive and punitive actions by authorities.''.       (12) Likewise, the United States Commission on      International Religious Freedom 2015 Annual Report states,      ``The Vietnamese government continues to control all      religious activities through law and administrative      oversight, restrict severely independent religious practice,      and repress individuals and religious groups it views as      challenging its authority, including independent Buddhists,      Hoa Hao, Cao Dai, Catholics, and Protestants.''.       (13) The 2013 Annual Report notes that in 2004 the United      States designated Vietnam as a country of particular concern      for religious freedom pursuant to section 402(b)(1) of the      International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.     6442(b)(1)), and that Vietnam responded at that time by      releasing prisoners, prohibiting the policy of forced      renunciations of faith, and expanding protections for      religious groups, and that ``[m]ost religious leaders in      Vietnam attributed these positive changes to the [country of      particular concern] designation and the priority placed on      religious freedom concerns in U.S.-Vietnamese bilateral      relations''.       (14) However, the 2013 Annual Report concludes that since      the designation as a country of particular concern was lifted      from Vietnam in 2006, ``religious freedom conditions in      Vietnam remain mixed'', and therefore recommends to the      Department of State that Vietnam should be redesignated as a      country of particular concern.       (15) Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Baer likewise      testified that ``[i]n Vietnam the right to religious freedom,      which seemed to be improving several years ago, has been      stagnant for several years''.     3. IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS ON CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS WHO                    ARE COMPLICIT IN HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES COMMITTED                    AGAINST NATIONALS OF VIETNAM OR THEIR FAMILY                          (a) Definitions.--In this section:       (1) Admitted; alien; immigration laws; national.--The terms      ``admitted'', ``alien'', ``immigration laws'', and      ``national'' have the meanings given those terms in section      101 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.1101).

2913,topic-id,1352,"Mr.President, let me join my friend, the senior Senator from Utah and President pro tempore of the Senate, in his remarks about the U.Capitol  All of us who work on Capitol Hill, all of our visitors who come here--our constituents from around the country--are in their debt because they literally do keep us safe and secure here on Capitol I do think the events this morning give rise to some additional concerns of what happens off the Hill, when ordinarily there might not be the sort of security measures in place that are necessary.  I think this is another wake-up call to all of us to be vigilant, to be aware of our situations, and to exercise concern for our own safety. Of course, we do need to continue to look at what the needs are of the Capitol Police, in terms of training and equipment and staffing, to make sure they can continue to do the outstanding job they have done here, yet again, this morning.  It is safe to say that without the Capitol Police being present, as a result of Congressman Scalise's location there at the Congressional Baseball Game practice, the results of this might have been much more serious--much more tragic--than they already were.  Of course, we are continuing to keep Congressman Scalise in our prayers. I was looking at the TV screen on the way out. It looks like he is out of surgery but is still in critical condition. Of course, we continue to think about him and his family and offer them our support and our prayers.  While there is a lot we do not know about this morning's incident, it is clear that this is a new environment we are living in, and we need to do everything we can to keep our constituents safe when they visit us on Capitol Hill as well as to keep safe all of the staff and everybody involved.  Mr.President, at a time when people do not believe anything bipartisan happens here in Washington, DC, I know we have seen a remarkable vote on these Iran-Russia sanctions with the vote of 97 to 2. Virtually every Republican Senator and virtually every Democratic Senator voted in favor of these sanctions which target two of the most aggressive regimes in the world.  The first is the Iranian regime, the 1 state sponsor of international terrorism. The second is the Russian regime, which, as we all know now, was so aggressively involved in trying to sow discord and chaos in the days leading up to the 2016 election.  It is staggering, really, to see the extent to which Russia has raised its game when it comes to disrupting core, democratic undertakings like elections. We know they are doing that in the United States, and we know they have attempted to do that in This is the way they operate. This is part of their tradecraft. Through a combination of cyber espionage, propaganda, the use of social media, and then unfortunately sometimes too gullible a mainstream media, we know false stories have somehow been elevated to a level at which people actually begin to believe them and cause them to distrust their own government. This is a real threat to the United States and to our democratic institutions.  The talk of the Russian collusion that led up to the election is fading because, as so many people have said, including distinguished Democratic leaders like Senator Feinstein, who served with distinction as chair of the Intelligence Committee and who serves on the Judiciary Committee and Intelligence Committee now, there is no evidence of there having been collusion in the election. What we need to turn to now is how we can countermeasure what Russia tried to do when it came to the so-called active measures, which was a combination of cyber espionage, the use of social media, and propaganda right here in our homeland.  We are a country that believes in freedom of speech and the First Amendment, and sometimes that makes us more vulnerable than perhaps others who have state-owned media because we let anybody who has a point of view express it freely. That is part of our It also means that aggressive, hostile regimes like Russia can take advantage of our open society and our freedoms to try to sow discord and distrust in our own country.  I hope, now that the allegations about collusion are fading, we will take a serious look at how to respond appropriately with countermeasures to this sort of aggressive action on the part of I am really pleased that with a vote of 97 to 2, we have voted to impose sanctions on the rogue nation of Iran and the rogue nation of                        PROTECT Our Children Act  Mr.President, in turning to another topic, earlier this year, with the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Nevada--Senator Blumenthal and Senator Heller--I introduced a bill that was called the PROTECT Our Children I am proud to see it is moving through the Senate this week.  This is an important piece of legislation that most people will not hear or read much about because it is not particularly controversial, but that does not mean it is not important, which is why I want to talk about it briefly. This bill helps to stop the exploitation of children across the country and over the internet by reauthorizing the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force  Years ago, when I was attorney general of Texas--from 1999 until the time I came to the Senate--we created in the Texas attorney general's office[[Page S3476]]something we called, quaintly, the Texas Internet Bureau, which was cutting edge for the time. Now it is more of a cyber crimes unit that deals with, frankly, a lot of the same subject matter--child exploitation, child pornography, and other crimes--which are committed using the medium of the internet. I had a chance to see, sadly, how vulnerable children can quickly become victimized at the hands of some truly despicable individuals as well as the resources it takes to stop and to prosecute these predators.  One of the things we did at the Texas Internet Bureau back in the 1999 to 2000 timeframe was to link up, of course, with local law enforcement officials, but what we learned is that every municipal police department or county sheriff's department has the kind of expertise and has the sort of equipment they need in order to combat this new type of crime.  Through a national network of 61 coordinated task forces that represent 3,500 Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies, we have now been able to comprehensively investigate and prosecute child predators. These task forces develop victim support programs, and they provide training and technical assistance and advanced forensic methods, which are very important when trying to track the online fingerprints or footsteps of these predators who operate online.  Through this legislation, these task forces will also help continue to facilitate community education, for example, by helping to inform parents and legal guardians what they can do to help protect their own children or the people for whom they are responsible.  Tragically, in this day and age, the internet's vast scope provides a dark, deep harbor for predators. Without the proper training and equipment, it can be difficult for our law enforcement officials to track down these child predators. This legislation ensures that they will have the resources they need to fight cyber crime and keep our communities safe by reauthorizing these important programs until the year 2022.  Last week's passage through the Judiciary Committee was the first key step. I am thankful for the work of my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Blumenthal, and one of our principal cosponsors, Senator Heller from I am hopeful we can keep moving forward with this legislation so we can get these essential programs reauthorized by passing this in the Senate and then moving it on through the House and swiftly to the President's desk for signature and enactment.

2928,topic-id,838,"Mr.President, I want to add to the voice of so many Senators today who expressed their prayers and concerns for the five Americans who were wounded today in a terrible shooting in Alexandria, VA: Steve Scalise, a friend of mine from the House of Representatives, someone who took a bet on me early in my first campaign, as a neighboring State, aspiring young candidate, and with whom I served for 2 years; Matt Mika, who represents the Tyson Foods, a great Arkansas institution, and whom I have known since the beginning of my days of politics; Zack Barth, a young House staffer; and Crystal Griner and David Bailey, two brave Capitol police officers who were on the scene.  We don't yet know all of the details of what happened this morning. Here is what we do know: If it weren't for the bravery of those Capitol police officers--not just Crystal and David but the others present--there might have been many more killed.  We all sit here safely engaged in the great debates of American democracy--whether we are a Senator or whether we are Americans watching it--because there are brave men and women literally standing guard at our doors with guns, willing to put their lives on the line to defend all of us.  I want to join so many other Senators today to express my gratitude to the Capitol Police, not just for protecting us--535 elected Members of Congress--but also for protecting all of the hundreds of thousands of Americans who come here every single day of the year to see their Congress and their Representatives doing the people's business.               Honoring Private First Class Larry Roberts  Mr.President, speaking of men who guard us with guns, I want to turn our attention to Arlington National After 74 years, an American patriot has finally come home.  PFC Larry Roberts, of Damascus, AK, was only 18 years old at the time of his final mission. It was November 1943--the height of World War Private Roberts had been assigned to the Special Weapons Group, 2nd Defense Battalion, Fleet Marine U.forces were making their way across the Pacific, island by island. That month, those marines landed on tiny Betio in the Tarawa Atoll of the Gilbert The mission? Take the island and advance on to Tokyo and victory. Private Roberts and his battle buddies performed brilliantly, but the fighting was fierce. One thousand marines and sailors were killed and 2,000 were wounded. The Japanese fought to the last man standing. In the end we won but at steep cost.  Private Roberts, like so many others, was killed on November 25, 1943. In the 2 years after the war, the 604th Quartermaster Graves Registration Company tried to recover all of the remains on the battlefield, but they never found any sign of Private In 1949, a military review board declared his remains nonrecoverable.  Just 2 years ago, the nonprofit History Flight discovered an until-then unknown burial site on the island and recovered remains of 35 marines who had died there. It took 2 years, but thanks to the amazing work of the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, we were able to identify the remains of Private First Class It was heartening news, especially to the Roberts family.  I am happy to say he has been laid to rest on American soil on our most hallowed ground--Arlington National I had the honor of attending his funeral earlier today. Now he rests amid the rolling green hills and the ghostly white crosses of that cemetery. I think it is more than fitting because his burial there is a symbol of what this one person, this young man so far away from home, did for our country. He gave his all-too-brief life in service to something greater than himself. He gave his life and service to his country. He gave all his tomorrows so you could have today and tomorrow.  I wanted to recognize him and his service on the Senate floor tonight. Standing here, I think of the words of the great British Parliamentarian William Gladstone: ``Show me the manner in which a nation cares for its dead and I will measure with mathematical exactness the tender mercies of its people, their respect for the laws of the land, and their loyalty to high ideals.''  To the men and women of our Armed Forces, I want you to know that if you are ever separated, captured, missing, or killed in action, our country will spare no expense and will suffer any burden to bring you back too.  PFC Larry Roberts died fighting for that highest ideal, that of freedom. He would have been 92 years old this year. It is because of him and his bravery and millions of Americans like him that our country is still here, still standing, still free, as it has been for 241 years.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

2942,topic-id,713,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in strong support of H.1808 to amend and improve the Missing Children's Assistance  Mr.Speaker, again, it is an honor to stand with my friend, Mr.Guthrie, in bipartisan support of this legislation which, again, makes some important changes to the existing law for the Center for Missing & Exploited Children, as my friend said, a program which was created in 1984. Sadly, it has not finished its mission.  Again, the FBI reports every year there are about 460,000 reports of missing children, and despite the best efforts of programs which NCMEC has operated over the many years, which include hotlines and public information campaigns, again, this is still a scourge which afflicts many families all across the country in Republican, Democratic, rural, suburban, and urban areas.  Again, this bill will basically update and modernize the language of the act[[Page H4455]]to recognize that there are new forms of threats and risks to minor children, such as human trafficking and online predators.                              {time}  1415  So it does three essential things:  Number one, it incorporates new terminology to align the law with these new threats, which I mentioned above, and strengthens protections for children at risk.  Number two, it clarifies that NCMEC is a nonprofit entity, which is an issue that has been ensnared in the courts. And, again, Congress' passage and enactment of this bill will clarify this critical issue.  And, lastly, it clarifies that NCMEC is a resource that provides technical assistance not just to law enforcement, but to families, community groups, schools, and the public at large.  Mr.Speaker, this last aspect of the bill is critically important. Last year, Congress passed Public Law 114-184, which President Obama signed into law, the Recovering Missing Children's It was a measure which I cosponsored with Mr.Paulsen from  This bill actually gave State and local police another tool in terms of recovering missing children. Incredibly, the Tax Code prevented State and local law enforcement from getting access to tax returns from adults who actually had abducted children.  So, incredibly, those adults were claiming these children, who were in their illegal custody, as a tax credit and a tax exemption, but State and local officials were barred by privacy provisions in the IRS code from actually accessing that information. So, on the one hand, you had one arm of government out looking for children and you had another arm of government who knew exactly where they were based on the tax returns which were filed.  Again, NCMEC is in the process of trying to disseminate this new tool, which an audit of the IRS demonstrated that there are roughly 2,000 tax returns a year where adult individuals are actually claiming children as a tax deduction, obviously, with their residence and identity included.  So, again, that is just another example of why we need to update and modernize the law.  I would just indicate on a personal level, my wife, Audrey, is a pediatric nurse practitioner. She works at the Children's Medical Center in Hartford, She is involved in a specialty clinic that helps children of sex abuse and human trafficking. She said that NCMEC is a frequent flier in their office. In the really important work that she and her colleagues do, they constantly use NCMEC as a way of trying to assist law enforcement in terms of helping children who are in these situations of human trafficking and who have been victims of online use of images, which is about as low a depraved activity that is out there right now. So, again, the work of this center, I can attest to from a personal level, is extremely important.  This legislation will update, modernize, and give tools to make sure that all of the good guys out there--the local State police and the folks in the healthcare sector--can really do everything they can to help families in this really terrible, horrific situation.

2905,topic-id,634,"Mr.I rise to speak on behalf of the Crapo-Brown-Corker-Cardin Countering Russian Aggression and Cyber Attacks Act of 2017. This is filed as amendment 232 to the pending Iran sanctions bill, and as has been indicated, we will vote on it in just a few minutes. This amendment is the result of a partnership between the Senate Banking Committee and Senate Foreign Relations  Amendment 232 ratchets up pressure against the Russian Federation for its illegal invasion and annexation of Crimea, its continuing escalation of violence in eastern Ukraine, and its malign cyber activities against businesses and citizens of the United It also provides Congress with strong oversight over almost any termination or suspension of these sanctions.  I spoke yesterday about the hard work of Senators Corker, Brown, Cardin, and their staffs. I thank them again for their leadership. I also thank Senators McCain, Graham, and Shaheen, who contributed to these efforts. I recognize our latest cosponsors, Senators Perdue, Menendez, Warren, Rubio, Scott, Heitkamp, Reed, and I appreciate their cosponsorship and support as well. We appreciate the leadership of Majority Leader McConnell and Democratic Leader Schumer, who helped ensure we could move a good Russia sanctions package. The need for this legislation is underlined by the fact that many Americans have deep concerns about Russia's behavior over the past few years.  Since coming to power, Russian President Putin has become increasingly belligerent, nationalistic, and autocratic. Americans are concerned about Russia's behavior in Ukraine and Syria, and they are concerned about Russia's increased cyber intrusions.  Many of us on both sides of the aisle feel the United States needs to be much stronger in its response to Americans want to see the United States stand firm in defense of our long-held values, which include respect for territorial integrity, human rights, and liberty.  The Crapo-Brown-Corker-Cardin amendment signals to the world that the United States has unflagging commitment to the sanctity of territorial integrity, human rights, and good governance. Our amendment also demonstrates our resolve in responding to cyber attacks against American citizens and entities and against our allies.  In summary, the Crapo-Brown-Corker amendment does the following things: It escalates and expands the current sanctions regime against Russia, it creates new sanctions against Russia, it engages Congress at a higher level than before by providing a mechanism for Congress to vote before lifting any sanctions on Russia, and it increases the Treasury Department's ability to track illicit finance, including illicit flows linked to  The amendment will result in some very powerful and new sanctions. Amendment 232 includes Congressional Review Act language to ensure Congress exerts proper oversight over the use of these powerful sanctions. It also requires the creation of a national strategy for combating the financing of terrorism and related forms of illicit finance. This strategy ensures that the United States pursues a coordinated and effective fight against illicit finance at all levels of the Russian  As we move forward with this amendment, we must engage all of our allies and our trading partners. It is important that we work together to minimize collateral damage and unintended consequences.  This is a strong bipartisan measure that, in important respects, represents the next step forward. Even though unilateral actions are not the best option, America must lead on the issue now and encourage others to follow. The times call for clarity of purpose and a correct amount of pressure. We have that in this amendment.  Again, thank you to Senators Corker, Brown, and Cardin for your hard work and support, and all of the other Senators I have mentioned. Thank you to our cosponsors, and especially to Leader McConnell and Democratic Leader Schumer for all of your help and your support. I look forward to passing this measure in short order.

2919,topic-id,578,"Mr.President, it has been more than 6 months since a major foreign adversary undertook a cyber act of war against our election.  The Russian attack sought to undermine faith in our democratic system and favor one candidate over another--[[Page S3480]]in this case, one seen as more favorable to the Kremlin's interests.  This was truly a historic event--one that requires a response of equal magnitude--not only to deter any such attacks on our future elections and those of our Western allies, but to make sure our election infrastructure is secure from any future cyber threats.  Unfortunately, President Trump has refused to even acknowledge the Russian act of cyber war and the Republican-controlled Congress has similarly refused to act to retaliate against Russia or strengthen our cyber defenses.  All the while, Russia has predictably continued its belligerent military and cyber actions against our NATO allies and Ukraine, as well as ongoing cyber attacks on the election of our democratic allies, most recently in  This should come as no surprise. We were warned by our own experts and our allies about the danger of American inaction.  For example, last month, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper warned, ``An American citizen should be very concerned about a foreign government, particularly our primary adversary, interfering with the most important foundational process that we have in this country, which is free and fair elections.'' And former FBI Director James Comey also recently warned about the Russians ``They're coming after America . . . They will be back.''  I heard the same warnings in Eastern Europe, where our allies starkly warned that Russia would feel emboldened to continue its attacks if the United States did not even respond to the attack on its own election. So I am understandably pleased that, at least this week, we are taking action to maintain and toughen sanctions against  This bill takes a number of long overdue steps, including codifying existing sanctions against Russia put in place by the Obama administration, adding new sanctions on Russia, and making it harder for President Trump to lift any sanctions on Russia without congressional review.  I think these are important steps we must take to respond to Russia and to protect our democracy, but they are not nearly enough.  We must also pass legislation to help protect against any such future attacks on our election and to safeguard our electoral infrastructure.  We must get to the bottom of questions regarding possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the  We must be prepared for President Trump to use the waivers and designation authority granted to him in this bill to ultimately do little to nothing to toughen sanctions against  You see, the way we usually write sanctions language is to instruct that the ``President shall'' take such action as described and then provide a national security waiver.  Well, this President has spent more time trying to endear himself to the Russians than warning them to never attack our Nation again. In fact, this President continues to deny that there was a Russian attack on our election. What can we expect this President to do with the discretion given in this bill dealing with these exact issues?  I hope he does the right thing to protect our national security and democratic system from foreign attack, but I and others will be watching to make sure he does and ready with additional measures if he does not.

Dan began his service to Orland Park in 1983 as a village trustee. A decade later, he was elected mayor and would go on to serve for six terms. In 1995, Mayor McLaughlin created the Orland Park Open Lands program, which preserved nearly 300 acres of open space, two family farms, and created the village's nature center. In the same year, he completed the Orland Park Veterans Each Memorial and Veterans Day, the village gathers at the memorial, Ara Pace--Place of Peace, at the Orland Park Village Center--and adds the names of veterans to the granite wall surrounding the memorial. It is a wonderful tribute that allows residents of Orland Park to thank those who bravely served our country.  During his tenure, Mayor McLaughlin also brought the community together through an increase in village sponsored events and outdoor concerts. He believed in fitness for fun, and his leadership helped save the Orland Park Health and Fitness Center, created Centennial Park West, and expanded the aquatic center, which now includes ice skating, sledding, a dog park, and bicycle paths.  His governing philosophy was simple, ``plan for people not cars.'' That vision led to a pedestrian-friendly center in the heart of downtown Orland Park in the historic 143rd train station, where people can come together to play and work. Throughout his career, Mayor McLaughlin grew Orland Park's economy by marketing the I-80 corridor, helping to bring in new businesses while retaining the ones already thriving in the village.  Mayor McLaughlin has been honored by numerous organizations, including the American Institute of Architects; Chaddick Institute; Chicago Magazine; Chicago Southland Convention & Visitors' Bureau; Congress of New Urbanism; Government Finance Officers Association; Home Builders Association of Greater Chicago; Illinois Arts Council; Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police; Metropolitan Mayors Caucus; Moraine Valley Community College; the Chicago Building Congress; the United States Conference of Mayors; and the United States Green Building Council--just to name a few.

It has been very clear, as has been stated by all of my colleagues, from healthcare to food policy, to education, to affordable housing, the President and his party continue to look for ways to take away what we have come to know as fundamental programs behind building stronger neighborhoods.  Our Nation is facing challenging times and we simply cannot afford to carry on business as usual. From the nooses found at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture to the racial slur spray-painted on LeBron James' house during the NBA finals and attacks against Jewish community centers and vandalism in Jewish cemeteries, our country and our globe are sadly seeing horrific increases in discrimination and racially biased incidents.  King always said: We have come over here in different boats, but we are now in the same boat.  I really mean just that. Think about it: an attack against one of us is an attack against all of us. We know we have come a long way in our fight against racial intolerance and hate in our country, but our journey continues. It doesn't matter if you are Black, Jewish, Hispanic, or We are stronger together when we celebrate both our similarities and our differences.  When we watch the news, it is incredibly upsetting to see what is still happening in 2017. A little over a week ago at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture here in D.C., we found another noose on the Smithsonian grounds. The museum's founding director said: ``It is a painful reminder of the challenges that African Americans continue to face.''  We know that we are not only seeing violence and intolerance against the African-American community, but it is everywhere. This year at the Mount Carmel Cemetery, a Jewish cemetery just outside of my district in northeast Philadelphia, countless tombstones were toppled and vandalized. Days after this, the JCC in Wynnewood in my district received a bomb threat.  These are just a few of the truly cowardly acts of violence taking place in our neighborhoods, yet our Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, and the President claim to be tough on crime. They want to put more people in cities behind bars.  This weekend, Mr.Speaker, I was the keynote speaker at Gaudenzia, an addiction treatment and recovery center in my district. The graduates are some of the strongest individuals in our city, and their stories of perseverance and hard work are truly inspiring. I always say: Where you start is not where you end up.  Throughout my career, I have been dedicated to trying to find ways to build stronger neighborhoods block by block. To do this, we have to make good jobs, great schools, and access to healthcare a reality.  We know the tradition and reentry back into our neighborhoods isn't always easy. In Philadelphia, ShopRite supermarket is hiring to give good-paying jobs to those who formerly were incarcerated. The company estimates they have given over 500 jobs to formerly incarcerated individuals. This is the result in one city.  Sadly, we know that racism and bigotry are still a factor in our communities. We have to confront this head-on. As the Congressional Black Caucus[[Page H4844]]collectively stands here today, we will not accept what is taking place. We are prepared to face these challenges, and we are asking others to join us because we recognize that we can move this country forward, but it will take all of us.  So what we are doing here today is raising the awareness because we must have this conversation in a public way. We must deal with this issue of racism, noninclusion, and discrimination. No longer can we accept this.  Mr.Speaker, I say to you today: As a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, we are prepared to do our part.

The resulting explosion sank the ship and claimed the lives of 1,177 servicemembers.  During the unimaginable chaos and carnage, Joe George displayed stunning composure and courage. Joe spotted six sailors trapped in the control tower of the sinking These men were severely burned, and they were searching for a way to safety. The six wounded sailors were Seaman First Class Harold Kuhn, Seaman First Class Russell Lott, Gunner's Mate Third Class Earl Riner, Boatswain's Mate Second[[Page S4776]]Class Alvin Dvorak, Seaman First Class Donald Stratton, and Fire Controlman Third Class Lauren  Upon seeing the men, Joe threw a heaving line between the Vestal and the Arizona to rescue the wounded sailors from the sinking ship. Suspended 40 feet in the air, the six sailors climbed 70 feet hand over hand across the rope to safety onboard the These sailors did all this while enduring injuries so severe that two would succumb to their wounds in the weeks following the attack.  As they struggled across the heavy line, Joe George remained close by, all the while encouraging the men to push on.  The four sailors who survived their injuries each returned to serve with honor during World War II and then went on to live long lives.  I spoke with two of them, and hearing about the injuries they had and that they still were able to return to service in the Second World War was amazing.  Joe George's legacy of heroism will remain alive forever in the children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren of the four sailors who survived the infamous day, thanks to Joe  Joe George was never awarded a medal for his role in the rescue of the six sailors, although his commanding officer commended his courageous actions. When I met with one of the Arizona survivors who was rescued by Joe, he told me, ``Joe George was never awarded anything for his bravery. He is no longer with us, but I believe in his memory he should be awarded the Navy Cross.''  Lauren Bruner was another survivor whom Joe saved. He said to me:       The six of us would not have survived except for his      courage, in spite of being at high risk himself. He fully      deserves high commendations for his actions. I feel he should      be recognized for this courage and presented the Navy  In his own words, during an interview in 1978, Joe said: ``I'll tell you, the only thing I could tell you about that day . . . my conscience was my guide.''  Well, his conscience was that of a hero. We need more people like Joe George in this world. That is why I am committed to honoring Joe and why I rise today with the honor and privilege to submit a resolution honoring Joseph Leon  Joe passed away in 1996, and it is long overdue that the Senate, the U.Navy, and a grateful nation honor the heroism of Boatswain's Mate Second Class Joseph Leon  God bless Joe George, whose immense and astounding composure serves as an example of the men and women in uniform who follow in his wake. Let us never forget his heroism and sacrifice.  I would like to also thank my colleagues Senators Gardner, Lee, Cotton, McCaskill, and Bennet for joining me on this resolution.

No child should live in fear, Mr.Speaker, and yet every year hundreds of thousands of children across the country are abducted, abused, or exploited. The safety of America's children has long been a national priority. That is why I stand here today in strong support of H.1808, the Improving Support for Missing and Exploited Children  In 1984, Congress passed the Missing Children's Assistance Act and established a grant to enhance our country's efforts to find missing children and prevent child exploitation. For more than 30 years, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, also known as NCMEC, has used the grant to coordinate a national response to crises and crimes affecting America's most vulnerable children.  Through unique public-private partnerships, NCMEC works with families,[[Page H4457]]law enforcement, schools, community leaders, and nonprofits in its efforts to find children who are missing and protect youth who are victims of sexual exploitation.  The reforms in the Improving Support for Missing and Exploited Children Act will ensure the vital work of recovering and supporting vulnerable youth is able to continue, reuniting more families with their loved ones and helping victims receive the support they desperately need. This is a bill that delivers the reforms needed to save lives.  I am also proud to say it is a bill with strong bipartisan support. At the opening of NCMEC, former President Ronald Reagan said:  ``No single sector of our Nation can solve the problem of missing and exploited children alone. But by working together, pooling our resources, and building on our strengths, we can accomplish great things.''  ``Together we can turn the tide on these hateful crimes. . . .''  Together we can turn the tide. The work our colleagues, Representatives Guthrie and Courtney, have done to get this important bill to the House floor demonstrates the type of collaboration President Reagan spoke of on that day at the opening of the And the Improving Support for Missing and Exploited Children Act isn't the only bill we have been able to reach across the aisle on and deliver reforms that will help vulnerable youth.  Working together, we are also advancing positive bipartisan solutions in H.1809, the Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2017. This bill aims at assisting a different kind of vulnerable youth, ensuring kids who find themselves in the juvenile justice system have an opportunity to turn their lives around and achieve success.  Every child deserves an opportunity to make a change for the better, if that child has made a mistake. By working together to develop the Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2017, my colleagues, Representatives Lewis and Scott, have put forward a bill that will help ensure at-risk youth are afforded an opportunity to do just that.  Both of these bills renew the commitment we have made to help and protect our Nation's most vulnerable children.

A common theme that I heard from folks was one of concern and questions about this Republican healthcare bill that we may be voting on later this week.  They are worried about their aging parents not being able to pay for their premiums and prescriptions and that newly added provisions that threaten those with preexisting conditions with skyrocketing costs will have such a devastating impact.  Every time we hear about the new versions and new changes to this bill, it gets worse than the one before. Among a host of new problems, the latest version strips away protections on healthcare benefits like maternity care, substance abuse, mental health services, while also expanding an already-crippling age tax against our seniors, against our kupuna.  No matter how you package it, this bill is a handout to insurance and pharmaceutical corporations while breaking the bank for those most in need of care. I urge my colleagues to stand in strong opposition to this bill and, instead, pass a healthcare bill that works for the American people.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-02-pt1-PgH3052-4.txt,2122,PROTECTING ACCESS TO CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,2.0,June
3067,topic-id,295,"Mr.Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Today, in the Congress, too many Republicans and Democrats are obsessed with health insurance, often at the expense of the reforms that could reduce the cost of healthcare. If we cut the cost of healthcare, we make solutions far more attainable for affordable coverage.  I support this tort reform legislation because it will make healthcare in America more accessible and less expensive.  Defensive medicine costs Americans over $50 billion. Commonsense reform will eliminate these costs, help patients afford healthcare, all while reducing the Federal deficit.  It is no surprise that defensive medicine costs so much. One survey recently reported that 93 percent of doctors practice defensive medicine due to a broken tort system.  It is outrageous that we force doctors to subject patients to costly, unnecessary, and occasionally harmful tests just to avoid frivolous lawsuits.  Let's go back to performing medical tests when needed for the patient, not to simply avoid exposure in litigation for insurance companies. This will lower healthcare costs.  The New England Journal of Medicine found that 1 in every 14 doctors gets sued each year. An earlier Harvard study revealed that 40 percent of these malpractice suits were groundless, yet over a quarter of these frivolous cases are settled, and the average payout was $300,000.  Groundless cases overburden our legal system, making it harder for people with legitimate grievances to have their day in court.  Frivolous claims drive up the cost of insurance for all healthcare providers, driving many physicians away from the healthcare profession. We need more doctors and hospitals, not less. Without reform, we get higher costs, fewer doctors, a larger Federal deficit, and worse healthcare outcomes.  Let's pass this bill and start delivering on more accessible healthcare for the American people.

3141,topic-id,306,"Mr.Speaker, the motion to recommit is ambiguous, as there is no legal standard currently for that which constitutes gross negligence in the area of prescriptions.  Already this legislation does not apply to circumstances in which there is criminal conduct. That means that bad doctors with bad intent will be prosecuted, and in every State in America, there are legal standards by which those very doctors would lose their license were they to engage in the conduct that the gentlewoman highlighted.  Mr.Speaker, healthcare costs are rising at alarming rates due to the failures of This bill will reduce healthcare costs. It will improve the quality of care received.  Mr.Speaker, through this underlying legislation, we will enhance the relationship between patients and doctors. We will reduce frivolous litigation. And by ultimately addressing the challenges that arise with increasing healthcare costs, we will make it more easy to get to the affordability challenges with healthcare coverage.  This will ultimately increase wages for the American worker because, due to the failures of ObamaCare, more businesses are having to put money into healthcare premiums and not into wages, not into job creation, and not into the success of the American people.

3009,topic-id,749,"Mr.Speaker, in 2012, President Obama was speaking to some of his supporters in They were eager to know how he was planning to make progress on key issues in his second term, given the uncompromising rabid opposition of the majority in this  Here is what President Obama said: ``I believe that if we're successful in this election, when we're successful in this election, that the fever may break, because there's a tradition in the Republican Party of more common sense than that.''  Five years later, I can say--we can all say--that the fever has not broken. The fever is running as hot as ever. The fever drove this House majority to threaten default on our Nation's debt, to shut down the Federal Government, to indulge racist birther conspiracies, to elevate the very champion of those conspiracies to the Presidency of the United  Ten years ago, I know Republican leaders could not imagine that kind of conspiracy would spread throughout the Republican Party rank and file, but it did and it has.  Five years ago, GOP leaders could not have imagined that their party would nominate Donald Trump and elect him to the Presidency, but they did.  One year ago, I know Republican leaders could not imagine that they would cover for the Trump campaign and Trump administration's collusion with the Russian Government, but they have, and they are.  For far too long, Democrats have wanted to believe that the GOP would come to its senses. We wanted to believe that it was really just a fringe minority within the GOP that was the problem, that sober, sensible leaders like John Boehner and Mitch McConnell wanted to do the right thing, but they couldn't because of the Tea They couldn't unless we helped them.  And that is why Democrats bailed out Boehner time after time, jam after jam. Democrats have to stop deluding themselves. There is only one Republican Party, and it is the party of  It is the party whose Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, blocked efforts by the Obama administration to stop Russian interference in the 2016 election. It is the party that every day looks the other way in the face of Trump's appeasement of Russia and fails to hold Trump accountable.  Last week, Congressman Ted Lieu and I introduced two amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act that the House is debating currently on the floor.  The first would endorse the intelligence community's assessment regarding the Russian's meddling in our 2016 election. This is critical because Donald Trump has repeatedly cast doubt, as recently as yesterday, on the report that despite unanimous agreement from all of our intelligence agencies, that indeed there was collusion, that indeed there was interference by  The second amendment would block an outrageous Trump administration initiative to create a new cybersecurity partnership with the Russian Trump's plan would let the fox into the henhouse and pave the way for more election interference in our upcoming elections and others, all at the invitation of Donald  These would have been two sensible steps that the House of Representatives could have taken this week to counter interference in our elections, but last night, the GOP leadership, under Chairman Sessions and the House Rules Committee, blocked these amendments. They refused to give these amendments a chance to be debated and voted on the floor.  As more and more information comes out about Russia, Americans all over the country keep hoping that the GOP will do the right thing, that they will put country before party and hold Trump accountable, but they have not, and they will not.  Just this past week, Donald Trump, Jr., himself released emails that show unequivocally the Trump campaign's eagerness to collude with the Russian Government, but that hasn't changed a thing.  It hasn't stopped Speaker Ryan from blocking a Russian sanctions bill at the Trump administration's request. It hasn't stopped Chairman Sessions and the Rules Committee from blocking my amendment to set the record straight on Russian interference and help prevent it in the future.  The truth is, they are all complicit. It is time to recognize the GOP majority is not the victim here. They aren't suffering from a fever that Democrats have to help fight.  It is the United States Congress, as a whole, that has a fever, and it is the GOP's grip on the majority that is the cause.  It is time for us to face reality.

3064,topic-id,930,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, the bill before us today is modeled on California's highly successful litigation reforms that have lowered healthcare costs and made healthcare much more accessible to the people of that  Because the evidence of the effects of those reforms on lowering healthcare costs is so overwhelming, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that, if the same reforms were applied at the Federal level, they would save over $50 billion over a 10-year period.  Because the evidence that those reforms increase access to healthcare is so overwhelming, they are supported by a huge variety of public safety and labor unions, community clinics and health centers, and organizations dedicated to disease prevention, all of which have seen the beneficial effects of these reforms in  So popular are these reforms among the citizens of California that a ballot initiative to raise the damages cap, backed and funded by trial lawyers, was defeated by an over 2-to-1 margin in 2014.  This bill's commonsense reforms include a $250,000 cap on inherently unquantifiable noneconomic damages and limits on the contingency fees lawyers can charge. They allow courts to require periodic payments for future damages instead of lump sum awards so bankruptcies in which plaintiffs would receive only pennies on the dollar can be prevented. They include provisions creating a ``fair share'' rule by which damages are allocated fairly in direct proportion to fault.  This bill does all this without in any way limiting compensation for 100 percent of plaintiffs' economic losses, which include anything to which a receipt can be attached, including all medical costs, lost wages, future lost wages, rehabilitation costs, and any other economic out-of-pocket loss suffered as the result of a healthcare injury. Far from limiting deserved recoveries in California, these reforms have led to medical damage awards in deserving cases in the $80 million and $90 million range.  Unlike past iterations, this bill only applies to claims concerning the provision of goods or services for which coverage is provided in whole or in part via a Federal program, subsidy, or tax benefit, giving it a clear Federal nexus. Wherever Federal policy directly affects the distribution of healthcare, there is a clear Federal interest in reducing the costs of such Federal policies.  The legislation before us today also protects any State law that otherwise caps damages--whether at a higher level or lower than the caps in the bill--or provides greater protections that lower healthcare costs.  When President Ronald Reagan established a special task force to study the need for Federal tort reform, that task force concluded as follows: ``In sum, tort law appears to be a major cause of the insurance availability and affordability crisis which the Federal Government can and should address in a variety of sensible and appropriate ways.''  Indeed, the Reagan task force specifically recommended ``eliminate joint and several liability,'' ``provide for periodic payments of future economic damages,'' ``schedule''--that is, limit--``contingency fees'' of attorneys, and ``limit noneconomic damages to a fair and reasonable amount.'' All of these recommended reforms are part of the bill before us today.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation that would enact much-needed commonsense and cost-saving litigation reforms that would increase healthcare accessibility for all.

2941,topic-id,402,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise today in strong support of H.1808, the Improving Support for Missing and Exploited Children Act of 2017.  Mr.Speaker, as a father, I cannot imagine the horror moms and dads in this country experience when they discover one of their children has been taken, abused, or exploited. Sadly, that is a nightmare for hundreds of thousands of parents in this country. Last year alone, there were more than 465,000 reports of missing children, and those are just the cases that were reported.  The well-being of America's children has long been a national priority. In 1984, Congress established the Missing and Exploited Children's Program to help coordinate State and local efforts to recover children who are missing and better protect and support kids who are victims of abuse and exploitation. As part of that program, we provide a grant that is used to support the work of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, known as  For more than 30 years, NCMEC has worked to provide help to people across the country, partnering with parents, law enforcement, nonprofits, and other public and private entities in an effort to recover, protect, and support missing and exploited children and their families. We are here today to ensure this supportive work continues.  H.1808 updates and streamlines the Missing Children's Assistance Act, making positive changes that will enable us to strengthen our efforts. This includes reforms that encourage and increase public awareness of new and innovative ways to recover and protect missing and exploited children.  The bill better protects the growing number of children who go missing from State care or are victims of sex trafficking, while also providing transparency surrounding recovery and prevention efforts. In recent years, some of the advances in technology have, unfortunately, made it easier for kids to be victimized and exploited. H.1808 ensures the law aimed at recovering and protecting exploited children is able to effectively identify and locate today's abductors and criminal offenders, many of whom are turning to more modern techniques to commit their disturbing crimes.  The Improving Support for Missing and Exploited Children Act of 2017 delivers important reforms that will provide the tools needed to effectively serve vulnerable youth, help bring perpetrators to justice, and ensure taxpayer dollars are spent responsibly. I urge my colleagues to support H.1808.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-05-23-pt1-PgH4453.txt,1922,PROTECTING ACCESS TO CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,23.0,May

3145,topic-id,798,"Mr.Speaker, ``This is a new era. This is the Trump era.'' Mr.Speaker, those were the words of the Attorney General, the former Senator from  The Attorney General has launched a campaign to paint immigrants as criminals, rapists, gang members, and ``cartel henchmen.'' In his prepared remarks at the border a couple of weeks ago, the Attorney General planned to say the following: ``It is here, on this sliver of land, where we first take our stand against this filth.''  When he gave the speech he edited out the words ``this filth'' because, I guess, calling immigrants from Latin America ``filth'' was even too extreme for this Attorney But it remains on the DOJ website. In fact, as far as the Attorney General is concerned, any immigrant who is here illegally is a criminal.  He has ordered the government to prosecute immigration violations, even minor ones, to the full extent of the law and to make prosecution of immigrants a top priority--on par with murder, drugs, counterfeiting, and kidnapping.  He has ordered every one of the 94 U.Attorney Offices to appoint a special prosecuting attorney so that immigrants are considered public enemy number one, nationwide--not drug dealers, immigrants. According to the latest Federal data, 46 percent of all new Federal criminal prosecution is immigration related--not narcotics. The second highest crime prosecuted accounts only for 14 percent of new Federal cases. In the new Trump era, a felony prosecution against an immigrant who has been living and working here peacefully for decades is three times important than a felony prosecution of a drug dealer.  And that imbalance is not enough for the Attorney He wants to prosecute immigrants beyond the full extent of the law by turning misdemeanors into felonies, and turning felonies into aggravated felonies. They think it will not look so ugly when the U.is deporting moms and dads who have raised successful families--or deporting children who grew up in the U.from the time they were toddlers--if the Attorney General and his team can look and tell the American people they were just thugs, gangbangers, and rapists.  Jeff Sessions and Donald Trump want more immigrants criminalized, felonized, and deported. Yes, we are truly in the Trump era.[[Page H2904]]  But let's be frank. This is not a surprise when Donald Trump descended the gold escalator and announced his candidacy for Almost the first words out of his mouth were Mexicans are rapists, murderers, drug dealers, and immigration is turning America into a war zone.  When he was a Senator from Alabama, the Attorney General made a career of associating immigrants with crime and doing his best to defeat reforms that would strengthen legal immigration and reduce illegal immigration. Deportation, criminalization, and restricting legal immigration were the bedrock of this Attorney General's approach when he was a U. Our legal immigration system already works fine according to both Senator and Attorney General Sessions, no matter that some people who are receiving their visas today applied for them when Bill Clinton was President and that those applying for visas today will probably get them when Chelsea Clinton is President of the United  Mr.Speaker, when your constituents say, ``Hey, why don't those immigrants come here legally?'' or, ``Why don't they just go back and come back legally?'' the answer is clear: as a Senator, our Attorney General made sure that that was impossible.  Next week, millions of Americans will take to the streets to demonstrate against mass deportation, the border wall, prison beds, and drive-by deportations. But it is not because we are soft on crime or love immigrants more than the people who were born here. We have a different vision of what the United States is and should always be.  We are not an incarceration nation, a nation hostile to other countries and their people. We are a great nation, a nation that, in her greatness, is a beacon of hope to refugees, a land of opportunity for entrepreneurs, and a democracy with separate branches of government that act as effective checks and balances on unlimited power.  The American people are sensible, fair, and pragmatic, and are correct when they reject the idea that a wall makes sense in the 21st century as the centerpiece of our immigration policy. We are not persuaded by the poetry of the Attorney General when he stands at the border and says: ``It is here, on this sliver of land, where we first take our stand against this filth.'' No, we think of another, better poem, the one at the Statue of Liberty, the lady with her torch in the harbor, who shares our deeply held values as Americans and says every day to the entire world at that harbor: ``Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.''                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-27-pt1-PgH2903-2.txt,478,COUNTERING IRAN'S DESTABILIZING ACTIVITIES ACT OF 2017,2017.0,27.0,June

2912,topic-id,983,"Mr.President, I rise to express my deepest sympathy for the victims of this morning's shooting, including for my good friend, Representative Steve I pray that he, the congressional staff, and police officers who were injured in this horrific event can recover quickly.  Today is not a day to reflect on our differences but on our common commitment to upholding the Constitution and doing the work of the American people. This Chamber is often divided on matters of policy, but in the face of tragedy, we are united as one. Today, we are together, and together we recognize the local law enforcement officials who responded quickly and professionally to this morning's attack.  Each and every day, police officers across this great Nation risk their own well-being to ensure the safety of others, and they do so with little fanfare or recognition. In light of today's events, I recognize, in particular, the special sacrifice of our U.Capitol police officers--the selfless men and women--who, each and every day, assume significant risk to keep all of us safe.  I shudder to think of what may have happened this morning had it not been for the quick action taken by Representative Scalise's security detail. These courageous special agents returned fire to apprehend the perpetrator of this senseless and appalling act of violence. Through their heroic actions, they prevented a massacre and saved the lives of dozens of elected Members of Congress and congressional staff. Today I wish to pay special tribute to these humble heroes.  As far as I am concerned, our Capitol Police officers are the finest professionals this Nation has to offer. We wave to them each morning as we walk in to work, we say goodbye to them each night as we leave, and we interact with them each day. Yet how often do we thank them for their service? How often do we reflect on the weight of their work? How often do we recognize them for their sacrifices? In my opinion, not often enough. Because these police officers are such a common presence here on Capitol Hill, I worry that all too often we take them for granted, but we should never take for granted the men and women who would willingly give up their lives to protect ours.  This morning's attack reminds us all of the thin line between peace and violence, and our Capitol police officers are the first to respond when that line is crossed. Today and every day, these selfless men and women deserve our heartfelt thanks and appreciation.  In paying tribute to our Capitol Police, I would be remiss if I were to fail to recognize the 23 members of my own[[Page S3475]]security detail who work around the clock to keep Elaine and me safe. These men and women are like family to me. Over the past 2\1/2\ years, I have built a special bond with each of them.  Today I would like to recognize each of them individually:  Supervisory Special Agent David Rib, who leads the detail with assistance from team leaders Jason Marcello and Shane Powell; in addition, Special Agents Eric Boggs, John Britto, Jacqueline French, Eric Holzer, Eric Love, Paul Martin, Ronald Munar, Benjamin Odell, Richard Philius, Luis Pimentel, Ryan Rayball, Austin Reinshuttle, Henry Smith, John Whittle, Micah Harrison, Muhammed Khan, Gideon Maran, Arnold Pierre, Robert Schultz, and Charles  In all of my years of public service, these are among the most honorable men and women I have ever worked with. ``Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.''  The fact that these special agents are willing to put their lives on the line to protect all of us speaks to their selflessness, their bravery, and their love of this institution and of country. Elaine and I love each of these special agents deeply, and we love their families too.  In these photos, you can see one of the team leaders, Jason, hard at work. Jason hates this photo, which is why I blew it up for national The other photo is of the trip I took to all five of Utah's national parks last year. During this trip, my security detail was with me every step of the way. These men and women never leave my side.  Today I wish to thank them with all of my heart for their service and their sacrifice. These are really great people, and we have enjoyed being together. At least, I have enjoyed being with them. I will put it that way.  As Members of Congress, we stand united in the aftermath of today's attack. Thanks to our brave Capitol Police officers, we also stand protected from those who would do us harm. Because of them, we can confidently carry on the work of the American people.  These are really great human beings--men and women--who literally sacrifice a lot to serve us, back us up, strengthen us, and help us in times of need. They are people whom I really, really admire. All I can say is, I admire those who stood up this morning for Congressman Scalise and the others who were there and especially for those who were wounded.

2971,topic-id,642,"Mr.President, I rise today in support of the nomination of Mr.Patrick Shanahan to be Deputy Secretary of  The Department of Defense is going through historic changes in its organizational structure. These much needed changes are thanks to the chairman of the Armed Services Committee and his unwavering commitment to strengthening our Nation's security and ensuring that American taxpayers get the best return on their investment. We should all applaud the chairman for his efforts.  But even as we make these reforms, we should also heed the lessons of the past. History shows us that the Department of Defense runs best under a Secretary who is a strong policy leader and a Deputy Secretary who is a dynamic business manager. The most obvious example of this preferred structure was when David Packard, the former CEO of the Hewlett-Packard corporation, was confirmed as Deputy Secretary of Thanks to Deputy Secretary Packard's considerable business acumen, his term in office is still regarded as the model of effective management at the Department of  That leads us to today and our once-in-a-generation opportunity to replicate this efficiency and success at the Department of The pieces are now in place. Chairman McCain has provided the statutory catalyst, and I am sorry he has had some difficulty healthwise over the last few days. We can't wait to get him back. Secretary Mattis is a brilliant thinker and a master strategist who is providing the critical leadership we need during this period of uncertainty, and today he is seeking to replicate the Packard model by choosing as his Deputy a man of proven business and management skill.  I understand that things could have gone a bit better during Mr.Shanahan's confirmation hearing, but I believe we all should remember that Mr.Shanahan has not been nominated for a position in public affairs--far from it. He has been nominated to be a strong manager who can increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the Department of In this role, I believe Mr.Shanahan will excel. I think everybody who knows him believes that.  Currently, Mr.Shanahan is a senior vice president at the Boeing corporation, where he has been responsible for designing and producing some of the world's most complex machines. For example, when the Boeing Company's latest aircraft, the 787, was experiencing developmental difficulties, Mr.Shanahan was one of the key leaders tasked to solve these issues, earning himself the nickname ``Mr.Fix-it.''  As further evidence of his leadership, I was particularly impressed with one of Mr.Shanahan's written answers to the Armed Services Committee's questions. He wrote:       In my three decades of experience, I have developed and      practiced a formula to create change at scale in large,      complex organizations. I believe leadership is essential to      changing the status-quo--setting a compelling vision,      establishing ambitious goals and realistic intermediate      objectives, and converting strategy into action.  Is that not exactly the type of person we want to be managing and reforming the Department of Defense? I personally think it is.  Finally, I believe Mr.Shanahan's most important credential is that he is Secretary Mattis's choice to be the Deputy Secretary of I firmly believe Secretary Mattis will be remembered as one of our Nation's premier national security leaders. The Secretary does not fool around. He demands the best in himself and those around him. If Secretary Mattis wants Mr.Shanahan, then I believe the Senate should speed his confirmation so the good work can continue.  If confirmed, I look forward to working with Mr.Shanahan, especially to ensure that the Department of Defense maintains our current statutory requirements regarding our defense logistics capabilities. I strongly believe Mr.Shanahan will play a critical role in leading the Department of Defense to a new era of effectiveness and efficiency.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

(b) Lawsuits Against Entities.--If the defendant in a      health care lawsuit is an entity that employs a person      against whom or on whose behalf the testimony is offered, the      provisions of subsection (a) apply as if the person were the      party or defendant against whom or on whose behalf the      testimony is offered.       (c) Power of Court.--Nothing in this subsection shall limit      the power of the trial court in a health care lawsuit to      disqualify an expert witness on grounds other than the      qualifications set forth under this subsection.

(e) State Flexibility.--No provision of this section shall      be construed to preempt any State law (whether effective      before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this Act)      that places additional qualification requirements upon any      individual testifying as an expert witness.     13.

3124,topic-id,376,"Mr.Chairman, access to a fair and just court system is a vital part of the makeup of the United It is important that courts are used to seek justice, not for the financial benefit of lawyers looking to take advantage of patients. Basic protections these amendments provide from frivolous lawsuits will provide peace of mind for the vast majority of physicians who work so hard to protect and heal their patients.  Patients in States that have enacted comprehensive medical liability reform have seen their healthcare costs decrease and their access to quality medical care increase. Enacting these reforms at the Federal level will benefit patients nationwide.  All provisions within this amendment defer to State laws and directly address the issues covered.  The first provision is called the Sorry This provision would allow a physician to apologize to a patient for an unintended outcome without having that apology count against them in a court of law. Thirty-two States plus the District of Columbia have an apology provision in place.  The second issue in this amendment is Notice of This provision would require a plaintiff to provide a notice of intent to the physician 90 days before a lawsuit is filed. Cases are often settled before reaching a verdict, and this provision would encourage settlement before court proceedings begin.  The third provision is Affidavits of This provision would require a plaintiff to have a physician in the same specialty as the defendant physician to sign an affidavit certifying the merits of the case before the lawsuit could be brought to court. Twenty-seven States have some form of affidavits of merit, though the standards vary from State to  The final provision in the amendment is Expert Witness This provision would require that any expert witness called to testify during a trial would need to meet the same licensing requirements as the defendant physician. Forty-eight States plus the District of Columbia have some form of expert witness qualification, though the standards vary from State to  So you see, these are very commonsense provisions. They are provisions that many States already have, and they will lead to lower costs and better care for patients, which ought to be our goal in the end.

3129,topic-id,430,"Mr.Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his leadership on this issue, and I also would like to express my appreciation to my colleague from  We all care about patients and we all care about patients seeking justice, but I just think maybe we disagree how to get there at this point.  The one point he raised about the crocodile tears, the way he describes the Sorry Provision, look, doctors are human beings and sometimes things happen. It should be appropriate for a physician to be able to express those feelings that they are sorry that that happened without that being seen as some sign that there is guilt involved. So I think the Sorry Provision is important because the doctor-patient relationship is very important, and these are human beings.  The other argument that was raised, that it is an undue burden to have to have an expert witness, listen. A lot of these cases are very detailed and very specific. If you are talking about a cardiothoracic event, you need a cardiothoracic surgeon to discuss that. A lot of these speciality fields, it is important that you have someone from that field as an expert.  Frankly, there are folks out there who have the profession of being professional witnesses. They travel around the country and testify on behalf of the plaintiff bar. Frankly, I think we need to have experts testifying that are qualified to talk about those very specific cases that they are testifying against.  The other thing that was raised is that the 90-day notice is an unfair burden on a patient. Frankly, I believe that having a little bit of time where individuals can talk could actually help that patient get to a settlement, get some redress earlier.  I don't think you are delaying any kind of justice for individuals, but I think it is important that there is notification time, there is time for both parties to communicate. I think, in the end, you might end up having justice delivered much quicker than going through a lengthy trial that could have been avoided if you had a notice in the beginning.  This amendment simply is seeking to provide justice for those who deserve it much more quickly with much less expense, but also to preserve our healthcare system.  Mr.Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.  The The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.Hudson).

3085,topic-id,390,"Mr.Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr.Chair, I rise today to express my strong opposition to H.1215. First of all, my home State of Washington is one of those States where our Supreme Court has ruled and said that caps are not constitutional. So this bill is an intrusion of our States' rights.  This bill also clearly puts the interests of big corporations over everyday people and sends a signal to medical and health providers that they can act irresponsibly, perhaps to make more money, and get away with it.  Let me give you a very real example of what happens when hospitals put profit over people. The neurology program at Swedish Medical Center-Cherry Hill in Seattle is under investigation for negligent care arising out of a program designed to incentivize neuroscience doctors to take on heavy caseloads of complicated cases that lead to serious errors and even death.  One of the patients was Talia Goldenberg, a talented and vibrant young woman. Talia went in for a cervical spinal fusion with a neurosurgeon who had been embroiled in numerous investigations. And as a result of gross medical malpractice, Talia died.  According to a Seattle Times investigation, numerous problems surfaced around her care--or lack thereof--and attention to the surgery and medical complications that arose from it.  When Talia went in for her surgery, she was filled with hope. In thinking about the life that she might have after surgery, she wrote this: So who am I? I am an artist, a dreamer. I am a stationary biker. I am a woman, a girl, a person. I am a skier. I am an aspiring pole vaulter. I am a reluctant, yet faithful, believer of the power of lucky underwear. I am someone with a voice.  Talia died. She is one of the many tragic instances of people losing their lives to medical malpractice, and, even in my own office, two of my staffers have lost three of their grandparents due to medical malpractice. We have to make sure that we have consequences when we entrust our healthcare to someone, and there are grave errors.  For the sake of Talia and so many others like her who have dreams that are violated by preventable errors, we must defeat this bill.

Since January 20, we have seen a disturbing increase here in America in anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, anti-Black, anti-LGBT, and anti-Semitic acts.  And the question is: Is this just a coincidence, or could it possibly have something to do with the election of the 45th President of the United States of America?  Now, in part, what we are seeing is connected to a historic backlash that has often occurred throughout this journey that we have been on here in America, that whenever we make significant progress, there is always a backlash amongst some in America who have got a problem with the fact that we have done things designed to be more consistent with our values of liberty and justice for all, equal protection under the law.  We know slavery was the original sin here in That was corrected in the aftermath of the North's victory during the Civil We had the reconstruction amendments: the 13th Amendment, abolish slavery; 14th Amendment, equal protection under the law; 15th Amendment, the right to vote regardless of race. That was progress in America followed by the inevitable backlash.  The imposition of Jim Crow laws; a lynching epidemic; Black code, segregation, particularly through just the Deep Progress followed by backlash.  And then finally, in the 1960s, in an effort to create a more perfect union and address the unfinished business in America, you had the civil rights movement, anchored with the `64 Civil Rights Act, effectively ended Jim Crow; the `65 Voting Rights Act, giving African Americans in the Deep South, people of color throughout the country the right to vote, unimpeded from things like grandfather clauses, and poll taxes, and other types of shenanigans that people were practicing; the 1968 Fair Housing Act capped off the civil rights movement, followed by the inevitable backlash.  Richard Nixon ran a racist campaign, a southern strategy, designed to appeal to aggrieved Whites in parts of this country, particularly in the Deep South, ushered in an era of resistance to the progress that had been made, antibusing, antiaffirmative action.  And then, of course, we have got Barack Obama who was elected in what many of us viewed as an incredible step in the right direction. African Americans, having gone from the outhouse to the White Eight years of tremendous progress in moving this country forward, followed by the election of Donald Trump, a man who spent 5 years perpetrating the racist lie that Barack Obama was not born in the United States of  And many of us are wondering, why were so many people who worship at the altar of White supremacy drawn to Donald Trump's campaign?

We do know that every racist in America voted for Donald That is a problem.  And so, again, I just ask the question in closing: Is this all a big coincidence?

We have heard--and I hope it is not true--that this was a political shooting; that this person who decided to commit these despicable acts did it because he didn't like the political persuasion of the people at whom he decided to shoot.

It has not become prevalent in America, but it certainly has become more than just a mere occurrence. I will put it that way.  The internet has been an extraordinary thing for commerce and for the quality of life of all of us, but sometimes I read what people write on Facebook and I read comments. The worst are the ones where people can comment anonymously on newspaper articles. The vitriol, the hatred--I would hate to live with that much hate in my heart.  Our thoughts and prayers are with Steve, Jennifer, Madison, and Harrison, and they are with Special Agent Griner, Special Agent Bailey, Zack Barth, and Matt My personal thoughts and prayers are with every American today who feels as I do, that this is just a sad, sad day for this great country.  I don't know if there is any good that can come out of this, but if there is, I hope the good that does come out of this is that we will all stop and think about the things that divide us and understand it is OK to disagree.

3056,topic-id,521,"Mr.Speaker, like in anyone's office, the photos and trinkets on display in mine tell a little bit about who I am: a wedding photo, a picture of me and my family on our swearing-in day, a copy of the first bill I had signed into law, the moments that I am proud of, the pieces of me that I want to share with the world.  In this body, the people's House is no different. We have always been proud of our democracy and even prouder to display it for all the world to see. That is why we keep these cameras on whenever we are in session. It is why every single word that is uttered on this floor is documented and preserved long after the day we draw our last breath. It is why we walk beside Americans of all backgrounds and beliefs through the rotunda with the same awe of our Nation's history embodied in bronze statues and bold paintings. It is why every single night this building glows through the darkness; because the light of democracy not only lays bare our divisions and dissent, but it lights a path to our proudest moments.  In times of war and peace, fights over civil rights and equality, our debates in these halls have always been driven by a fierce conviction of our beliefs and a shared vision of a kinder, stronger country. Disagreements, yes, but enlightened by ideals, by vision, by a shared commitment to our American experiment.  And when you stand behind those principles and your policies, you welcome that spotlight; you engage in that debate; you are eager to answer questions; you are ready to be held accountable.  And so, Mr.Speaker, we should all be concerned by what has transpired in our Capitol over the course of the past few weeks. For if you are proud of your legislation, you don't lock it behind closed doors; you don't shield it from the very people that are going to be hurt most by it; you don't turn off the cameras and then call it mean; you don't sabotage a healthcare system and leave a wake of devastation and destruction to score political points.  Drafting TrumpCare under the cover of darkness is an admission that this bill cannot--cannot--withstand the sunlight of our neighbors.  Mr.Speaker, the America that I know would never turn its back on a friend or a stranger in need. TrumpCare does.  The America that I know doesn't tell the sick, the elderly, or the frail that you are on your own. TrumpCare does.  The America that I know doesn't tell the young woman struggling through an opioid recovery that your next relapse, well, that one was one too many. TrumpCare does.  The America that I know understands that our greatness comes from our goodness; that we lean into challenges, you don't yield to them; that the frustration that we see in our streets and our communities is a cry for our government to be as good and as decent as the people we aim to serve. They, we, deserve nothing less. TrumpCare is not that cure.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-22-pt1-PgH5053.txt,2172,MERLE HAGGARD POST OFFICE BUILDING,2017.0,22.0,May

2888,topic-id,3140,"Mr.President, I was in Maine over the weekend, and people said: How do you feel about healthcare? What do you think we ought to be doing? I said: I like the President's plan. I think President Trump has it just right. He says we need healthcare that will cover everyone, low premiums and low deductibles, no preexisting conditions. That is the right formulation, and I hope that is what we can work toward, and that is what we should be working toward.  He also said yesterday that the bill that passed the House was mean. Well, a couple of weeks ago I said it was cruel, but I will accept mean; both mean the same thing. It is a terrible blow to literally millions of people across this country and thousands in my State of  By the way, the problem with the House bill is that it is so bad that some kind of compromise has developed here that is halfway, and it is still mean or cruel. Now people are talking about a ``soft landing.'' That is a euphemism for stretching out the crash. It is not a soft landing. Whether we take Medicaid and healthcare coverage away from people in 2 years, 4 years, or 7 years, it is still going to happen, and it is a crash. It is not a soft landing. That is just stretching it out into beyond the next couple of elections, but it doesn't really get to the core of the issue, which is taking healthcare and health insurance away from millions of people.                Congressional Baseball Practice Shooting  Mr.President, before I began, I meant to acknowledge what happened this morning to our colleagues across the way at the baseball practice--tragic, inexplicable, horrible, and just inexcusable. My heart goes out to the Capitol Police who, I understand, were incredibly brave and met their responsibilities admirably to Representative Scalise and to any others who were injured--a terrible incident and one that we hope we never see the likes of again.                         Healthcare Legislation  Going back to healthcare, I think it is important for people to understand the big picture of what is going on with this issue that is now before both the House and the  What we are really talking about is a massive tax increase on middle-class and lower middle-class people and a massive tax cut for the wealthiest It is as simple as that. It is a gigantic transfer of wealth--probably one of the greatest in a short time in recent American history--where we have millions of people across the country who have health insurance under the Affordable Care Act and are protected under Medicaid and Medicaid expansion, and we are taking that away. The Affordable Care Act exchange policies are a tax credit. So when you take that away, you are increasing people's taxes; you are increasing the taxes of people who are making between $15,000 and $45,000, $60,000, $70,000 a year, and you are decreasing taxes in a huge way only for people who make more than $200,000 a year.  The 400 highest taxpayers in the country will get a tax cut of $7 million apiece. That makes no sense. We are taking resources away from the people who need it--the middle class--and we are giving it to the people who don't need it. It is Robin Hood in reverse.  That is the fundamental point of this legislation. It is all about that big tax cut for the rich--for the really rich--and I just don't understand why we are even thinking about that, because the American people need help with the cost of healthcare. If you divide the total healthcare bill in this country by the number of people, you come up with about $8,500 a year per person, on average, or $35,000 a year for a family[[Page S3466]]of four. That is the cost of healthcare. That cost has to be paid, and I would argue that people who are in the middle income can't afford it. They can't afford to pay those costs, and they need some help, and that is what the Affordable Care Act does. But, instead, we are talking about repealing it--knocking those millions of people off.  In Maine we have 75,000 people on the exchanges. And then, of course, we have hundreds of thousands on We are talking about severely constricting their access to healthcare. That is just wrong, ethically, morally, and in any other way. We are taking healthcare away from people so we can give a massive tax cut to the people who don't really need it.  In Maine, if the House had taken a blank sheet of paper and said ``How can we design a healthcare plan that would really hammer the people of Maine?'' it would have been the AHCA--misnamed the American Healthcare Act; it ought to be the anti-healthcare act because that is what it is all about--taking healthcare away from people. It could not be more tailored to harm people in  We are the oldest State in the country. We have more people in the older age brackets--50 and up--than any other State in the United States as a percentage of our population. We also are a relatively low-income You put those things together, and you really get hurt. Also, in Maine, as in the Presiding Officer's home State, we have a lot of hazardous occupations--logging, agriculture, fishing, the iconic Maine lobsterman.  This is a guy named David Osgood from Vinalhaven, an incredibly beautiful island off the coast of Lobstering is an essential part of the Maine economy. It is a part of our way of life. Vinalhaven, where Dave lives, has a population of about 1,200. It is really hard work. It is all-weather, and it is dangerous. You have to haul tracks, repair them, be out on the water in the wintertime, which is no fun. David Osgood has been lobstering since he was 13, like his father and grandfather before him.  As of this spring, all three of David's and Elaine's children have finished college. That is amazing. That is a real achievement for any family, but fishing is challenging and tough.  The Osgoods are really thankful for the fact that they can get affordable health insurance through the Affordable Care Once, they weren't covered, and David had a back problem that required surgery. Like a lot of people in Maine, he paid it off, month by month by month. But the ACA, according to Elaine, has given them some comfort and peace of mind.  I don't think those of us who have pretty much had health insurance all of our lives realize the importance of that peace of mind, of not being anxious about a health problem that could wipe you out, make you lose your house--an illness or an injury. Elaine said: We will be  The deductibles are a problem. They are too high. I agree. What we ought to be working on is how to get the deductibles down, how to work on the premiums, how to work on the cost of healthcare.  All of this debate about the Affordable Care Act and Medicare and Medicaid and a public option and single payer--all of that is about who pays, when a big part of the problem is how much we are all paying. We pay roughly twice as much per person for healthcare than anyone else in the industrialized world. That is a real problem that we have to start debating. We have to start talking about that because, whoever pays, whatever the insurance plan is, if the underlying cost is something that people just can't afford, then we are going to be arguing about who pays, how much, and what part. We have to get at that $8,500 per person.  People say: Yes, but we have the best healthcare system in the world. Yes, we do, for the people who can afford it. But for the millions of people who don't have health insurance, who get treated only in emergency rooms or more often don't want to get treated at all because they don't want to go in because they know they can't pay for it, the healthcare system does not deliver for them.  By all objective measures--longevity, infant mortality--we are not first in the world. We are like 20th in the world. We are way below our colleagues, and yet we are paying much more. We have to address high deductibles, high premiums, and high costs, but also, in the meantime, we have to keep people covered.  Another couple in Maine, Jonathan Edwards and Jennifer Schroth, live in Hancock It is another coastal county. They are farmers, and they raise vegetables.  Here is a great Maine story. I have known Jen's mother for about 40 years. I just met Jen at a healthcare forum in Bangor a few weeks ago, but I knew her mother way back. Everybody in Maine knows everybody else. I suspect it is like in We are a big small town with very long roads.  Jonathan and Jennifer own and operate a farm. By the way, this farm is in a town called Brooklin, but this is the real Brooklin--Brooklin, They grow potatoes, vegetables, strawberries, raspberries, and asparagus. They make maple syrup. They could never afford healthcare until the ACA came along because they were essentially a small business, but they were not a big enough business to have a group plan. They didn't have employer-based health insurance. They just didn't have it.  They are both in their fifties, and one of the changes made under the Affordable Care Act was that the ratio between the premiums for younger people and older people can't be more than three times. It reflects the reality that older people have more healthcare needs and cost the system more. So there is a reflection. It is allowed to be a three-times basis. The House bill changes that to five times. That is a huge shift directly toward people in their fifties and early sixties.  When Jen was pregnant with each of their two boys, they had no insurance. They paid the hospital. Just like my friend David Osgood, they paid the hospital. That is what Maine people do. But what if there had been complications? They were pretty straightforward births, but what if there had been complications? They would have been wiped out because they had no health insurance. Jen says she doesn't feel it is responsible to go without health insurance, especially when you have a family.  It is critical to them that the ACA is affordable, and it is because of the tax credits. They also appreciate that they have real insurance that really covers things. There are no exclusions. People say: Well, I have this really cheap insurance policy, but it doesn't cover anything. It may not even cover hospitalization or it doesn't cover doctor visits or it doesn't cover drugs. It doesn't cover what you really need. That is not insurance. That is illusory. But now, Jen says, they have peace of mind because they have coverage. She told me that face-to-face not long ago.  Running a small business is tough. It is tough because you generally can't get group policies. Sometimes you can join a small business association, but generally you can't. This is a way to have coverage that people can afford.  Imagine if somebody came to this body and said: I have a great idea for a bill. I am going to raise taxes on the middle class and give a great big break to hedge fund managers. We wouldn't even think about it. It wouldn't even get out of committee. Yet that is essentially what this is all about.  How much of a tax increase is it on somebody? Well, in Hancock County, where these folks live, for a 60-year-old making $40,000 a year--these are real numbers from the Kaiser Family Foundation--under the Affordable Care Act the premium is $4,080 a year, about 10 percent of your income. That is still substantial. But under the bill passed by the House, that would go to $17,090 on a $40,000 gross income. It is ridiculous to go from $4,000 to $17,000.  Where does that difference come from? It is going back to the people who don't need it. It is going back to the people who make $200,000, $400,000, $800,000, $1 million, $5 million a year--a 300-percent increase in out-of-pocket costs for healthcare. In Knox County--I think David is younger than 60, but if he were 60--his premium goes from $4,080 to $10,590, more than doubled.  This just doesn't make sense to me. This whole discussion doesn't make sense to me. I agree that we need to talk about healthcare, and I agree that we need to do something about it, but we are doing the wrong thing. We are making it worse.[[Page S3467]]  There are two problems with healthcare in this country. We can boil it down to two issues--cost and access. The Affordable Care Act, although it dealt somewhat with cost, was mostly about access--allowing people who don't have health insurance to get it, whether through Medicaid expansion or through the exchanges.  Cost is a bigger issue, and it is one that we also have to deal with. But that is not what is on the floor now, or will be soon, and it is not what is being considered in But I would argue that we really have to pay attention to that issue as well.  So all of this and taking coverage away from my friend David or Jen and John and thousands--we know the number from the House bill, 23 million people in America--to give a massive tax break so a guy making a couple million dollars a year can buy an extra Maserati just doesn't pass the straight-face test for good public policy.  I am the first to agree that the Affordable Care Act is not perfect. I think there are things about it that need to be fixed and adjusted, and we need to work on how we do the deductibles, how we improve that, and how we broaden the coverage and maybe make it more of a sliding scale. All of those things are things we can discuss and work on, and I am absolutely willing to do it--but the idea of repealing it just to check a box to meet a campaign promise and to be so divergent from what the President has said over and over in the campaign and since that time--that he wants coverage for everyone, no preexisting conditions, and lower premiums and deductibles. I am for it. But what we are doing is the exact opposite--the exact 180-degree opposite.  So let's take a breath. There is no deadline here of next week or the July 4th recess. Let's take a break and back off and start talking about it as Senators and Representatives from all over the country and all parties. I think we ought to be able to come to some agreement here.  Now, if there are people who are just hell-bent to provide a tax cut to multimillionaires, then, there isn't an agreement to be had. If that has to be part of the deal, include me out. But if we can start talking reasonably about how we can improve the Affordable Care Act--I don't care if we improve it, change it, tinker with it, and call it TrumpCare or McConnellCare or Call it what you want, but let's provide health insurance, which is so important to the American people.  I have told this story a couple of times, but I am going to conclude with why I am so passionate about this. Forty years ago, I worked here. I was a staff member, and I had insurance. For the first time in my young life, I think, I had health insurance. Part of the health insurance was a provision for preventive care, which is also required under the Affordable Care So you could have a free physical. I was 28, 29 years old and immortal. We all were at that age. But I said: What the heck; it is free. I guess I will have a physical.  So I went in and had a physical. The doctor looked me over, looked at my eyes, and down my throat. But he happened to notice that on my black I had a black mole. He said: I don't like the looks of that. That ought to be taken off.  I didn't even notice it. I didn't even know it was there. He took it off, and it turned out to be something called malignant melanoma, which is one of the most virulent and serious forms of cancer. The thing about malignant melanoma is that, if you catch it in time, you are good. Here I am, 40 years later. If you don't, you are gone. I have had friends in Maine and in other parts of the country who have died of melanoma. It has always haunted me to this day that the only reason I caught it and my life was saved was because I had health insurance, and somewhere in this country there was a young man who also had a mole on his back or on his arm or on his neck and who didn't have health insurance, didn't have preventive care, didn't go to the doctor, and he is gone. That is not fair. That is not right. In a country as advanced and wealthy as this is, it is not right that that guy died and I am here.  So don't ever tell me that health insurance doesn't save lives because it does. There is no doubt that it does. That is why it is so important for us to get this right and not just cavalierly and blithely rip health insurance away from people--many of whom have gotten it for the first time, many of whom are small business people--the very people we all talk about wanting to help.  We can't do it. It is a dereliction of our duty to serve the American people.  We need to figure out how to do it right. We need to figure out how to do it effectively and efficiently. In the end, we are here to help our fellow citizens. I am here for Maine, and I can't let my people suffer under a law that would take something away which they have come to depend upon and that has saved lives and means so much to them. We can do better. I am sure of it.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.

2991,topic-id,440,"Mr.President, today I wish to recognize the 225th anniversary of Bucksport, ME, an active town set along the banks of the Penobscot The town has a long and proud history dating back to the late 1700s, and I am pleased to join with Mayor David Keene, town officials, members of the Bucksport Historical Society, and residents as they gather for a founder's day celebration to honor the town's history.  First settled in 1763, Bucksport was incorporated in 1792 and named for its original surveyor, Colonel Jonathan However, Bucksport's history begins long before the 18th century. The town's first known inhabitants were the prehistoric ``Red Paint People'' who were discovered through an archaeological dig in the late 19th century. Originally known as the territory of the Penobscot Abenaki Native Peoples, the town of Bucksport today encompasses an area surveyed by Colonel Buck in 1762. After returning in 1763, Colonel Buck built the first sawmill, store, and home, and by 1775, there were a total of 21 families living there. During the Penobscot Expedition in 1779--notably one of the greatest defeats in American naval history--the British overtook and burned the town. As a result, in 1783, the town was resettled and named Buckstown Plantation, later changed to Buckstown, and finally renamed Bucksport in 1817.  Bucksport's history is deeply engrained in the papermaking industry. In 1930, Bucksport's Maine Seaboard Paper Company opened its doors as the first paper mill on the Penobscot The mill and the town have experienced significant changes as the paper industry has declined, with the paper mill finally closing its doors in 2014. Despite these hardships, the town of Bucksport has opened new doors both through creative uses of the former mill site, as well as by capitalizing on the town's deepwater port, rail service, and location at the intersection of two loops of the ``three Ring Binder'' broadband network. The resiliency of the town is a testament to its residents' hard work, innovation, and commitment to  Bucksport is home to nearly 5,000 people and continues to grow. Bucksport is centrally located 18 miles from three major employment centers and is also home to numerous cultural and arts organizations like Northeast Historic Film, the Alamo Theater, and the Lighthouse Arts The town also features the Downeast Waterfront Walkway, a mile-long walkway along the Penobscot River with views of Fort Knox and informational panels that detail Bucksport's important past, as well as its potential for the future. I am proud to commemorate 225 years since the incorporation of Bucksport, a town that has greatly contributed to Maine's economic prosperity and a community known for providing the unique Maine experience.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-22-pt1-PgS3729-3.txt,1724,PROTECTING ACCESS TO CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,22.0,June

2893,topic-id,1417,"Madam President, there are some days that are noisy in DC and in the It seems as if the disagreements and the discourse have paused for just a moment, and we remember again that we are all Americans and that there are issues we are facing as a nation.  Earlier this morning a group of baseball players who are also Members of Congress were getting together to practice for a congressional baseball game happening tomorrow night. It is a friendly game, a great competition for charity, and a few Members, Republicans and Democrats, from both the House and the Senate get together and practice and then play the game.  This morning at the Republican practice, a man walked onto the field and opened fire on guys just practicing baseball.  Steve Scalise, who is the majority whip, was hit, two members of his detail, Capitol Hill police, were injured, and other individuals who were there were injured as well. The Capitol Police saved many lives this morning. They were prepared and they returned fire and were able to stop the person who was shooting over and over again at everybody he could see on that baseball field.  What has been interesting today--since I have come out this morning, as I have walked through the hallways heading back and forth to different meetings, I have been interested to see many doors that I have walked by, and when those doors were open, I could hear people inside praying. There have been at least three organized prayer meetings on the Hill today, specifically related just to that, and others spontaneously occurring. Just for a moment we have the opportunity to be able to reflect and say to God: Thank You so much for protecting the people on that field.  Thank you again to the Capitol Police, who literally put their lives on the line to protect the guests and the Members and staff here every single day.  Once again, we remember that we are a nation that solves things by conversation. We disagree, and that is We have said for two centuries that we can disagree. We don't solve it this way, and we cannot.  I would like to be able to join what is happening all over this Hill for just a moment in this room--for us to be able to pray for a moment, as well, for the people who were there and for the people who are going through surgery right now and for their families. For every single staff member who is here, every single Member who is here, every member of the Capitol Hill police, their families are calling them and texting them and saying: Are you OK? These families are scattered all over the country, and they are worried.  We can help lead. We can set a tone to tell the Nation that we should disagree on things, but we don't ever do this. So I would like to ask for us to be able to take a moment of privilege and just be able to pray.  Father, thank You for the way that You have protected--for those individuals who are in surgery now and recovering now, for the Capitol Hill police, Steve Scalise, and for other individuals who were affected today, God, we pray that You would bring them healing.  We pray that You would take care of families who are worried and the Nation that is worried. We pray that You would cause something good to come out of something that is very evil. Help us to know how we respond as a nation.  I ask this in the Name of                     Amendment 232, as Modified  Madam President, we have a lot of issues that are moving right now and a lot of issues that we are discussing. Currently we are discussing sanctions. The sanctions for Russia are entirely appropriate.  I have no question in my mind that Russia has tried to interfere with our elections. I have no question in my mind that Russia did work to interfere with the elections across Europe, especially Eastern There are individuals in Russia that mean to do our Nation economic harm, political harm, and to cause turmoil. For whatever reason, they believe they can strengthen their nation by trying to cause chaos everywhere else.  As Americans, we believe we strengthen our Nation by helping others to succeed. For whatever reason, the Russians believe they can strengthen their nation by trying to cause others to fall. It reminds me a lot of bullies on playgrounds and in middle schools. For whatever reason, they do not advance to the level that they find great joy in helping others; they find their pleasure in trying to diminish others. There is an appropriate response we can make back to that as a Nation; that is, to continue sanctions and to be able to press that.  With the sanctions conversation we have about Russia, we also have an ongoing conversation about sanctions on Iran, and that is one of the reasons I want to visit with this body today to put this word out. For whatever reason, the way sanctions are being organized right now against Russia and Iran, there are two different platforms for how to unwind those sanctions. The way this bill is currently offered, the sanctions against Russia cannot be unwound except by congressional action, but it is not so against Iran, and I am trying to figure out why.  This Congress came to this floor just about a year and a half ago with a bill called the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, which passed 98 to 1 in this body. It was to be able to take authority back so that Congress should be able to vote on sanctions being lifted, in case there is ever a time that any President wants to be able to lift sanctions. Obviously, that debate was circling around the Iran nuclear negotiation at that time, and this body voted 98 to 1 that there should be accountability on any President, regardless of who it is, on the lifting of sanctions against the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world, which is So we added in those sanctions, but for whatever reason on this particular vote, those aren't there, and I have an issue with that.  I would say to this body: Can we learn our lesson? When Congress creates sanctions on nation-states and on individuals, we should also have the authority to determine whether they are lifted or not lifted. Because of that, I have filed simple language to be able to take the bill we have currently and to be able to add in simple language that says something very straightforward: The President can, for national security reasons, lift sanctions on the nation or on individuals for 120 days but cannot renew that until it comes back to If it is truly for national security reasons, there will not be any problem convincing this Congress, either body, that it is essential to be able to do that. But if you can't convince this body that it is for national security reasons, you certainly are not convincing the American people of that.  It is simple, straightforward language that I believe we should have in all of our sanctions bills. Whether it is North Korea, Iran, Russia, or whatever it may be, we should simply say that the American people, through their elected Representatives, say that this group of individuals should be sanctioned, and no individual can pull that back unilaterally without it coming back to the American people again to be able to turn it off. That is how we work as a I believe that is how we should work in the days ahead.  This is not a hostile amendment. This is an amendment saying that we have learned our lesson as a body. We should actually apply this. This is not a partisan issue. Whether it is a Republican or Democrat President is irrelevant in this issue. If Congress creates sanctions, Congress should not release the authority to make decisions on and off. What we turned on, we should be[[Page S3471]]able to turn off. That is the way our system works.  I look forward to the open debate on this simple issue, and I look forward to our determining as a body how we handle sanctions for any nation or any group in the days ahead.  With that, I yield back.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-06-14-pt1-PgS3462-3.txt,2050,PROTECTING ACCESS TO CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,14.0,May

3003,topic-id,640,"Mr.President, this Saturday Alaskans will observe ``Ted Stevens Day,'' a living memory to Alaska's greatest Senator, who left us 7 years ago next month. As family, friends, and former staffers of Senator Stevens gather in Alaska for this annual observance, many will take time off on Thursday to honor a beloved member of the Stevens' team, Ted's loyal assistant and State director, Barbara Andrews-Mee, who passed away earlier this year. I will not be able to attend this event because the Senate will be in session on Thursday, but I wanted to take this opportunity to speak in memory of this loyal and dedicated employee of the U.Senate, as well as great friend of  Barb's tenure with Senator Stevens long predates his Senate service. Barb began working with Ted in 1962, 2 years after she came to She followed him to the Alaska Legislature and the U.Senate, retiring in 1997. Upon her retirement, Stevens said, ``For half of my life--and two-thirds of hers--Barbara Andrews-Mee has been my boss. . . .'' Barb returned the compliment noting that she had been with Ted Stevens longer than she had been with three husbands.  Barb had a great sense of humor and a huge and welcoming personality. She was regarded as a mentor and grandmother-like figure to generations of young staffers who went to work for Senator  She could sure turn a phrase. Alaska humorist Mike Doogan published a few of Barb's quips in the Anchorage Daily News to celebrate her retirement. Among them, Barb, who was 5-feet tall, once said, ``I tell people I used to be 6-foot-2, and then I went to work for Stevens.'' But she wasn't always so humble. Another ``Barbism'' was ``[m]y grandmother always told me dynamite comes in small packages.'' I am told that one came in handy when she was working difficult constituent problems[[Page S4052]]to successful conclusion and building Ted's brand in the process. Whether it was Norwegian stubbornness or Alaskan toughness, she got the job done.  That seemed to be her second best characteristic from Ted's standpoint. In his May 21, 1997, floor tribute to Barb, Senator Stevens said, ``When I've been asked what her best characteristic is, I say `loyalty'. That means more to me than any of the help that she's given me and the people of Alaska over more than three decades; work above and beyond the call of duty.''  Barb was quite the worker, delivering care packages to visiting dignitaries whose flights were refueling at what was then called Elmendorf Air Force Base, picking up Senator Stevens at what is now called Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, whatever the hour, and making sure he made the flight back to Washington, and supporting servicemembers and military families.  It wasn't all work though. Barb actually christened a Navy PC8 coastal patrol craft, the USS She flew in an F-15, experienced several aircraft carrier landings, and traveled in the submarine, USS Then there was golf. In 1995, Barb married Vince Mee, her longtime golfing partner. Senator Stevens performed the ceremony on the ninth hole on Eagleglen golf course on In 2010, Barb authored a book, ``Ted Stevens and Mee,'' a memoir of her time working with the man they called Alaskan of the  Barb lived a wonderful life--or as she might put it, ``A great ride.'' Devoted to her wonderful family, to her church, and to community service, she came far from humble beginnings in South Dakota, leading to a long drive up the Alcan to Glennallen, AK, and a path to Alaskan greatness. One of the first women in Rotary and a member of the Athena Society of Anchorage, Barb's contributions and leadership will be long remembered.

3073,topic-id,418,"Mr.Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Yes, the previous speaker is right. This shouldn't be a partisan issue, but the Republican Party in both houses has been doing its best to destroy healthcare for the American people in the last couple of months. This is just a different piece of the same plot. Bob Wise didn't always have the best judgment.  This cruel legislation does exactly the opposite of what its title states. It would place an artifical and very low cap on noneconomic damages in medical malpractice cases, and it would lock that figure into law without adjustment for inflation, which would reduce its value almost to zero over time.  By capping damages, this bill would ensure that many victims of medical malpractice will not be fairly compensated for their injuries. Many other victims may be unable even to file a case in the first place because they will be unable to retain a lawyer. That is because medical malpractice cases often require significant upfront costs, as high as $100,000 on average, and few attorneys will take a case if the cap on damages means that there will be no reasonable likelihood of recouping their costs.  This bill's cap on noneconomic damages is particularly insidious because of its discriminatory effect on many women, children, and seniors. They often have little or no lost wages to calculate, and, therefore, they may recover very little in the form of economic damages. But they may still have suffered a real and lasting injury that deserves compensation. This includes women who may have chosen to stay home and raise a family, children who have yet to begin their careers, or seniors who have retired and left the workforce.  Why should they be punished under this bill and get very little compensation for a lost limb or something else?  The law recognizes that pain and suffering, and other noneconomic damages, are worthy of compensation, but supporters of this bill think Congress, not juries, should decide what those injuries are worth, and it is shamefully little.  This legislation is based on the California law that includes a cap of $250,000 for noneconomic damages, but it was enacted back in 1975. Whether or not that was an appropriate figure 40 years ago, in today's dollars, it is clearly inadequate.  After adjusting for inflation, the cap would need to be approximately $1.128 million to be the same as the $250,000 cap was when it was enacted.  The The time of the gentleman has expired.

3075,topic-id,185,"Thinking of it another way, that $250,000 cap is now worth just over $56,000, nearly a fifth as much.  Even assuming that $250,000 is the appropriate figure today, fairness demands that this cap be indexed for inflation going forward so that we do not see a similar erosion of value. But this bill locks in an already low cap and lets it dwindle away until it is worth essentially zero.  I offered an amendment to adjust the cap to reflect 40 years of inflation, and to index it going forward, but the Rules Committee did not make it in order. Instead, we are forced to vote on a bill that, over time, will consider pain and suffering to be worth nothing at all.  This bill would not reduce the cost of malpractice insurance, it would not drive bad doctors out of practice, and it would certainly not protect patients.  What it would do is give a free ride to a healthcare provider, or a healthcare entity, that seriously harms a patient or a consumer.  I urge my colleagues to reject this unfair and unnecessary legislation.  ",CREC-2017-06-28-pt1-PgH5263.txt,850,COUNTERING IRAN'S DESTABILIZING ACTIVITIES ACT OF 2017,2017.0,28.0,June

Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the Partnership Grants to Strengthen Families Affected by Parental Substance Abuse I applaud Mr.Davis for all of the excellent work he has done on this issue.  Most substantiated child abuse and neglect cases involve substance abuse by a parent or a guardian. This is something we are seeing all too often in places like my home State of South Substance abuse, especially alcohol and meth, result in far too many instances of child abuse, domestic abuse, and other kinds of violent crime and behavior.  Historically, a lack of coordination and collaboration has hindered the ability of those working in the fields of child welfare and substance abuse, and even the courts, from fully supporting families in substance abuse crisis.  Families involved with child welfare have complex needs. No two cases are alike. It is for this reason that improving outcomes for parents and children require a coordinated effort among all systems.  This bill strengthens the Regional Partnership Grants program, which provides funding to State and regional grantees seeking to provide evidence-based services to prevent child abuse and neglect related to substance abuse. Most importantly, this bill updates the RPG program to specifically address the opioid and heroin epidemics.  By ensuring better coordination, this bill will also encourage States to address the well-being of the family as a whole, using evidence-based approaches to help parents and children at the same time, so many children can stay safely at home with their families.  Finally, this bill is noncontroversial and it is bipartisan. Provisions in this bill were contained in the Family First Prevention Services Act last Congress, which passed the House by a voice vote. The Family First Act, as you recall, was supported by over 500 State and local organizations representing a wide range of practitioners and advocacy organizations.

It fills the gaps in our prior legislation on missing and exploited children. We need to look at such legislation very often because of what we are learning about missing and exploited children.  There are many parts of this bill I support, but I particularly support a provision that we didn't have nearly as much knowledge of during the passage of the last bill: to improve the protection of children in State care. These are often foster children or children without parents. These are the children who may be most susceptible to trafficking and other exploitation.  I certainly would appreciate the efforts of the committee in making sure that provisions of my bill that, I believe, got to you too late, are included in the final House and Senate bill because they are entirely consistent with the bill on the floor today. They come from recent experience of the District of  The D.police began to do something, which I urge all of you to do, and that is to use social media to let people know when there are missing children. It unnerved residents of the District of Columbia until they recognized that the city didn't have any more missing children than any other jurisdiction. Still, I support what the District did in using social media. Still, we simply don't know enough.  My provisions would have the government collect subsets of data that it does not collect today. For example, we found in the District that there were more missing girls of color than boys. We ought to have known that from national statistics. You don't know it because there are no national statistics on the subsets of children.  My bill would collect and publish demographic characteristics that simply are not published today on race, gender, sexual orientation, and gender identity. If you think of those categories, you will understand why these may be the children in particular need of protection.  In addition, there is no current comprehensive count of missing children in the United So, we need more work on this bill. We need to break down to these subsets so that jurisdictions, like my own, will know where to focus when we are focusing on missing children.  Again, I am pleased that the District turned out not to have any more missing children than the average jurisdiction, but I am also pleased that it got a rise out of people who never would have paid attention to this issue until the police department decided to go on social media.  We want to make sure that we cover all of our children and that we do what this bill does.  What are the gaps? Where do we need to fill in?  Mr.Speaker, this is the first bill on missing children in a number of years.

Before I begin, I want to take a moment to mark the 1-year anniversary of the Pulse Nightclub shooting and to remember the 49 lives that were cut short in the deadliest mass shooting in our Nation's history.  As we grieve for the victims and their families, we must continue to stand in solidarity with the survivors and with the LGBTQ community against hate, intolerance, for love, in support of our Nation's values of equality and dignity for all.[[Page H4840]]  The kind of intolerance, hate, and violence on display that day in Orlando has become an alarming trend in this country, a trend that has disturbingly been fueled by President According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, 37 percent of the 1,094 bias-related incidents in just the first month after the election referenced the President, his campaign slogans, or his remarks about sexual assault.  As he did throughout his campaign, President Trump continues to speak the language of racial and cultural grievance, pitting Americans against one another and perpetuating the viciousness he pretends to despise. The result is what you would expect: a spike in hate crimes and hate speech.  I have seen in my district in New Jersey where anti-Semitic graffiti was plastered on a pedestrian bridge. We have seen it at American University and just down the road at the National Museum of African American History and Culture, where nooses were found last month. Communities of color know this pain all too well.  Mr.Speaker, I am really fortunate to be able to discuss an issue of such importance to this This is one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  You know, I have been very fortunate in my life to have been born into a situation where a great American prior to me held this seat for 23 years in the 10th Congressional District of the State of New His name was Donald He was my father and he afforded me a lifestyle, one of which I did not know of his suffering and pain growing up as a young African American in this country. But even in that situation, I have found myself--irrespective of being in that position, I found myself in situations that have been dangerous and uncomfortable.  As a young, 20-year-old--you know, when we are 20, we do things that we probably shouldn't be doing at times. I was on my lunchtime going downtown to pay a bill at a department store where I had my first credit card, and I was running late. So what I decided to do was make a U-turn on the main street, Broad Street, in Newark, New Jersey, which is the largest street in the town. And I made a U-turn to come in front of the store.  Naturally, you know, with my luck, a motorcycle police officer was coming down the street at the same time. So he pulled me over, as he should, and I was wrong. But I was using my cousin's car. So when he asked me for my license and registration, I could not find the papers that I needed and I was fumbling and nervous.  The officer leaned into the car and used the N-word and said: If you don't find those documents in a minute, I will throw you so far under the jail that they will never find you.  So this is very frightening for any citizen to go through. So I was able to get my license, and I handed it to him. Just before that, they would throw me so far under the jail that they would never find me again. Once I handed him my license and it said that I was Donald Payne, Jr., whose father was a sitting councilman in the city of Newark, his whole attitude changed.  ``Don't you know that you could get hurt, or you could hurt someone, or you have to be careful.'' A minute ago I was nothing. I would be so far under the jail, they would never find me. But now that I am connected to something or someone, all of a sudden we have become paternal.  Mr.Speaker, there are millions of people in this country that aren't connected to someone, and these are the types of things that they go through. So I am just here to say that we must be vigilant.

I would like to acknowledge the great work and the leadership of our chair, Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, and, of course, my coanchor, Marc Veasey of Texas, as we lead the discussion for the next 60 minutes.  In these next 60 minutes, we have a chance to speak directly to the American people on issues of great importance to the Congressional Black Caucus, Congress, and the constituents that we represent.  In this hour, we would like to discuss racism and discrimination in America and, specifically, hate crimes and the radicalization and the domestic terrorism that they present to the American people.  The conclusion of Dylann Roof's trial a few month's ago is the latest reminder that homegrown terrorism has become part of the fabric of life in This problem shows no signs of fading yet reveals a threat that is both rare and more complex than simple explanation suggests.  Solving the issue of domestic terrorism through hate crimes involves understanding the true nature of the problem--violent domestic extremism--so that effective steps can be taken to protect the Nation from it.  It is legitimate to ask whether homegrown terrorists are being radicalized. We talk about jihadi narratives and Islamic extremism, the Islamic State group recruiting online; but there are other groups in this Nation which are radicalizing our youth, radicalizing young people to be a threat against other This is a subject and a discussion that has rarely been discussed and which we believe is very important.  Since 2001, almost 40 percent of the nearly 150 terrorism fatalities in the United States were related to domestic motivations, not jihadi narratives.

During the presidential campaign, then-candidate Donald      Trump employed starkly divisive rhetoric to connect with a      segment of his base that relished in cultural grievance and      hatred. His tone and the arguments that he made were      incredibly offensive to minority communities, and his      campaign rallies were forums for some of the ugliest public      displays of race-based violence and animus in modern      political times. Numerous Black Americans were assaulted at      his rallies and scenes of deep racial resentment against      Blacks, Hispanics, immigrants, and Muslims were frequently      paraded and celebrated.       Since the election, it seems hate-filled individuals have      been emboldened to terrorize minority communities. In just      the first 34 days after the election, the Southern Poverty      Law Center counted a total of 1,094 bias incidents around the      nation. Disturbingly, the Center also calculated that 37      percent of these cases directly referenced either President-     elect Trump, his campaign slogans, or his infamous remarks      about sexual assault. This data is just from the immediate      aftermath of the election. The numbers have increased since      then, with national news providing coverage. These are not      isolated incidents, but rather a frightening trend forming      before our eyes.       In fact, this is occurring in Congress' own back yard, like      the horrific hate crime that took place just a few miles away      at the University of Maryland when Richard Collins III, a      promising young man, was stabbed to death on the eve of his      graduation from Bowie State University by an admitted white      supremacist. There have also been several reports of nooses      hung throughout the District of Columbia, including in the      African American Museum of History and Culture and on      American University's campus. To add insult to injury, a      Mississippi lawmaker recently called for Louisiana      politicians to be ``lynched'' for supporting the removal of      racist confederate monuments from New       Surely there is no greater cause of a government than to      protect the lives of its citizens, particularly those      uniquely vulnerable to hate, intolerance, and violence. The      federal hate crimes statutes were designed with that mission      in mind and serve as a critically important tool in      combatting the most insidious elements of our society. That      is why I implore you to dedicate additional resources within      your respective agencies to address the increasing frequency      of these deplorable acts. you should and must investigate      each and every potential hate crime and prosecute offenders      to the fullest extent allowed under the law. You should also      ensure that community leaders, including state and local law      enforcement, understand the federal resources available to      investigate and prosecute hate crimes.       Your leadership is required to not only bring justice to      the victims of hate crimes, but also to send a clear message      that these acts of domestic terrorism will never be tolerated      in this country.

This is an opportunity for us as Americans to see the victimization even of those children who become a part of the alt-right, who become a part of neo-Nazi groups; that they are, in fact, being radicalized by these very disturbing groups, and that we, as leaders in America, have a responsibility.

First of all, it has nothing to do with ``groundless cases or frivolous claims,'' because the draconian new limits proposed in their legislation applied only to valid claims in serious cases. It has nothing to do with groundless cases and frivolous claims. That is an irrelevant distraction from their own legislation, which is an attempt to reduce what you can recover with a perfectly valid claim when a jury has awarded you damages.  Number two, the floor leader says that it would not apply in the case of someone being raped in a nursing home. Perhaps he thinks it wouldn't apply to my constituent, a 15-year-old girl who got raped by her dentist.  But as I read the bill, it says, ``healthcare lawsuit means any action against a healthcare provider,'' and that includes anyone who is providing healthcare. So if a nursing home is providing healthcare or a dentist is providing healthcare, they would be covered by the law.  But I would invite the floor leader to clear this up, because if he is representing now that rapes of patients in a nursing home or in a dentist's office don't count, that should be definitive legislative history that we establish today because we tried to amend the bill to that effect in committee and the majority voted it down. But he has just represented that a rape would not count, and I want him to definitively commit whether or not a rape by a healthcare provider would count.  Finally, the gentleman from Iowa says it won't preempt the States, it will not impose Federal laws because it is still in the State courts. It is still in the State courts, but Federal law now applies.  There are 28 States which have said that you cannot limit people's access to noneconomic damages when a jury wants to award them those damages for pain and suffering. They have either said in their Constitution there can be no limits at all, or the legislatures have said it, or the State supreme courts have struck it down.

3176,topic-id,2152,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to voice my support for the FDA Reauthorization Within this legislation is a very important measure that will support the development of innovative and promising cancer drugs--the RACE for Children Act,[[Page S4719]]which is a law that I introduced with Senator Michael Bennet of the State of  RACE for Children is sorely needed, as it would close a loophole that exists in current Federal law and prompt companies--pharmaceutical companies--to examine the safety and the efficacy of powerful cancer drugs and how they work on children. This, in turn, will provide doctors with the necessary information to properly treat children battling cancer.  Pediatric cancer is a leading cause of death by disease among children. A startling statistic: One in every 285 children is diagnosed with cancer before the age of 20. While the good news is that researchers are continuing to make significant advances to treat and cure cancer for adults, the progress to develop safe drugs for pediatric cancer sadly lags far behind.  One of the problems is that current law, the way it is today, directs pharmaceutical companies to study the safety and the efficacy of adult drugs on children. So if you develop a drug on diabetes or heart disease or anything for adults, it also requires you to do some of that on children because you want to make sure that it works on both populations and you don't want to keep a drug out of the market for children that could work for them. Of course, this requirement is only in place if the FDA believes that there is a pertinent need--in essence, a condition that children suffer from. There are some conditions that are unique to adults; there are few, if any, pediatric populations who have that disease, so maybe they would decide it wasn't pertinent to require it.  However, this provision in the law specifically exempts cancer drugs. In essence, it says to a pharmaceutical company: If you are going to study the safety and the efficacy of a drug on adults, if there is a pertinent need, if there is a real population out there that suffers from the same condition in children, you have to test it on children, as well, except if it is a cancer drug. One of the reasons that exemption is in there is because technology--medical technology at the time that law was put in place--didn't allow researchers to target the genetic structure of cancer. In essence, at the time, it didn't allow them to say: We can go in and find the genetic markers of a specific cancer and test against it. That is why it didn't have that requirement.  Now, however, we do have that capability. Today, the technology exists to pinpoint the similarities in adult and childhood cancer genomes. So the technology has now reached a point where you can treat the specific genome of a cancer whether it is in an adult or in a child. That is how far the technology has advanced, but the law has not been updated to keep up with it. The result is that there are a lot of adult advances being made, and we don't know if they work on children because they haven't been forced to test it.  So the RACE for Children's Act, which is a law that Senator Bennet and I offered and is included in the FDA reauthorization, closes that loophole.  Let me say that getting to this point here on the floor was not easy. So I do need to take a moment to thank the chairman, Senator Alexander of Tennessee, and obviously Senator Bennet, but also the pediatric cancer community, including organizations like the Live Like Bella Foundation in my hometown of Miami, Lambs for Life, the Alliance for Childhood Cancer, Jude's, Baldrick's, Nemours Children's Hospital, Arnold Palmer Hospital, the American Cancer Society, and so many others that came together to the table to address this important issue in a way that would not limit future innovations for cancer treatment. It has taken over a year and a half to reach this point, and I am grateful to all of them for their participation because I would not be standing here giving this speech without it.  Suffice it to say that, tragically, many of my colleagues in Congress, here in the Senate but also across the country, have been affected by cancer. Whether you are fighting cancer yourself or it is your child, your sister, your brother, your cousin, your friend, I want to make one thing clear: You are not alone in your struggle.  I would venture to say that I do not know anyone who has not been impacted by pediatric cancer. I have it in my own family, and some have confronted it in theirs, in loved ones and children who went to school with your kids. In fact, Live Like Bella Foundation was founded for a young girl by the name of Bella from She was a classmate of my nephew in grade school, and she lost her battle with cancer. Her father has been a tireless advocate for this cause. He moved Heaven and Earth to try to reach a point where they could find a cure for her. That did not come in time. He has now made it the mission of his life to honor her life by continuing this work. So we have all been impacted in some way.  As I said, unfortunately, across this country this disease is a reality. I want to share some stories of a few of the children who have been impacted by cancer and who have impacted our office and helped us to make this a priority over the last year and a half.  The first is the story of a young boy named He is only 5 years old and has been in treatment for 4 of those 5 years. He has had more than 150 surgeries so far, and ultimately had to have his eyes removed because of cancer, which left him completely blind, obviously.  Then there is Tatum, who was diagnosed with a rapidly developing brain tumor just before she was supposed to start kindergarten. Her parents were told by the doctors that they should take her home and they should enjoy the little time they had with Tatum because they had no options to treat her.  There is Princeton, who was diagnosed with cancer when he was 5 years old. He is now 7. In those 2 years he has undergone 6 chemo cycles, a bone marrow transplant, 9 surgeries, 12 rounds of radiation, and 6 cycles of immunotherapy. Because of this intense and time-consuming treatment schedule, Princeton built friendships with others who were also in the hospital for treatment. Sadly, he has lost many of these friends.  Princeton's best friend was Trevor passed away right before Princeton's birthday party. Princeton came to my office asking the Senate to do more for kids like them. Here is what 7-year-old Princeton said: ``I don't want my friends to die, and I don't want me to die.''  There is the story of He was a healthy, happy baby until he developed an aggressive form of cancer and it produced tumors all over his body. His body was literally taken over by tumors. At only 5 months of age, baby Derek lost his battle against cancer.  These are real stories. They are real, heartbreaking stories--stories of our neighbors, friends, and family and what they have endured.  But with the developments in medicine today, there is no reason these children shouldn't have a second chance. Yet the treatment options for children with cancer is much more limited than it is for adults, and some of the reasons why are the issues we are trying to address about this law here today.  Recent advancements in cancer treatment enable oncology drugs to specifically target the genetic structure of the cancer, and that makes it possible to transition certain adult cancer drugs for pediatric use. However, the basic information you need to do that--about dosing and safety--needs to be determined to guide the doctors responsible for treating these children. These treatments, these advances are providing new-found hope for cancer patients, but mostly only for adult cancer patients.  Fortunately, we have a chance and an opportunity to change this, and that is the goal of the RACE for Children  The House recently passed the RACE for Children Act as part of the FDA user fee reauthorization bill that is before us here today. It is now our turn to do so and to send this important and potentially lifesaving legislation to the President for his signature.  In a place where we have had some heated debates over the last 7 years, since I have been here--6\1/2\, and more to come--sometimes it feels as though, perhaps, our service here doesn't make much of an impact. But from time to time, we have unique opportunities to vote on laws and legislation that slightly alter the arc of history and potentially help people. Standing here today, I can't tell you if there will be[[Page S4720]]1,000 children, 100,000 children, or 5 children who will benefit from a cancer treatment because of this new requirement in which these adult drugs will have to be tested on children. We don't know.  Standing here today, believing that we all walk on Earth and our days are numbered to the glory and grace of God, frankly, we don't know if one of our own children, God forbid or someone we deeply love or one of our children's classmates will be impacted by pediatric cancer. But we know that 1 in about 300 children will be. So the chances are that at some point, we will once again have someone we care deeply about impacted. We hope that when that moment comes, if it does, that there will be options for their parents and their doctors and that they will have the opportunity to use for them treatments that perhaps would not have been available, had this requirement not been in the law. That is why I hope and I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in supporting this initiative.  In fact, sometimes we give these speeches with a sense of mystery: If this passes; if it doesn't pass; there is no reason this isn't going to pass. We all expect the FDA reauthorization bill to pass. I imagine when people vote on this tomorrow, they will read the title of the bill, ``FDA Fee Reauthorization.'' It sounds like taking care of the normal course of business--it is important in its own right, by the way--that this is just this bureaucratic exercise to reauthorize an expiring law. Embedded in that law is a very important law, one that I hope will lead to real life-changing innovation in a way that will impact lives, change and save the lives of children here in our country but ultimately in other parts of the world as well.  That is why I felt it was important to come to the Senate floor and, obviously, urge my colleagues to support this initiative but also to urge my colleagues to be proud of it.  We are about to go home, whether it is tomorrow or next week, and answer to our constituents for all the things we didn't do. There are some significant issues we have not confronted and solved for the country, but this is a significant issue. There aren't going to be a lot of articles written about it; there aren't going to be blaring headlines on the websites about it, mailers and campaign commercials. That doesn't mean it isn't important. We live in a society where oftentimes good news doesn't draw ratings, and good news doesn't drive eyeballs and clicks to a website. It doesn't make it unimportant. It doesn't make it insignificant.  This is significant. This is an opportunity. This is evidence that more often than perhaps people realize, fellow Americans of different points of view, representing diverse States and communities, who approach the political process with very different ideologies and aims, come together to make a difference. I am pleased that while there are many things we have not done, we will leave here tomorrow or next week knowing that at least we did one thing that will matter. It is an important thing because these children whom we are trying to help do not have the time to continue waiting for us to step up and take action.  I thank the  With that, I yield the floor.

2906,topic-id,692,"Mr.President, in a few minutes, we will vote on an amendment that consists of a package of Russia sanctions. I would like to endorse the amendment in the strongest possible terms and hope we can get all of our colleagues to vote for it.  It was negotiated by a bipartisan group of Senators who did a great job: Senators Corker and Cardin, Crapo and Brown, with a great deal of help from Senators Shaheen, Durbin, Leader McConnell and I worked extremely well on this issue together, which I hope portends future things we can do together in a bipartisan way. This amendment is as bipartisan as it gets, and rightly so because this is an issue that should unite Members of both parties and concern Americans of all political stripes.  Over the past several years, President Putin and his allies and the Russian oligarchy have committed several sanctionable offenses. President Putin has violated the sovereignty of its neighbor, Ukraine, by annexing He is guilty of human rights abuses, including propping up the brutal Assad regime in Syria, and stifling political dissent and the human rights of his own people. In Mr.Putin's Russia, elections are neither fair nor free. The media is controlled by the state, and the political opposition is hardly tolerated.  This is a regime that has routinely flouted international norms and agreements; that severely and brutishly pursues its own self-interest without regard to legitimate rights of other nations and peoples. For that, the U.Congress passed a series of economic sanctions to squeeze Putin and his allies and show them that the United States strongly condemns these actions, and that was before Russia conducted a high-level campaign to interfere in the American election.  The Russia sanctions legislation we are about to vote on would address these two critical issues. By codifying existing sanctions and creating a process for congressional review of any decision to weaken or lift them, we are ensuring that the United States continues to punish Putin for his reckless and destabilizing actions. It is particularly significant that a bipartisan coalition is seeking to reestablish Congress, not the President, as the final arbiter of sanctions relief, considering that this administration has been too eager--far too eager in my mind--to put sanctions relief on the table. These additional sanctions will send a powerful bipartisan statement that Russia and any other nation that might try to interfere with our elections will be punished.  There is no process more sacred in our democracy than the guarantee of free and fair elections, no principle more enshrined in our system of government than the people participating in our noble democratic experiment at the ballot box. That bedrock principle, the fundamental right was attacked by Mr.If we did nothing--or we reduce sanctions, as the President sometimes has talked about--we would eat at the wellspring of our democracy. Foreign powers influencing whom we elect is something the Founding Fathers feared, and we are doing everything we can in this body to try and stop.  With the upcoming vote, the U.Senate is saying to President Putin: You will be held accountable for your actions. Foreign interference in our democracy has been a concern since the founding of the It is the origin of the emoluments clause in the In Federalist 68, Alexander Hamilton writes that ``these most deadly adversaries of the republican government [come] chiefly from the desire in foreign powers to gain improper ascendant in our councils.'' Every ``practical obstacle,'' Hamilton[[Page S3474]]said, ``should be opposed to [such] cabal, intrigue, and corruption.''  We cannot let Russia's meddling in our elections go unpunished, lest they ever consider such interference again, nor any other nation in the world. They must know that if any future attempts are made to degrade our democracy, the retribution of the U.Congress will be sure and will be swift.  I urge a ``yes'' vote on the amendment.

3024,topic-id,1125,"Finally, Madam President, a word on healthcare.  The Republicans continue to work on their healthcare bill behind closed doors, and now it seems they are looking for a vote on a final bill before the July 4th recess.  To all of America, this should be a red alert. This is not a drill. This is a red alert. In a very short time, maybe only 2 weeks, the Republican majority may try to jam through a healthcare bill that no one in America has seen--no committee hearings, no public debate. According to some reports, the Republicans will not publicly release the text until the very last moment.  What Senate Republicans are doing on healthcare is one of the most outrageous examples of legislative malpractice in decades.  Senator McConnell, who believes in regular order, ought to think long and hard before he does this because it will not go down as a fine moment in history for him, for his party, or for the This is the party that chanted ``Read the bill, read the bill,'' when ObamaCare was being debated, and now they will not even show the bill.  Democrats spent over a year on the Affordable Care Act, the ObamaCare bill, with multiple committee hearings. We actually accepted dozens of Republican amendments. Show us the bill. Senators Grassley, Hatch, and others had amendments that were added to the bill. Show us the bill so we have the same opportunity.  Why would the majority so starkly depart from the normal legislative procedure? Why would they seek to pass in the dark of night a bill that affects one-sixth of the economy, millions of people's lives?  Leader McConnell used to stress the importance of regular order in the Why is he proceeding with the Republican healthcare bill in the most irregular way? I know why. It is because Republicans don't want the American people to see the bill. They are so ashamed of their healthcare plan, they want to pass it in the dead of night, with no hearings, no amendments--rushing it through.  It is not a bill they are proud of. If they were proud of the bill, they would say: Let's debate it. They are ashamed of the bill. They know they have the hard right on their backs saying: You have to do something. But at least have the decency, the honor, a little bit of courage to put the bill out there and let us debate it and let us amend it.  The Republicans don't want the American people to know their bill will likely gut Medicaid to finance a massive tax break for the wealthiest of Americans, hurt the healthcare of average Americans, middle-class Americans, elderly Americans, those who abuse opioids, so they can have a big tax break for people whose income is above $200,000 a year.  The Republicans don't want the American people to know their bill will make older and sicker Americans pay more for less coverage. Someone 63 or 64 could see their premiums go up three, four, five times, while millionaires and billionaires get a break on their taxes. If it were my bill, I would be ashamed of it too. Thank God it is not.  Republicans don't want the American people to know their bill will cause their costs to go up, their care to go down, while leaving millions of Americans without health insurance. Why are Republicans working so hard in secret for a bill they are clearly not proud of? Because the ideologues on the hard right are pushing them to just repeal and give a tax break to the rich.  It is because they repeated the political slogan ``repeal and replace'' to their base for 7 years without coming[[Page S3383]]up with a workable healthcare plan when the day came that they were actually in charge.  Now we have this Frankenstein bill from the House, assembled from spare parts intended to buy off different Republican constituencies, and the Republican majority in the Senate, which we thought at one point would show more honor and more courage, seems to be taking the same approach. They are working on modifying the bill so it can get 50 votes in their caucus, no matter what the impact is on the country. Most of the devastating consequences of the House bill will remain.  Mark my words, my Republican friends, the Republican Party will regret the day it passes a bill that looks anything like what is now being considered. Every independent analysis has shown that TrumpCare will devastate sicker, older Americans, folks in rural areas, the working poor, younger couples and middle-aged couples who have a parent in a nursing home. It will raise costs on middle-class families, and those struggling to get there will be left with a healthcare system that works only for the healthiest and wealthiest among us, and the Republicans will own every last shred of the responsibility. They will own it completely because there has not been a scrap of bipartisan input on the bill, not a single Democratic amendment, not a single hearing, and no one even knows exactly what the bill looks like.  A senior GOP aide said in the paper today that they weren't releasing the bill text because ``we are not stupid.'' I challenge that claim. Keeping a bill this bad holed up in secret and then forcing it down the throats of the American people is much more stupid than simply showing the bill, allowing it to be vetted and amended, and allowing it to be improved. It is much more stupid.  The Republicans are going down a dark path, down a dangerous road that will have devastating consequences for their party and of course for the American people. Believe me, this is not what Democrats want.  We Democrats are actually willing to take on some of the responsibility. We are willing to work with our Republican colleagues to make improvements to our healthcare system and to fix problems with the existing law. That involves some political risk. We are willing to take on that risk to try and help more Americans afford healthcare.  The Republicans are doing just the opposite by hiding their bill under lock and key. They are trying to avoid the risk of public backlash on a bill that, at least the polling shows, has the support of a mere sliver of the American people--18 percent. It will backfire. It will do potentially irrevocable damage to their party and more importantly to our country.  The Republicans ought to turn back before it is too late. They will rue the day they rushed this bill, in the dark of night, that does so much damage to the American people.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-12-pt1-PgS3382-5.txt,1036,JACKIE ROBINSON DAY AND THE TAMPA BAY RAYS,2017.0,12.0,June

Too often, we find ourselves splitting into smaller factions. We stop listening to others' points of view. We react immediately with hostility, doubting the very intentions of folks who do not agree with our perspective. This is very dangerous for our future. We seem to have forgotten how to disagree without being disagreeable, and today's shooting is one of the manifestations of that.  This weekend marks 2 years since the massacre at Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston, SC--my home--where a racist who wanted to start a race war decided that he could take advantage of the cracks in our foundation, that he could drive to Charleston, SC, and take advantage of those cracks. But the families of the victims, understanding and appreciating the notion of Matthew 5:44--loving those who seem to be our enemies--did not allow their grief and their anger to overpower their senses. They believed in the power of love. They believed that love is more powerful than hate. They believed in each other. And because of their conviction, my city and my State stood together, Black South Carolinians and White South Carolinians, and said to the world: Not in my place, not in my city, not in my State, and not in my houses of worship. We stood together. We did not allow this spirit of oppression and division to separate us. We allowed the power of love to unite us.

We must work together, ensuring opportunity for all, not profiting from the division in this Nation, not looking for ways to get more clicks on our pages. And why is that?

In Texas, the statute of limitations begins to run from the date the alleged negligence occurs or date of last treatment. This is a certain date that does not leave room for controversy. I believe aligning the underlying text with this approach will benefit both physicians and patients to clarify exactly where harm might occur.  My amendment clarifies that when the date of the breach or tort is known, the statute runs from that date. When the date of the breach or tort is not known, the statute runs from the last date of treatment. By this method, certainty is provided to defendant, plaintiff, and the court. Easy understanding. For example, if there is a surgical mishap, the statute would run from that date. On the other hand, if the injury is from the prescription medication over a long period of time, it would run from the date of last treatment.

Texas added, in the first year, some 4,500 doctors who came to Texas knowing that it was a level playing field.

Russia's goals were to undermine faith in the US      democratic process.  While recently we have learned more about the scope of their interference, a classified National Security Agency report, prepared prior to the November election, concluded that Russian military intelligence executed a cyber attack on at least one U.voting software supplier and sent spear-fishing emails to more than 100 local election officials. Yesterday, Bloomberg reported that Russia's cyber attack on the U.electoral system included incursions into voter databases and software systems in as many as 39  We are learning more and more about the extent to which Russia attacked our voting system and tried to undermine our elections. That is exactly why the Senate stands united behind this bipartisan amendment to stiffen sanctions. We must not allow this kind of interference in our elections to become a normal process.  What we have heard from experts in the intelligence community--they have warned us that if Russia gets a pass on this, that it will interfere in future U.elections. We have seen it in Europe and other Western democracies.  In testimony last month before the Judiciary Committee, the former Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, said:       I believe [the Russians] are now emboldened to continue      such activities in the future both here and around the world,      and to do so even more intensely.  He goes on to say:       I hope the American people recognize the severity of this      threat and that we collectively counter it before it further      erodes the fabric of our democracy.  Russia's interference in our electoral process should outrage every patriotic We need a bolder, more aggressive strategy for deterring This bipartisan agreement to stiffen sanctions is a critical step forward.  In concert with this legislation, we need to be focused on bolstering NATO and our European allies, and we need to demonstrate more vigorous support for Ukraine's efforts to strengthen its democracy and independence.  We need to be more aggressive in countering the Russia propaganda and disinformation campaign, including the Russia Today empire.  Finally, I want to again applaud the leadership of all of our committees who were involved in coming up with this bipartisan agreement. Also, I applaud the bipartisan leadership of Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer because without their negotiations, we would not be here today.  I certainly urge all of my colleagues in both Houses of Congress to promptly approve this legislation, and I hope the President will sign it.  The PRESIDING The Democratic leader.

2930,topic-id,1372,"Mr.President, we are on the Senate floor today, yesterday, and tomorrow, and we will be continuing the debate on the Countering Iran's Destabilizing Activities Act of 2017. This is actually a very important bill, and I want to commend Senator Cardin, Senator Corker, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and many others on working hard to put this bill together in the Foreign Relations  There is a lot of interest in this. I am a cosponsor of the bill, and I think it is an important bill.  Let me just give a quick overview of what its core purpose is. There was a lot of discussion last year about the JCPOA--what it was going to do and what it wasn't going to do. I think a lot of us, even those who supported it--and I certainly did not support it. As a matter of fact, I thought it was a very misbegotten agreement that was going to undermine American interests and the interests of our allies in the region. But a number of us were concerned about what it didn't cover. The bill we are debating today does close some of those loopholes. For example, the core purpose of 722 is to impose sanctions on Iran for its ballistic missile program, which continues to violate U.Security Council resolutions, and its support of terrorism.  It is still listed by our State Department as the 1 state sponsor of terrorism in the world. As to its transfer of illicit weapons, which it is not supposed to do under U.Security Council resolutions, it continues to do that, and, of course, there is its continuing and widespread abuse of human rights. That is all still happening with regard to this Iranian regime, which the previous administration spent so much time negotiating with to get this nuclear deal that, I think, undermines our interests.  The bill we are focused on is very bipartisan. It sets to close some of these loopholes and impose sanctions for these kinds of violations. It does not violate the I think Senators Corker and Cardin worked hard to make sure that would not be the case in order to get bipartisan buy-in. I think it is an important bill, but it could have been stronger. Unfortunately, a number of us had provisions and amendments that were meant to strengthen it. Some of us don't sit on the Foreign Relations Committee, but we have a lot of interest and experience with these issues. What we could have done was to actually make this bill stronger by looking at some of the other amendments that Members of the Senate brought to the floor on this very bill.  Let me give you one example. I had an amendment that was a very simple amendment. It essentially stated that Iranian banks and financial institutions would not be able to use the U.financial system--our banking system, which is critical to global commerce to conduct any business around the world--until Iran was taken off the list of countries that sponsor state terrorism--very simple: not using the American financial system until you are not a terrorist designated by our State This is important. These kinds of sanctions are important because Iran and other rogue nations--you see it all the time--want access to[[Page S3484]]our financial institutions and the dollar, the world's currency. Roughly 43 percent of international financial transactions and more than 60 percent of total allocated global floor exchange reserves are denominated in U.dollars.  We have tremendous leverage over other countries, even if we are acting just as the United States, with regard to accessing the U.financial system. When you have these kinds of sanctions, when other countries are not allowed to access our financial system, it puts a real strong bite on their economy.  We wanted to bring this down to the floor. Again, there is bipartisan support for this amendment. Unfortunately, not many but just a few of my colleagues wouldn't want to accept this. They didn't even want to vote on the amendment. They believed, incorrectly, that somehow this would undermine the Well, it wouldn't. As a matter of fact, former Secretary of the Treasury Jack Lew stated that under the JCPOA, the Treasury Department was still going to prohibit Iranian banks from being able to use U.dollars through New York or to hold correspondent account relationships with U.financial institutions. He testified that the JCPOA would continue to bar Iranian financial institutions from using our financial system. So that is happening right now.  What we wanted to do with this amendment was to say that we are going to make that legislation; we are going to make that a statutory prohibition, and the biggest sponsor of terrorism in the world shouldn't be able to use our financial system until they are no longer a sponsor of terrorism--very simple. But we couldn't get that through the If we voted on it, I believe there would be a strong bipartisan majority of Senators who would agree with us, but there are a few who don't.  The JCPOA was sold in many ways as helping to ensure that Iran would moderate its behavior, that Iran would become part of the ``community of nations'' again.  Well, of course, despite claims by the former President and the former Secretary of State that this is what the agreement would do, that hasn't happened. To the contrary, the opposite has happened. Iran has undertaken activities to undermine U.interests, the interests of Israel--our sacred ally in the Middle East--and the interests of our gulf Arab allies in the Middle East on almost a daily basis.  Look at what has happened since that agreement was signed. Moderating behavior did not happen; much more aggressive behavior did. It is really important for people to remember that this isn't just the largest state sponsor of terrorism. This is a country whose activities have led to the deaths and wounding of thousands of American soldiers and marines. The Iranian regime was supplying very sophisticated IEDs to Iraqi Shia militias that were killing, maiming, and wounding our troops in That is a fact. This is a regime with the blood of U.soldiers, marines, sailors, and airmen on its hands. This is not a regime we should trust. This is a regime about which we should do everything we have in our power to use our leverage to help undermine their nefarious activities around the world that they have been conducting for decades.  So again, my congratulations and I am going to vote for the bill. My congratulations go to Senators Corker and Cardin for this important bill, but it could be stronger. We need to look at ways to make this stronger. This was a missed opportunity, simply bringing an amendment like this to the floor for a vote. Let's see where people stand. It would be strongly supported by the American people, strongly supported by our allies, strongly supported by Members of the Senate on both sides of the aisle.  Unfortunately, there are a few in the Senate who seem more interested in protecting the legacy of the JCPOA than in really putting the screws to Iran and really limiting their ability to fund terrorism or their illicit businesses around the world. That is disappointing. These Senators will not say they are doing that, but that is what is going on here. The legacy of the JCPOA is not worth safeguarding if it means missing the opportunity to further leverage and undermine Iranian terrorist activities around the world. So that is a disappointment we have seen today.  I am going to continue to keep pushing to do more to make sure we take every action, every bit of leverage that the United States of America has to push back against the nefarious activities of the biggest sponsor of terrorism in the world--the Iranian regime and its leadership. I know that most of my colleagues--Democrats and Republicans--are interested in doing so today. We made a good start with this bill that hopefully is going to pass the Senate floor, but we can do much more. We need to do much more. I am going to continue to press my colleagues to do so.  I yield the floor.  (",CREC-2017-06-14-pt1-PgS3462-3.txt,2290,PROTECTING ACCESS TO CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,14.0,June

2922,topic-id,431,"Mr.President, like all of us here on Capitol Hill, I am still reeling from the attack on our colleagues this morning. My thoughts and prayers are with everyone who was injured, and with their families.  My friend and colleague Steve Scalise remains in critical condition right now, and I am praying for a full and swift recovery.  I am grateful to hear that the young congressional staffer who was shot--a legislative correspondent for Representative Roger Williams--is expected to make a complete recovery.  Legislative correspondents and the other young staffers who work in our offices don't get a lot of media attention, but not one of us could do our jobs serving our constituents without them. We are grateful for their work and dedication.  In the Gospel of John, Jesus says: ``Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.''  Most of us have never been in a situation where we have a need to consider such a great sacrifice. But, every day, the men and women of the United States Capitol Police, and every police force in this country, get up and go about their jobs, knowing that they may have to lay down their lives, and they do so willingly. When others run from danger, they run into it. When bullets fly, they advance.  Today, violence threatened, and officers of the Capitol Police stepped up to meet it. Had it not been for the efforts of the heroic officers who were on site, today's attack could have been much, much worse. As it is, their actions have brought many safely home to their families tonight.  Events like today remind us that there is evil in the world, but they also remind us that there is good. Around every act of evil and violence, 100 acts of good spring up. The officers who risked their lives to defend those at the scene, the colleagues who hurried to provide medical care to Steve Scalise, the Alexandria police officers who came running to help, the Democratic congressional baseball team who united in prayer for their colleagues, the injured officer who went to check on the Member he was protecting before he thought of seeking treatment for himself--these are the things that endure.

I will yield to him as the chairman of the Armed Services  The PRESIDING The Senator from                     Amendment 232, as Modified  Mr.Madam President, I rise in support of the Countering Russian Aggression and Cyber Attacks Act, an amendment to the Iran sanctions bill currently under consideration.  In just the last 3 years under Vladimir Putin, Russia has invaded Ukraine, annexed Crimea, threatened NATO allies, and intervened militarily in Syria, leaving a trail of death, destruction, and broken promises in his wake. And of course, last year, Russia attacked the foundations of American democracy with a cyber and information campaign to interfere in America's 2016 election.  It has been 8 months now since the U.intelligence community publicly concluded that the Russian Government had attempted to interfere in our last Presidential election. Since then, the intelligence community has concluded that it is confident that the Russian Government directed a campaign to compromise emails, American individuals, and political organizations; that Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign to undermine public faith in the democratic process; and that Moscow will apply lessons learned from this campaign to future influence efforts worldwide, including against U.allies and their election processes.  Months of congressional hearings, testimony, and investigative work have reinforced these conclusions that Russia deliberately interfered in our recent election with cyber attacks and a disinformation campaign designed to weaken America and undermine faith in our democracy and our values. Vladimir Putin's brazen attack on our democracy is a flagrant demonstration of his disdain and disrespect for our This should not just outrage every American; it should, at long last, compel us to action.  In the last 8 months, what price has Russia paid for attacking American democracy? Hardly any at all: Modest sanctions against a few Russian individuals and entities, some Russian diplomats and spies sent home to Russia,[[Page S3468]]two spy compounds closed, at least for now--and all of this is reversible at the discretion of the  We must take our own side in this fight, not as Republicans, not as Democrats, but as It is time to respond to Russia's attack on American democracy with strength, with resolve, with common purpose and with action. So I am proud to support this amendment, which would begin to do just that.  This legislation incorporates some of the best ideas from different pieces of legislation already introduced in the Senate, ideas that have broad bipartisan support. The amendment would impose mandatory sanctions on transactions with the Russian defense or intelligence sectors, including the FSB and the GRU, the Russian military intelligence agency that was primarily responsible for Russia's attack on our election.  The amendment would impose mandatory visa bans and asset freezes on any individual who undermines the cyber security of public or private infrastructure and democratic institutions, and it would impose mandatory sanctions on those who assist or support such activities.  The amendment would codify existing sanctions on Russia by placing into law Executive orders signed by President Obama in response to both Russian interference in the 2016 election and its illegal actions in Ukraine, and it would take new steps to tighten those sanctions.  The amendment would target the Russian energy sector, which is controlled by Vladimir Putin's cronies, with sanctions on investments in Russian petroleum and natural gas development, as well as Russian energy pipelines.  We also need to put additional pressure on the ability of Putin and his cronies to move money they have looted from the Russian state. So this amendment would mandate that the Secretary of the Treasury establish a high-level task force within the Department's financial crimes and enforcement network that would focus on tracing, mapping, and prosecuting illicit financial flows linked to Russia, if such flows interact with the U.financial system. The task force would also work with liaison officers in key U.embassies, especially in Europe, to work with local authorities to uncover and prosecute the networks responsible for the illicit Russian financial flows.  Finally, recognizing that Russia seeks to undermine not just American democracy but Western democracy altogether, this amendment would provide support to the State Department, Global Engagement Center, and USAID to help build the resilience of democratic institutions in Europe against Russian aggression exerted through corruption, propaganda, and other forms of political interference.  Importantly, the legislation also mandates congressional oversight of any decision to provide any relief from these sanctions. Administrations cannot waive or lift these sanctions without certifying that Russia is making concrete steps toward changing its behavior on the international stage. In particular, Russia needs to begin adhering to the Minsk Protocol, roll back its occupation of Crimea and destabilizing efforts in Ukraine, and cease its cyber operations aimed at undermining democracy in the United States and  We need a strong Russia sanctions amendment, we need it now, and we need it on this piece of legislation. We need this amendment because we have no time to waste. The United States of America needs to send a strong message to Vladimir Putin and any other aggressor that we will not tolerate attacks on our democracy. There is no greater threat to our freedoms than attacks on our ability to choose our own leaders, free from foreign interference, and so we must act accordingly and we must act now.

2892,topic-id,897,"Madam President, I appreciate my colleague's sense of humor.                   Transparency in Business Ownership  Madam President, the United States of America has suffered an unprecedented intrusion into our American Presidential elections. In January, our intelligence agencies disclosed that agents of Russia, on the orders of President Vladimir Putin, engaged in a massive election influence campaign throughout 2016.  This effort strikes at the very heart of our representative democracy. All Americans should take this attack deadly seriously. Congress had to act against such interference decisively. By strengthening economic sanctions against the Russian gangster state, we hit them where it hurts, right in the oligarch. I am glad to see that Republican and Democratic Senators came together to do this.  Now the question will shift to the White Last July, as evidence of Russian election meddling began to emerge, then-candidate for Vice President Mike Pence said: ``If it is Russia and they are interfering in our elections, I can assure you both parties in the United States government will ensure there are serious consequences.''  Well, it is Russia, and they were interfering, but there has been little sign of consequences so far from the Trump White  Michael Flynn, as adviser to the President-elect, had illicit communications with the Russian Ambassador, about which he then lied. Trump appointees at the State Department alarmed career officials with their rush to craft a pro-Russia program. President Trump held an unprecedented, cozy meeting with Russian envoys--all smiles in the Oval Office--a meeting for which Putin says he has a transcript. In Europe, Trump, dropping the assurances about article 5 protections from his NATO speech, gave the Russians joy.  The Trump administration has been reportedly trying to return two compounds used by Russian intelligence to Russian control--compounds here in the United Former FBI Director James Comey told the Senate last week that President Trump never spoke to him, not even once, about defending against Russia's acts of aggression.  Well, the threat from Russia is severe. Chairman Graham and I held hearings in our Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism, exploring the Russian toolbox for interference in democracies across the globe--how Russia exploits the dark shadows of other countries' political and economic systems.  One tool is campaign money. Russia is reported to have funneled money to French far-right party Presidential candidate, Marine Le Pen, for instance, as part of a reward for her support of Russia's actions in Ken Wainstein, Homeland Security Advisor to George Bush, cited Russia as a threat of that kind of foreign financial infiltration here in the United ``It is critical that we effectively enforce the campaign finance laws that would prevent this type of financial influence by foreign actors,'' Wainstein told our subcommittee. But that task proves difficult in a system like ours that permits the free flow of dark money.  Since the Citizens United decision, we have seen unprecedented dark money flow into our elections from anonymous dark money organizations, groups that we allow to hide the identities of their big donors. We don't know who is behind that dark money or what they are demanding in return. Despite this risk, Congress has been unwilling to push back against the tide of dark money. Too many are too in tow to the big American dark money emperors, like the Koch brothers, but once you permit big money to flow through dark money channels, cash from Vladimir Putin is no more traceable than cash from Charles and David  ``The Kremlin's Trojan Horses'' is a study of Russian influence in Western Europe done by the Atlantic Russia takes advantage of nontransparency in campaign financing and financial transactions, the report says, to build political alliances with ideologically friendly political groups and individuals, as well as to establish pro-Russian organizations in civil society, creating a shadowy web of political networks which help to propagate the regime's point of view.  Corruption is the grid on which the electrons of Russian influence flow. In[[Page S3469]]the foreword to the ``Kremlin's Trojan Horses'' report, Radoslaw Sikorski, former Foreign Minister of Poland, who has seen a lot of this up close, described what he called ``the financial networks that allow authoritarian regimes to export corruption to the West.'' He warns:       Electoral rules should be amended, so that publically      funded political groups, primarily political parties, should      at the very least be required to report the sources of their      funding.  He continues:       The Kremlin's blatant attempts to influence and disrupt the      U.Presidential election should serve as an inspiration for      a democratic push back.  Well, we should certainly push back by requiring political entities in this country to report their sources of funding.  Another of our witnesses, Heather Conley at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote about ``The Kremlin Playbook.'' The CSIS report, ``The Kremlin Playbook,'' calls corruption ``the common thread'' among these various drivers of Russian influence. It is, the authors write, ``the lubricant on which this system operates.'' She testified just today in the Helsinki Commission that ``corruption is a systemic weakness within a country that is exploited and influenced by adversaries and from which no country is immune, including the United States.''  Where Russia can work in darkness, Russian agents systemically exploit democratic institutions to acquire influence over politicians and political systems using corruption.

2916,topic-id,2966,"Mr.President, I have some remarks to make with respect to healthcare that I will offer in a moment.  First, I want to address the events of this morning. The shooting that took place in Alexandria today was a horrendous, despicable act of violence. The victims--including Congressman Scalise, two Capitol police officers, and two others--are still undergoing treatment. There is much that is still not known about what happened.  There are a few things that are known. First, it is thanks to the extraordinary heroics of the Capitol Police and first responders on the scene that this shooting did not become a massacre. Each and every one of us who comes to work in these buildings every day is profoundly grateful for our Capitol Police, our first responders, and the incredible service and protection they provide.  Second, I think all of us know that this violence has visited too many of our communities. It has cost and ruined too many lives.  Finally, we know that the game our colleagues were practicing for--a charity game between rival parties that is held to benefit disadvantaged kids--is going to go on as planned. The game is[[Page S3477]]a show of friendship. It is a show of bipartisanship. It is an indication that, as there are strong differences of opinion on the policies that we debate on the floor of the Senate, we still come together at urgent times like this. The game, which shows our commitment to friendship and bipartisanship, has never been needed more than it will be tomorrow.  Our thoughts are now with those who are injured. It seems that everyone you run into at the Capitol has said they are praying and they are rooting for a full and speedy recovery. It is one of those moments when people understand that there is legislation here--their bills, their amendments. Sometimes there is a lot of process--an amendment to the amendment to the amendment, as my wife calls it. Then there are other times like this morning, which are life and death.  As we reflect on those who did so much to keep it from being even worse--a massacre--we have our prayers for those who are injured. Once again, it puts into perspective what is so very important.                         Healthcare Legislation  Mr.President, to the topic at hand, there have, obviously, been dramatic headlines in the news pertaining to ties of the President with I want to be sure that what is happening here in the Senate with respect to healthcare doesn't get drowned out.  The fact is that here in the Senate, behind closed doors, 13 Senators--all from the same party, all of them men--are updating the Republican healthcare plan. The House passed its TrumpCare bill by the slimmest of margins just a few weeks ago.  The public has seen it, and, based on everything I can tell, it has gone over about as well as a prolonged root canal surgery. I have heard about every imaginable concern about that House bill from I have had 46 townhall meetings thus far this year, including 4 over this past weekend.  When the bill came to the Senate, my colleagues on the other side got out in the press, tamped down expectations, and claimed that everything would be starting over. They are starting from scratch. Now the public knows, because it is what Members of the majority party have said, that the Senate version isn't going to be all that different from what barely made it from the House this spring.  When the bill is finalized, we know it is going to be rushed to the floor, and it will not be long before debate is cut off and final votes are cast. It is a plan that relies on speed, forcing a devastating blow to American healthcare through the Senate before our citizens can actually catch on to what is happening.  This political process on this bill makes what the House has been up to look positively transparent. The basic framework of the Republican healthcare plan isn't going to change. Millions and millions of Americans will lose their health coverage. It is not my view. It is the view of the independent Congressional Budget Costs are going to go up, especially for those who are elderly and sicker, and those who are the fortunate few are going to get an enormous tax break.  The basic framework isn't changing, and what that means is that the social safety net--led by Medicaid, which is a lifeline for kids and seniors and the disabled--is going to be under attack. The public health system in America has stood on two twin pillars since 1965. Those pillars are Medicare and The Republican majority has a plan to knock one of them out beginning this year.  Today, Medicaid comes with a guarantee that if you are sick, if you are injured or if you spend every day walking an economic tightrope, you are going to be able to get care when you need it. You will not be denied benefits. But TrumpCare ends that guarantee.  The plan Republicans have on offer would dismantle Medicaid as it is known today, putting hard dollar limits on the program. That puts caps on care. That is what it means--that there will be caps on care. It is a scheme that puts Medicaid in a vise, squeezing its funding year after year fix. The plan makes budget targets a bigger priority than real-world healthcare needs for some of the most vulnerable people in our country.  Seventy-four million Americans have health coverage through That includes 37 million children. It provides comprehensive care to millions of pregnant women. It is a leader in the fight against the opioid epidemic, and there is treatment for those who are dealing with mental health and substance abuse disorders.  Medicaid is a lifeline when it comes to helping kids and adults with disabilities. Then there is the nursing home benefit, something I know from my years as codirector of the Oregon Gray This is a benefit that is a bedrock protection, built into Medicaid to help pick up the tab for two out of three nursing home beds in If you roll that benefit back, I don't see how seniors across this country are going to avoid living in squalor. Maybe their kids can take them in, but the kids of the parents I am talking about have told me they are working on an economic tightrope, trying to balance food against the fuel cost, the fuel cost against the rent cost.  So my guess is, if you squeeze the Medicaid Program tighter and tighter and States are forced to cut benefits and access to care, as will be inevitable under TrumpCare, I just don't see where you can ensure that seniors in nursing homes are going to be protected.  My own view--and this goes back to the days when I worked with seniors--the challenges with older people have evolved over the years. Back then, you had Part That was hospitals. Part B was doctors. That is not Medicare any more. Today, more than 90 percent of the spending deals with chronic illness--cancer, diabetes, heart disease, strokes. It is a very different program, but we are still going to need nursing home care for so many of our older people who have done everything right in life. They are our mothers, our fathers, our grandparents, our friends. They fought our wars. They started families. They built careers. They raised kids. They scrimped. They saved. They never went on that special vacation. They never bought the boat they would have loved to have, and they did it because they always wanted to pay for essentials and see if maybe they could set aside what they could for schooling for their kids and retirement for themselves.  But, as I have said, what I have seen over the years since those Gray Panther days is that growing old in America just keeps getting more expensive for so many older people. The bills don't stop coming when you retire. And most older people still live on a limited, fixed income. I saw that with my full-time work at the legal aid office for older people and the Gray Panthers, and I saw those seniors having to stretch every last penny, and even then, it was a struggle to cover the basics. So what happens--and I am afraid we are going to see a lot more of it--is seniors eventually spend down their savings. When they face challenges, they spend down their funds.  Today, when it comes time to pay for long-term care like nursing homes and home-based care, Medicaid steps up. It is the backstop, a guaranteed backstop to protect our senior citizens. I don't want to undersell how much that means to people in my State and across the land. Medicaid is the barrier that keeps millions of seniors from falling into isolation and utter destitution.  There was a time in our country when seniors were cast aside. They were sent to poor farms, what were called almshouses. The wealthiest Nation on Earth said goodbye to those poor farms with the creation of Social Security, Medicare, and Under the Republican healthcare plan, unfortunately, Medicaid would be slashed so deeply, States are going to be forced into cutting benefits. Seniors could be nickel-and-dimed for basic everyday services. Nursing homes could be shuttered. Home-based care that allows seniors to live independently could be no more. I think you are going to have lots of seniors living in squalor, and some could be out on the street.  So in my view, the people of our country are owed answers to key questions about this Republican plan.  First, how are families supposed to support their loved ones if they lose the guarantee of Medicaid?  One year in a nursing home costs more than $90,000 on average. That is two or three times the cost of a year of college tuition. Are families going to be forced into choosing between educating their kids and supporting their[[Page S3478]]elderly parents? Is it going to be a fact of life for working Americans that they have to cram two or three or four generations of one family into the same house simply because they can't afford nursing home care?  Second, what is the backup plan for vulnerable, isolated seniors, particularly those who live in rural areas?  I recently held a series of eight healthcare roundtables in rural communities across Oregon just over the last few days, in Pendleton and The message I heard from healthcare providers again this past weekend throughout rural Oregon was that TrumpCare cuts could hit seniors in rural America especially hard.  Seniors in rural communities have higher rates of chronic illness, like heart disease and diabetes. The healthcare they need requires more attention and more services. They count on getting top-notch care in nursing homes and from home-based providers. Losing these benefits could mean being alone in a home that is unsafe, cut off from the care and the connections they need.  Colleagues, in the last few weeks of this debate, I heard Members flatly deny that gutting Medicaid by more than $800 billion will mean anybody loses access to healthcare services. That is just untrue. Anybody who says that they can slash our healthcare programs by close to $1 trillion without having a negative impact on access to healthcare services is just plain wrong.  Furthermore, I think it is time to recognize what the end goal of this debate appears to be. My Republican colleagues haven't put forward a proposal to protect seniors who can't get the Medicaid nursing home care they need or kids with disabilities who lose the services they depend on. What Republicans have on offer is not a plan that swaps one vision of healthcare for another.  These massive cuts to Medicaid and other health programs are going to pay for equally massive tax breaks for the fortunate few. Members of this body are going to have to decide whether it is worth gutting Medicaid and endangering essential care, like nursing home care and important home-based services, to pay for these big tax breaks for the fortunate. In my view, it should be an easy choice.  My colleagues on the other side ought to drop this partisan approach--what is called reconciliation--that it seems the Senate is headed toward. At a minimum, the majority party ought to bring this process out from behind closed doors and give it a little bit of sunlight. There ought to be hearings convened in the Finance Committee and the other committees of jurisdiction, as there were again and again in 2008 and 2009.  When you are talking about one-sixth of the American economy and what is the premier issue and always will be, which is people and their loved ones having their health, I don't see how you make an argument for not having a debate out in the open. There has to be a public debate. The legislation ought to be written in the light of day, and then our people ought to have ample time to review it before it goes up for a single vote, either in committee or here on the floor.  I am going to close with something that I think about especially today--the big challenges of our time. You have to deal with them in a bipartisan fashion in order to, one, get them right, and two, make them sustainable. The Presiding Officer of the Senate knows this. He and I spent many months working on key economic issues and recently put together a bipartisan bill on infrastructure. Healthcare is particularly important because when you are talking about providing care for over 300 million Americans, you have to really think through what the consequences are. Often, when you take a step over here, it ripples over there. That is why it seems to me that it is so important that the Republican majority set aside this partisan ``our way or the highway'' approach and get back to working together to find common ground.  I had a piece of legislation when we were debating healthcare in 2008 and 2009--eight Democratic Senators and eight Republican That was the first time in the history of this body that we had that. There are Republicans and Democrats who continue to serve in this body who are cosponsors of that legislation. It is called the Healthy Americans  We got some of what we thought was important into the Affordable Care Act--in particular, a provision that I think the American people really want to think about in the days ahead, and that is, in our bill with the 16 Senators, we had airtight, loophole-free protection for those with preexisting conditions. There wasn't any way to hit them with extra costs or discriminate against them because they had a preexisting condition. We said that we wouldn't stand for that because if you allow discrimination against those with preexisting conditions, you take America back to the days when healthcare was for the healthy and wealthy. If you are healthy, you don't have a preexisting condition, and if you are wealthy, you can pay for care. We can't go back there. But the House bill basically allows States to get waivers so they can start unraveling that and punch big holes into that guarantee of airtight protection for those with preexisting conditions.  If the majority will set aside this partisan-only, ``we are doing it our way'' kind of approach, what you heard from colleagues on my side is that there is very significant interest in working together to deal with the key challenges. One of them, obviously, is more competition in the insurance markets, particularly as it relates to individual insurance. You do that, and you will take the insurers off this roller coaster so they have some certainty and predictability. You can stabilize the private insurance market.  We ought to work together on bringing down prescription drug prices. Our people tell us every time we are home that these prescription drug price increases are hitting them like a wrecking ball. I have introduced approaches that I think can get bipartisan support, and there are others who have as well. But that is how to do it right. That is how you find common ground: You take time to take each other's good ideas.  Bipartisanship isn't about taking each other's lousy ideas. Bipartisanship is about taking each other's good ideas, and there are good ideas on both sides of the aisle to stabilize the private insurance market, to hold down prescription drug prices. But this idea of reconciliation, where we are all just going to do it our way--that is the Republican approach, the partisan approach, and featured in that approach are devastating cuts to That is a nonstarter.  So I come to the floor this afternoon, particularly given years of interest in trying to find bipartisan common ground on healthcare, to urge my colleagues to abandon this approach that is being pursued behind closed doors, that nobody knows anything about, and that really seems unprecedented in terms of dealing with one-sixth of the economy. I urge my colleagues to abandon the partisan approach of reconciliation and work with colleagues on this side on a bipartisan basis.  I will close simply by way of saying that I wanted to come to the floor today, and I will try to be back tomorrow to outline other challenges ahead in healthcare. I urge the American people across this country, in every corner of our Nation, to make their voices heard.  I yield the floor.  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

In doing so, the President authorized the removal of anybody deemed ``threatening.'' The President's action was based in fear and prejudice rather than any actual threat, and many Japanese Americans paid the price as innocent people were separated from their families and traumatized.  The United States would ultimately incarcerate more than 120,000 U.citizens and lawful permanent residents of Japanese ancestry. The Federal Government deemed Japanese Americans who lived on the west coast a ``threat,'' putting my State of Oregon on the frontlines of this injustice.

Units like the famed 442nd and men like my friend and former colleague Senator Dan Inouye displayed an exceptional degree of courage and valor abroad. Back home, Japanese American civil rights leaders like Minoru Yasui and Fred Korematsu were challenging the prejudices that led to Executive Order 9066, the internment, and other injustices faced by Japanese Americans and permanent residents.  As the son of Jewish parents who fled Nazi Germany, I feel especially compelled today to remind my colleagues and my countrymen of this dark chapter in our Nation's history. It is especially important to recall this history today because it seems some Americans have slipped back into an era of fear-mongering, bigotry, and hate.  I have seen countless expressions of kindness and decency in my years representing Oregon, which is why I have faith that people across our State and the country will continue to stand up and say ``no more.'' That is why I also want to honor the truly courageous Japanese Americans and others who fought the pain and fear caused by Executive Order 9066.
