    RECOGNIZING 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF SIXTH MOUNT ZION BAPTIST CHURCH

  (Mr. McEACHIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of a pillar of 
the Richmond community. This year, Richmonders and parishioners 
celebrate the 150th anniversary of Sixth Mount Zion Baptist Church.
  Sixth Mount Zion Baptist Church has been a central institution in our 
community since its founding in 1867 by Reverend John Jasper. The 
church was founded in an abandoned Confederate horse stable on Brown's 
Island and, since then, has been a pillar of our community.
  The long history of supporting the community has continued under the 
leadership of six distinguished leaders, including the current pastor, 
Reverend Tyrone Nelson.
  Reverend Nelson is a fellow alumnus of Virginia Union University's 
Samuel DeWitt Proctor School of Theology, a member of Henrico County 
Board of Supervisors, and a longtime friend.
  Sixth Mount Zion Baptist Church has addressed the social concerns of 
the city's residents and was one of the first Black churches to have an 
organized charity with a staff social worker available to help our 
community.
  Mr. Speaker, Sixth Mount Zion Baptist Church continues to assist 
community members with resources necessary to overcome life's 
obstacles.
  I pray that Sixth Mount Zion Baptist Church will thrive in our 
community for another 150 years.
