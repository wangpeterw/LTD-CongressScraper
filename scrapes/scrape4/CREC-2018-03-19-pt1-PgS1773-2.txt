                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Most high God, You are the great King of the Earth. Nations must 
submit to Your sovereignty, for You hold the hearts of national and 
global leaders in Your hands.
  May our lawmakers remember that You can show them a way out of any 
difficulty, empowering them to not give up. Remind them that the tests 
they face are similar to what other generations have experienced and 
that You will enable them to prevail as You have done in the past.
  Lord, thank You for Your faithfulness, mercy, and love.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
