     1940 and covered the Battle of Britain;
       Whereas, following the entry of the United States into

     American campaign in the European theater, including in North 
     Africa, Sicily, Italy, and France;
       Whereas war reporting by Pyle during World War II

     United States and shared in the toils, endeavors, and
