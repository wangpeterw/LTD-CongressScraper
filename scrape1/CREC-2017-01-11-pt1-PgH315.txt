  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize two southern Arizona 
young women for their achievements and for servingas role models in 
their communities. Macy Maine, a senior at Buena High School, and 
Hannah Mason, a senior at Pusch RidgeChristian Academy, were recently 
given the 2016 Brilliant, Beautiful and Bold Role Model Award from the 
Girls Rule Foundation.The award recognizes only a handful of young 
women across the State who are making a difference.
  Macy was given the award for her active engagement in the community. 
She represented her high school as an American LegionAuxiliary Arizona 
Girls State delegate, is an All-American cheerleader, and represented 
her city at the Power Up Teen LeadershipConference. She is a frequent 
volunteer and hopes to enter public service.
  Hannah has been a selfless leader for her family and community. After 
a car accident took the life of her father andseverely injured her 
older sister, Hannah stepped up to care for her family. She helped her 
sister through multiple surgerieswhile continuing to excel at school 
and remain active in the community. She hopes to enter medical school 
one day.
  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate both Macy and Hannah for being 
inspirational role models to their peers and wish them the bestof luck 
as they continue to pursue their dreams.
