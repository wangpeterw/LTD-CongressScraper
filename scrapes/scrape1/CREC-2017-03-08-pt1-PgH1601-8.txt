                        AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT

  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, the Republicans have introduced their 
healthcare plan. The President said it would be better and more cost 
effective than the Affordable Care Act and it would offer insurance to 
everybody.
  Well, if you believe that, you believe the President has got a secret 
plan to defeat ISIS which he was going to give us within 30 days, that 
there were thousands of Muslims in New Jersey cheering 9/11, and that 
President Obama was born in Kenya. It is not true.
  What the plan they have introduced is is something that will give the 
wealthy unbelievable tax breaks. The 400 wealthiest people in America 
will get tax breaks of $7 million apiece; and the Americans who earn 
$200,000 a year or less will get none of those breaks, but they will 
pay more for their insurance and get less for it.

  The fact is property taxes will go up as less and less people are 
covered by insurance and they go to emergency rooms for primary care; 
and as hospitals give more uncompensated care, they have to raise your 
insurance rates in public hospitals and raise your property taxes.
  The American Hospital Association has come out against this. The 
American Medical Association has come out against this. Next thing you 
know, the people living the lifestyles of the rich and famous at Mar-a-
Lago will come out against it.
