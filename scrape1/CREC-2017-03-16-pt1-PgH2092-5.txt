             PUT HEALTH CARE BACK IN THE HANDS OF AMERICANS

  (Mr. RICE of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, 4 percent of the people of 
South Carolina have individual policies under ObamaCare. I submit to 
you that if you have a health insurance policy that pays nothing, with 
a deductible so high that you can't use it, regardless of the fact that 
statistics may say you are covered, you are not covered.
  Sadly, that is what many of my constituents back home in South 
Carolina are dealing with under ObamaCare. I have statement after 
statement from folks in South Carolina that are being horribly damaged 
by this law. They are faced with rising premiums, high deductibles, and 
limited choice.
  In my State, premiums went up nearly 30 percent last year. At one 
time, South Carolina had five different providers. Now there is only 
one, and they are threatening to pull out.
  What happens then?
  By now it is clear that this law is not helping South Carolinians the 
way it was intended. But what I also want to make clear is Republicans 
have a plan to fix it. Our plan does a blanket repeal of harmful 
ObamaCare taxes, like the individual and employer mandates. It 
preserves patient protections so people won't be denied for preexisting 
conditions. It gives individuals and families

better control of their health care by allowing them to spend their 
healthcare dollars as they see fit.
  Simply put, our plan moves us from an unsustainable path to a 
sustainable one.
