                        MIDDLE CLASS JOBS CAUCUS

  (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, as debates over the meaning of last 
fall's elections continue, one fact is not in question: The American 
people want us to work together on commonsense, bipartisan solutions to 
grow our economy and create good-paying, middle class jobs. Neither 
party can meet this challenge alone.
  I am proud to say that Republican Congressman Mike Gallagher and I 
have joined together in founding the Middle Class Jobs Caucus to bring 
greater attention to these issues and to advance proposals to address 
them. The caucus will meet regularly to address a wide array of key 
issues facing working families, such as job training and infrastructure 
and transportation modernization.
  Every era of prosperity in our history has been built on a thriving 
middle class. In the plainest terms, middle class jobs mean a strong 
America. I encourage all of our colleagues to join us in helping 
families reach the middle class and stay there.
