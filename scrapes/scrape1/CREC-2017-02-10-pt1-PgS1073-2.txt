                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Almighty God, who inhabits eternity, thank You for also dwelling in 
contrite hearts.
  Today, meet the needs of our lawmakers from Your celestial bounty. 
Strengthen their hearts in Your ways against temptation and make them 
more than conquerors in Your love. In all that they say and do, may 
they seek Your glory, striving for faithfulness in even the small 
matters of their labors. With Your saving kindness, keep them from 
stumbling or slipping, preparing them to stand before Your glory 
without fault or blemish.
  We pray in Your strong Name. Amen.
