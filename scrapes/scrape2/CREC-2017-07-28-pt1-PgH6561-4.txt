              PASSING EXTENSION OF THE VETERANS CHOICE ACT

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the House was able to 
pass the extension of the Veterans Choice Act funding for an additional 
6 months to allow veterans to have choices, the ability to not wait in 
long lines, long lists, and have local proximity to treatment and care 
that they need.
  We need to do much more on this in the future, but with today's 
action, at least we can sustain that program for an additional amount 
of time and serve our veterans who served us so well.
  The Veterans Choice Act is a good outlet, a good opportunity for them 
to receive the care they need timely and in proximity to where they 
live.
  Mr. Speaker, let's make sure the Senate gets this through and our 
veterans are served well.
