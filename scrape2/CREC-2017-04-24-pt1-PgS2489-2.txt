                      TRIBUTE TO DALLAS HUMPHRIES

 Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, today I recognize Dallas Humphries, 
an intern in my Washington, DC, office, for all the hard work he has 
done for me, my staff, and the State of South Dakota.
  Dallas is a graduate of Douglas County High School in Castle Rock, 
CO. In August, he will graduate from the University of South Dakota 
where he studies political science and criminal justice. Dallas is a 
dedicated and diligent worker who has been devoted to getting the most 
out of his internship experience and who has been a true asset to the 
office.
  I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Dallas for all of the 
fine work he has done and wish him continued success in the years to 
come.
