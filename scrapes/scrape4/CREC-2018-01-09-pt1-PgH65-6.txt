be in Fargo

as the North Dakota Air National Guard's 119th Wing was awarded their 
19th.
  The 119th Wing, known as the Happy Hooligans, has received this 
prestigious recognition nearly constantly since 2006.
  The Air Force Outstanding Unit Award is given to numbered units of 
the Active Duty Air Force, Air National Guard, and U.S. Air Force 
Reserve that have distinguished themselves by exceptionally meritorious 
service or outstanding achievement.
  The mission of the 119th Wing is to provide trained and ready airmen, 
executing world class MQ-9 and reconnaissance kinetic and nonkinetic 
target intelligence production, and expeditionary support capabilities 
for the Nation and State.
  Mr. Speaker, Aristotle said: ``We are what we repeatedly do. 
Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.''
  Freedom-loving people around the world are grateful to the Happy 
Hooligans from Fargo for making excellence in defending liberty a 
habit.
  Congratulations, Colonel Brit Hatley and Hooligans, and thank you for 
your outstanding service to the cause of freedom around the world.
