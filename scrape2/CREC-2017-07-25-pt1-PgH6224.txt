      WE ARE DOING THE WORK OF THE PEOPLE AND KEEPING OUR PROMISES

  (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, all too often, the important work we are 
doing in the people's House does not get the attention it deserves.
  So far this year, we have rolled back 14 overly burdensome 
regulations from the Obama administration, saving taxpayers billions of 
dollars in the process.
  We passed landmark reforms that are now law to bring greater 
accountability and better care to the Veterans Administration.
  Here in the House, we kept our promise to rescue families from the 
collapsing ObamaCare law.
  We have taken action to rebuild our military, give our troops the 
biggest pay raise in 8 years, and expand the GI Bill to improve 
educational benefits.
  We have enhanced border security and public safety by passing Kate's 
Law.
  And we have passed measures to strengthen career and technical 
education, combat human trafficking, and reform the FDA to encourage 
medical innovation.
  Madam Speaker, these policies, and many more that are languishing in 
the Senate, will make a real difference in people's lives.
  And we will keep working hard on the issues that matter, even if it 
doesn't always make the headlines.
