                  CLIMATE ALARMISTS OFFER NO SOLUTIONS

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, climate change alarmists always 
predict cataclysmic events that will inevitably occur when the world's 
temperature rises by more than 2 degrees Celsius.
  But all the howling and gnashing of teeth signifies nothing. It is 
all posturing for their own purposes, including a desire to control 
people's lives or get another government grant or an academic 
promotion.
  The Paris climate agreement, supported by about 200 countries, would, 
at best, only prevent an increase in temperature by one-sixth of a 
degree Celsius.
  If the Paris Agreement has little impact on global temperatures, then 
no regulation proposed by the Obama administration nor any single bill 
introduced in Congress would have any significant impact on climate 
change--not one regulation, not one piece of legislation.
  So the next time you hear or read about some imminent calamity due to 
climate change, remember it is just all words and no action.
  The real solution isn't more ineffective and costly regulations. It 
is innovative technology that will make all forms of energy cleaner and 
less expensive.
