                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  O God, our help in ages past, our hope for years to come, throughout 
life's seasons moments of decision arrive. As our lawmakers prepare to 
make critical decisions, give them the wisdom to choose the more 
challenging right that brings the greatest glory to Your Name. Supply 
their needs according to Your riches in glory. Purify their thoughts as 
they strive to do Your will. Remind them that those who are faithful 
with little will be faithful with much. May they seek simply to be 
faithful in whatever You assign their hands to do, striving to please 
You with their work.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
