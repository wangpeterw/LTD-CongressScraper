                 TAKE ACTION TO ABATE THE GUN EPIDEMIC

  (Mr. HASTINGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, in a few moments I will manage today's 
rules; but right now, I would like to thank the staff of the Rules 
Committee on both sides for the hard work that they do, especially the 
staff director for the Democrats, Don Sisson.
  I would like to also take a moment to recognize Ms. Kira Sisson, a 
senior from Albion High School in western New York. Kira is here with 
us today, along with classmates from her school. Don is her uncle.
  Today we will not address Dreamers. Today we will not address the gun 
epidemic. I encourage all adult Americans to work with the students on 
March 24 that are coming here to Washington in a march for what they 
describe as our future. I hope adult Americans will encourage massive 
attendance at this march, and that this Congress will take action to 
abate the gun epidemic.
