            HONORING THE WORK OF THE STATE COLLEGE FOOD BANK

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
acknowledge the good work of the State College Area Food Bank in Centre 
County, Pennsylvania. In 1982, the food bank opened in the basement of 
the St. Andrew's Episcopal Church as a temporary solution to a 
temporary need. As the need continued, so did the food bank. Today, it 
has a permanent home in a large facility on South Atherton Street.
  The need is great, and the statistics are alarming. Nearly 15 percent 
of Centre County's population lived in food-insecure homes in 2015--the 
highest in the Commonwealth. It means that more than 22,000 individuals 
lack regular access to adequate food. Thankfully, the food bank is 
filling a void in the community. In 2016, it distributed more than 
400,000 pounds of food and fed nearly 1,700 individuals.
  I rise today as the chairman of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on 
Nutrition but also as a proud citizen of Centre County. The food bank 
hopes that one day no one will go hungry in Centre County. Thankfully, 
it is working every day to realize that goal.
