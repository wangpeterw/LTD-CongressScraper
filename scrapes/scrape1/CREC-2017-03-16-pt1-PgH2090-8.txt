                             CLIMATE CHANGE

  (Ms. STEFANIK asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, my district is the proud home to 
Adirondack Park, an environmental treasure. We understand in the north 
country that protecting our environment plays an important role in 
promoting economic growth and opportunity.
  Along with 16 of my colleagues, I am proud to introduce a resolution 
calling on the House of Representatives to commit to working on 
economically viable solutions that address the threat of climate 
change.
  Clean energy innovation is critical, and this resolution brings 
together the priority of addressing the risks of climate change with 
the importance of protecting and creating American jobs. This 
resolution calls on American ingenuity, innovation, and exceptionalism, 
also citing that it is a conservative principle to protect, conserve, 
and be good stewards of our environment.
  No matter what side of the aisle you are on, we all have a 
significant responsibility to protect our environment from avoidable 
damage. I ask my colleagues to join in this commitment and support this 
important resolution.
