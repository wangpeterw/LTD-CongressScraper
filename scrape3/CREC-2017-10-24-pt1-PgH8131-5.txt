                     NEED FOR MORE FEMA INSPECTORS

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, citing from The New York Times, 
``Outside Rachel Roberts' house, a skeleton sits on a chair next to a 
driveway, a skeleton child on its lap, an empty cup in its hand, and a 
sign at its feet reads, `Waiting on FEMA.' ''
  I want to acknowledge that FEMA workers from around the country have 
worked without ceasing, but we have got to do a better job. My 
constituents in Houston, Harris County, Texas, after Harvey, are 
waiting on those inspectors.
  That is the only way, Mr. Speaker, that they can begin the repair of 
their homes. Many people are there without coverage and truly need to 
have their homes repaired.
  I have given suggestions. I am sorry that we didn't stand up enough 
Federal FEMA inspectors. But what about college students, people who 
are unemployed, using a FEMA app, dividing the area in sectors, 
finishing one sector then going to another sector? This includes the 
State of Florida as well. People are on hold for hours at a time.
  I have spoken to those who are now looking at it. I want them to know 
that I appreciate them taking my call and reviewing this, but reach out 
for help. We have got to have more inspectors. If we do not have 
inspectors, they will not be able to repair their homes. If they cannot 
repair their homes, they are living in dangerous conditions. If they 
are living in dangerous conditions, the quality of life deteriorates.
  Help us in Texas. We need more FEMA inspectors. We need them now.
