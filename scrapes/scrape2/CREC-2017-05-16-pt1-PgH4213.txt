          HONORING AN AMERICAN HERO, JEREMY ``SCOTT'' McGUIRE

  (Mr. SCALISE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to honor an American hero. 
Jeremy ``Scott'' McGuire was a special agent assigned to the National 
Security Investigations Division at the Department of Homeland Security 
in New Orleans.
  Scott began his career in law enforcement while pursuing a bachelor's 
degree in criminal justice at the University of Southern Mississippi, 
where he received the Most Outstanding Undergraduate Pursuing a Career 
in Law Enforcement Award. After graduating with honors from USM, Scott 
was hired by the former U.S. Customs Service, where he was an import 
specialist.
  After the September 11 terrorist attacks, Scott was selected to be a 
special agent with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement team at the 
Department of Homeland Security. There, he received numerous awards and 
citations while he investigated successes that included preventing the 
export of radioactive material in Iraq and halting an attempt to 
smuggle military aircraft parts to Pakistan, just to name a few 
examples.
  On January 25 of 2016, Scott was killed in the line of duty while 
conducting investigations to dismantle transnational criminal and 
terrorist organizations that threaten the United States.
  Scott will forever be in our hearts and minds. I want to thank his 
family for being here with us in the balcony.
