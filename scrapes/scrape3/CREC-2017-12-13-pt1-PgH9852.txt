             COMMEMORATING FORMER PERRIS MAYOR DARYL BUSCH

  (Mr. TAKANO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Daryl 
Busch, the former mayor of Perris, California, who passed away earlier 
this month.
  As a U.S. Navy veteran, a small-business owner, and a pillar of the 
Perris community, Mayor Busch's commitment to public service was never 
in doubt. His professionalism, class, and compassion are just a few of 
the many reasons he was elected mayor of Perris for six consecutive 
terms.
  During his tenure, the city emerged from serious financial challenges 
to become a stable and growing community, and his leadership was 
critical to completing the Metrolink extension, which now connects 
Perris to neighboring communities. The foundation he built during his 
17 years of public service will benefit the city and its residents for 
years to come.
  My thoughts are with Kay, his wife of 57 years, their son, Barry, and 
the rest of the Busch family.
