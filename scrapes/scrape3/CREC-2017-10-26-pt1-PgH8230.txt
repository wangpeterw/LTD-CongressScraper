                OPPOSING THE BILLIONAIRES-FIRST TAX PLAN

  (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, today, House Republicans will move one step 
closer to giving a budget-busting $2 trillion tax cut to the 
superwealthy on the backs of hardworking Americans, one step closer to 
increasing taxes on vulnerable Americans, one step closer to gutting 
Medicaid by $1 trillion and slashing Medicare by $500 billion, one step 
closer to decimating programs that help veterans, seniors, students, 
and families.
  Many families in my home district in Ohio are struggling--struggling 
because they haven't had a pay increase in over a decade. That is why, 
instead of pushing Donald Trump's ``Billionaire's First Tax Cut Plan,'' 
we need to ensure that all Americans have a chance to achieve an 
American Dream by expanding the earned income tax credit, child care 
tax credit, and low housing income tax credit, not capping retirement 
contributions, and eliminating tax loopholes that allow U.S. companies 
to profit from shipping jobs overseas.
  Mr. Speaker, it is time that we provide a level playing field for all 
families to truly help them have a better life.
