That year, they made a $800 profit and immediately spent it on an airplane.  Buzzy Tomlinson had a plane for sale, and they bought it with the agreement that he would teach them to fly, and he did. He gave them about 5 hours of instructions and sent them on their way.  They landed on their own front yard, as proud as they could be to show their parents the new purchase.  Steve Guenard did give them official flight lessons, and both received their pilot's license.  After graduation from LSU, Bubber joined the Naval Aviation Officer Candidate He spent the next 4 years flying F-J3s, F-J4s, Chance Vought F8U-1s, and F8U-2s.  He had two Mediterranean tours, one North American tour, and he had a 3-month tour off the coast of  He made over 400 carrier landings, both day and night, during his time in service.  His father died in 1961, so he decided to resign his regular commission and return to manage the family Panola farm.  In 1966, his cousin, Brenda Brown, came home from college with her roommate, Jennie Lou Bubber and Jennie Lou were married a year later, and they have three children today: Grady, Jr.; Glen; and  He was always involved with the children's activities. He was president of Patrick's school board for 12 years, baseball coach, flight instructor, hunting guide, and more and more.  He not only taught both of his sons to fly, but his nephew, too; and he was very proud of them.  Bubber was an entrepreneur. He was the first farmer in the area to utilize second growth farming. He always came up with new projects.  In 1983, Bubber decided to start a new business, Panola Pepper Corporation, making his mother's recipe for her famous hot sauce. The idea was to employ his farm workers during the winter season. Creating jobs was his passion, and it was his specialty in the Lake Providence, Louisiana, area.  Bubber was on many councils and committees, and received numerous awards. He served on the Louisiana Rice Council for many years and was actively involved in the LSU Rice Research  He was the lifelong member of Patrick's Catholic Church, where he was on the church building committee, parish council, finance council, and an active member of the Knights of  He was also a lecture, usher, and Eucharistic minister.

Bubber had seven grandchildren: Wyly Brown, Lauren Brown, Emma Brown, Carter Coullard, Will Brown, Ben Coullard, and Andrew  He loved his grandchildren and was very proud of every one of them.  Bubber's legacy is that he taught his family how to be good He taught them all about goodness, kindness, patience, peace, hospitality, generosity, joy, faithfulness, self-control, and, most of all, love.  Bubber was the epitome of the Southern gentleman. He will be sorely missed.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-13-pt1-PgH1510.txt,2244,STATE VETERANS HOME ADULT DAY HEALTH CARE IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2017,2018.0,13.0,March

22,topic-id,1561,"Mr.President, the Senator from Washington knows the deep respect I have for her, and we have worked together on some important legislation on our committee when we have had differences of opinion, including on the 21st Century Cures legislation and No Child Left Yet I have to say, with all due respect, the last 7 months of working with the Senator and the Democrats on trying to fix the Affordable Care Act, as they have asked us to do, has been the most frustrating time in my 16 years in the  For example, she made three points.  One is that the Democrats were unhappy that we had reduced taxes and repealed the individual mandate. We know they are unhappy about that, and we know it raised individual rates somewhat, maybe as much as 10 percent. That was last year. So what are we supposed to do--not work to reduce rates? We continue to work to reduce rates.  According to the Oliver Wyman experts, the proposal Senator Collins and I have put on the floor, which is basically a combination of bipartisan proposals, would reduce rates by up to 40 percent, taking into account what we did in the tax bill. The CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, said it would reduce rates by up to 20 percent. That is the first point.  I understand the Democrats don't like to cut taxes, and they don't like to get rid of the individual mandate, which is a tax on a lot of poor people, but they have to get over that at some point. If you think it raised rates, let's cut rates. We have a proposal to cut rates on plumbers and songwriters who pay for their own insurance by 40 percent. So that is not a very good excuse for blocking this rate decrease.  The second thing is, the distinguished Senator from Washington said the Collins-Alexander proposal interferes with preexisting condition. It does not. Only someone who hasn't read the bill carefully could think about that for a moment. I mean, we deliberately made sure the proposal we would present would not disturb the essential health benefits, which most of us would like to do, and most of them would not. It does not change the preexisting condition requirement.  It does codify the proposals the President made on short-term insurance, at the suggestion of the Democrats, who were afraid the President might be able to do some things. What we were trying to do was limit what he could do, to say the States have the responsibility, and to make sure the consumers knew what they were buying. After all, the short-term plans, which the Democrats don't like, can only be done if States choose to do them. They were afraid the President might do them, so we made sure he could not. So that is not an issue.  The third thing is in terms of the Hyde amendment. Now, the Hyde amendment is a very simple amendment. Usually, when you oppose something, you just stand up and say: Look, this is the reason I am opposing it. You may disagree with me or you may not, but this is my reason.  This is the only reason the Democrats are blocking this 40-percent rate reduction. They have said so publicly and privately. That is it. That is the only reason. They don't like applying the Hyde amendment to health insurance in this bill. If they don't, fine. That is their prerogative. I respect that. I don't question their motive, and I don't question their right to do it. I would just like for them to stand up and say that is what they are doing. Then they can explain to the American people what sense that makes.  We have been working for 7 months to develop this proposal that includes two parts. One is fundamentally the Alexander-Murray proposal that Senator Schumer said every single Democrat would vote for, and the other part is 3 years of reinsurance at $10 billion a year. That is it. Those are bipartisan ideas. The only issue is, shall we also apply Hyde to it?  What we have planned to do for the last several months is to put it in this bill that we are voting on today, the omnibus bill, to which the Hyde language has applied since 1976. What that means is, the Hyde language is a compromise. It says you may not use Federal funds for elective abortion, but it makes clear that States, individuals, churches, and nonprofits may pay for elective abortions. That is the compromise. We counted them up. The Hyde language applies to more than 100 Federal programs that the Democrats will be voting on today.  The Democrats will be voting today on applying the Hyde language to the National Institutes of Health, but Senator Murray is saying they can't apply it to a 40-percent health insurance rate reduction. They will be voting to apply the Hyde language to community health centers, but she is saying, no, they can't apply it to a 40-percent health insurance rate reduction. They are going to be voting to apply it to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program--that is for all of us who get insurance, all the Federal employees--but that they can't apply it to a health insurance rate reduction. We are going to apply it to Federal family planning grants under title X, but for some reason, we can't apply the same law to a health insurance rate reduction. I can go down that list, as I did earlier, but I will not read the whole thing. There is the VA, global health programs, the Ryan White school-based health centers.  The Democrats have voted for Hyde protection hundreds of time. What the Democrats are arguing is, when they had 60 Senators here and President Obama and a Speaker of the House named Pelosi, they passed the Affordable Care Act, and they watered down Hyde for the purposes of the Affordable Care They want that language. No Republican has ever voted for that language in the The Democrats have voted hundreds of time for  How can we continue, how can we expect to make any progress in fixing the Affordable Care Act if the Democrats will not apply the Hyde language to any funding under it? I don't see any prospect for it.  I don't like the insinuation that I have walked away from anything. Most of the Republicans are usually willing to work with the Democrats, and I have spent hundreds of hours. I walked over to the Senator on the night we failed on repeal and replace and said: Let's do something. We had long discussions. We had hearings to which half the Senate came. Everybody was just cheering. It was like going to summer camp. Why don't we do more of this? So we did it, and we came up with something the Democratic leader said everybody could vote for over there. Then they got mad about the tax cut. They can be mad but not forever, maybe.  So we came up with a cure for that. We got a 40-percent rate reduction despite what we did in the tax bill. All we want to do is to apply to this health program the same health program that every Democrat who votes for this bill[[Page S1921]]will be applying to every other health program today. If they will not do that, how can they stand up and say they expect to make progress on fixing the Affordable Care Act? I don't know any way to do it.  I am as willing as anybody to try to work things out here, but I am no magician. I greatly respect the Senator from Washington and enjoy working with her, but on this issue, I think we have reached an impasse. They have yet to give us any language at all that applies to the Hyde language. All of their suggestions are saying: We want to do what we did when we had 60 Senators, a President of the United States, and Nancy Pelosi as Well, they may want to, but that is the one time that ever happened, and here we are today--with no one objecting on the Democratic side.  I mean, should I offer an amendment to take the Hyde language out of applying to the National Institutes of Health? Why don't they offer to take it out of family planning grants under title X? That should be just as offensive as applying the Hyde language to health insurance.  I don't understand this. They have been scrambling around all day. The staff has been putting out memos. They are making up things. They are misleading, and they are misreading. They are making excuses. There is only one reason. They are blocking a 40-percent health insurance rate decrease for the plumber who is making $60,000 and paying $20,000 for his insurance. We could cut that $20,000 insurance to $12,000 over the next 3 years. That person is hurting, and the Democrats are blocking that. They will say: We will apply Hyde to everything else but not to the rate decrease for that plumber. I don't understand it, and I don't see any way to make any progress on it as long as they take that position.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Kennedy).

In 1968, I had the job of recruiting State chairman for Citizens for Nixon-I was a very young, wet-behind-the-ears former legislative assistant to Senator Howard We were working in the Willard Hotel in the fall of 1968. The idea was to try to find outstanding citizens who weren't necessarily Republicans because in the southern part of our country, there weren't a lot of Republicans, especially in the State of  So I called around the State of Mississippi to find out who might be willing to head up this Nixon-Agnew campaign. Everybody I called said: Well, there are two young men here who are just the most outstanding young men, both are cheerleaders at Ole Miss, or had been, and both are going to grow up to be the Governor of Mississippi, which was, at that time, I guess, the nicest thing one could say about some aspiring young man because nobody thought the two U.Senators, Eastland and Stennis, would ever retire. So growing up to be the Governor of Mississippi was really a great compliment to a young man in Mississippi at the time. One of those young men was named Trent Lott, and one of those young men was named Thad  I telephoned Thad Cochran, and I invited him to become chairman of the Citizens for Nixon-He was a Democrat, but he agreed to do that. We met in October of that year in The mayor of Indianapolis then was Richard Lugar, a young mayor at that time and later a Member of this body. That was the beginning of Thad Cochran's Republican Party activity.  He and that other young man--who were so promising--both ran for U.Congress in 1972, and to the surprise of a great many people, they were elected, the first Republicans since Reconstruction, I suppose, from Mississippi--Thad Cochran and Trent  In 1978, Thad Cochran did something nobody had done from his State since the Reconstruction; he became a Republican who was elected to the U.Senate, and he has been here ever since.  The reason he was able to be successful is not surprising. Thad was and is an engaging, pleasant person. His parents were educators. He learned to play the piano. He was a terrific baseball player--good enough to play professional baseball. He joined the He was, in every respect, an outstanding young man, just as he has been a distinguished public servant throughout his life.[[Page S1893]]  He has been widely respected here by his colleagues, elected to be chairman of the Republican conference, and most recently he has been chairman of the Appropriations Committee, which is as important as any position in this body.  In an era where not everybody seems to think it is important to act like a gentleman, Thad Cochran is a gentleman, and we respect that and the example he has set.  So he has been a pioneer for the Republican Party, he has been a good example for young people, and for all of us, really, in terms of what we should expect and try to emulate in public life, and, to me, he has been a great friend.

639,topic-id,2235,"Mr.President, I am here today to talk about the plumber making $60,000 whose health insurance is $20,000 and he pays for all of it and about the fact that the bill we are about to vote on today could have had in it bipartisan legislation--supported by the President of the United States, the majority leader, and the Speaker of the House--that would have reduced that plumber's health insurance bill from $12,000 to $8,000, according to the Oliver Wyman health consulting experts, who have evaluated the bipartisan legislation that we have proposed.  The only reason it doesn't have that in there is because Democrats have objected to putting on this bill we are voting on today the traditional Hyde amendment that governs how dollars are spent when an abortion is involved. The traditional Hyde amendment is a compromise that has been on every appropriations bill--and this is an appropriations bill--since 1976 and that Democrats have voted for hundreds of times and Republicans have voted for hundreds of times. On this very bill that we are voting on today, more than 100 times the Hyde language applies to other programs.  So Democrats are scrambling and embarrassed, coming up with excuse after excuse, trying to explain to the self-employed businessperson--the farmer, the songwriter, the plumber--who might be making $60,000 or $70,000 and paying $20,000 for their insurance, and paying it all, with no government subsidy--why they are blocking a 40-percent reduction in their health insurance and why they will not apply the Hyde language to the health insurance rate reduction and they will apply it to 100 other programs. Not just in past voting but today, every single Democrat today who votes for the omnibus bill will be voting to apply the Hyde language restricting abortion to at least 100 other programs.  For example, how will they explain this to the plumber, the farmer, and the self-employed businesswoman: I will apply the Hyde language and restrict Federal funding for abortions to the National Institutes of Health but not to reduce your health insurance rates by 40 percent. I will apply the Hyde language to community health centers today, but I am going to block the bipartisan proposal to reduce your health insurance by 40 percent that is supported by the President, the majority leader, and the Speaker of the I will vote today to apply the Hyde language to the Federal Employment Health Benefits Program, which provides health insurance to 3 million or so employees, but I will not vote for a health insurance program to reduce your rates by 40 percent because I will not apply the Hyde language to it?  How are they going to explain today and next October, when the insurance rates are announced for 2019, 2020, and 2021, that they had an opportunity in March of this year to reduce rates in 2019, 2020, and 2021 by 40 percent and they refused to do it because they said: We will not apply the traditional Hyde language to health insurance, even though we are going to apply it to the Indian health programs, to the VA, to women's medical care, to global health programs, to the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program--to 100 programs that Democrats will be voting on today to apply the Hyde language to. They will do that, but they are going to block bipartisan legislation--supported by the President, the majority leader, and the Speaker--that will reduce the health insurance rates of the plumber making $60,000 from $20,000 to $12,000?  I want to speak about that plumber. I want to speak ahead to October 1, when the rates for 2019 are announced. I want to talk about Marty, the farmer in Tennessee who I met at the Chick-fil-A, who came up to me and said: I was paying $300 a month for my health insurance, and over the last 5 years it has gone up to $1,300, and I can't afford it.  I said: I have a Christmas present for you. Then, I thought I had a Valentine card for it. Then, I thought I had an Easter present for it, because we got bipartisan legislation, supported by the President, the majority leader, and the I said: We can put that in the omnibus bill, we can pass it by the end of March, and we can reduce your rates.  There are 9 million Americans who don't get insurance on the job. They don't get insurance from the government. They buy it themselves. They are hardworking They are the plumber, the farmer, the small businessperson. They are making $60,000, $70,000, $80,000, $90,000 a year. Their insurance bills are $15,000, $20,000, $25,000 a year. They are rapidly approaching a point, if they haven't already, that they have to go without insurance because they can't afford it, and we have a way to do something about that.  It is happening in my State of Rates went up another 57 percent last year for those people. That is thousands of dollars. Yet we could have today reduced their rates by thousands of dollars. Here is how:  We have developed two bipartisan bills, beginning in the fall. Our committee--the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee--held four hearings. We had roundtables to which we invited all the Senator Murray, the ranking Democrat, and I presided over this.  We talked about all of the issues and tried to see what we could do, and we came up with what we call the Alexander-Murray bill. It had two parts to it. The first part was regulatory reform. We took something already in the Affordable Care Act--the 1332 innovation waivers--and we made it possible for States to streamline it and use it.  We also added a few other things. We changed the law so that Minnesota and New York could use the basic health plan and could tap into the subsidies in the way that those States wanted to do[[Page S1906]]it. That is $130 million a year in Minnesota and $1 billion in New Democrats are blocking that today--$130 million in Minnesota and $1 billion in New York, and Democrats are saying no to that today. Why? Because they will not apply the Hyde language to the health insurance rate decrease, even though they are going to vote to apply it to 100 other pieces of legislation in this very bill.  We did the regulatory reform, and then we did something many Republicans didn't want to do and the President didn't want to do to start with. We extended the cost-sharing subsidy payments for 3 more years. These are payments to reduce rates for low-income people on their copays and deductibles. We agreed to do that.  Then, Senator Collins and Senator Nelson, a Republican and a Democrat, came up with a plan--the House did, too, with Representative Costello--to add reinsurance. Reinsurance is something about which, in our hearings and in our meetings, virtually every Senator in both parties said: We really need to do that, because the reason the individual market is in such trouble is that it has so many of the sickest Americans in it and they are soaking up all the money.  The reinsurance program that we suggested and have in Senator Collins and Senator Nelson's bill--3 years, $10 billion a year--would give States funds as well as planning money to set up those invisible risk pools, those reinsurance programs, that were meant for the sickest Americans to have their needs taken care of, and you lower the rates for everybody else.  So we have regulatory reform, 3 years of cost-sharing subsidies, 3 years of reinsurance, $10 billion a year. The Congressional Budget Office says: If you score it based on real spending, it actually saves the government money by reducing the premiums that taxpayers have to pay for--a $1 billion advantage for New York for each of the next 3 years, $130 million for Minnesota for each of the next 3 years. We fix the problem in New Hampshire, to allow both Democratic Senators and the Republican Governor to say: Please do this; we want to be able to mix our ObamaCare and Medicaid savings.  We said: Yes, you can do that, and so can every  Within the Affordable Care Act, we did what Democrats have been saying to do ever since we couldn't repeal and replace it last August and said: We will work with you to fix it.  The part that needs fixing is the part causing the plumber who makes $60,000 to pay $20,000 for his health insurance, and we have a way to fix it--to reduce it by 40 percent, according to Oliver Wyman consulting; by 20 percent, according to the Congressional Budget Yet the Democrats are blocking it today because they will not apply the traditional Hyde language that they voted for every single year since 1976 in the omnibus bill and that they will be voting on today for 100-plus times.  How do you explain that to the plumber? How do you explain that to the farmer? How do you explain that to the 9 million Americans who see their health insurance rates going through the roof?  Let's not make any mistake about who is doing this. We are big boys and girls in the When we take a stand, we ought to admit it. What the Democrats are doing is they are blocking a 40-percent rate decrease for one single reason--one single reason. The President of the United States supports it, the Speaker supports it, the majority leader supports it, and we are ready to put it in the bill, and they say no.  Let's look down the road to All of the insurance companies will announce their rates for 2019, and we will be looking ahead to 2020 and 2021. Rates will be going up instead of going down. The farmer, the self-employed person, the songwriter are going to be saying: How am I going to be able to afford this?  Nothing is more important to Americans than healthcare. Nothing is more frightening to Americans than the prospect of not being able to afford to buy healthcare. That is what we are doing here.  I am disappointed by this. I have spent hundreds of hours on this since We had a piece of legislation introduced on this floor by 12 Republicans and 12 Democrats that the Democratic leader said every single Democrat would vote for and the national Democratic chairman said was great bipartisan legislation. That is two-thirds of our bill.  What is the other third? The other third is the Collins-Nelson bill, which adds $10 billion a year for reinsurance. The Governors like this. The State insurance commissioners like this. The plumber and the songwriter like it. Who doesn't like it? A few Democrats who are saying that the Hyde language, which says--let's be specific about what it says--you can't use Federal funds for elective abortions, but you may use any other funds. That is exactly the law that we have in our bill.  The Hyde language is in the bill we are going to be voting on later today. It was put there in 1976. It is adopted year after year. It is on page 1036, if anybody wants to look it up. Then, there is language in the bill that we are going to be voting on today restricting Federal employee health benefits with Hyde-like language, which is on page 588. You will be voting for it today. Then, there is the title X family planning legislation. That is in the bill you are going to be voting for, as well, today. That is Hyde language. Then, there is the Mexico City legislation. You are going to vote for that today.  But you are going to tell the farmer, the songwriter, and the employer that they are not allowed to have a 40-percent health insurance decrease. They are going to have to not be able to afford health insurance for their family. As to Federal funding for the DC government, you are going to vote for that today. Using funds for elective abortions is restricted in the bill that we are voting on today.  Senator Collins from Maine is here, and the Senator from South Carolina is here. They have worked hard on this. We are a group of Senators who I think are fairly, usually seen as trying to get results around here. We are greatly disappointed by this--not just for this institution but for the people we serve because the hard, simple fact is that we have legislation that could be in this bill that will reduce your health insurance rates by 40 percent starting in 2019 and continuing for the next 2 years, until it gets up to 40.  We have the support of the We have the support of the We have the support of the majority leader. But the Democratic leader says: You can't have it in the bill. We are going to vote 100 times to apply the Hyde language to everything from the National Institutes of Health to community health centers, but we are not going to let you reduce healthcare rates.  That is why Democrats are scrambling, coming up with excuse after excuse. They are going to have to really come up with scrambling and excuse after excuse on October 1, when the rates are announced.

It takes an existing part of the Affordable Care Act and makes it work--that is the innovation waiver--gives States more flexibility to create more choices and lower cost choices without changing the essential health benefits, without changing the guarantee for preexisting conditions. It is really a modest change, but it is a significant change. Then it has 3 years of cost-sharing subsidies--remember, the President said he did not want to pay those, but he supports this--and then 3 years of reinsurance so we can help the sickest people who are in the individual market, take them out, pay their needs, and reduce rates for everybody else. These are the best Republican and Democratic ideas that have been put together in a package and, as Senator Collins has said, virtually everyone who has looked at this--starting with the Oliver Wyman Health consultants who say it reduces rates up to 40 percent, the Congressional Budget Office says 20. That is thousands of dollars.  If you are paying $20,000 for your insurance, if we do nothing, you might be paying $24,000. If we do this, you might be paying $16,000. That is a lot of money. If we do this, you might be paying $12,000. That is thousands of dollars less. That is a big tax cut for you, and it is a big tax increase. Why are we not doing this?  Let's not kid ourselves. There is a lot of scrambling and embarrassed running around over on the other side of the aisle to come up with an excuse for this, but let's be honest about it. The Democrats are blocking this for one reason. They have convinced themselves they do not want to apply to the health insurance rate reduction in the omnibus bill the same law that applies to more than 100 other programs in this omnibus bill. So every single Democrat over here who says: I can't vote for a 40-percent rate reduction for you, Mr.Plumber or ",CREC-2018-03-22-pt1-PgS1892-2.txt,1695,ALLOW STATES AND VICTIMS TO FIGHT ONLINE SEX TRAFFICKING ACT OF 2017,2018.0,22.0,March
645,topic-id,476,"Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent also to have printed in the Record a short summary of the three-part, bipartisan proposal that will produce the 40-percent rate decreases in the individual market, according to Oliver Wyman, and up to 20 percent, according to the Congressional Budget Office, over the next 3 years.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Lower Premiums, More State Flexibility, Avoid Chaos in 2019, 2020 and                                   2021       President Trump, Majority Leader McConnell, and Speaker      Ryan support this proposal.

Oliver Wyman projected premium decreases and coverage      increases:       2019, 2020, and 2021: 40% lower premiums in states that      receive a 1332 waiver than what people in the individual      market would pay if Congress doesn't act.       Will provide insurance coverage to an additional 3.2      million individuals.       An alternate analysis by the Congressional Budget Office,      based on real spending on Obamacare subsidies, indicates that      the proposal would save over $9 billion over 10 years.

646,topic-id,622,"Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Oliver Wyman analysis entitled ``A Proposal to Lower ACA Premiums by More than 40% and Cover 3.2 Million More''       There being no objection, the material was ordered to be      printed in the Record, as follows:                            [March 12, 2018]A Proposal To Lower ACA Premiums by More Than 40% and Cover 3.2 Million                                   More      (By Tammy Tomczyk, FSA, FCA, MAAA and Kurt Giesa, FSA, MAAA)       In our December 9, 2017 article, we analyzed the effects of      a proposal the US Senate was considering to fund cost-sharing      reduction (CSR) payments and appropriate $5 billion in 2019      and 2020 for states to establish reinsurance programs to      stabilize their individual insurance markets. We discussed      how pass-through savings could provide reinsurance coverage      equal to roughly $15 billion in protection for high-cost      claimants, and how this protection, combined with CSR      funding, would bring more people into the individual market      and lower premiums by over 20 percent.       More recent congressional attention is focusing on a      proposal that includes an extension of CSRs and a reinsurance      program in 2019, 2020, and 2021, funded with a $10 billion      appropriation in each year, with a federal fallback option      available to states in 2019. The federal fallback option      would likely be based on--and use the federal infrastructure      built to administer--the Transitional Reinsurance Program in      place from 2014 through 2016.       Our healthcare microsimulation model, used to understand      this package's likely effects on the market, assumed states      would use federal pass-through savings under Section 1332 of      the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to supplement and leverage the      $10 billion the considered legislation would authorize and      appropriate each year. Pass-through savings result from the      fact that the premium subsidies available under the ACA cover      the difference between the second lowest cost silver plan      available in a rating area and a fixed percentage of a      household's income, varying only by federal poverty level      (FPL). Lower premiums result directly in lower premium      subsidies, and under a Section 1332 waiver, these savings      from lower premiums may be used to provide additional      reinsurance.       In our modeling, we are presuming that states will take      advantage of these pass-through savings in 2019. In reality,      states that have not already begun working on a waiver will      be challenged to get a 1332 waiver[[Page S1913]]     filed and approved under the current regulatory regime in      time to impact 2019 premiums. The current regulatory regime      includes a requirement that a state enact enabling      legislation, develop an application, hold public hearings      during a 30-day public comment period, and submit the      application to the US Health and Human Services (HHS). HHS      then undertakes a two-step review process that can span up to      225 days--up to 45 days for a completeness determination      followed by up to 180 days for review. But even those states      unable to get a waiver in place for 2019 would still benefit      from that year's federal fallback program.       Therefore, we estimate, under the assumptions described      above, that an additional 3.2 million people will be covered      in the non-group market, and the proposal would result in      premiums that are at least 40 percent lower than they would      have been without the proposal in place, across all metal      levels. In those states that are not able to obtain a 1332      waiver and take advantage of pass-through savings for 2019,      we estimate that premium would decline by more than 20      percent across all metal levels. Those estimates include an      average 10 percent reduction due to the funding of CSRs, with      the remaining reduction coming from the reinsurance program.       As a note, our modeling reflects elimination of the mandate      penalty, but does not consider the proposed regulation's      likely effects on association health plans or on short-term,      limited duration coverage.

647,topic-id,363,"Mr.President, the Congressional Budget Office estimate looks at this proposal two different ways, but it says that if we base it on real spending--that is, as if Congress actually passed this bill--the Alexander-Murray-Collins-Nelson proposal that reduces insurance rates 40 percent saves the Federal taxpayer money. In other words, it doesn't cost anything.  As a U.Senator who came here to get results, who enjoys more than anything working across party lines to cause that to happen--because it takes 60 to get a result--who admires Senators like Senator Collins, who spends her time doing that, I am very disappointed, not just for me, not just for Senator Collins, who has spent hundreds of hours on this, not just for the Senate as an institution, but I think of people who come up to me like Marty at the Chick-fil-A, who said: I was paying $300 a month, and now I am paying $1,300 a month. I can't afford it; I am a farmer.  I said: I have a Christmas present for you. And then I thought, well, I have a Valentine's present for you, and then I thought maybe I could say I have an Easter present for you, and now I can say I can't do it because the Democratic Party voted to put the Hyde protection on more than 100 programs today--as it has done every year since 1976--but it refused to put the Hyde protection on a 40-percent rate decrease that was developed across party lines, in long hearings that were attended by more than half the Senators--all of them coming in and saying: Oh, this is a wonderful thing.  They came up to me and said: Chairman Alexander, this is so good. We wish the Senate would act like this more. We like the fact that you are having open hearings. Democrats are coming. You are letting us all come without being a member of the committee.  Why are we not doing more of this? This is why we don't do more of it. We come to a result. We come up to a partisan end that hurts people.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from                      Omnibus Appropriations Bill  ",CREC-2018-03-22-pt1-PgS1892-2.txt,1695,ALLOW STATES AND VICTIMS TO FIGHT ONLINE SEX TRAFFICKING ACT OF 2017,2018.0,22.0,March
1234,topic-id,767,"Mr.President, later this week Senators Blunt, Cassidy, Collins, Roberts, and Young will join me in introducing the School Safety and Mental Health Services Improvement  Three weeks ago, 14 high school students, a teacher, a coach, and an athletic director were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, As the authorities tried to get to the bottom of exactly what happened in the shooting, many of us in local, state, and federal government have been looking at what can be done to help keep students safe at school. We can't stand still and do nothing while our children are being killed.  I am the chairman of the Senate Health and Education Committee and sponsor, with Senator Murray, of the Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015, which reauthorized the law overseeing kindergarten, elementary, and secondary education. I also sponsored with Senator Murray the 21st Century Cures Act of 2016, which made the first major mental health reforms in a decade, focusing the federal government's efforts on early intervention.  The bill I am introducing this week with several of my colleagues will help States use every federal dollar available to them to keep their schools safer from violence and have the mental health services they need. This is complementary to a bill Senator Hatch introduced this week that addresses programs in the Judiciary Committee to improve school safety and stop school violence.  There are 100,000 public schools in the United States, and most of the responsibility for making them safer for children lies with the State and local governments and families and communities that provide 90 percent of school funding. But the Federal Government can and should help create an environment where communities, school boards, and States can create safer schools.  Under this bill, the Federal Government can help in the following four ways:  1, allow schools to use title II funding under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to hire more counselors.  About a fifth of all children age 9 to 17 have ``a diagnosable mental or addictive disorder that causes at least minimal impairment.'' In the 2014-to-2015 school year, there was a counselor-to-student ratio of 482 to 1, while the American School Counselor Association recommends a counselor-to-student ratio of 250 to 1. This bill would help schools make up that difference.  2, make it clear that schools can use federal funding they are already receiving through titles II and IV under the Every Student Succeeds Act to improve the professional development of school counselors and to improve the school safety infrastructure, including installing new alarm systems, improving entrances and exits of schools, installing security cameras, and other infrastructure upgrades.  3, our bill renews and updates a law to expand a successful program that helped to train education personnel and ensure children have the services they need after a violent incident. This program was piloted after the shooting in Newtown, CT, and has shown to be effective.  4, create an interagency task force led by the Secretary of Education, with the Departments of Health and Human Services, Justice, Homeland Security, Interior, and Defense, to make recommendations--not mandates; recommendations--on best practices, policies, and procedures to improve school safety and school safety infrastructure.  This bill would encourage and reinforce for Tennessee and for all other States that Federal dollars may be used to hire more counselors, psychologists, and other mental health professionals at schools; to build safety infrastructure--such as securing doors, automatic locks, and smart entrances--to prevent intruders; and to develop mental health programs to identify children who might be dangerous to other children.  While most of the responsibility for improving the safety of our schools and the environment or climate of our schools rests with local and State officials, the federal government has a role to play.  In conclusion, in addition to the policies in this bill that I described, I support President Trump's directive to the Department of Justice to craft regulations to ban so-called ``bump stocks,'' which have the effect of making a semiautomatic firearm function more like an automatic firearm.  I, along with 49 other Senators, have cosponsored bipartisan legislation to have more effective background checks. This legislation, sponsored by Senator Murphy and Senator Cornyn, would ensure that Federal agencies and States get information about individuals who should be prohibited from buying a gun through the National Instant Background Check  I hope my colleagues will cosponsor and support our legislation to help[[Page S1363]]States use every Federal resource available to them to keep their schools safer from violence and have the mental health services they need.

1595,topic-id,2735,"Mr.President, probably every single one of us in the Senate would agree that it is hard to get here, it is hard to stay here, and it is wonderful to be able to accomplish something worthwhile while you are here. That is why I am here today--because I want to call attention to an announcement that was made this morning by a bipartisan group of U.Senators and the Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, which could take away[[Page S1455]]the $11.6 billion of national park maintenance backlog in the 417 national parks that we have. The proposal we made this morning could eliminate that backlog over the next 10 years.  I want to give Secretary Zinke and the President a lot of credit for this because they have agreed to do something that no other President and no other Secretary of the Interior have ever agreed to do, as far as I know, and that is to allow us to use revenues from energy development on Federal lands as mandatory spending to pay for the maintenance backlog in our National Park  Ken Burns called our national parks ``America's Best Idea.'' I would say that the best idea to support America's best idea is the proposal that Secretary Zinke has made to take care of the maintenance backlog in our national parks.  Half of that maintenance backlog is our roads. Of course, when we pay for the roads this way, that means all the money that is now being taken away from all the other purposes at our national parks--I am talking about the National Mall, where I get up in the morning and walk every day, or the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, where I walk when I go home on the weekends--could be used for other purposes there, in all 417 of those parks.  If we don't do this, we will never catch up because this backlog--this $11.6 billion backlog--is four times the annual appropriations for the National Park Everyone who cares about our national parks--and that should be almost every American--should welcome this proposal.  As I said, our use of Federal dollars in this way is unprecedented, but the principle is not unprecedented. The principle is a very simple principle, and that is this: If we create an environmental burden, which energy exploration does, whether it is wind turbines or whether it is spreading solar panels all over hundreds and hundreds of acres or whether it is oil and gas exploration. If we create an environmental burden, we should create a corresponding environmental benefit. That principle is well established in our laws and has been supported by almost every major environmental and conservation group I know of.  Let's start with the 1962 Outdoor Recreation Resources Review Commission that Laurance Rockefeller chaired. That Commission, which took a look at America for the next generation to see what we should do to protect the outdoors so we could all enjoy it, recommended, and the Congress adopted, the idea of the Land and Water Conservation There was a Federal side and a State side. Over all of the years since 1964, $18 billion has been spent in the Land and Water Conservation That is the environmental benefit. Where did the money come from? It came from drilling on Federal offshore properties.  In 1986, I chaired President Reagan's Commission on Americans We reaffirmed our support for the idea that an environmental burden means we should have an environmental benefit. We urged Congress to make permanent the funding for the Land and Water Conservation So we reaffirmed that again for the next generation.  Then, in 2006, with the leadership of Senator Domenici, Senator Bingaman, and others--many of us worked on it--Congress decided we would take some of the revenues from new drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and apply those to the State side of the Land and Water Conservation Fund--again, an environmental burden and a corresponding environmental benefit.  That is why this proposal is so exciting to me. That is why this proposal has such strong bipartisan support.  In the Senate, the supporters include Senator King of Maine, Senator Daines of Montana, and Senator Heinrich of New It is a bipartisan group. Supporters also include Senator Capito and Senator Manchin, Senator Gardner and Senator Tillis; all of us support and are cosponsoring this legislation we are introducing today.  In the House of Representatives, we also have two cosponsors. Congressman Mike Simpson of Idaho, who is chairman of the House Energy and Water Development Subcommittee, and Congressman Kurt Schrader from Oregon is also a cosponsor in the House of  So I believe this is an unprecedented day; for all of those who care about and love our national parks and who have struggled to imagine how we can deal with this $11.6 billion maintenance backlog--a backlog that is four times the annual appropriation--we can pay this all off with this proposal, which is supported by the President and his Office of Management and Budget, a bipartisan group of Senators, and a bipartisan group in the  I look forward to working with Senator Murkowski and Senator Cantwell in the Energy and Natural Resources Hopefully, it can be moved promptly through that committee. There are other important things we would like to do, but I can't think of anything much more important than our National Park  I mentioned a little earlier that we have 417 national parks in the country. I grew up camping and hiking in one of those, and I live within 2 miles of that park. It is the Great Smoky Mountains National It has more visitors than any other national park--nearly twice as many as the closest one. Eleven million people a year come to the park.  Many of my best memories are from that park. I remember, when I was 15 years old, my dad dropped me and a couple of other boys at the highest point of the park, Clingmans Dome, one day around There was 3 feet of snow. He said: I will pick you up in Well, he did, and that was about 8 or 9 hours later.  Later that same year in the summertime we were camping on Spence That is at about 5,000 or 6,000 feet as well. We had taken blueberry pancake mix up there. We picked the blueberries. We had all of the materials for a good breakfast, but we made one mistake. We left the breakfast in our packs in the tent, and during the night a bear crawled in there with us, took it out, and we ended up on top of the trail shelter banging the pans together trying to run the bear off. That was the last time we left our breakfast materials nearby the sleeping area when we were camping in the park.  The park is a good place for lessons and learning and appreciating beauty. It is a good place for the rich. It is a good place for the poor. Parents bring their children out of a digital diet to feast on a world of natural splendor. We learn our history in a place where history comes alive; not just the history of the world but the history of East Tennessee, the history of Wyoming, the history of Maine, the history of  Let me give my colleagues a sense of just what this $11 billion backlog means. I have already said it is nearly four times what the National Park Service receives in annual appropriations. We can talk about the Smokies alone. Between Tennessee and North Carolina, there is about a $215 million backlog of projects; 75 percent of that is roads. We get nearly twice as many visitors as any other park. These visitors come to see our majestic views. They spend 400,000 nights camping in 9 frontcountry campgrounds and 100 backcountry camp sites.  In 2013, the park had to close Look Rock Campground and the picnic area due to funding shortfalls in replacing the water treatment facilities. In order to open this recreation area for visitors, the park needs $3 million to replace the water treatment facility, repair the road infrastructure, and replace aging picnic tables and campground pads. This proposal could do that.  The funding provided in the National Park Restoration Act, which is what we call our legislation, could help reopen this campground for the enjoyment of the over 11 million visitors to the  The Smokies also supports a vast trail system, with almost 850 miles of maintained trails for hikers, backpackers, and visitors. The current deferred maintenance backlog for trails in the Smokies is $18.5 million. This proposal would take care of that.  In August 2017, I visited the Smokies with Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, and I saw firsthand with him the work that is needed on the trails. We hiked the Rainbow Falls Trail, where a 2-year project is underway to rehabilitate the trail.  Crews from Trails Forever, a partnership between the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the Friends of[[Page S1456]]the Smokies, and the American Conservation Experience are working to build a rock staircase along the trail to reduce erosion and improve visitor safety and enjoyment.  Crews use rigging systems to move large rocks, split them using drills and chisels, and then set them into place to provide long-lasting trail structures for those hoping to see the rainbow formed by mist from the 80-foot waterfall along the Rainbow Falls  Secretary Zinke and I worked to split and place one of those rock steps. It is not very easy to do. Volunteer crews will work to rehabilitate over 6 miles of that trail.  In addition to the crews, every Wednesday volunteers head up the trail to help restore it for future visitors. In 2017, volunteers donated 900 hours of work on that trail.  The Smokies is full of wonderful volunteers like those working on the Rainbow Falls Over 2,800 volunteers donated over 115,000 hours last year alone, but we must do more to get the funding to our parks to help address the maintenance needs and support the countless volunteers.  In the Smokies, 75 percent of that maintenance work is roads, which isn't surprising, since millions of visitors to the park each year experience it behind the wheel. The park maintains and operates nearly 400 miles of roads, including 6 tunnels and 146 bridges, which allow visitors to traverse the park's mountainous landscape.  The Smokies is working hard to address these maintenance needs, and later this year they will open 16 miles of the Foothills We are all looking forward to that in East Driving the Foothills Parkway will give you a spectacular view of the highest mountains in the Eastern United Tennesseans are excited that these new 16 miles of the parkway will soon be open to the public. It is scheduled for this fall.  Due to funding shortfalls, building and repairing the 16-mile stretch of the Foothills Parkway took over 50 years and will be completed nearly 75 years after Congress first authorized the Foothills Completing just 1.6 miles of the parkway took nearly 30 years.  In 1944, Congress authorized the Foothills Parkway but prohibited Federal funds from being used to purchase and acquire the land, so the State of Tennessee purchased the land and gave it to the Federal Government to create a scenic parkway to provide views of the Great Smoky Mountains National  For 75 years, Tennesseans and visitors have been waiting to enjoy the majestic views of the Foothills Parkway because there hasn't been sufficient Federal funding to address the maintenance needs of our national parks. Other roadways in the Smokies, including Newfound Gap Road and Clingmans Dome Road, remain on this backlog list.  Clingmans Dome Road takes visitors to Clingmans Dome--the highest point in Tennessee and the third highest mountain east of the At 6,643 feet, Clingmans Dome offers panoramic views of the Smoky  Additional funding is desperately needed for the Smokies and all of our National Parks to help repair and rebuild campgrounds, trails, and roads. Doing that will bring more visitors, more tourists, and more jobs to Tennessee and to national park communities throughout our country.  According to the Outdoor Industry Association, the outdoor recreation economy generates 7.6 million direct jobs and $887 billion in consumer spending. In Tennessee, the outdoor recreation economy generates 188,000 direct jobs and over $21 billion in consumer spending.  In 2016, the visitors to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park alone spent nearly $950 million in communities surrounding the park. The over 11 million visitors to the park supported nearly 15,000 jobs and $1.3 billion in economic output in these communities.  Restoring our parks not only helps to preserve our land for generations but helps to grow our economy.  Now, here is what our bill does. I see the Senator from North Carolina is coming to preside, and he is one of the principal cosponsors of the bill. The National Park Restoration Act will use revenues from energy production on Federal lands to help pay for the $11 billion maintenance backlog at our national parks. It will provide mandatory funding on top of annual appropriations for the National Park Service--for the priority-deferred maintenance needs that support critical infrastructure and visitor services at our parks.  The National Park Restoration Fund created by the legislation will receive 50 percent of revenues from energy production on Federal lands over the 2018 projections that are not already allocated to other purposes.  This legislation includes revenues from all sources of energy production on Federal land: oil, gas, coal, renewables, and alternative energy.  The legislation protects all existing obligations for revenues from energy production on Federal land, including payments to States, payments to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and payments to the Reclamation  Finally, I want to acknowledge the work that Senators Portman and Warner have done. They have introduced similar legislation. They have many of the same objectives. I know there are many other Senators who care deeply about this issue, other than the bipartisan group of us who introduced the legislation today. We can all work together in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee where this bill will be referred. We will put our heads together with Senator Murkowski and Senator We will come out with the best possible bill--something that President Trump can continue to support and that the full Senate and then the House of Representatives can pass. Then, we can get on with it and begin to deal with the deferred maintenance backlog in our national parks.  Theodore Roosevelt once said that nothing short of defending this country in wartime ``compares in importance with the great central task of leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it is for us.'' We must all work together to restore our national treasures so future generations have the same opportunity to enjoy them, as we have.  In conclusion, let me reiterate something personal about this. In 1985, the Secretary of the Interior called and asked me, when I was Governor of Tennessee, to chair the President's Commission on Americans I did that, along with Gil Grosvenor, the chairman of the National Geographic Society, and a variety of people. One of our major recommendations was to pick up the recommendation of the Rockefeller Commission from 1964, which said, if there is an environmental burden, there should be an environmental benefit. They are the ones who recommended, to begin with, that we take land from energy exploration and use it to pay for the Land and Water Conservation  We reaffirmed that in 1986. We reaffirmed that principle in 2006 when we used revenues from drilling for the State side of the Land and Water Conservation  So while this proposal is unprecedented in the sense that it is the first time that I know of that a President and his Office of Management and Budget have approved mandatory funding using revenues from energy production on Federal lands to deal with national park maintenance needs, the principle of matching an environmental burden with an environmental benefit is well established.  I am grateful to the President, and I am especially grateful to Secretary Zinke for his initiative. I look forward to working with a bipartisan group of Senators in the Energy Committee to develop a bill, pass it, and get started on the work of America's best idea for restoring America's best idea--our National Park                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2018-03-07-pt1-PgS1454.txt,1695,NUCLEAR ENERGY INNOVATION CAPABILITIES ACT OF 2017,2018.0,7.0,March

813,topic-id,476,"Mr.Speaker, the year 1776 marked a turning point not only in American history, but in human history. While brave patriots here in America were affirming their right to equal representation and, ultimately, revolution, a Scottish philosopher named Adam Smith was revolutionizing the way we think about economics.  ``The Wealth of Nations'' was the book he wrote where he extolled the virtues of free markets and free trade, showing how all benefit from robust competition and an open marketplace.  Mr.Speaker, because of tax cuts and regulatory reform, returning to freer markets in this country, we have this economy off high center and growing at a rate we haven't seen in over a decade. While some of my friends across the aisle would like to dispute this, the results speak for themselves.  Just last month our economy added over 300,000 new jobs and over 800,000 people joined the labor force, the largest 1-month jump in over 30 years. Mr.Speaker, people are looking for work, and they are finding work.  With the stock market, business, consumer confidence, and the labor participation rate at all-time highs and the unemployment at a 50-year low, the last thing that we need and want to do is impose a new kind of government intervention to diminish the great economic progress we have made.  I am concerned, Mr.Speaker, that these tariffs that the White House and others have talked about, if not appropriately targeted, could do this and could have unintended, negative consequences on the American economy, on American consumers, and on hardworking American families.  The Texas delegation has a unique stake in this issue. For 16 consecutive years, Texas has been the top exporting State in the country with over $264 billion in exports for 2017. So trade policy has a significant impact on our constituents. That is why last week my colleagues and I sent a letter authored by Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady to the President urging him to take a more measured and surgical approach in imposing tariffs. And I am glad it looks like that the White House and the President have heard and have heeded our pleas.  I believe in free trade, Mr.I believe in open global markets. And it has improved standard of living for everyone. However, free trade only works if everybody plays by the same rules; that is, free trade and fair trade go hand in hand. For years, China has been gaming the system by dumping their product, infringing on our intellectual property rights, manipulating their currency, and circumventing trade agreements for years.  President Trump was right to call them out. He was right to hold them accountable. I am confident that we can work with the White House so that tariffs ensure fair competition and protect our national security interests while also making sure we don't harm consumers here at home.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-13-pt1-PgH1511.txt,2350,"ECONOMIC GROWTH, REGULATORY RELIEF, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT--MOTION",2018.0,13.0,March

Regulations like the ones that came out of Dodd-Frank were intended to protect the consumer, but ended up creating more burden, more complexity, more cost, and fewer choices.  By the way, it destroys relationship banking in rural America and districts I represent. The best way to protect consumers and weed out the bad-acting businesses is a healthy market with robust competition, transparency, and more choices for the consumer.  The last 8 years gave us an administrative state in place of the freest and greatest economy in the world. We inherited trillions of dollars in regulatory costs, millions of hours in paperwork, and an economy that has grinded to a near halt.  Let's continue to rein in the unnecessary regulations.

1418,topic-id,820,"Mr.President, I rise to join and thank Senator Whitehouse for his ongoing commitment to give a voice to the issue of climate change and the threat it poses to our country and, frankly, our world. Senator Whitehouse has provided real, moral leadership on this issue, and I wish to express my gratitude for his unrelenting focus.  Let there be no doubt that climate change is real. The question is not whether it is happening but how we will address it. Are we going to do all that we can to leave the next generation a safer and healthier world?  As my friend from Rhode Island has impressed upon us with due urgency week in and week out, climate change will be tremendously costly to our economy and to our very way of life. The longer we wait to act, the more costly these impacts will be.

I think of Aldo I think of John I think of Senator Gaylord Nelson, the founder of Earth  As a Senator for our great State, it is one of my top priorities to follow in this legacy and to preserve our natural resources and quality of life for future generations. It is not hard to see why Wisconsinites deeply value environmental protection. From looking out at the crystal clear waters of Lake Superior from its South Shore to standing atop Rib Mountain and gazing at the forests and farmlands of Central Wisconsin, to casting your fishing rod in the world-class trout streams of the Driftless region in the southwest of our State, there is no question that we are blessed. We are blessed with natural beauty in the State of  The impact of climate change can already be seen on these very landscapes and the economies they support. We see it in agriculture. Growing seasons are shifting, and extreme weather events are harming our crops. We have increasing concerns about drought and groundwater. In fact, NASA recently warned that droughts will not only become more severe, but our ecosystems will be increasingly slower to recover from those droughts. Decreased soil moisture will put stress on farmers and their livestock, on private wells, and on our municipal drinking water systems.  These prolonged droughts, combined with the increased intensity of storms and changing temperature patterns, will force farmers to change how and what they grow. It is extremely troubling as agriculture is an $88 billion industry in the State of  We also see the negative effects of climate change on our Great In Lake Michigan, for example, we see changes in precipitation and evaporation patterns due to climate change that may cause more dramatic fluctuations in lake levels than we have already seen. Data from the Environmental Protection Agency shows that average surface water temperatures have increased in all five Great Lakes since 1995. Warmer surface water temperatures disrupt the food chain and facilitate the spread of invasive species, threatening our native fish with disease. Changing water levels create challenges for property owners and communities along the Great Each of these changes will strain our local economies.  Tourism is also a major part of Wisconsin's economy. The Northwoods is a beloved place to fish, camp, hunt, and snowmobile. But last year, for only the second time in its 45-year history, Wisconsin's famous Birkebeiner cross-country ski race was canceled because of warm temperatures and a lack of snow.  The impacts on tourism, recreation, and the landscapes that we hold near to our hearts are already here. They will only become more drastic. The threats may be daunting, but we cannot allow the challenges to overwhelm us into inaction.  Wisconsin's motto is just one word--``forward.'' The people of Wisconsin have never been afraid of the challenges we face. We have a strong progressive tradition of confronting our challenges and working together to shape our future for the next generation. Many of Wisconsin's most successful companies are leaders in energy efficiency, renewable energy, and clean technology.  In 2014, one of Wisconsin's major healthcare systems became the first in the Nation to use entirely renewable energy. Wisconsin companies are strong innovators and provide opportunities for workers of today and tomorrow as they lead the way.  I believe in smart investments by governments at all levels, by companies and institutions, and by citizens. This will help us confront the challenge of climate change while positioning Wisconsin for economic and ecological resiliency. This opportunity is great, and we must meet the challenge head-on--going forward, the Wisconsin way.

895,topic-id,829,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise today in support of H.4725, the Community Bank Reporting Relief  Community banks were hit hard by the Great Recession and the ensuing regulations. Numerous bankers have told me they are spending more and more money and resources and time on compliance costs and less money and resources on actually providing services to customers. This is particularly alarming because these small banks are so critical to their communities. From sponsoring the local T-ball team, to lending money to a farmer for the next year's crop, to helping the single mom purchase a used car so she can get to work, these banks are involved at every level of our communities all across America, but because of overregulation, these banks are rapidly closing and consolidating.  Unfortunately, the headline for banks in the Commonwealth of Kentucky is no different. Since the enactment of the Dodd-Frank financial control law, we have seen a 20 percent drop in the number of banks in our State and there has been a dearth of charters for new banks. In fact, since 2010, there have been only a few de novo charters for banks nationwide.  Now, some people say that consolidation and mergers have been a long-term trend for the last 30 years and, therefore, not related to the recent uptick in regulations unrelated to Dodd-Frank, but they are clearly not seeing the bigger picture, because even after mergers, many branches in rural and other underserved communities are closing, leaving many Kentuckians to drive a town or two over just to get to the nearest bank.  It is not just about a long-term trend of consolidation. There have been literally no new charters, whereas before the Dodd-Frank law was enacted, there were many, many new charters every year; and since the Dodd-Frank law was enacted, no new charters. So the consolidation trend has gotten a lot worse since this avalanche of red tape coming out of Washington, D.C., and that is having a very negative impact on rural and underserved American communities.  While new technologies are helping bring banking services to anyone with an internet connection, many people still prefer the personal one-on-one banking style that they grew up with and the personal interaction often that helps the banks themselves understand the exact needs of their customers.                              {time}  1400  The Dodd-Frank law was almost 2,300 pages and required dozens of agencies to create new regulations or revise existing ones. As a result, these agencies issued hundreds of regulations and, according to the Mercatus Center, the law placed about 28,000 new restrictions on the banking industry, effectively doubling the number of regulatory restrictions in title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulation to more than 52,000.  Although not part of the Dodd-Frank rush of regulations, a growing number of banks have cited the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council's, or FFIEC, Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income--or call reports, as they are commonly called--as too burdensome.  Each quarter, all national banks, State member banks, insured State nonmember banks, and savings associations are required to file these call reports. The reports contain approximately 50 pages of financial data on each bank, including their assets, liabilities, capital accounts, expenses, and income. However, these reports are very burdensome for community banks with limited resources and offer little value to the regulators relative to the last quarter's report.  Thankfully, H.4725, the Community Bank Reporting Relief Act, is fighting back against the bureaucratic nightmare of complying with these 52,000 restrictions by allowing banks with less than $5 billion in consolidated assets to file their call reports every 6 months as opposed to every 3 months.  The impact of this regulatory change will be a huge development for banks across the country. Now they will spend less time on call reports and more time on actually helping customers. This means more capital will be flowing into our local economies, spurring job growth and economic development, while making a real difference in the lives of Americans trying to access affordable capital to buy a new home or car or start a business.

1110,topic-id,586,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.4768, the National Strategy for Combating the Financing of Transnational Criminal Organizations  I want to, at the outset, applaud and thank my colleague Mr.Kustoff from Tennessee for his leadership on this important legislation and for bringing this solution to the Congress and this solution to the American people.  As Members of Congress, our number one responsibility is the national security and the well-being of the American people. Unfortunately, transnational criminal organizations threaten the safety of Americans, and we must do[[Page H1396]]everything in our power to stop them. Transnational criminal organizations, or TCOs as they are called for short, are engaged in illegal business ventures around the world such as money laundering, cybercrime, and the trafficking of drugs, weapons, endangered species, and even human beings.  While TCOs may not be motivated by a particular radical, political, or religions ideology, they are motivated by money, and they will stop at nothing to get it. According to a 2011 report published by the Obama administration, entitled, ``Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime,'' TCOs have dramatically ramped up their size, scope, and influence, and are even teaming up with terrorist organizations and corrupt foreign officials to expand their networks and conceal their illicit financial assets.  These TCOs cost the Western Hemisphere about 3.5 percent of gross domestic product annually, and they generate for themselves around $870 billion, which is roughly the value of the world's largest company,  President Trump, on February 9, 2017, issued Executive Order 13773 on ``Enforcing Federal Law with Respect to Transnational Criminal Organizations and Preventing International Trafficking.''                              {time}  1415  It states that TCOs in the form of transnational drug cartels have a stronghold in America and threaten the safety of the American people. From former President Obama to current President Trump, TCOs are recognized as a major risk to national security. That is why I am very pleased to see that my good friend from Tennessee, Congressman  David Kustoff, has introduced H.4768, the National Strategy for Combating the Financing of Transnational Criminal Organizations  This legislation requires the President, the Treasury Secretary, financial regulators, and other appropriate officials to create a national strategy to combat TCOs and their illicit use of financial networks. Specifically, the legislation requires them to identify and assess the largest TCO threats to the United It also mandates that the strategy include the identification of the people or groups that facilitate access to financial networks for the TCOs through laundering assets, such as, real estate, art and antiquities, smuggling bulk cash, exploitation of shell companies, and the use of covert cryptocurrencies and other cyber technologies.  The legislation also requires the strategy to include long-term and short-term goals, an explanation of how goals will be integrated into existing national security apparatuses, and, if needed, suggest legislative and regulatory changes to better fight against  This legislation passed the House Committee on Financial Services with unanimous support in January, and it is my hope that it passes with unanimous support today on the House floor.  Mr.Speaker, in addition to Congressman Kustoff, I thank Chairman Hensarling and Ranking Member Waters for their hard work on this issue. Together we can, in a bipartisan way, empower our government to better fight transnational criminal organizations, making the American people safer and our economy stronger.

The Office of National Drug Control Policy was established      to set out our strategy in combatting our nation's drug      problem. Similarly, the Office of Community Oriented Policing      Services has served as the cornerstone for our nation's      crime-fighting efforts for more than two decades. With the      growing threat posed by transnational criminal organizations,      it is important that we adopt a comprehensive national      approach.       President Donald Trump took the first step by issuing      Executive Order #13773, the Enforcing Federal Law with      Respect to Transnational Criminal Organizations and      Preventing International Trafficking a year ago. The Threat      Mitigation Working Group was set up to bring Federal agencies      together a common goal of investigating, prosecuting and      dismantling transnational gangs.       This bill would codify part of this Executive Order by      developing a national strategy for combatting transnational      criminal organizations. We need to attack their ability to      profit from unlawful activity-whether it is money laundering,      bulk cash smuggling, shell companies or digital currencies.      Simply put, until we can stop the flow of criminal profits to      these organized, unlawful enterprises, they will continue to      survive no matter how many individuals we arrest and      prosecute.       On behalf of the more than 335,000 members of the Fraternal      Order of Police, we believe this bill will make our country      safe from these transnational criminal organizations.

1545,topic-id,1058,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, H.2226, the Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access Act, represents a very simple solution to a significant policy challenge facing our economy: how to expand access to mortgage credit without replicating the accumulation of excess risk in the mortgage-backed securities market like we witnessed in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis.  My legislation achieves both goals by extending the qualified mortgage legal safe harbor to small creditors, banks, and credit unions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or less, that originate and hold residential mortgage loans in portfolio, rather than selling or securitizing them, allowing those lenders to satisfy Dodd-Frank's ability-to-repay rule.  Such a policy would actually incentivize private sector risk retention--a goal of the Dodd-Frank Act itself--and mark a return to relationship lending in which a bank or credit union can tailor products to a consumer's needs and credit risk, without running afoul of one-size-fits-all government requirements. Under CFPB regulations, only government-defined qualified mortgages enjoy a presumption that a lender has satisfied the Dodd-Frank law's ability-to-repay requirements.  Small banks and credit unions have been disproportionately impacted by these rules, given their reliance upon residential mortgage lending and greater involvement in small dollar or balloon loans that run afoul of current QM regulations. It is no surprise that Harvard researchers have found that, since Dodd-Frank's passage, community banks have lost market share at a rate double that experienced between 2006 and 2010, a period including the entirety of the financial crisis. It is also not a surprise that many small community financial institutions have testified in front of the House Financial Services Committee and to many of my colleagues that they have simply left the mortgage business altogether because of the difficulties associated with the QM rule as currently constructed.  Indeed, a third of the National Association of Realtors survey respondents reported being unable to close mortgages due to a requirement of the qualified mortgage rule. Residential mortgages were the product or service most often identified by surveyed banks as a candidate for discontinuation as a result of Dodd-A recent study by the John Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University documents the falling share of bank participation in mortgage originations.  Everyone agrees, especially after the 2008 financial crisis, that a borrower should be required to show a demonstrable ability to repay. The only question is: Who is in the best position to make that determination--a community banker with a professional and, perhaps, even a personal relationship with the borrower who has full view of that borrower's character, creditworthiness, financial situation, and who is willing to assume 100 percent of the downside risk of default; or is it an unaccountable, unelected bureaucrat in Washington, D.C., who literally knows absolutely nothing about that borrower?  By bearing 100 percent of the risk, financial institutions have every incentive to make sure that a borrower can afford to repay a loan. Banks and credit unions would have more than just skin in the game. Under this legislation, their interests would align perfectly with that of a borrower.  As one witness in front of our committee testified: ``A financial institution that retains a loan's credit and interest-rate risk has a keen interest in engaging in thorough, sound underwriting to determine the borrower's ability to repay. Allowing a financial institution to make a customer-specific lending decision on a loan it intends to hold in its portfolio can be a more effective way of protecting consumers than regulatory attempts to micromanage mortgage terms with inflexible standards.''  No less than Barney Frank, former chairman of the committee, endorsed this concept in a hearing before this committee, saying he ``would like the main safeguard against bad loans to be risk retention, because that leaves the decision in the hands of whoever is making the loan,'' the CFPB also, itself, acknowledged this key point in its own rulemaking, where it recognized that portfolio lenders ``have strong incentives to carefully consider whether a consumer will be able to repay a portfolio loan at least in part because the small creditor retains the risk of default.''  This legislation also presents a viable alternative to the ``originate to distribute'' mortgage lending model that contributed to the subprime mortgage meltdown and bubble in residential real estate and taxpayer bailouts. The[[Page H1391]]result is expanded access to mortgage credit without additional risk to the financial system or to the taxpayer.  In fact, this is particularly important for young families and first-time home buyers, who tend to have difficulty meeting the ability-to-repay requirements due to circumstances, such as significant student loan debt, but who are otherwise creditworthy.  I have been working on this legislation for 5 years now, and I am happy to announce that, this year, we had a bipartisan breakthrough. That is because, at the committee markup, I offered an amendment that limited the scope of this bill to financial institutions with less than $10 billion in assets. And my distinguished colleague, Representative Capuano, offered a technical amendment that enhanced the legislation by clarifying a few key provisions. I am pleased to report that, because of those two amendments, the Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access Act passed with unanimous support in the committee and is now on the floor today for consideration.  I want to thank Chairman Hensarling, Ranking Member Waters, Representative Capuano, the Kentucky Bankers Association, the Kentucky Credit Union League, the American Bankers Association, the Independent Community Bankers of America, the Credit Union National Association, the National Association of Federal Credit Unions, the National Association of Home Builders, and the United States Chamber of Commerce for their hard work on this important legislation.

1553,topic-id,638,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  In closing, let me just reiterate that this legislation solves two problems. It solves the problem of responsible expansion of access to mortgage credit, access to that American Dream of home ownership; and, at the same time, preventing the mistakes that led to the 2008 financial crisis, the originate to distribute model where originators of mortgages had no skin in the game and they allowed those mortgages to be poorly underwritten or not underwritten at all, with no documentation, and then securitized and sold into the secondary market, really without any eye towards the consumer and the borrower's ability to repay.  Everybody in this institution, as evidenced by the bipartisan work here, we all recognize that a borrower should demonstrate an ability to repay that loan, but the crux of this legislation, at the core of this legislation is a recognition that a local community banker, a local credit union, a lender with a personal relationship with a borrower is in the best position to determine whether or not that borrower, that prospective homeowner, can repay that loan.  When there is risk retention, when that lender is charged with the responsibility of maintaining that loan in portfolio, the lender is much more incentivized to properly underwrite that loan and make sure that that customer, that borrower, that future homeowner, has a demonstrable ability to repay. I think it is a much better substitute to a one-size-fits-all credit box from, frankly, bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., who have no eye towards the creditworthiness of that particular borrower.  We have worked with our friends on the other side of the aisle to make this a bipartisan piece of legislation limiting the size of the institutions that can access this regulatory relief. But, clearly, when community financial institutions, bankers from around the country, every part of the country, are saying that they see the QM rule as not ``qualified mortgages,'' but as ``quitting mortgages;'' and when we see an[[Page H1393]]unnecessary constraint of mortgage credit; and when the National Association of Realtors are reporting that they are unable to close mortgages due to this onerous qualified mortgage rule, clearly the pendulum has swung too far.  So, yes, we needed some reforms in the aftermath of the financial crisis. This QM rule went too far. This is a recalibration of that. And this is important regulatory relief for our community financial institutions that will inure to the benefit of the American home-buying public, and it will do so in a responsible way, providing a viable alternative to the originate to distribute practices that really led to the financial crisis.  Madam Speaker, let me just make one final observation, and that is to give credit to the administration. The Department of the Treasury, in their findings and recommendations in their report on banks and credit unions, they recognized that this was a problem in the mortgage lending space and they made a recommendation also to increase the portfolio lending safe harbor to institutions with $10 billion in assets or lower; and that, as they argued, will accommodate loans made and retained by small depository institutions, provide that needed regulatory relief to our community financial institutions, and also expand access to mortgage credit in a responsible way.

They forced the majority to file cloture on it. We had the vote last week, then we had to wait to do it, spend the time, and in the end, 30 Democrats--the Democrats who demanded we hold a cloture vote, delay the vote--voted in favor of his confirmation. This had nothing to do with his qualifications for the office. They just wanted to delay and obstruct. That is what we are dealing with here.  Forcing a cloture vote on a noncontroversial executive nominee used to be extremely rare--hardly ever happened.

That doesn't even count people who were nominated to be judges. We are just talking about Presidential appointments in the executive branch. This delay is unproductive, and it is unprecedented.  Democrats are insisting on cloture votes because there is a Senate rule that allows for up to 30 hours of debate on Presidential nominees after we have had that vote. In reality, very little of this time is actually spent on debating the nominees or their credentials to serve in the office for which they have been nominated.  It is a pattern of ongoing obstruction the Democrats have been following since the very first day of the Trump administration. That is right. Since the very first day, Inauguration Day last year, Republicans wanted to vote on Mike Pompeo's nomination to be head of the Central Intelligence Agency, an important key position in any President's Cabinet, but we already had the debate in the Foreign Relations We could have had a debate on the floor that evening, but no. A small number of Democrats blocked it and forced us to have first a cloture vote and delay moving forward, delaying the process from day one--Inauguration Day--of the administration.  How much of the 30 hours did the Democrats actually spend debating this person's qualifications to be head of the CIA? Less than 2 hours. They wasted 30 hours of the whole time; only 2 hours was used in debate. That is how long the Democrats spent on this floor giving their reasons why they wanted to vote against the nominee. It had nothing to do with Mr.Pompeo; it was just so Democrats could waste 3 more days, allowing nothing else to happen, blocking other activities in the The rules allow the Democrats to stall, and they took full advantage of the rules.  It is time, in my opinion, to end this partisan spectacle. We have 78 more nominees for various jobs who have made it through their committee hearings and are waiting for a vote on this floor. Most of these people have bipartisan support. They can be and will be confirmed easily. The administration has to waste time to get their team in place. Democrats aren't using the rules for debate. They are not using the rules for deliberation. It is only for delay.  It wasn't and hasn't always been this way, and there is no reason it should continue this way. The Senate had a different standard for executive branch nominations a few years ago. In 2013 and 2014, the rules said that we would have a full 30 hours of debate only for Cabinet Secretaries; for all other executive branch Presidential appointees, only 8 hours of debate. But today we allow 30 hours on every nomination, and Democrats have shown that, in most cases, it is far too much time.  We need a fair debate on every nomination. The procedure from 2013 and 2014 was fair. The way Democrats are wasting time today to keep us from doing work is not fair. It is time to return to the rules for debating nominations that the Senate used 4 years ago.  The rules that we used in 2013 and 2014 were the result of a compromise. Democrats controlled the Senate at the time, and a Democrat was making the nominations; that was President Republicans agreed to a fair time limit on the amount of debate. There was a bipartisan group who worked on this compromise--four Republicans, four Democrats--and I was one of the four Republicans who were part of that group. Senator Schumer, who is now the Democratic leader, was part of that group as well. There was overwhelming support for these changes on both sides of the aisle. It is time to change the Senate rules and go back to that process that Senator Schumer supported in 2013 and in 2014 when Democrats were in the majority.  Today, Democrats deliberately delay in ways that limit us to a couple of nominations in a typical week. If we go back to the 2014 standard, we could clear multiple nominations in a single day.  We should have this process back in place by the time we take up Mike Pompeo's nomination to be Secretary of State when we get back in  The world is a dangerous place. We have serious concerns about Russia, Iran, China, and important trade issues that we need to be working on. The President will be meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong America needs to have a full slate of people helping the President on these issues, and we need them to be the correct, very talented people that a President needs.  We are fortunate to have Mike Pompeo as the likely nominee to be Secretary of He is the right person for the job. He knows the issues. He knows the people. He has the intelligence. He has the integrity. He has the experience for the job.  We will be having confirmation hearings in the Foreign Relations Committee in Let's have a hearing, a fair debate, and then let's vote. Let's not have any of these continued stalling tactics and this pointless obstruction that Democrats have engaged in ever since the first day President Trump took office.  Mike Pompeo's nomination to be Secretary of State will still get 30 hours of debate, and after that, we will need to confirm a new CIA Last year, we allowed 30 hours of debate on that nomination, and Democrats used only 2 of the 30. Under the compromise rules that I think we should return to, we would allow up to 8 hours of debate. It is clearly enough--more than most people would think would be needed.  We have more than 100 other qualified people who have been voted on and approved by the appropriate Senate committee, and they are waiting to do important jobs. With all of the threats that our country is facing around the world, it is time for Democrats in the Senate to stop wasting time and stop abusing the rules. It is time for Democrats to join Republicans and the President to do all we can to keep America prosperous, safe, and secure.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.

1594,topic-id,1217,"Mr.President, over the next couple of weeks, Congress is going to need to finalize government appropriations for the remainder of this year. Among the things that some people are talking about is including money for a couple of ObamaCare programs. One of them is money for the so-called cost-sharing reduction payments. Funding for these payments was never appropriated by The Obama administration paid the insurance companies anyway. President Trump stopped these illegal payments last Now, some people in Congress are talking about funding them again.  We all know that ObamaCare has been a disaster for millions and millions of families all across the country. We know that for the people who live in States that use the Federal healthcare.gov exchange, average premiums have doubled since the law took effect. Certainly Wyoming is one of those States that experienced it; I heard about it in Clark County just last week. We know it. We hear about it in letters from the people who write to us. No matter where they are from in the State of Wyoming, we continue to hear about the costs going up. I am sure there is a similar situation in the State of Arkansas, the Presiding Officer's State, as well.  According to Gallup, the number of uninsured people actually increased last year by 3 million. Many people are finding that they just can't afford to have ObamaCare insurance. It is especially hard for hard-working families who don't qualify for subsidies under the healthcare law. So we know there is a problem, and we know we have to do something to help people who are struggling in ObamaCare markets.  If people are going to discuss using this government spending law to spend more money on the collapsing ObamaCare markets, there are other things we should be discussing as well. We should discuss finding a real solution to rising healthcare costs--one that doesn't just continue the unworkable, unaffordable, and, frankly, unfair system that ObamaCare created. We should discuss actually giving people more freedom and more flexibility to choose a healthcare plan that is right for them.  I am introducing a bill today to do just that. My legislation will build on a step that President Trump and the Trump administration took last month. The administration reversed a last-minute Obama-era policy that had all but killed short-term health plans. These are less expensive health plans that are free from the expensive and intrusive and burdensome regulations that ObamaCare placed on other insurers, so they are a much more affordable option for many Americans who have been priced out of  President Trump is on the right path with this new rule. It is absolutely the right decision. He is giving people back an option so they can decide for themselves if it is a right choice for them. I think we should go a step further, and that is why I am introducing this legislation. We should go a step further in the omnibus spending bill. We should make this more affordable choice permanent. Making it permanent protects people. It protects people so a future administration doesn't do what President Obama did and try to wipe out choices for  This legislation I am introducing today gives people a choice to have these plans for not just 90 days--which was allowed at the end of the Obama administration--but for a full 364 days. So it is up to a year.  It also makes sure people can then renew these plans, if they want to, so it can become their permanent insurance, free from the mandates of the Obama healthcare law. It protects them from being dropped if they are sick. Remember, that was one of the biggest promises of ObamaCare that was broken. President Obama said: If you like your plan, you can keep your plan. Almost immediately, people found out it wasn't true at all. In fact, it was called by some of the press the ``Lie of the Year.''  In 2013 alone, there were 4.7 million Americans who got letters from their insurance companies telling them that their insurance plan had been canceled. Under my proposal, people with these short-term plans wouldn't have to worry about getting a cancellation letter. They would be protected from their insurance company, and they would be protected from Washington,  States are much better suited than Washington to regulate their insurance markets in ways that work best for the citizens of their These simple changes in my legislation will help give people back--help give to them--the freedom ObamaCare took away. That is what we are looking at, the need for freedom for the American people. We can essentially give people an escape hatch to get out of the ObamaCare plan entirely. We can give them the freedom to choose the coverage that works for them and works best for their families.  That is the right way to bring down healthcare costs for Americans: Give them options, give them choices, give them freedom, not make them buy a one-size-fits-all government plan.  People living in more than half of America's counties have only one choice of insurance in the ObamaCare exchange--only one--half of the counties in the country. It is not a choice. They don't have options. It is a monopoly.  The left-leaning Urban Institute estimates that 4.2 million Americans would enroll in short-term plans next year if we just let them keep their plan as long as a year. That is the kind of pent-up demand that is out there for these more affordable, more flexible plans with much more freedom.  Just the one change could make a difference in the lives of 4 million My legislation does just that, and it has other benefits as well.  I think it would be an attractive option for many more Americans, but a lot of Democrats in Washington don't want to talk about options. They know ObamaCare markets are collapsing; they don't seem to care. They know costs are soaring out of control; it doesn't seem to concern as many as it should. They know middle-class families are being squeezed the hardest by these rising ObamaCare premiums. Their answer? We have heard it. We have heard it on the floor of the Senate: Try to push everyone--everyone in America, want it or not, everyone in America--into a single, government-run insurance plan that looks a lot like That is exactly the opposite of what we should be doing and what I am proposing today.  What the Democrats are proposing is more of the same failed idea that caused Americans so many problems under ObamaCare: government control.  If there is going to be talk of propping up the ObamaCare markets during the omnibus spending bill, then we should also be talking about helping people get out of the ObamaCare markets. Give them the freedom, give them the escape hatch.  We should protect people who want health insurance but who don't want ObamaCare health insurance. They know what works best for them and their families, and we should trust the American people to know what is best for them and their families. We should give people the freedom and the flexibility to make those decisions for themselves, and we should give them more opportunities to escape from the disastrous, destructive, and extremely expensive ObamaCare markets.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2018-03-07-pt1-PgS1454.txt,1881,BLOCKING REGULATORY INTERFERENCE FROM CLOSING KILNS ACT OF 2017,2018.0,7.0,March

But, Mr.Speaker, when the house is burning down and you need the fire department, you don't ask if they followed proper procedure to get somebody out there to put out the fire.

Well, he was going to die anyway, Mr.So he signed the informed consent and he took the drug and it didn't work, but he had that last shot. Now, I don't know what this debate about false hope is. When you have no hope, perhaps false hope is better than none at all.  All this bill does is let people who have no other hope for conventional therapy, if a drug has at least passed stage one at the FDA approval process, and their doctor thinks it will help them, if they give an informed consent, they can try it.  Now, my friends on the Democratic side are correct that, most of the time under the existing protocol, the FDA approves it without a problem. But why should the FDA approve it if you are about to die anyway? That is what this bill does. By the way, it passed the Senate with unanimous consent. Now, that is a miracle in itself.

1097,topic-id,831,"Mr.Speaker, what a great opportunity to really stand up here and smile and talk to the American public with the words of constituents from Michigan's First District, because these are not my words. These are their words over the last 2\1/2\ months or so since we passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs  You know, in November 2016, the great people of Michigan's First District sent me to Washington with a direct, yet simple, mandate: Get Washington, D.C., out of our pockets and off our backs. For a marine, that is a pretty simple mission-oriented instruction.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was the first major step to accomplishing that goal. Since we passed tax reform, I have travelled throughout many of the First District's 32 counties talking with constituents, business owners, and hearing their individual stories. Farmers, businesses, both large and small, and families are already seeing the benefits that tax reform brings, and we are just getting started.  Many of these small companies said: Well, I don't know yet, but I have got to meet with my accountant around the middle of April, and then we will really see.  But now they are starting to see wage increases and bonuses, and business expansions are all beginning to roll in and take effect, and it is long overdue in our neck of the woods. And when I say, ``our neck of the woods,'' that is not a figurative statement. That is a literal statement.  You know, many families in our district live paycheck to paycheck, and even a small crisis could send them into a tailspin. An extra $100 or $150 in a paycheck in my district is not crumbs. It is not It is a big plus. It gives that family flexibility to live their life and to raise their kids and be a proud community--wage-earning members of that community.

And by the way, we only have, roughly, a little over 2 weeks of winter left, but we use our snow tires up there through about mid-That is just the way it works.  That money might go for the kids to play on a sports team. Hockey is not a cheap sport to put your son or daughter in. Or it could be, possibly, just saving up in that family rainy day fund for an emergency.  We hear of businesses from Boyne City to Marquette expanding, growing their staff, raising wages, all a result of a fairer and simpler Tax  You know, when I talk to some folks, they say: You know what, I don't mind working. I am proud to work. The dignity of work is what makes me strong as an individual, what makes me strong as a mother or a father.[[Page H1431]]  They just think, in some ways, it is just not fair if you don't earn your wage. So there is a certain sense of pride that goes along with that.                              {time}  1800  We all know that if you are looking for thanks, running for office probably isn't the field of work you should get into. Yet everywhere I go in the district these last couple of months, constituents have been coming up to me saying: Thank you.  They don't know who I am. We get to talking, and they say: You are the guy on Well, thank you for what you did. Thank you for passing tax reform.  Just a few weeks ago, I was at the Home Depot in Petoskey, and a gentleman who was working there pulled me aside and thanked me for getting tax reform done. That allowed him to keep more of his check plus a sizable bonus that was paid by Home  In the Upper Peninsula, U.Special Delivery gave all 200 employees $1,000 bonuses after tax reform passed because of the money that they will save as a company on their taxes this year.  A couple of weeks back, when I was in Traverse City, Traverse City State Bank announced that they are giving out new bonuses.  So many more businesses in the First District are raising wages, adding workers, giving bonuses, and expanding.  We know that this is just the beginning, and Americans can expect much more in the days ahead because of the energy that we have put into the growth of our American economy.

Adult day healthcare does more than just provide veterans with the medical care that they need; it also offers much-needed relief to their caregivers. Oftentimes, friends and family come together to help with the daily care that these veterans and their families require.  By giving veterans the opportunity to access medical care for up to 8 hours a day through a State veterans home, caregivers will have the opportunity to fulfill their personal responsibilities for themselves and their families.

They cannot identify the bad actors, but they might be taking advantage of them. That is a fallacious and specious argument to make when you are denying people who have a terminal illness, who have been diagnosed with a terminal illness, who have gone through the already approved FDA processes in order to get and petition a pharmaceutical company for an experimental drug that might prolong their life and might heal them.  False hope, that argument, is the argument that I am hearing. But the reality is these people are individuals. They have a higher sense of reality than virtually anybody else I know because their mortality is there. They want the opportunity. It is not false hope. It is hope. Support of this bill is compassionate. Support of this bill is fair.  I have also heard that there may be some liability issues on the part of pharmaceutical companies which might impede them from providing drugs.

What I am asking here today, and what everyone with whom I have met over the years who want a right to try is asking, is simply a chance to have some determination and control over their own lives.                              {time}  1345  One of the intriguing arguments I hear today and I heard last week is, well, you know what, the pharmaceutical companies aren't compelled to provide these drugs. So my immediate question is: Oh, so you would be more comfortable, then, if we would have included a compulsory means in the bill? Did you want the pharmaceutical companies to be compelled to provide these?  The answer would be no. It is simply they don't like this bill. They don't want the bill.

1808,topic-id,334,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman for the excellent work that he has done on the BRICK Act, and also Mr.Johnson, who brought this legislation forward and who has worked so closely with individuals, with companies in his district to address their concerns on this.  Now, what brings us here today is the fact that, once before, the brick industry faced an EPA rule that went on the books, hadn't gone through judicial review. This happened in 2003.  Over a period of 5 years, they began ramping up to make these changes. This is expensive because most of the brick manufacturers in our country are small businesses. They have two kilns, and they are working very, very hard to keep the jobs and keep people employed. When they look at having to change to this new equipment, the investment is going to be $3 million, $4 million, $5 million, depending on the size of their business.  Now, previously, a rule went through the process of judicial review, and then it was withdrawn. What this legislation does is to say, look, let's finish this entire process before we move that expense to the industry, because when you put it to the industry and they are incurring this cost that could end up being an unnecessary cost, what happens? Brick costs more. Building materials cost more.  Who ends up paying for that? Consumers, purchasers, individuals who are buying homes, individuals who are remodeling homes, individuals who are building commercial buildings.  So what we are saying is let's exercise some wisdom. Let's exercise a little bit of experience that comes from having been here before, and let's delay until this entire process is finished.  As we have talked about bricks, we are also addressing the wood heater industry, which is a primary source of heat for many of our homes, and just saying let's be mindful, let's be careful, let's put consumers and taxpayers in front of the bureaucrats who are looking to implement these rules and regulations.

H.3737 will move the government toward implementing checks of social media for individuals we trust with our country's most sensitive information.

1690,topic-id,321,"Mr.Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.DeSantis), the sponsor of this bill.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, in the private sector, if an employer is going to hire somebody, a lot of times they will do a Google search, they will check social media postings to try to learn a little bit more about this prospective employee.  It may be hard to believe, but the Federal Government often fails to conduct a simple internet search on individuals before they are trusted with a security clearance.  Publicly available social media is one of the best ways to understand an individual's interests and intentions, but our investigatory process still focuses on interviewing the applicant's family, friends, and neighbors. For over a decade, various agencies, including the Office of Personnel Management, have conducted studies and pilot programs to assess the effectiveness of social media checks in security clearance investigations. Congress has not been provided those results.  What this bill will do is it will require these agencies to identify best practices so that we can use this going forward to make sure that the people who are employed by this government, armed with a security clearance, who have access to sensitive information that puts the security of the country at risk, that these are people whom we want to have there and they are not folks who have ulterior designs.  A lot of times it is going to be much more informative to look at their publicly available writings than to talk to somebody who may have lived next door to them in an apartment 10 years ago.

Whistleblowers are the front line of defense against waste, fraud, and abuse in the Federal Government, but too many Federal employees are unaware of the laws that protect them and the options available for dealing with retaliation and other actions intended to silence them.  To address this problem, Congress created the ombudsman program in 2012. The program directs agency inspectors general to designate an ombudsman for whistleblower protections at the agency. They provide information to employees on whistleblower protections and remedies in the event of retaliation.  This program was originally a component of the 2012 Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act and was set to expire after 5 years. Over the past 5 years, the ombudsman program has received high marks from the inspector general community. This benefits the country as a whole and makes the Federal Government more efficient.

1851,topic-id,326,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.1132, the Political Appointee Burrowing Prevention Act, introduced by the gentleman from Colorado, Representative  This important bill will protect the integrity of the civil service and ensure the American people are served by a competent, nonpolitical career workforce.  Under current law, each administration appoints a political staff to help advance the administration's political goals. These political employees leave at the end of the administration to make way for the next administration's appointees.  In contrast, the career civil service is designed to carry over from administration to administration. These employees should be hired based on their qualifications and promoted based on their performance. Despite the significant differences between the two types of positions, however, political appointees are currently allowed to convert to career positions. This practice is known as ``burrowing.''  As the Government Accountability Office explained: ``Circumstances surrounding conversions can raise questions as to whether the individuals selected experienced favoritism or enjoyed an unfair advantage in the selection process.''  GAO went on to say: ``Any appearance of this could compromise the merit system's integrity.''  H.1132, the Political Appointee Burrowing Prevention Act, will enact in law the requirement for OPM to review political conversions.  The bill also raises the bar for political conversions, requiring an agency certify the conversion is necessary to meet its mission. To ensure Congress can continue to monitor for abuse, the certification must be provided to Congress before it is approved.  Finally, the bill prohibits political conversions within 2 years of leaving a political appointment. This ensures sufficient time has passed between when political appointees finish their appointment and when they may become a career employee.  In closing, this bill protects the integrity of the merit-based system so career politicians stay free of politics. The American people deserve nothing less.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.

As someone who has personally been trained to ``Stop the Bleed,'' I can attest to its importance and value.  Each year, more than 180,000 people die from traumatic injuries sustained as a result of events including vehicle crashes, falls, industrial and farm accidents, shootings, and natural disasters. The most common preventable cause of these deaths is losing too much blood in the minutes before trained responders arrive. Just like CPR training, a civilian familiar with basic bleeding control techniques is better equipped to save a life. The effort to make this training available to the public is driven by the goal to reduce or eliminate preventable death from bleeding.

289,topic-id,1961,"Mr.President, I am proud to be here as a former U.attorney and the chief Federal prosecutor in  I have been involved in law enforcement for most of my career, and I am proud to stand here now in this Chamber, following the chairman of the Commerce Committee, whose dedication to this cause has brought us to the finish line, and my colleague Senator Portman, whose leadership on this bill is invaluable.  I wish to second a number of points that have been made by Senator Portman and Senator Thune, most especially about the very collaborative effort involved in this bill--a bipartisan championing of a cause whose time has come--and, particularly, about our colleague John McCain and his wife Cindy McCain, whose energy, spirit, courage, and strength have really been an inspiration to all of us. I also want to thank Senators McCaskill, Heitkamp, and Cornyn, because their contributions have been enormously valuable as well.  There is a face to human trafficking in this country. Here is one of the faces. Desiree Robinson, whose story you just heard from Senator Thune, is one such face. Her voice is still. Her voice could not be heard directly, but her mother, Yvonne Ambrose, came to our committee and talked about her[[Page S1851]]beautiful daughter, whose life was lost as a result of sex trafficking. She was killed after she was raped and after she was sold. Her story alone helped us to achieve unanimous approval in the Commerce Committee for this bill, and I hope it will lead us to an overwhelming vote today on the bill before us.  I hope, as well, that it will lead us to defeat amendments that would, in effect, kill this bill--amendments that may be well intentioned, but, in fact, have an effect contrary to their stated purpose.  This bill is completely bipartisan from beginning to end. It is the result of tireless work of advocates, sex trafficking survivors, and a bipartisan coalition of our colleagues. It now has 68 cosponsors. Its companion legislation passed in the House 388 to 25.  It is the product of stakeholder consensus. It has the support of every major human trafficking organization, every major law enforcement group, and every part of the tech community--if not unanimous, at least of many of its leaders.  This bill would clarify section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which was never intended to give websites a free pass to aid and abet sex trafficking. It was never intended to immunize completely those websites so they could knowingly facilitate sex trafficking. Those words are in the bill--``knowingly facilitate.''  The purpose of our measure, very simply, is to give survivors their day in court. Right now, the courtroom doors are barred to them, as a recent court of appeals opinion remarked, outrageously so. It would also open avenues of prosecution to law enforcement where they are currently roadblocked.  My experience combating sex trafficking at the State level led me to colaunch and cochair the Senate Caucus to End Human Trafficking with Senator Portman, seeking to find solutions to this problem. As a State prosecutor, I was told that I could not pursue actions again craigslist or other sites nearly a decade ago because of that section and the interpretation.  Clearly, the websites that facilitate this, knowingly encouraging and profiting from sex trafficking, must face repercussions in the courtroom. For law enforcement to succeed in combating sex trafficking, there have to be consequences. The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children reported an 840-percent increase in reports of suspected child and sex trafficking from 2010 to 2015 alone. It found that spike ``directly correlated to the increased use of the internet to sell children for sex.''  Those numbers fail to tell the full story. In fact, this picture is worth a thousand words. This picture of Desiree shows her as a young girl, smiling. In fact, her mom told us that her smile could light up a room. She was a successful student who dreamed of becoming a physician in the Air  When she was in high school, a series of men reached out to her on social media. They pressured and manipulated her into letting them sell her for sex and then advertise her on backpage.com. Her mom, Yvonne, told us what happened next:       On December 23, 2016, a 32-year-old man by the name of      Antonio Rosales was looking through Backpage.com for a child      to have sex with, just like countless others before him. . .      . He knew Backpage.com was a site to go to in order to find      young underaged girls to have sex with. During his search, he      came upon a picture of my 16-year-old daughter under the      posting, ``New girl in town looking to have fun,'' which was      posted by her pimp. Desiree was driven to Antonio's residence      by the pimp with the intent of having sex with this 32-year-     old man, a man twice her age.       This was the last night of my daughter's life. . . . On      Christmas Eve, December 24, 2016, Desiree, my baby, was      brutally murdered, and now my life has changed forever. She      had been beaten, raped, strangled, and if that wasn't bad      enough, he slit her throat, all because she said, no, she      didn't want to do this again. She screamed for help, and      there was no one around to help her.  Yvonne Ambrose had the courage to come testify before us, and I have repeated this part of her testimony not because it is ennobling or pleasant, but because it is the hard, ugly truth about sex trafficking. It is the reason that we must pass this measure. It is also the reason why we need to defeat the amendments that would send this measure back to the House and its possible demise.  Every one of the groups I mentioned earlier, including Desiree's lawyer, have urged us to defeat these amendments. I will read just one or two sentences from a letter that I received today from Desiree's lawyer about the so-called moderation amendment:       At first glance, it appears that the Moderation Amendment      is disguising itself as a good Samaritan amendment. However,      in a nutshell, its effect is a really bad faith Samaritan      immunity.  This measure is narrowly tailored. It would ensure that State and local law enforcement can join the fight against these criminal websites. It provides survivors a right of action that would not only be a source of relief for them but also a means of remedy. The Good Samaritan amendment, unfortunately--perhaps, unintentionally--would simply protect the websites.  The people who complain and take action certainly deserve protection. It is in the current law. One of the reasons why we want to defeat this amendment is that it would probably have unintended consequences in protecting websites that identify sex trafficking ads and then leave them up in order to continue profiting from them.  I think the letter from the attorney for Desiree Robinson's estate, Gina DeBoni, objecting to this amendment is a powerful reminder that we need to stick to what we have and what we know will work.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Senator Blumenthal: At first glance, it appears that the      Moderation Amendment is disguising itself as a good Samaritan      amendment. However, in a nutshell, its effect is really a bad      faith Samaritan immunity.       Not only does the amendment strip the ``good faith''      requirement (that is already accounted for in the current      CDA), it creates a new and very expansive immunity for      companies charged with all crimes--not just sex trafficking.      This is in sharp contrast to CDA's original intent and does      nothing but immunize bad actors.       I significantly limits evidence that could be used in any      federal criminal action against a website. Because almost      every company uses some form of moderation system, the      immunity would apply in every case brought under Section 230      going forward.       The CDA has already been crafted to provide immunity to      those that are truly using good faith in their screening.      This amendment undoes that and instead, creates a new bar to      liability.       Moreover, it does not make sense in the real world and has      the potential to create devastating consequences. As you      know, we represent Yvonne Ambrose, the mother of Desiree      Robinson, who was just 16 years old when she was murdered on      Christmas Eve 2016. Desiree was not much different than any      other 16 year old girl. She was loved by all, and had dreams      like all. Like all children, Desiree was vulnerable. It did      not take long for her to fall victim to a man who preyed upon      her and sold her for a finder's fee to her pimp, Joseph      Hazely sold Desiree for sex on Backpage.com to      Antonio Rosales--her killer. Desiree's case has both a      criminal and civil component--Desiree's traffickers and      killer have been charged criminally and are awaiting trial.      We are pursuing a civil wrongful death action against all      that played a part in her death, including Backpage.com.       You heard from Yvonne who testified before the Senate      Commerce There is no better advocate for the      passage of SESTA than a mother who lost her child. Desiree      represents hundreds of 1000s of children who are knowingly      trafficked on Backpage.com. The proposed Wyden amendment cuts      Desiree's claim off at its knees, giving bad actors, who are      not acting in good faith, a way out--giving them a clearly      defined immunity to hang their hat on. It is such a drastic      departure from that of the Good Samaritan, taking good faith      out of the equation entirely. It will create an      insurmountable challenge for lawyers who are fighting on      behalf of victims of sex trafficking, not to mention, any      victims of any other crime, whether criminal or civil,      brought under Section 230.       In practical application, in a case such as Desiree      Robinson, this is how it plays out:       We know that Backpage makes an effort to identify and flag      ads that are objectionable through its strip word feature. It      then affirmatively edits ad that it knows are selling      children for sex on its website. Under this amendment, even      though Backpage knowingly facilitated trafficking of children      when it edited the ads, it would be immunized because it took      steps to identify this content, even though it didn't remove      it. Surely, immunizing bad actors such as Backpage cannot be      the intent of this Congress and all the co-sponsors of this      bill.       We know from the Senate report and information obtained via      our subpoena to Co-Star Group that Backpage's moderation is      relevant and intrinsically connected to their knowing      facilitation of sex trafficking. This[[Page S1852]]     amendment removes the consideration of the direct evidence of      criminal activity because the amendment broadly excludes all      evidence of this nature. In fact, it broadly excludes this      type of evidence for ALL civil and criminal matters      regardless of the type of crime.       Companies such as Facebook, etc, that have the largest risk      or burden are supportive of the SESTA language as is. This      amendment is not geared towards good actors but rather      companies that are not acting in good faith. The Commerce      Committee report clearly provides for good faith moderation--     ``an ICS would not have their good faith efforts to restrict      access to objectionable content used against them.'' Good      faith moderation is already protected by the CDA and the      passage of SESTA does not negate that.       For the above reasons, we respectfully encourage Senator      Blumenthal to vote NO on the Wyden I am available      any time this weekend or on Monday to discuss further.

290,topic-id,346,"Finally, there is a funding amendment that has been offered. While well-intentioned, it would, in effect, derail this legislation. It would provide money through Attorney General Sessions to investigate and prosecute websites that criminally facilitate human trafficking.  This amendment, too, is opposed by law enforcement agencies. Yesterday, I put their letters into the Every major law enforcement representative agency opposes it because ``the funding amendment is a poison pill that is dead on arrival if sent back to the House.''  I will conclude simply by saying that I believe this measure accomplishes some powerfully important purposes. It would not criminalize the so-called harm reduction communication--information designed to ensure that women and men wrapped up in commercial sex trade can avoid violence, prevent HIV, and access community and support services.  H.1865 was not designed to target websites that spread harm reduction information, and the language of the bill makes that clear. The purpose of this bill is much more narrowly focused: A website user or operator must intend to facilitate prostitution. If their goal is to save lives by providing lifesaving information, they have not violated the law.  Finally, I want to make absolutely clear, this legislation is not intended to prejudice the rights of anyone who has been victimized by a crime online other than sex trafficking. For example, I disagree with the courts that have held that the Communications Decency Act immunizes online firearm sales--like Armslist--for facilitating illegal gun sales. While this legislation does not address those cases, nobody should infer that Congress believes they were rightly decided.  Again, my thanks to all of my colleagues and most especially to Senator Portman for his hard work, his leadership, and his courage in tackling this tough problem, which should bring all of us together.

Sadly, Mr.Owens passed away on April 3, 2018, at the age of 83. He will be remembered for his outstanding legacy of dedication to Connecticut as both a statesman and a judge.  Howard began his impressive career in public service as an assistant U.attorney and then as a State senator representing the city of Bridgeport and the town of I had the honor of briefly serving with Howard during my tenure in the Connecticut House of  Beginning in 1974 through 1988, Howard held this seat with the exception of one term in 1984. He took every opportunity while in the capitol to improve the quality of life for not just those who elected him, but for all the people of Connecticut, whether it was promoting mass transit, especially for the urban centers, as senate cochair of the transportation committee or seeking a fairer justice system as senate cochair of the judiciary committee.  In 1998, Howard's passion for State service took on a new shape when he received the appointment to serve as a judge on the superior court. Throughout his time as a State judge, he presided over a number of high-profile cases, which earned Howard recognition for his patient, thoughtful oversight of complex divorce decisions.  Although dedicated to public service, Howard always made time for his friends, especially when they needed help--in the courtroom, as well as outside of it. His legacy of unfailing service and dedication to his community is evident when speaking with anyone who knew him. A caring man with a good sense of humor, he carried out his work humbly and with a sense of devotion to those close to him and to the rest of  Howard added inimitable wisdom to the capitol and the courthouse and is known by many of us throughout the State as a tireless supporter of Connecticut and the Nation's best interests. His commitment to the rule of law and loyalty to his friends and family have left a lasting, positive mark on Connecticut's legacy.  My wife, Cynthia, and I extend our deepest sympathies to Howard's family during this difficult time, particularly to his wife, Ann, and their four children. May their many wonderful memories of Howard provide them solace and comfort.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-04-09-pt1-PgS2011.txt,2076,SATISFYING ENERGY NEEDS AND SAVING THE ENVIRONMENT ACT,2018.0,9.0,March
1243,topic-id,1359,"Thank you, Mr. We are here at a critical time for our democracy because our country is under attack. In fact, we are here because Russia is attacking our democracy as part of a campaign of informational warfare. That term is not mine; it is Russia's. It is quoted in an indictment that was handed down by the special counsel less than a month ago against 13 individuals and 3 entities. That document is absolutely stunning. It is chilling in its detail and breadth and in its revelations about the apparatus and personnel, the skills and expertise that Russia methodically and relentlessly brought to bear in the 2016 election, in its attack on our democracy.  That attack began in 2014. It was not a few hackers in the basement of some Moscow apartment; it was literally thousands of people, divided into different departments with different skills, pursuing disinformation, cyber attack, misinformation, and propaganda directed at undermining our democracy and, in fact, our election.  Let's remember, constitutionally, elections are foundational to our democracy, and Russia sought not just to sow discord and dissension but to affect the outcome. According to the indictment, its effort to affect the outcome was to assist then-Candidate Donald Trump and to disparage and damage Hillary We will never know how much it affected the outcome, but it certainly impacted the views and the votes of some people in the United States of  That attack is now continuing. Our intelligence community is unanimous in the view that Russia interfered in our last election and that this effort is continuing. Indeed, all of the intelligence community that has come before the Armed Services Committee in the last 2 weeks has been unanimous that Russia is continuing its attack.  In his testimony, Admiral Rogers is very clear that they will continue that attack because they are paying no price for it. The cost to them is minimal, if any, and the benefit is highly asymmetrical. In other words, they pay very, very little to undermine our democracy, and they see a lot of return. That is because this country is doing little or nothing--or I should say more accurately that this administration is doing absolutely nothing to make Russia pay a price. In effect, that is the testimony from representatives of the intelligence community, including, most recently today, the Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, and GEN Robert  When I asked what was being done to deter, counter, or retaliate against the Russians, Director Coats said, in effect, that it is everyone's responsibility, which means, in effect, it is no one's responsibility; that it was the whole of government responding, which means no single agency, and there is no plan and no action underway. There is at most perhaps some kind of study of what should be done.  But the denial of meddling is really the reason why nothing has been done and why no action is underway, and that denial comes from one person--the President of the United He has refused to acknowledge that the Russians interfered on the scale and scope that they did, and that denial or refusal to acknowledge is itself a tremendous boon to the Russians continuing to attack our democracy.  As recently as this afternoon, at his press conference with the Swedish Prime Minister, the President said, in effect, that perhaps Russia might have meddled, other countries might have meddled, and other individuals might have meddled, but he has refused to acknowledge the extent and the depth and breadth of past and continuing Russian interference in our democracy.  Make no mistake--others of us on both sides of the aisle have said that the Russians will escalate in the sophistication of their attacks, in the depth of their interference, in the types of tools used through cyber and social media and platforms that are now being developed. They will use American voices. There will no longer be the broken English, no longer be the payment in rubles. They will become ever-more astute and adroit in their attack on our democracy.  So the question is, Why? Why has the President declined to acknowledge this attack--a continuing assault on our democratic institutions, particularly on our elections, which are foundational to our democracy? Some have put it this way: What do the Russians have on him? But my view is that we need to look back at the knowledge that the Trump campaign had of that attack in 2016 as it was proceeding.  To take one example, the stolen or hacked emails. Clearly, Trump campaign contacts with WikiLeaks and Russia show that the campaign knew about those stolen or hacked emails, which were then used to attack the Clinton campaign. If those members of the Trump campaign knew about it--those in responsible positions--the question is, How could the President not have known?[[Page S1370]]  In April of 2016, George Papadopoulous, a member of the Trump foreign policy team for at least a substantial period of time, was eager to communicate with senior staff of the Trump campaign that he knew the Russians had hacked emails and that those emails could help the Trump campaign. He was anxious to ingratiate himself with his connections to make himself more valuable in their eyes. So he boasted, in effect, about his contacts with Russians and with Russian officials. Papadopoulous was already working overtime to ingratiate himself with the Trump campaign leadership, and he certainly was not likely to keep valuable information about stolen emails possessed by the Russians to himself.  Remember, when the Trump campaign--specifically Donald Trump, Jr.--was offered dirt on Hillary Clinton, he replied: ``I love it.'' From everything we know about Donald Trump, Jr.'s relationship to his father, he is unlikely to have kept that information to himself.  George Papadopoulous is one of several Trump associates who seemed to know that Russia was trying to help the Trump campaign win the 2016 election. Donald Trump, Jr., again, was in contact with WikiLeaks beginning in September of 2016, and we know this communication continued at least through July of 2017. We know that Donald Trump, Jr., turned over these messages to investigators. When Trump, Jr., received the first message from WikiLeaks, he emailed other senior officers within the Trump campaign. Those officers included Steve Bannon, Kellyanne Conway, Brad Parscale, and Trump's son-in-law, Jared How could that information and other similar communications not have been transmitted to Donald Trump himself?  Donald Trump, Jr., received an email in which Rob Goldstone offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents from Russia that would supposedly incriminate Hillary We know now that Donald Trump, Jr., jumped at the chance to receive this information, responding with the famous: ``If it's what you say, I love it.'' That, then, led to the meeting involving Trump, Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort at Trump  There is more here that raises the likelihood of collusion. There is a credible case of obstruction of justice against the President of the United There is a solid factual basis to believe that the Trump campaign not only knew but encouraged and cooperated and even colluded with the Russians in this effort. If motive is necessary for the Trump campaign to have done this kind of collusion--certainly it is in the prospect of impacting the outcome. If motive is necessary for President Trump now refusing to acknowledge Russian meddling during the election campaign and now continuing meddling, it is collusion as well.  So we are in a dangerous time because, in fact, Russia will continue to interfere and undermine our democracy if it pays no price for it. The only way to make sure Russia will pay a price to counter, deter, or retaliate is for the President of the United States to demonstrate leadership and to put aside whatever concern about legitimacy there may be. No one is relitigating the 2016 election as to what the outcome was, in fact. We have a President in office, but that President now must act to protect our democracy and our elections going forward from this day into the future.  Thank you.

25,topic-id,1911,"Mr.President, first of all, I think the session led by Senator Alexander and Senator Collins on the cost-sharing has been very helpful and shows the impact that would have if we went forward with it, but I want to talk about the funding bill itself.  The first and foremost thing this bill does is it makes critical investments to keep Americans safe. It is the largest annual defense increase year-to-year in 15 years. It provides a pay increase for those who risk their lives in service to us. When we send our men and women who are willing to do that job in harm's way, we ought to do everything we can to ensure that they have every possible advantage. We don't want Americans to be in a fair fight. We want Americans to be in an unfair fight because we have stacked the fight in favor of people who are defending us.  We lost the advantages we had over the last 10 years. We clearly have not funded the military at the level it needed to be funded. We haven't provided the training dollars. We let the equipment get old. I would like to think I have consistently been on the other side of that debate.  We see what happens when we lose that advantage. We lost 80 personnel this year and last year, 2017, in accidents--in training accidents and other accidents--where people are asked to do too much for too many hours without enough training on the kind of equipment they are going to be using. We had 80 people lost in those accidents--four times as many people as were lost in combat. We can't continue to let that happen.  That is what this bill does. It turns the page after a decade of inadequate funding, a decade of diminished readiness, a decade of training that wasn't what people should have been expected to have before they were expected to do the things we asked them to do.  This bill makes the equipment better, it strengthens our military defense, it strengthens our missile defense, it funds new weapons systems, and invests heavily in measures designed to counter the threats such as ISIL and North  It begins to upgrade U.military strength with funding increases for shipbuilding, for aircraft procurement and maintenance. Some of the aircraft we make--the Growlers and Super Hornets--in Missouri, and there are lots of small suppliers that are a part of that readiness chain that are jeopardized when we decide we are not going to keep our equipment up-to-date or repaired.  This bill has a pay raise for the military men and women that they deserve. It also deals with veterans. In my State, we have 500,000 veterans. I am proud to see this bill provides a record level of Veterans' Administration funding but also continues down the path of being sure veterans have more choices. There is no reason to drive by three hospitals that are really good at something that the veterans hospital you are going to may not be as good at. There are things veterans hospitals should be better at than anybody else. They should be better at post-traumatic stress. They should be better at IED attacks, where eyes and limbs are hurt. Always the veterans hospitals have been as good as anybody on prosthetics when people have lost legs and lost arms. That is part of what veterans uniquely are likely to have happen to them more than others. There is no reason to assume they should be as good at kidney dialysis or open-heart surgery. There is every reason to assume, if they want to go somewhere that really is good at this that is closer to where they live, they should be able to do that.  This bill funds either the construction or the repair and backup of almost 100 miles of the wall that the President talked about at the border.  It provides the money to keep the Guantanamo Bay detention facility open. It has the Fix NICS component, particularly with Federal agencies. It was a shock to me and others, as we have looked into this, that so many of the problems with reporting to the background check system have been through Federal agencies and the military failing to report the kinds of things that clearly would be reported if they had happened in a civilian environment. Fix NICS does that, providing incentives for States to figure out how to make their reporting better.  This includes the Hatch and Klobuchar safe schools language that talks about how to stop school violence, early intervention, military mental health awareness. In my State, at least, we have been leaning on something called mental health first aid, where teachers and others who work with young people are not turned into psychiatrists or psychologists but in a fairly intensive, but short, period of time are given some of the key things to look for to then try to connect that young man or woman with the kind of help they need.  The equipment that could be available for better securing schools would be available in new ways under this bill, if we pass it. Some of that is in the education area. I am on that subcommittee with the Presiding  The labor, the health and human services, and the education components of the bill are strong--what we are doing for the third year straight in healthcare research. Until this year, every time we made that new commitment to healthcare research, after 12 years of no increase at all, we did it with no new money. It was purely prioritizing this as an important thing. With this year's bill, the bill we will pass today, we will restore 22 percent of funding that the NIH lost in research buying power in the previous 12 years, where not a single new penny went to healthcare research beyond what they had before--whether it is Alzheimer's, cancer, or the BRAIN We just simply know a lot more than we knew a dozen years ago about the human genome, about the individual impact of cancers, about getting your own system more aggressively fighting back, by sort of amping up your own system's response. Your system and mine, we have a response to those cancerous attacks, but usually it is quickly overwhelmed by the cancer itself. It doesn't have to be that way because research has led the way on that.  This bill is not perfect. I could go through the bill--every one of us could go through the bill and find something in there that we individually don't like. That is part of the legislating process.  Going back to my earlier comments, it is a different decision to be made when you decide: I am absolutely committed to defending the country, but I[[Page S1923]]am going to find something in the bill that funds that that I can be against, so even though I can be for defense, I don't have to explain anything I am not for.  I would rather we brought these bills to the floor one at a time. I am lucky--I hope--fortunate to be on the special committee that was just appointed to try to figure out a way to make the budget and appropriations process work in a way that this might be the last time we have all this in one bill. It didn't used to be that way. It has been that way for about 10 years now. It needs to stop. Every Member needs to have a right to be able to amend these bills, to bring them to the floor one at a time or two at a time, have a real debate, and put them on the President's desk as we pass them, not to wait until 6 months after the new spending year begins and then have one big bill and have no real impact on what is in that bill in ways we would like to--at least vote on having it changed.  It is not perfect. There was right-to-conscience language, where healthcare professionals who didn't want to be part of a particular procedure that would generally be a life-ending procedure because of their personal conscience and faith beliefs--you would think that could have made it in this bill, but it didn't. I would be much happier about voting on this bill if it were there, but it is not there. So I can find things that aren't there that I would like to see in this bill. I can certainly find things that are in the bill that I would prefer not to see us go forward with. But that is the process of democracy. That is the process of legislating. You have to look at the alternatives before you.  If we are going to make the kind of commitment to our national defense and the men and women who defend us that this bill makes, if we are going to make the kind of commitment to healthcare research and school safety that this bill makes, the choice today is to vote for the bill sometime before the continuing resolution runs out tomorrow or to think of how you could have done this in a better way. I think we all can think of better ways to do this.  Moving forward here, it is important that we have made a commitment to the opioid crisis we are seeing in the country. More people now die from drug overdoses than in car accidents. Drug overdoses have become the 1 cause of accidental death in the country today.  We have $1.5 billion in flexible spending for the States as part of the $3 billion being spent to fight the opioid crisis in the next year. About 15 percent of that $1.5 billion is going to go to the States that have the biggest problem. There will be some allocation to every State because every State has a problem, but some States have bigger problems. For the first time in this fight, with the good advice of Senator Shaheen, Senator Capito, Senator Portman, and others, we are factoring in a way to get more money quicker to the States that have big problems.  There is also money for the National Institute of Health to research new ways to respond to drug overdoses so that more people survive the overdose and research different ways to deal with pain so that people don't get addicted to the things they are addicted to now and either die from overdoses or move to even more dangerous drugs. And people who don't die from an overdose can see their lives crumble in front of them even if they are fortunate enough to recover from the addiction they became part of. This is a national crisis, and this bill views it as a national crisis.  Whether it is a domestic crisis, like opioids, or an international crisis, like our failure to defend ourselves in a way that people who defend us would expect us to be willing to do--this is a bill that overall deserves to be voted for. I intend to vote for it. I intend to start tomorrow trying to have a bill next year that not only comes to the floor in a different way but also corrects the problems that I think could have been better served in the bill we have before us today.  With that, Mr.President, I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2018-03-22-pt1-PgS1919.txt,1464,NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018--MOTION TO,2018.0,22.0,March

618,topic-id,885,"Mr.President, everybody doesn't just come up with the same description of someone they have worked with every day by accident. When we think about everything that has been said and everyone independently setting down what we remember about Senator Cochran, what we think about when we think about Senator[[Page S1897]]Cochran--he is a gentleman. He is a quiet persuader. He gets things done in a way that makes things that would otherwise seem hard for other people seem easy for him.  The true, groundbreaking politician came to the Congress in 1972, but in 1978, he was the first Republican elected statewide in Mississippi in over 100 years.  He gave evidence to that willingness to serve everybody in the direction he gave his staff. Nobody ever talks about Senator Cochran without talking about his staff. It doesn't take long into that conversation to talk about his staff. Just as Thad Cochran encouraged them to do on day one, they always tried to solve everybody's problem they worked for, no matter what that past relationship might have been or how they disagreed on other things.  The first time I got a chance to work with Senator Cochran, I was the chief deputy whip in the House, and we were in a leadership meeting trying to bring some things to a conclusion. I think the majority leader in the Senate at the time was Thad's colleague from Trent Lott turned to Thad and me--I was the junior person at the table. My mom and dad were dairy farmers, and maybe that is why Senator Lott thought I would understand this. It was a dairy issue, as I recall, and he said: Why don't you and Senator Cochran work this out? I think it was something on milk marketing orders, which almost nobody understood. It was a problem that nobody thought they could solve. I had been here about 25 months, and Senator Cochran had been here 25 years, and what I got was the great gift of watching him work out that problem, and it got to the conclusion that, for whatever reason, everybody was happy with.  His leadership, for States like Missouri and Mississippi with large rural populations--I think we have a bigger urban population than Mississippi, but we both have big rural populations. Whether it was agricultural issues or flood insurance or rural economic development, Thad Cochran was always there--at one time, not just as the chairman of the Agriculture Committee but also the chairman of the agriculture appropriating committee, and anybody who has worked around here very long knows it doesn't get much more powerful than that when it comes time to solve problems.  There have been mentions of Hurricane Katrina and stepping up, along with Haley Barbour, the Governor of Mississippi, coming together, convincing the Congress of things that needed to be done, and a few things that got done in Mississippi that didn't get done anywhere else.  I was presiding this morning when Senator Schumer spoke. He mentioned--he didn't mention it is his comments a few minutes ago, but he mentioned this morning--and this is an important view of both of them--he said that he remembered Thad saying one time: I don't call a lot of press conferences; I don't think it is part of my responsibility. Senator Schumer quickly pointed out that was not his view of press conferences, but it was Thad's view of press conferences or ``Meet the Press'' or anything else that didn't focus on his job of getting things done.  The bill we will vote on today does things for members of the Active Armed Forces and veterans that we haven't done in a long time. It is a fitting conclusion to the service of Thad Cochran, who in 2013 received the Navy Distinguished Public Service He was stationed in Boston for part of his service in the Navy, where nobody could understand what he said, but they wanted to do whatever it was that Thad Cochran wanted to do.  I liked the term that Senator Shelby used, that Thad Cochran is one of the last practitioners of the lost art of being nice--the lost art of being nice.  I talked to my 13-year-old son Charlie just this morning, and I said: You know, Charlie, it is actually easier to be thoughtful than to be thoughtless. So many of us don't mature much beyond the 13-year-old understanding of that. We would be better off to watch and learn from what Thad Cochran did so well while he served in this body.  Thad and Kay will be missed in the daily Senate family, but they will always be an important part of the Senate family.  It is an exciting time when you get to go home to Mississippi and don't immediately understand that you very quickly have to turn around and come back to Washington to do what Thad did so well for so long, representing the people he worked for, the people he loved. At least two generations of Mississippians don't remember when Thad Cochran wasn't their Senator, and only when this time in the Senate ends will people fully begin to realize how much he did, how much they appreciate what he did, and how much has happened because Thad Cochran was here.

1326,topic-id,1148,"Mr.President, I want to join my colleague from West Virginia, as well as our friend from South Dakota, to say how much I appreciate the effort that Senator Crapo has made to put this bill together. It is exactly how the Congress is supposed to work and how the Senate is supposed to work--a bipartisan bill. Frankly, I am sure it is a bill that everyone who will vote for it would have changed at least one thing in it, but if we were to change all of those things that all of us would have changed, suddenly we wouldn't have a bill that could pass, a bill that would do what this bill does, a bill that will roll back the Dodd-Frank regulations, which are one more attempt by the Federal Government to make one size fit all. If you have ever tried on any one-size-fits-all things, you know that one size almost never fits anybody, and that has been the case that we have seen now.  Credit unions and community banks provide critical financial services for families and for small businesses across Missouri and across the country. When the Dodd-Frank bill became law, small and medium-sized banks and credit unions were faced with huge regulatory burdens. Big banks got bigger, and small banks got bought and went out of business way too often. There was negative impact on their ability to maintain service on Main Street in a small community. You couldn't put together a group that would just be the compliance group, and if you did, that had to come out of their ability to do the kind of business that you wanted to do and always had been doing.  According to the Independent Community Bankers of America, despite holding less than 20 percent of the Nation's banking assets, community banks fund more than 60 percent of small business loans and more than 80 percent of U.agricultural loans--all in that 20 percent of the banking assets of the country. Furthermore, they operate in many areas where other banks don't, where they are the only physical banking presence, frankly. One out of every five U.counties has only one bank, and that one bank is a community bank, a small bank. The more time, the more money, the more staff that community lenders have to dedicate to complying with needless regulations, the less ability they have to provide the kind of service they would like to provide.  In talking about the bill that I am pleased to be a cosponsor of, the president of the Missouri Bankers Association, Max Cook, said: ``This common-sense legislation will allow banks to better serve the needs of customers and businesses in our communities.''  He went on to say ``that financial regulatory reform will unleash America's economic potential.'' That is the end of his quote, but I think you could add to it that lots of good things are happening in our economy right now--the tax bill, the regulatory, commonsense regulations that are overcoming regulations that didn't make much sense. Access to capital is a critically important part of what you have to have to have a growing economy--access to capital in small communities,[[Page S1416]]as well as access in big communities. That means you have to have banks that can serve the communities those banks are in.  This bill contains a number of bipartisan priorities. One of the priorities in here is a bill that I sponsored, the Family Self-Sufficiency Senator Rounds mentioned part of what that means to rural Americans, but it also means a lot to Americans who are living under public housing programs of one kind or another. This was a bill that I introduced. It was cosponsored by Senator Reed from Rhode Island, Senator Scott from South Carolina, Senator Menendez from New Jersey, and it is another bipartisan statement that this bill will make when we pass it. It simply makes commonsense changes in the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Family Self-sufficiency That program happens to be under the Banking Committee, so it fits right in this bill.  What this addition to the bill would do--and it is in the bill to start with now--is expand the ability of people, under the new way to define these programs, to improve their education, to save money for the future, to reach their goal of becoming more financially independent.  The first thing the legislation does is streamline two public housing family self-sufficiency programs into one. There is no reason to have two family self-sufficiency programs, no reason to have two definitions, no reason to have one category of people in those programs who qualify for things and a second category who don't, just because they happen to qualify under the definitions of a needlessly duplicative program. So it eliminates that.  This bill expands the scope of support services. It allows people who are in these programs to attain a GED if they don't have one, to pursue a postsecondary degree or a postsecondary certification, and it gives training for financial literacy.  Lastly, this bill would expand the reach of the Family Self-Sufficiency Program to families that may otherwise be technically excluded from the program today.  I would like to share some of the statements from housing organizations in my State and around the country, such as a group called Beyond Housing, which is interested in more than just a place to live, but how you use that as a way to improve your life. Beyond Housing in Louis, which provides more than 400 affordable housing rental units for families throughout the Louis region, endorsed the bill because they said it would ``empower families across the country to achieve self-sufficiency.'' The Missouri chapter of the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials supports the change this bill has because they say ``it provides the Tool Box the residents can use to better life for them as individuals and as a family.''  The National NeighborWorks Association says that the legislation would ``improve the existing self-sufficiency program to help more individuals and families achieve more in life for themselves and their families.''  Providing families in need with affordable housing is critical, but it is also important that we figure out ways to move them beyond government support to self-sufficiency. These changes in this bill help make that happen. A companion bill of that part of the bill in the House passed in January by a vote of 412 to 5, so I hope it is a helpful addition to the bill. I know it is going to be helpful to the families that it opens new doors for.  I am glad to be here supporting this bill and to have Senator Rounds, Senator Capito, Senator Enzi, and Senator Fischer here, as well, to talk about the importance of this bipartisan piece of legislation.

1657,topic-id,719,"Mr.President, I rise to recognize the role of nutrition in the health and wellness of our Nation and the development of our children. Arkansas' agricultural producers play a vital role in providing affordable, nutritious food, not only for our State and country but for the entire world.  March is recognized as National Nutrition This is a time to focus attention on the importance of a balanced diet and healthy eating choices. As a cochair of the Senate Hunger Caucus, I am committed to supporting and raising awareness of efforts that provide nutritious, healthy meals; creating policies that fight hunger; and supporting programs that have proven successful.  The Department of Agriculture's Child and Adult Care Food Program is a unique effort that uses public-private partnerships to meet the nutritional needs of vulnerable children and adults. This has become a critical tool in the fight against hunger.  Senator Klobuchar and I recently introduced a resolution designating this week as National Child and Adult Care Food Program Week to honor and raise awareness of the important role the Child and Adult Care Food Program plays in the health of those in Arkansas, Minnesota, and throughout the country. Through this program, more than 4 million children and 130,000 adults in childcare centers, adult daycare homes, and afterschool programs receive nutritious meals and snacks daily.  Studies show that access to the Child and Adult Care Food Program can measurably and positively impact the cognitive, social, emotional, and physical health and development of children, leading to more favorable outcomes, such as decreased likelihood of being hospitalized, an increased likelihood of healthy weight gain, and an increased likelihood of a more varied diet.  As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I will be working to ensure that individuals who need food assistance are able to access affordable, nutritious meals. I will also continue to press for flexibility in the Department of Agriculture's Summer Food Service Program so children who rely on school meals when class is in session can access healthy, nutritious meals during the summer in order to have a seamless transition from the school year to the summer programs.  In Arkansas, more than 50,000 children receive nutritious meals through this program. For many rural areas of the country, like the Natural State, this one-size-fits-all approach fails to meet the needs of communities and the children who are most in need.  More than 60 percent of Arkansas' children rely on free or reduced meals during the school year, so we need to modernize the program so that summer meal sites are available to children no matter where they live. Arkansas is blessed to have the support of schools, churches, Boys & Girls Clubs, libraries, and other organizations that serve as host sites for summer meal programs, and we need to allow them the flexibility that is necessary to reach the students in their communities. It is time that Federal policy responds to this need.  I have seen how community involvement in Arkansas is fighting food insecurity. Efforts like the Cooking Matters at the Store Initiative, launched by the Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance, teaches families who are on budgets to compare prices, read food labels, and buy fruits and vegetables.  This month is recognized as School Breakfast Month in State educators have seen how essential breakfast is to students' progress, so they have instituted programs to promote breakfast and are helping to grow gardens where the food produced is used in school lunches. Grocery stores are allowing SNAP beneficiaries to purchase locally grown produce at a discount. Proper nutrition is crucial to our well-being.  Creating opportunities to access healthy, nutritious food is also important to our State's and the Nation's economic development. In order to break the cycle of food insecurity, we must work together. Hunger knows no boundaries, but it is preventable, and we have the tools to help fight it. We have made significant gains in Arkansas, across the country, and throughout the world to improve nutrition for the most vulnerable in our society, and I will continue to be a champion of efforts to improve access to healthy nutritious, foods.  I yield the floor.

1088,topic-id,514,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for holding this Special Order tonight. And I also say, just because we are following a theme, if we put in perspective how long ago it was that we did tax reform in this Nation, I was running for my first political office for county board. I had a mullet, and it looked good--at least my wife told me it did.  But let me tell you that, after we passed this tax reform--I come from deep southern Illinois, nowhere near Chicago, a very rural district, a little bit of metropolitan--a typical family of four will receive a break of over $2,000 per year.  Now, folks, I don't know how it would be in your district or in your hometown if you are listening to this tonight, but that is not crumbs where I come from. Some of the folks here in Washington may think that that is the case, but that is not.  Let me tell you that I have been around my district talking to people; and you go to barber shops and coffee shops, and my wife and I own a beauty salon, and you hear from the people how much they are saving, so much so that we actually asked for people to start replying on our Facebook and to tell us what their story was.  I am just going to give you a few of these. I know that we are on limited time, but I am going to tell you that Bobby from Makanda, here is what he writes:       I am a police officer and my wife is a high school teacher.      Combined, the new tax rates save us over $300 a month. We      have two teenage children. The additional income will help us      save for upcoming college expenses.[[Page H1429]]  Terry from Royalton writes:       My wife is an educator and I am in healthcare. Since these      changes have affected my pay about the same as hers, we know      how much it changes our monthly income. About $300.  His statement is:       Hey, Nancy, if that is crumbs in your world, it's not in      mine.  Tracy from Wood River writes:       Tax reform allows more money for college, more money to be      put towards paying off our home, provides more activities for      our children, and allows us to save more money for the      future.  These are just three stories of countless that we have heard. Countless have come in not only from individuals on the individual tax rate, but the business tax rate as well: expansion of business, growing of business, using it to expand the 401(k)s of their employees, giving increases in pay to their employees.  The bottom line is this: The tax reform allows people to keep more money of their paycheck. It allows them the opportunity to use that money in the way they see fit, not how the government wants to use it. They earned that money. It is theirs. They should be able to keep more of it to spend and save as they please. This new tax reform does just that.

She rises while it is yet night and provides food for her      household and portions for her maidens.       She considers a field and buys it, and from the fruit of      her hands she plants the vineyards.       She dresses herself with strength and makes her arms      strong.

629,topic-id,726,"Mr.President, this weekend, Americans around the country and at, at least, a dozen places in my State of Ohio will hold peaceful marches in their communities to demand that we in this body--the people who represent them--actually do something to protect them from gun violence, not just state that my thoughts and prayers are with the victims and the families but to actually do something.  That sort of activism is so important to our democracy. Change never starts in We make progress because of the grassroots movements of Americans across our country who demand action. For too long, Congress has ignored millions of Americans who want reasonable gun safety measures. Instead, this Congress continues to do the bidding of the gun lobbyists.  We already see activism making a difference. It is a minor step, but this week, in the bipartisan budget deal, we will vote to loosen government regulations that severely limit research on gun safety. It is an important first step, but we have a long way to go. We can't say we are doing what it takes to keep our country safe until we are finally willing to pass commonsense laws that protect all Americans from gun violence. Many of us have tried.  I supported the original Federal assault weapons ban in 1994 during my first term in I joined with many of my colleagues to vote to[[Page S1901]]renew it after the shooting at Sandy Weapons of war don't belong on our streets or in our classrooms.  We have tried to pass legislation to close loopholes in our background check system so the people who buy guns on the internet or at gun shows have to go through the same background checks as law-abiding gun owners who buy their guns at stores in  After the tragedy at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, we tried to pass legislation to prevent people on the terrorist watch list from buying guns. People can't believe the law in this country; that if you are on the government's terrorist watch list, you can't go to the Cleveland Hopkins International Airport in Cleveland, to the John Glenn Columbus International Airport in Columbus, or to the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Washington and get on an airplane, which is the right thing, but that you can go out and buy a gun.  We know what happened each and every time. The gun lobby stood in the way. It stands in the way, despite the fact that the laws we are talking about will not undermine the rules and rights of law-abiding gun owners. I have always respected the rights of hunters and collectors and other law-abiding gun owners. No one is trying to take away their guns. Yet, when our students aren't safe in school, it is clear something has to be done. We will not give up on making our country safer. We will keep fighting until we get weapons of war out of our schools and off our streets.  Creating change in our country is not easy. It requires often going up against powerful special interests. It is how things happen in this country. It is how women got the right to vote. It is how we passed civil rights. It is how we passed workers' compensation. It is how we passed It is how we got Social People banded together--activists--around the country.

1036,topic-id,3282,"Mr.President, well, not exactly. Yesterday I spoke about the big banks that have violated our banking laws time and again, banks like Wells Fargo and I talked about foreign banks like Santander and Deutsche Bank--the President's personal German bank, I might add. Santander, a Spanish bank, has foreclosed on the cars of American service men and women when they are overseas serving our country, and we are rewarding that Spanish bank. We are rewarding a Swiss bank that has broken international law in support of We are rewarding these foreign banks.  I liked this bill at the beginning. I have been working on these issues with Chairman Crapo, whom I respect--I really do--for some years, and we worked on coming up with a bill that would help community banks and the midsized regional banks, three of which are located in the Presiding Officer's boyhood State and my State of Ohio--Fifth Third, KeyCorp, and We wanted to do those things.  You know, in this place, when we work on something to help the small guy, the big guy thinks: Well, don't leave me out. I want to be part of this. I want to get my things too.  So we start helping community banks, we start helping the little guy, and all of a sudden, Wall Street gets its hand out, just like on the tax bill. I guess I believed my colleagues on the tax bill when they said it was a middle-class tax cut bill. Well, it kind of didn't end up that way. By the end, 81 percent of the tax benefits went to the richest 1 percent.  That is what we do. We start here. We go back home, and we talk about helping the middle class and helping the little guy. No matter whether she punches a time clock or works construction, we want to help middle-income people. But you know what--by the time the lobbyists swoop in, by the time they are here, and they start talking to their friends and start doing what they do, then all of a sudden, these bills help the big guy. They help Wall It is no surprise; it has happened here before.  I particularly think we would learn about it when it comes to what happened 10 years ago. There are some pretty smart people in the Senate, but they have some kind of illness that I don't entirely understand called collective amnesia. They forget. They forget what happened 10 years ago.  Where I live, Cleveland, OH, and where the Presiding Officer grew up in greater Cleveland, in my neighborhood, ZIP Code 44105, in early 2007, in the first half of that year, more people lost their homes through foreclosure than any other ZIP Code in the United States of The neighborhood that I live in is not a gated community. I live in an area of about 200 relatively new homes. When I drive about 500 yards in any direction, I see the blight that came because of what Wall Street and, frankly, this Congress and the regulators, the Bush regulators--I can mention names; it is all public record--did to our economy. And 10 years later, we have kind of forgotten about all that.  Well, the people who lost their homes haven't forgotten about it. The people who lost their jobs haven't forgotten about it. The people who lost their retirement savings haven't forgotten about it. It is just a bunch of Members of Congress, a bunch of Republican members of the Banking Committee, a bunch of Members on that side of the aisle--almost all of whom, I believe, are supporting this bill--they seem to have forgotten what happened to the economy 10 years ago.  After starting with a relatively simple and benign, let's help the community banks and the credit unions--which I want to do, too, and have a voting record to prove it--and help some of the smaller regionals, such as Huntington and Fifth Third and Key Corp in my State, it just sort of got out of hand.  Well, now they are coming back and saying: Well, we will make a couple of changes. Let's talk about these couple of changes that Houdini would be proud of, sort of some sleight-of-hand kinds of changes. In fact, these changes have made the bill worse, and I will explain.  Last September, we learned that Equifax had allowed hackers to exploit a known security flaw and make off with names, birth dates, Social Security numbers, and all matter of private information of 143 millions There are probably 50 people in the If the national averages hold out, 25 of them were wronged by They were fraudulently or incompetently--perhaps through incompetence--attacked by In my State, it was about 5 million people. Around the country, it was about 143 million. In fact, most of the people in the Gallery are adults, so it is more than half the adult population that was wronged by Half the country is vulnerable to identity theft.  Americans are furious with Equifax, as they should be, but this amendment that apparently is in the substitute bill for reasons I can't fathom includes provisions designed to help It is not just that this body doesn't punish Equifax and that these executives have no contrition--of course nobody went to jail.  The people we send to jail in this country--we almost never send people to jail for financial fraud. They dress well, they are sophisticated, they belong to the right country clubs, and they would never go to jail. Let me back off on that for a moment and talk again about  Equifax and other credit reporting agencies apparently have been upset about a proposal to give men and women in the military credit monitoring. Think of that. Equifax executives didn't like that there was a proposal to give the people serving this country credit monitoring.  I understand what Santander did; they repossessed autos of men and women from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton and from other places who were overseas serving. They repossessed their cars, and we rewarded them, so I guess Equifax thought, well, there is a good trend here, a good precedent there. We don't want to give men and women in the military credit monitoring.  So we have an amendment to fix that. A small gesture to the people who serve our country, though, seemed too much for the Republicans and too much for In exchange for this token benefit, they demanded that consumers and servicemembers give up their right to take Equifax to court. So Equifax is willing to do a little bit for people, just a little bit, but damn it, you can't sue us then. That was the deal--you can't sue us. We will give you a little bit of credit monitoring, but in return, you can't sue us for anything. I am not a lawyer, but that is called a right to action. So the next time the company's recklessness exposes sensitive financial data, sorry, you can't sue us. Sorry about that; that is the way it goes.  In the end, Equifax--shocking--got exactly what it wanted. Equifax let your data loose and ruined your credit score, but you won't be able to sue them. Sorry about that.  It gets worse. Equifax--a company that can't even safely store consumers' data--and that is their job; that is what they are hired to do, even though we don't individually choose them. The company spent nearly as much on executive salaries as it did on cyber security. So this company's job is to protect private data, but they didn't really invest that much in cyber security[[Page S1543]]because, for whatever reason, they paid their executives about the same amount of money.  Now Equifax wants in on the credit-scoring business. Along with two other major credit reporting agencies, it has created a product to compete with Fair Isaac's FICO score.  The Federal Housing Finance Agency has a process in place to try to broaden the factors it looks at in determining creditworthiness, but, as Director Mel Watt testified in the Banking Committee, it is complicated and it is time-consuming. Understandably, FHFA wants to get it right, and so do the lenders that sell loans to Fannie and But instead of allowing FHFA to take the time it needs to get it right, this bill ignores that, and it sets up its own process. We have not taken any testimony on this legislation from market participants or from the government agency. I have my hunch, though, as to who is pushing for it. Guess who is one of the biggest beneficiaries of this change. The pages would know the answer to that, if they are listening. Equifax, of course.  I know my colleagues were well-intentioned. It would be great if we had additional ways of determining whether someone is creditworthy and if we could give more Americans the opportunity to become homeowners. But determining creditworthiness and balancing access to credit with the need to make sure we don't end up with millions of foreclosures is complicated. That is why we have FHFA, and that is why we have a process in place.  We know there are problems with the current system, and more data would improve our efforts to combat discrimination in housing. The Center for Investigative Reporting just completed a valuable study of tens of millions of mortgage records and found out that across the country, people of color are far more likely to be turned down for a loan, even when you take into account factors like income and the size of the loan. I will repeat that. Holding all things equal except for race, people of color are far more likely to be turned down for a loan. We know that.  The trade associations for lenders argued that the study was flawed because more data--data like credit scores and debt-to-income ratios--was needed to prove discrimination. The good news is that Dodd-Frank did that. It required this very kind of data to be collected, and beginning in January, banks and credit unions began reporting it.  Problem solved, right? Well, once the more detailed data set is available and large enough, watchdogs can then undertake better analysis, target the bad actors, and allow the good lenders--and most of them are--to continue with their business without a regulator knocking on their door. But who are we kidding? This bill wants to do away with that too. I thought we had solved the problem. The substitute would repeal the reporting required by Dodd-Frank for 85 percent of all banks.  Backers of the substitute will claim it has addressed complaints that this effort will undermine enforcement of civil rights laws, but it hasn't. Backers will point to a provision which says that banks that flunk the Community Reinvestment Act exam and get a rating of substantial noncompliance are ineligible for the reduced reporting of mortgage data. That sounds good, but in all of 2017, out of the thousands of Community Reinvestment Act exams, only two banks out of thousands flunked. When we have reason to believe banks all across the country are discriminating in their lending, even if it is unintentional--and sometimes it is--looking at data from two banks out of thousands isn't going to tell us a whole lot.  The substitute would maintain current laws for banks that are given a ``needs to improve'' rating on their CRA exam over two consecutive exam cycles. Let's say a bank is engaged in discriminatory lending. The examiner gives it a ``needs to improve'' rating. This amendment says: No harm, no foul; the first one is free. Really? A few years later, when the next exam rolls around, if the bank is still discriminating, only then will it have to submit to the amount of data required today. So this amendment says it is OK for a bank to engage in legally sanctioned discrimination for years before it faces any consequences. Why would we do that in this bill?  In sharp contrast to the slow-motion response to discrimination, when it is the bank that wants the data from the Federal Government, the sponsors of this bill can't move fast enough. It is like everything around here--when Wall Street says ``jump,'' most of this Senate jumps, and frankly, straight down the hall in the House of Representatives, they jump faster and higher.  There was a bill introduced just this Monday, referred to the Finance Committee, that would allow credit card companies to tap the Social Security Administration database to verify identities. There hasn't been a hearing on it, and it hasn't gotten attention, but guess what--it is in the substitute bill. So the banking majority can move very fast when it comes to helping the banks; they can't move so fast when it comes to prohibiting discrimination against people of color. I suppose I understand why, but that is pretty outrageous. The demand on SSA would explode. Will the system be able to handle it? Will the public interfere? Will this public interface be one more way that hackers could gain access to the Social Security database? I don't know because there has been no time for the Finance Committee to look at this bill. Protecting people's Social Security numbers is the last place--the last place--where we should be rushing things to please the big banks.  Whether it is a State as conservative as Tennessee or as liberal as California, I am guessing most Americans don't want Congress to rush something through that might expose their Social Security numbers without really understanding it through congressional hearings and examination.  This would all be bad enough, but it is not just Equifax that gets goodies in this bill. This bill is a gift to foreign megabanks. Yesterday we saw a new provision on foreign banks included in the substitute to clarify the legislation, but it doesn't fix the issue. The substitute includes a figleaf to try to convince the public that this bill doesn't do what it actually does do.  This provision provides some vague and ambiguous language that puts the question to the In this bill, we say: You can regulate the foreign banks or you don't have to regulate the foreign banks; it is up to the new Federal regulators. It is your choice. The legislation doesn't require the Fed to keep strong rules in place that are already in place. It doesn't stop the foreign banks from suing the Fed if it doesn't obey the request.  We are expected to trust Randal Quarles to be tough on foreign banks--most of you don't know Randal I have had conversations with him. He is a smart man. He is well educated. He is a nice guy--but that is not a bet I want to make. That is not a bet Congress should make.  Just this week, Governor Quarles spoke at an international banking conference, and he promised--it was an international banking conference. That would probably not be with Wells Fargo, probably not JPMorgan Chase, probably not Bank of America; it would probably be with Santander, UBS, Swiss Bank, or Barclays--the British bank--or the President's personal bank, the German bank, Deutsche Those are who attended. He said, if we really want to fix the foreign bank issue--he said he plans to deregulate those foreign banks.  I know the supporters of this bill think they can sort of obfuscate--I don't think they are lying. I think they are just obfuscating and not really being straightforward about what this bill does for foreign banks, and I know they did this for foreign banks because I asked Treasury Secretary Mnuchin--Senator Corker was in the room with the Banking Committee--and he said: Yes, we plan to deregulate the foreign banks.  We know that. We know that from other former regulators: Paul Volcker, former head of the Federal Reserve appointed by both President Carter and President Reagan; we know that from people like Sarah Bloom Raskin, who was a member of the Board of Governors at the Federal Reserve; we know that from professors and other regulators. I know Sheila Bair, a Republican nominee appointed by President Bush to run the FDIC, is concerned about this bill. We know that.  So if we want to fix the foreign bank issue, let's just adopt my amendment. Let's fix it. It is simple: No favors for[[Page S1544]]the biggest global banks here in the United Don't give the regulators the option because we know whom the regulators for the banks are. We know most of the regulators for the banks used to work on Wall You go to the White House, and the White House looks like a retreat for Wall Street executives.  We want to write strong laws, clear laws. We don't need to place blind trust in the people who have failed us before--Quarles, Mick Mulvaney, Otting, and We are expecting these people who have been strong in their public announcements to be right in their public actions? We are entrusting these people who have profited--I could name the names. We are entrusting these people who now have public service jobs and who have profited from Wall Street malfeasance to protect our economy and our country from Wall Street malfeasance.  I take the side of Paul Volcker, Sheila Bair, Tom Hoenig, Barney Frank, Sarah Bloom Raskin, Phil Angelides, Antonio Weiss, and Michael They are all people who have counseled us--all good public officials, all former regulators. Not quite half, but a number of them are Republicans, and some are They are all people who counseled us to vote no on this bill and whose concerns have not been addressed by this substitute.  In addition, the substitute raises $675 million to pay for the privilege of deregulating the banks, but all it could manage on lead poisoning in housing was a report from  Where are our priorities? The Congressional Budget Office said this bill makes it more likely they will need a bailout, more likely to lead to a bailout for the big banks. So $675 million of taxpayer money is squandered instead of doing infrastructure, instead of dealing with lead. That is part of the issue we dealt with in our committee. That is why I supported Secretary Carson for his confirmation, because I thought he was going to do something about lead. Shame on me for believing that, when I have seen nothing so far.  Instead of those $675 million going to Wall Street, wouldn't it be great if we could direct those hundreds of millions of dollars to prevent children from developing developmental disabilities brought on by lead?  Remember, I talked about my ZIP Code, 44105. Look at those houses. Drive through Drive through Drive through Drive through all kinds of cities in this country. You will see houses that were built in 1950 or before, and 80 or 90 percent of them have toxic levels of lead. We have sentenced millions of American children to live in those homes.  This is called the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs We have done nothing in this committee for the last 5 years--not a damn thing--about getting that lead out of those homes and stopping the poisoning of children. We could be doing that but instead we are giving more to Wall  This substitute doesn't make this bill better. By papering over its fundamental problems, by treating servicemembers as second-class citizens--think of Santander, think of the amendment Senator Reed from Rhode Island is working on--we are opening up the Social Security system to possible threats. It represents a step backward.  I urge my colleagues to reject the substitute and the underlying bill.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (",CREC-2018-03-08-pt1-PgS1529-7.txt,2106,"ECONOMIC GROWTH, REGULATORY RELIEF, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT--MOTION",2018.0,8.0,March
1211,topic-id,3700,"Mr.President, 10 years ago almost to the day, this country was on the verge of a financial crisis that would wreck the lives of millions of families. The experts--let's say the so-called experts--had their heads in the sand. They shrugged off the warnings. They told the public everything was fine.  Jim Cramer was telling hard-working Americans to invest their money in Bear Maybe younger Members of the Senate don't really remember what Bear Stearns was. Jim Cramer said: ``I'm not giving up on the thing.''  Bank of America was putting the finishing touches on its plan to buy the subprime lender Countrywide, which they called ``the best domestic mortgage platform.''  Hank Paulson, the last Treasury Secretary who got plucked from Goldman Sachs--we have had at least one since--downplayed homeowners' pain. He said: ``You know, the stock market goes up and down every day more than the entire value of the subprime mortgages in the country.''  Meanwhile, advocates in communities--the people who were actually dealing with the consequences of the crisis--were sounding the alarm. The fair lending group Greenlining began meeting with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan at least once a year, starting in 1999--1999--to warn about predatory mortgage lending. Attorneys general from across the country started to caution about troubling trends.  In Cleveland, which is in the Presiding Officer's home State, we saw home prices climb 66 percent in 10 years, with the housing market juiced by ``flipping on mega-steroids,'' according to a government panel that investigated the crisis. City officials in Cleveland began to hear reports that predatory home refinances were being pushed on buyers regardless of whether they could afford to repay the loans. Those refinances mean fees to bankers.  Foreclosures began to shoot up in Cuyahoga County--5,900 foreclosure filings in 2000, and by 2007, 15,000. My wife and I live in ZIP Code 44105, which includes Slavic Village in Cleveland, In the first half of 2007, that ZIP Code had more foreclosures than any ZIP Code in the United States of  The city of Cleveland went to the Fed and asked it to use its authority to restrain subprime lending. The Fed did nothing. The people in charge in Washington were too certain, too detached, and perhaps too comfortable to listen to the warnings from Ohioans and from people across the country.  We saw what happened. All of these people who had the hubris to say that the economy could keep growing and keep growing and keep growing while the middle class was being looted--those people, thank you very much, weathered the crisis just fine. No one with a cable show had their home foreclosed on. Nobody on Wall Street who tanked the economy went to jail. In fact, many of these same people now have fancy jobs in fancy buildings and dress in fancy clothes and have fancy titles and work on Wall Street and in the White But in ZIP Codes like 44105, in Slavic Village and Cleveland, OH, and places like it across the country, parents were sitting down at kitchen tables to have painful conversations with their children.  Think about what this means. You lose your job, or you can't keep up with your mortgage payment. The husband, the wife, two teenage children. You have a family pet, a dog. You realize you are falling further and further behind. You are still working and you are still trying, but things aren't going well. The first thing you do--your dog has to go to the vet. You can't pay for that. You simply don't have the money. You take the dog to the shelter. You do what a lot of families in Cleveland unfortunately do; you just try to give your dog away or do something.  You then face your children. You say to your children: We are going to lose our home. We are going to have to move. We don't know where we are going to move yet. We don't know which school district. We don't know where your friends will be because we are going to have to move.  I don't think people around here really think much about what foreclosures mean to families. Remember what I said--5,900 foreclosures in Cuyahoga County in 2000 and 15,000 by 2007. Hundreds of those were in ZIP Code 44105. Think what that does to those families. My colleagues, when we vote today and tomorrow and Thursday on whether we are going to pass this giveaway bill to Wall Street, just think about that.  The CEOs and the boards at the banks and people in Washington who are supposed to be watching failed these That is why Congress, including some Republicans, did something about it 10 years ago, something to stop this from ever happening again. We passed a law. We created important protections for the financial system, for taxpayers, for homeowners. We held banks and watchdogs accountable to prevent another crisis.  Fundamentally, we did it right a decade ago, but Wall Street never gives up that easily. They didn't like that bill. They opposed that bill--most of them. Big bank lobbyists, the same ones who were so sure the 2000s crisis wasn't going to happen, those who flippantly said that things are all right--remember what Hank Paulson said. Hank Paulson, the Bush Secretary of the Treasury, said: You know, the stock market goes up and down every day more than the entire value of subprime mortgages in the country. Well, Hank Paulson didn't pay much of a price.[[Page S1351]]None of the regulators paid much of a price.  Ten years ago, we did it right. As I said, the big banks never gave up. Big bank lobbyists went to work.  Get this: The day the President signed the Dodd-Frank bill implementing these safety rules and regulations--implementing the consumer protections, making sure that the government was actually on the side of consumers and people paying their mortgage and homeowners--the same day President Obama put his ``Barack Obama'' signature on the Dodd-Frank law, the top financial services lobbyists in Washington said: Now it is half time. In other words, we may have lost the first half. They passed this bill. We didn't want it, but don't worry about us in the second half.  To these people, the economy is a game. They can't tell the difference between putting millions of Americans' lives and homes and savings at risk and a game of pickup basketball.  Piece by piece, Wall Street has gone to the agencies, they have gone to the courts, they have gone to Congress to dismantle the consumer protections we put in place. The drumbeat is constant. It is ongoing. It has been happening for 10 years. They always want a new exemption, they always want a weaker standard, they always want a new tax break, and do you know what? They can always find a whole lot of Senators and House Members who will write a letter to the Federal Reserve, who will make a call to the Office of Consumer Counsel, who will go at it and will attack in public the Consumer They can always find Members in this body who are fueled by lots of Wall Street contributions and a lot of allies in New They can always find people to do their bidding. That is why you see this drum. That is how you hear this drumbeat. They want a new exemption, a new weaker standard, a new tax break.  The last year has been a really good time to be a bank lobbyist. After the crisis, we had created the Consumer Protection Bureau to represent the interests of regular Americans who have to fight with their bank or their credit card company. Now, in this administration, the Consumer Bureau, unbelievably so, is run by a guy who believes--publicly said it--it shouldn't even exist. The Consumer Bureau's new protections are under attack.  One quick story. All Democrats, even some Republicans, agreed we should protect consumers' right to take their bank to court. What is more American than that; if you think your bank cheated you, that you should be able to go to court.  Bank lobbyists, with a lot of allies on this side of the aisle, convinced the Vice President of the United States to come to this very Senate Chamber late at night--late at night here, at 9 or 10, the public is not watching, but you can be damned sure the special interests are alive and well and watching in their offices and making calls and doing all that.  The Vice President of the United States came to this Senate Chamber to break a tie, to cast a tie-breaking vote to vote against hard-working American families. Instead of protecting these families, the Vice President and his allies in the Senate--they voted for Wells Fargo, they voted for Equifax, they voted for The rule is gone. That rule to ensure that consumers have their day in court if their bank cheated them, that rule is gone, piece by piece by piece.  The watchdogs who are supposed to be protecting Main Street all come to their jobs fresh from--surprise--Wall Street and K The President's Cabinet looks like an executive retreat for Wall Street bankers. They have released blueprint after blueprint on how to dismantle all the rules put in place after the crisis, and they are putting their people in place to do it. They just rammed through Congress a bill to give Wall Street an enormous tax break that will cost American families $1.5 trillion, but it gives big bank CEO's a huge raise.  That is 10,000 times more than what we spend at HUD every year to protect kids from toxic levels. Back to ZIP Code 44105, the health department of the city of Cleveland told me almost all those homes built before World War II, 99 percent of them have levels of toxic lead that will make children sick--99 percent of those homes. Yet we can do this big tax cut and not take care of those families.  Not long ago, another bank lobbyist told us their plan: We don't want a seat at the table, he said, we want the whole table--and they are about to get it under the bill the Senate will consider this week. Piece by piece, they tear these protections down. This bill gives them the whole table. It leaves nothing for working families.  If you thought the Secretary of HUD's $31,000 he spent to buy that fancy table for his dining room--31,000 taxpayer dollars--if you thought that was a bad deal for taxpayers, wait until I tell you about the billions and billions of dollars at risk that are packed into this effort.  This bill puts Americans at risk of another bank bailout. The Congressional Budget Office, the independent, nonpartisan scorekeeper, confirmed yesterday that this bill would increase the probability of a big bank failure and a financial crisis. It will add $671 million to the deficit. The Washington Post said: ``Senate banking bill likely to boost chances of bank bailouts.''  It is bad enough we are going to pass--after banks have been so profitable the last decade, after they were bailed out by the public--thank you very much--they have had a really, pretty darned good decade. Then they got a big tax cut. Now they want this and a little cherry on top. First, they get this bill, which is about to pass--which will be really good for bankers--but then they get $671 million extra from taxpayers. So, again, thank you very much, taxpayers, for taking care of the banks. So we are going to weaken the rules, and we will pay Wall Street for the privilege of doing it.  This bill weakens stress tests for all large banks, even Wall Street megabanks that are designated as global, systemically important banks--like JPMorgan Chase, $2.5 trillion in assets. Now, 2.5 trillion is 2,500 billion, and a billion is a thousand million. So $2.5 trillion--that is hard to calculate, but that is a lot of money. So JPMorgan Chase gets a break. They get their $2.5 trillion in assets. Bank of America gets a break. They get $2.3 trillion in assets. Wells Fargo, which can't stay out of trouble--every week there seems to be something new--$1.9 trillion in assets. Citibank, $1.9 trillion in assets. These banks--and the Wall Street Journal, hardly a paper hostile to business or a bank that is really always close to Wall Wall Street Journal headline this morning: ``[Wall Street] Banks Get a Big Win in Senate Rollback Bill.''  So don't let my colleagues--don't let anybody who supports this bill--tell you this is all for the community banks. The community banks get some things in this bill. I would love to support the community banks and make this a bill about community banks, about credit unions, even about the regional banks like the ones in my State that generally do the right thing--Huntington and Fifth Third and But this bill, this is the Wall Street Journal: ``Big Banks Get a Big Win in Senate Rollback Bill.''  This is about those four banks I mentioned: JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, These banks hold 51 percent--more than half--of all industry assets. They are a pretty darned big part of our economy, and we are doing things for them. As they are profitable, as their executives make maybe tens of millions of dollars, as they are doing stock buybacks to make even more millions of dollars, we are doing things for them. We are not dealing with infrastructure, we are not dealing with the opioid crisis, we are doing nothing here about guns, but we have time to do a lot for America's largest banks. With this deregulation, these are banks whose collapse could cause ripples across the world.  Together, the country's biggest banks took $239 billion in taxpayer bailouts. So without the rigorous annual stress test that we put in Dodd-Frank a decade ago and we are relaxing now, taxpayers could, once again, be on the hook if too-big-to-fail banks collapse, and we don't have the right tools in place to see it coming.  This is maybe even more unbelievable than the fact that this body has fallen all over itself to help the biggest banks. This bill also weakens the oversight for foreign megabanks operating in the United States--the same banks that repeatedly violate U.laws. Let's[[Page S1352]]run through the rap sheets of some of these banks.  Deutsche Bank, a big German bank, manipulated the benchmark interest rates used to set mortgages. It is also known as the only large bank in the world that will finance the President's businesses.  Santander, a Spanish bank, illegally repossessed cars from members of the military who were serving our country overseas. So we are going to give a break to a Spanish bank that repossessed the cars of men and women at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and others when they were serving overseas. Santander repossessed their cars, a Spanish bank, and we are going to deregulate and make them more profitable with less accountability.  Barclays, a British bank, manipulated electric energy prices. If you live on the West Coast--I don't; my constituents weren't affected--but a whole lot of people were as they manipulated energy prices.  Credit Suisse and UBS, two Switzerland banks--one of them illegally did business with We have tried to tighten the sanctions on Iran to get Iran to behave better so they don't continue to harass--or worse--Israel and all the threats they make. We are going to help a bank that did business with Iran, and UBS sold toxic mortgage-backed securities.  It didn't have to be this way. I tried for months to work with the chairman of the committee--and I like Senator Crapo a lot. We work together well. I tried for months to work in a commonsense package of reforms aimed at lifting up community banks and credit unions. That is what we ought to do. That is what we could do. That is what we still could do. These are the local financial institutions that fuel home ownership and small businesses. I know a lot of them. They come to see me when they are in I see them in their communities. I see them in Sycamore, Columbus, and Mansfield, and all over the These are not the people who caused the meltdown 10 years ago. These are the ones who got dragged down when big banks crashed the economy. I support relief to those banks and regional banks that do things right and play by the rules. I want to do more to help average Americans who have to cope with unfair tricks and traps, but that is not what this bill does. That is how it started out. That is what Wall Street wants you to think; this is a bill for the community banks.  Don't forget, they said that about the tax cut bill: It is a tax cut for the middle class. Well, 81 percent of the benefits of the tax cut go to the richest 1 percent. So don't always believe what they say when they talk about this.  This was a false choice. Why should we have to roll back rules for the largest banks in Switzerland to help out community banks or credit unions in Ohio? Of course we shouldn't. It has been a false choice. We could pass a bill today that helps those local banks invest more in their communities while keeping in place strict rules for Wall Street megabanks, but Wall Street and Republicans don't want to do that. They want to use the little guys, the community banks we all want to help. They want to use the little guys to extract something for the big guys. It is the oldest trick in the book around here.  We are going to cut taxes for the middle class. Well, really we are kind of hoping we can give big tax breaks to the richest 1 percent. We are going to help the community banks, but really we are hoping--we know we are going to help Wall  This city, Washington, this government, this Senate, this Senate Banking Committee are all suffering from collective amnesia. They just forgot what happened 10 years ago. Maybe it is convenient they don't want to remember what happened. Thankfully, the IMF, the International Monetary Fund--an agency of international financial experts--has done us a favor, to help jog memories. They have cataloged 300 years of history of bank deregulation efforts all across the globe. Do you know what they found? We deregulate, the economy explodes. We put in protections, the economy gets better. We deregulate again, the economy explodes. We put in protections, the economy gets better. We deregulate again--wash, rinse, repeat.  We can do better. We owe it to the people we serve to do better. The Senate owes it to 176,000 kids in Ohio and other kids across the country whose lives and education were disrupted by the foreclosure crisis. Think how many children lived in homes when their parents were foreclosed on or their parents were evicted, and everything in their lives turned upside down. We don't care about them. We are going to forget about them, this collective amnesia. We are going to forget about them because we want to help the big banks get bigger and bigger and bigger. Is that what we are going to do? We owe it to the millions of people whose retirements were wiped out. Millions of Americans lost big chunks of their retirement, but we bailed out the big banks at the same time. We owe it to the students who graduated in the great recession and may have low earnings for the rest of their lives.  The watchdogs who understand these markets are trying to warn us. Paul Volcker, former Chair of the Federal Reserve, has cautioned us about this bill. He was the Fed Chair for a Democrat and a Republican Sheila Bair, who helped us put protections in place after the crisis, is a Republican warning us about this bill. Tom Hoenig, the current Vice Chair at the FDIC, selected to that position by Republicans, has told us this bill is harmful. Barney Frank, as in Dodd-Frank, has said he would vote no if he were here. Former member of the Federal Reserve Dan Tarullo, who used to do the bank regulation with the Federal Reserve, has outlined a long series of concerns. Sarah Bloom Raskin, Antonio Weiss, Gary Gensler, law professors, fair housing advocates, big bank experts, people who provide legal services across this country who deal with foreclosures and civil rights groups are telling us we can't go down that path again.  We know what happens next. It is hubris to think we can gut the rules on these banks again but avoid the next crisis. If you strip the rules away from the big banks and you turn your back as regulators on misfeasance and malfeasance, that collective amnesia--we are going to pay for it, and we know we are.  There are so many important things we should be doing here instead. We should be addressing the fact--and the Presiding Officer and I have been working on this bill--that workers and retirees in Ohio and across the country might have their pensions they have spent a lifetime earning slashed in half if Congress doesn't act. We can be doing that. We could be addressing the fact that 400,000 Ohioans pay more than half their income each month on rent to keep a roof over their head. We could be creating jobs. We could be attacking the opioid epidemic. We could be fighting against high drug prices. We could be investing in our crumbling roads and bridges. Instead, guess what. We are here helping the big banks. Everybody is willing to work full time to help Wall  It is a question of whose side are we on? Are we on the side of megabank lobbyists or are we on the side of American taxpayers and homeowners and students and workers?  I yield the floor.

1408,topic-id,1167,"Mr.President, I first wish to thank Senator Whitehouse, one of my best friends in the Senate.[[Page S1673]]We came to the Senate on the same day. He will go down in history as the best advocate in this body or perhaps the greatest moralist of our time combatting climate change. He has educated Members of the Senate--some more resistant than others.  He has taken to the floor over and over. He has continued to make sure that people listen to something important, and we all appreciate that leadership.  Climate change affects Ohio jobs that rely on Lake The Great Lakes are vital to our industrial heartland, as the Rockies are to the West, as the Atlantic coastline is to New England, as the Gulf of Mexico is to the Presiding Officer's own State of In fact, 84 percent of America's freshwater is in the five Great Only polar icecaps contain more freshwater than do the Great  Lake Erie is one of the biggest lakes in the world. It is also the shallowest of the lakes. This is an amazing statistic. Lake Erie is the shallowest and among the smallest of the Great Lakes in surface area. Lake Erie contains 2 percent of all the water in the Great Lakes, yet it contains 50 percent of the fish in the Great Lakes because it is warmer and shallower and conducive to aquatic life and fish life.  Its shallowness makes it particularly vulnerable to storm water runoff and the algae blooms that it causes. The Maumee River runs through The Maumee River Basin is the largest drainage basin of any of the Great Lakes, and the largest river that empties into the Great Lakes is the  Climate change makes these algae blooms off the coast of Toledo in the western base of Lake Climate change makes those blooms worse. It contaminates our lakes, and it threatens the Ohio businesses and communities that rely on Lake Three summers ago, we had to get bottled drinking water to the citizens of Toledo and the surrounding areas of Northwest Ohio because the water was not potable at that time.  According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, we know that one effect of climate change in the Great Lakes region has been a 37-percent increase in the gully washers--the heavy rain events that contribute to algae blooms.  I talked to farmers who have been farming in the Western Lake Erie Basin for decades. Just a few weeks ago I did a roundtable in that part of the My staff member Jonathan McCracken has done a number of roundtables before. Since talking to these farmers, they tell us they are experiencing heavier rain events more often and with greater intensity compared to even 15 years ago, let alone in the lifespan of many of these farmers.  Hotter summers and shorter winters make this worse. The effects of algae blooms have a profound effect on the ecosystem. That is why this matters. Protecting our lakes is one of the biggest environmental challenges facing the entire It is the biggest challenge facing  We have made some progress over the last 8 years, thanks in large part to the Great Lakes Restoration The GLRI is working. Everybody knows it does. Nobody claims it doesn't.  I remember how polluted Lake Erie was when I was growing up. I grew up an hour or hour and a half from there. My family, a week or two in the summer, would drive north to Gem I remember the dead fish. I remember the smell of the lake. I remember that this lake was in big, big trouble.  We have made progress cleaning up its tributaries. We increased access to the lake. We approved habitats for fish and wildlife. It has been a bipartisan success story, and it took the Federal Government to do it. The city of Cleveland couldn't do it, nor the city of Lorraine, the city of Sandusky, the city of Port Clinton, the city of They couldn't clean up the lake. The State of Ohio didn't have the ability and the resources to clean this lake up. It took the Federal Government and the U.EPA to have the strength and the dollars and the mission to clean up this lake. That is why it has been a bipartisan success story all over our country.  We need to make sure that GLRI has the funding it needs to keep up its work and not eliminate it, as the President again proposed in his budget. Taking a hatchet to GLRI would cost Ohio jobs, and it would jeopardize public health by putting our drinking water at risk.  If you are over 50 years old, you remember what that lake looked like. You remember what that lake smelled like. You remember how people didn't swim there, how people's drinking water was threatened. You remember that before EPA, before there was this bipartisan commitment to clean up one of the greatest of the Great You remember that.  Obviously, this President doesn't know this. This President won his election based on winning these Great Lakes States, and he has abandoned these States by drastically cutting funding for the Great Lakes Restoration  Those of us along the Great Lakes didn't stand for a budget that eliminated GLRI last year. Nothing has changed this year. Ohioans on both sides of the aisle will go to the mat for our lake.  I am working with Senator Portman--I am a Democrat; he is a Republican--and my Ohio colleagues from both parties to protect it. Budget cuts are terrible for this; climate change will only make it worse.  When I was young, people wrote off Lake Erie as a polluted, dying lake. As I said, I remember seeing it. I remember smelling it. I remember hearing people talk about it. Many, many people thought that there wasn't much future for this Great Lake, that it would be impossible to clean up.  People in the past have had a habit of not just writing off Lake Erie but also writing off my We have proved them wrong time and again. We proved them wrong back then, we proved them wrong today, and we will prove them wrong in the future.  Our lake is improving. It is supporting an entire industry. It supports the jobs it creates. It is providing drinking water and recreation and so much more to communities across our State, and we can't allow climate change to ruin that progress. We cannot write off Lake We cannot write off the millions of Ohioans and people from Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New York, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Minnesota who depend on these five Great  I see it up close.

1575,topic-id,864,"Mr.President, I would like to have been here today to offer strong bipartisan support for a bill that would help with rules and regulations for the smallest banks and credit unions in the country. There is a real effort on the part of a lot of us to come to an agreement particularly aimed at those banks, the community banks and the regional banks. I have three. Senator Portman's and my State is the only State in the country that has three regional banks, the banks that have $50 billion, $100 billion, $150 billion--Huntington, KeyCorp, and Fifth  Unfortunately, this bill started off that way, but it has become something else, and the something else is that this bill seems to me and many others to be more concerned with the largest banks and Wall Street than it does with community banks.  There are lots of things that can come out of this bill. The bill gives regulators way too much flexibility--regulators such as Mulvaney, Otting, Quarles, and others. It vests more power in FSOC--something that the Republicans didn't want to do until they got regulators like Mnuchin, Mulvaney, and people like that who are much more likely to side with Wall The White House is increasingly looking like a retreat for Wall Street executives, and these are the people who are going to be doing the regulation of this bill.  Republicans and Democrats alike who believe in the need for regulation are concerned about this bill or are opposed to this bill, people like Dan Tarullo, who used to be a member of the Board of Governors at the Federal Reserve in charge of regulation; Paul Volcker, a Federal Reserve Chair who was selected by a Republican and a Democratic President; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Gary Gensler; Tom Hoenig, a Republican; Sheila Bair, President Bush's nominee at the FDIC; Phil Angelides, who did a good analysis of what actually happened 10 years ago when Wall Street almost collapsed our economy.  This body seems to have experienced sort of a collective amnesia. Take a look at what happened to the economy 10 years ago, and today we are giving relief to many of the largest banks in this country, relief that these things on the stress test--a weaker stress test, a less regular stress test, will mean many of the larger banks simply will not be under the intense examination that we have done in the past. What does that mean? What that means is those banks are more likely to jeopardize the safety and soundness of the banking system. Again, we know what happened 10 years ago when we had to bail them out.  There is a Washington Post article that came out today. The headline is ``Senate banking bill likely to boost chances of bank bailouts, CBO says.'' The CBO says that the Senate banking bill is likely to boost chances of bank bailouts. Why would we do that when banks are doing very well? Banks of all sizes are very profitable these days. We just did a tax bill that gives the largest banks--the financial services industry overall but especially the Wall Street banks--huge tax breaks. So we are going to pass a bill that the Congressional Budget Office--a neutral scorer here, the referee--the Congressional Budget Office says that this will cost taxpayers $671 million, and it will increase the chances of a bailout. Why would we pass a bill to give the banks breaks and then give them $671 million of taxpayer dollars? I just don't understand why we as a Senate would want to do such a thing.  Nobody in Ohio, except for some bank executives, are clamoring for this bill. Nobody is saying: Oh, we have to deregulate the banks. We have to help the biggest banks. We have to help these banks that drove us into the ditch 10 years ago. It simply doesn't make sense.  I ask for a ``no'' vote on the motion to proceed.

1661,topic-id,2887,"Mr.President, when you went to a local bank in Mansfield, OH, to buy a house 30, 40, or 50 years ago, you knew the lender, and the lender knew you. You saw him or her at the grocery store. Maybe they went to your church or synagogue. Your kids probably went to the same school. You knew that your deposits at the bank helped fund your neighbor's house or the hardware store down the street. A lot of banks and credit unions don't work this way.  The 2008 crisis taught us that finance has changed. Now a mortgage in Zanesville, OH, is diced and sliced and sold to an investor in Zurich, Banks in Frankfurt place bets on loans in  When the system went bust a decade ago and predatory loans began to fail, Ohio taxpayers picked up the tab, including for foreign banks headquartered an ocean away. The Federal Reserve opened up a spigot of cheap money to keep the global economy from tanking. Banks in Spain, France, Japan, Canada, and Korea all came to the United States for help to weather the financial storm.  Think about this. An analysis of the Fed's lending from February 2008 to 2009 showed that the vast majority of loans went to foreign banks. After the crisis, records released to the public showed that foreign banks took more than 70 percent of the Fed's loans during the crisis and 65 percent of loans from other emergency programs.  Under one bailout scheme, British Barclays alone borrowed $232 billion from the Fed at a sweetheart interest rate--the kind of rate a hardware store in Hillsboro, OH, could never get on a loan to keep them afloat back in 2008. Think about that. British Barclays got a sweetheart deal, a better deal than a hardware store in Ohio could get from a bank.  After the crisis, Congress responded with a law, the Wall Street reform act, to ensure that taxpayers would never again have to send bailout money to British and Swiss megabanks. We ordered the Fed to keep a closer eye on the big banks--to use their power to make sure the largest global banks did not again crash the economy.  Congress instructed that the Fed apply the strictest protections to the biggest banks--those with more than $50 billion in assets. We know that.  When the Fed implemented these rules, they applied some standards to banks that have more than $50 billion across the globe, but for global banks that have more than $50 billion in the United States, the Fed applied the strongest standards. For foreign banks with not only trillions worldwide but systemic operations in the United States, the Fed wrote rules that are as strict as those for our domestic megabanks, standards that former Fed Governor Dan Tarullo called ``special prudential measures.'' They are standards that ensure that we only import Swiss chocolate, not Swiss bank failures. These special measures are important.  Last year, the Office of Financial Research released a report showing that foreign banks in the United States are riskier than similarly sized U.regional banks. Hear that again. Foreign banks in the United States are riskier than similarly sized U.regional banks. Think of that in terms of what this bill that we just voted cloture on actually does.  This legislation threatens to undo important rules protecting us from risk. The legislation puts taxpayers on the hook for bailouts. That is what the Congressional Budget Office said.  Under this bill, foreign banks that took billions in bailouts would be able to take more risk under a less watchful eye. Who are some of them? Deutsche Bank, Santander, and UBS would all be treated more like they were an Ohio regional bank. Deutsche Bank, the Trump family's personal business bank; Santander, the bank in Spain that repossessed the cars of hundreds of service men and women cars while those service men and women were serving our country overseas; UBS, the Swiss bank that illegally financed Iranian activities--they would all be treated more like they were Huntington in Columbus, or Fifth Third in Cincinnati, or KeyBank in What is right about that? What is fair about that? What is smart about that?  Don't take my word for it. Secretary Mnuchin sat right in front of the Banking Committee; Senator Crapo, the chairman, and I, as the ranking member, looked straight at him just a few weeks ago. He confirmed that this bill would treat foreign banks with up to $250 billion in assets the same as U.regional banks. So they are up to $250 billion, just like Huntington, just like KeyCorp, just like Fifth Third in Secretary Mnuchin said: We are going to treat those foreign banks the same if they are up to $250 billion in assets. That may be the first direct answer I have ever heard from Secretary I sit on the Finance Committee and the Banking Committee, and he has trouble giving direct answers. He did at least that time.  It makes sense because he was just confirming his intention. From what he and the Treasury Department wrote in a report last year, that is precisely what this administration wants to do. That is what they said in this report that we should do--deregulate these foreign banks that have assets under $250 billion in the United They wrote it into their banking deregulation blueprint back in  I give credit to Secretary Mnuchin, and I give credit to the Trump administration. While I don't give them credit for the White House looking like a retreat for Wall Street executives, I do give them credit for at least finally owning up in that report, in the legislation, and in his answer to my question in the Banking Committee hearing that, yes, they are going to deregulate these foreign, huge megabanks--Deutsche, Santander, UBS, and Barclays--as long as they have under $250 billion of assets in the United States, and they do.  Paul Volcker, former Chairman of the Fed, is worried, as I am, that this bill deregulates the U.operations of foreign banks. Sarah Bloom Raskin, former Fed Governor and Deputy Treasury Secretary, said this bill ``removes necessary guardrails that were installed to reduce the chances of foreign megabanks drawing on U.bailout funds.''[[Page S1625]]  I have watched the Presiding Officer--the junior Senator from Oklahoma--serve with integrity and honesty. I don't think you, any of my colleagues on this side of the aisle, or anybody else wants to face the voters 5 years from now, 10 years from now if what we voted on today and will vote on this week results in our bailing out foreign banks. Americans were angry that we bailed out the big U.megabanks. Imagine the anger if the story is focused more precisely on the fact that we bailed out foreign banks--which we actually did--but the story was more about Wall Imagine if that were the story.  Former Treasury officials Michael Barr and Antonio Weiss are worried that this bill is rolling back rules that protect the U.economy from foreign bank risk. The former CFTC Chairman, Gary Gensler, thinks we need to amend this bill to make sure that foreign banks don't get a windfall. These are across-the-board regulators, present, past, Republicans, That is quite a list of watchdogs, but what is most interesting: Do you know who else is under the impression this bill helps foreign banks? Foreign bank lobbyists.  I offered an amendment during the committee markup to close the loophole. I am offering it again on the Senate floor if Republican leadership allows amendments on the Senate floor. My amendment would have ensured that foreign megabanks in the United States are watched over just as closely as Wall Street banks. They are roughly the same size; some are bigger, but because their assets are smaller in the United States, we are going to treat them like Huntington and Key and Fifth Third rather than treating them like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America and Wells  Foreign bank lobbyists--they are American citizens. They are lobbyists for foreign banks; they are not foreign lobbyists, a difference. These lobbyists for foreign banks, representing Deutsche and UBS--most of them--wrote a letter opposing my amendment, saying it was unfair for me to try to keep these rules in place. They said their banks should be treated like U.regional banks, not like the global giants they are. That amendment was defeated in the committee; we will leave it at that.  Now, why is that such a problem? Let's look at the rap sheet on some of these foreign banks. Santander, a Spanish bank, failed a stress test 3 years in a row. It would have its rules rolled back under this bill. Stress tests are exercises, as my colleagues know, to ensure that a bank can survive an economic downturn without a bailout. So this Spanish bank, Santander, failed not once, not twice but three times. What that failure means--most people, if they fail three times, they flunk out. If they fail three times, they get in this bill, and they get a potential bailout. What is smart about that? What is honorable about that? What is good economic policy about that? What is fair about that? What is just about that?  In addition to failing its stress test, it is a bank that illegally repossessed cars from 1,100 American service men and women while they were serving our country. I spend a lot of time at the Wright Patterson Air Force Base, the largest employer in I see all kinds of financial institutions that prey on those young airmen and their families. Airmen and women, young Americans serving in the Air Force--particularly when they are 18, 19, 20, 21 years old--are more financially vulnerable. They are a little less sophisticated than somebody 10 years older. They don't make much money. Their families are always anxious when their husband or wife or mother or father serve overseas. This Spanish bank repossessed the cars of 1,100 American service men and women while they were serving our country. We are going to give them a break?  This is a bank that overcharged racial and ethnic minorities for car loans. It is a bank that violated a Federal order to keep more capital and instead improperly paid out money to its shareholders, and we are going to give them a break? I don't pretend to understand the thinking of that.  This bill helps Deutsche Bank, which the IMF called ``the most important net contributor to systemic risks'' of all worldwide banks. Deutsche Bank, a German bank, one of the biggest banks in the world, the International Monetary Fund called it ``the most important net contributor to systemic risks'' of all worldwide banks.  Deutsche Bank is the only bank that would lend to the Trump family economic empire. Even after all of its failed business deals, they kept lending, for whatever reason, to businessman Trump and the family. This is a bank that every week is met with a new request for information on shady financial arrangements with people in the White  I don't think my colleagues and I were sent here to serve Deutsche I am thinking none of us goes back in our campaigns--I am on the ballot this year. I am not going to go back and say: Please reelect me so I can help Deutsche Bank, so I can bail them out, so I can pass a bill that will actually give them something they don't deserve.  This bill would also help banks like Barclays and UBS and BNP Paribas--banks that have rigged interest rates, helped people avoid paying taxes, violated U.sanctions against Iran and Sudan, and manipulated energy markets. These aren't banks down the street lending to homeowners in Sandusky or businesses in Findlay or small companies in my hometown of Mansfield; these are some of the most complex global banks. They hold $1.4 trillion in assets. That is $1,400 billion--$1.4 trillion--in assets in the United States and more than $14 trillion in assets abroad.  Listen to Paul Volker, listen to Sarah Bloom Raskin, listen to Gary Gensler, listen to Michael Barr and Antonio Believe Secretary Mnuchin when he tells you what he wants to do. Believe the lobbyists for these foreign banks when they say that is what they want. That is why they oppose this amendment. This bill gives them exactly what they want.  Let me talk about one change made to the substitute amendment. Because I have come to this floor and some others have joined me in objecting to this foreign bank provision, the leadership--Senator McConnell and his office, I assume, down the way--I assume they huddled and thought: We have to answer this somehow; we have to at least look like we care about prohibiting a bailout of foreign banks. So they made a change in the substitute. The new version of the bill came out last week. There is a new provision that provides some window dressing. It is a figleaf protection to try to convince the public that this bill doesn't do what it actually does. It doesn't actually help Santander; it doesn't actually help UBS; it doesn't actually help Barclays; it doesn't actually help the President's bank, Deutsche Bank--but it actually does. The provision provides some vague, ambiguous language and puts the question to the Fed: You can regulate the foreign banks or not; it is your choice. It doesn't require the Fed to deregulate. It doesn't stop the foreign banks from suing if the Fed doesn't obey their requests.  Why not just prohibit? Why not just say: No, we are not going to do it. But they don't want to do that. They want to keep that door open because they know the regulators on FSOC, whether it is the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Jay Clayton, whether it is Mr.Otting of the SEC, whether it is Secretary Mnuchin, or whomever they put at any of these, we know what they are going to do. They have already said what they are growing to do.  Even a writer at the Wall Street Journal agrees, saying it will be up to the Fed to decide whether Deutsche Bank ``deserves a tighter leash.''  So we are expected--we, in a pretty much party-line vote, because most Democrats think you don't want Wall Street people in these positions regulating the banks, in a party-line vote, Randal Quarles was confirmed. His job is to be the Director of Supervision at the Federal So we are expected to trust Randal Quarles not to weaken the rules in the foreign banks--to trust Quarles, even though he himself missed the last crisis. He predicted as late as, I believe, 2007, as a member of the Bush administration, that the economy was great, the banks weren't under duress, any of that. It might have been 2006, but I think 2007. He missed the last crisis and, I might add, he personally profited from Wall Street malfeasance. I am not saying he did it on purpose, but he personally profited because of Wall Street malfeasance.[[Page S1626]]  We are supposed to trust Quarles, even though just last week he spoke at an international bankers conference, where a lot of those foreign bank representatives and lobbyists were in attendance, including CEOs and other executives, and he promised those bankers regulatory relief.  So we have the head of supervision at the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States--one of the most powerful people in this country--speaking to an international bankers group saying: Yes, we are going to give you regulatory relief. Aren't you lucky you came to this conference because I am in charge of these issues at the Federal Reserve, and I am going to help you get regulatory relief as a foreign bank.  Finally, this last point is technical, but it is important. The bills make sure that a globally systemic U.bank will not benefit from any deregulation, even if it has fewer than $250 billion in assets, but the bill doesn't even do the same for foreign banks.  Let me repeat. State Street has fewer than $250 billion in assets. State Street is called a custodial bank, located in Boston, as the Presiding Officer knows. It has fewer than $250 billion in assets. The bill says, because that bank is systemically significant, it doesn't get a free pass. This legislation says that about State Street, but it doesn't say the same for similarly--or, I would argue, way more--risky foreign banks in the United  My amendment would close that loophole. It treats systemically risky foreign banks like systemically risky U.banks. Why? Because why treat Barclays and Santander and UBS and Deutsche Bank better than we treat Huntington or Fifth Third or Key or Regents in Alabama or any of these regional banks--many of which we want to help. If we want to help community banks and credit unions and our regional banks to do the right thing, let's help them. Foreign megabanks shouldn't get another chance of a handout from American taxpayers--never.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

1900,topic-id,3813,"Thank you, Mr. The legislation we are considering today has been portrayed as modest, not that big of a deal, that it doesn't matter that much, that it is something narrow to help community banks and credit unions and regional lenders like the three institutions in my State--Huntington, Key, and Fifth Third--all pretty much things I support. Unfortunately, that is really not the only thing this bill does.  I tried for months to work with Chairman Crapo, whom I respect and admire--and I mean that. People say those things on the floor, but I actually mean that. I tried for months to work with Chairman Crapo on a commonsense package of reforms aimed at community banks and credit unions and small and midsized financial institutions. We had a lot of agreement on that. Then the creep began. Then the expansion began. Then leaking into this process were all kinds of help for all kinds of bigger banks.  These are the local lenders that we want to help to fuel home ownership and small business in our community. I get that. These are the community banks in Lakeview, Cleveland, Milford, Parma, and West Chester, the banks that we lost when the big banks crashed the economy a decade ago.  I know people in this institution--especially those who get lots of money from Wall Street--like to blame Dodd-Frank for so many community banks going out of business, but it was really what led up to the crash, including the crash, that caused so many community banks to go out of business.  Here is how this place works. I think most Senators understand this. If they don't understand it, they don't want to understand it. When the big banks and when Wall Street and the lobbyists--and there are hundreds of them for big banks in this town--when the big banks spot some legislation crawling through this body, when they see a bill in front of the Senate or the House that might help some small institutions, do you know what they do? They see an opportunity. They see an opportunity to grab more for themselves. It is the history of this country. We know what happens whenever Congress listens to Wall Street and listens to the big banks and Wall Street and the big banks get their way. Inevitably, the economy stumbles or, worse, crashes because we have given too much to the big banks. They put too much risk on the system, and in places like my ZIP Code in Cleveland, OH--ZIP Code 44105--my ZIP Code in 2007 had more foreclosures than any ZIP Code in the[[Page S1425]]United States of That is not because people in my ZIP Code have anything about them that they deserved this; that is just what happens in an economy when the big banks get too powerful, when Wall Street runs Congress, and we see what happens.  Now we see Wall Street moving in, trying to grab more for themselves despite the fact that some of these big banks wouldn't exist today without taxpayer bailouts of a decade ago. We remember what happened. This body bailed out the biggest Wall Street banks, which didn't deserve it, to be sure. But we didn't bail out the big banks--at least most of us didn't--to help the big banks, we bailed out the big banks to help Main Street, to help the economy.  So these Wall Street lobbyists have swarmed into this institution to grab more for themselves despite the fact that they wouldn't exist today without taxpayer bailouts, despite the fact that Wall Street banks are now making record profits, and despite the fact that the tax cut this body just jammed through Congress--81 percent of the recent tax cuts from the end of last year, 81 percent of that bill over time will go to the richest 1 percent of the people in this country.  You have taxpayers bailing out the big banks, then you have this huge tax cut go to the big banks, and now they want more. They want this legislation that will weaken rules and make the big banks even more profitable. They always want more. Understand, it is American history. It is what we have seen in the last 10 years. It is what we have seen since the Great Depression seven decades ago. The big banks always want more, and it is always at the expense of everyone else. This legislation gives them exactly what they want.  Listen to this. Not long ago, a bank lobbyist--one of the top bank lobbyists working for the American Bankers Association--said: We don't want a seat at the table, we want the whole table. They are about to get it under this bill--the whole table.  This bill weakens stress tests for the 38 biggest banks in the country, including Wells Fargo, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, HSBC, You know these banks. These banks in the aggregate are almost half of the assets of banks in our country--banks that together took $239 billion in taxpayer bailouts. Now, $239 billion--that is 239 thousand million dollars. That is a whole lot of money.  Stress tests are the best tool we have to make sure another bailout never happens again. This bill weakens these tests. It changes the requirement from present law--semi-annual stress tests. So instead of having these tests twice a year, they are now going to be periodic. What does periodic mean? Well, we don't know. The bill doesn't define it. Former Fed Governor Dan Tarullo, the architect of many of these post-crisis reforms, has called this provision ``quite vague, with little indication of what kind of test is contemplated for these banks.''  We also know something else. When Congress writes vague laws using words like ``periodic''--vague, versus specific--``semi-annual''--when Congress writes vague laws, bank lawyers, who are really good, very smart, and very well paid, can drive a truck right through those loopholes. We know that.  Do we really want to give the current crowd in charge more leeway--a White House that looks like a retreat for Wall Street executives? We are talking about an administration stocked with former bank executives. Are these really the people we want to give the opportunity--are these the people we want to trust to interpret vague words like ``periodic''?  This legislation weakens oversight of foreign banks operating in the United States, many of which have a track record of breaking U.laws. Think about that. We are not only deregulating a number of these large banks in this country, we have singled out that we are going to give a break to foreign banks.  Let me talk about the rap sheet of some of these foreign banks. Santander, a Spanish bank, illegally repossessed cars from members of the military who were serving our country overseas. Think about that. We have somebody from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base who is serving overseas. Santander repossessed her car or his car when he or she was serving overseas. Yet we are going to give a break to that Spanish bank?  Deutsche Bank, the President's favorite--President Trump, the businessman Trump's favorite bank--Deutsche Bank manipulated the benchmark interest rates used to set borrowers' mortgages. So we are going to give Deutsche Bank a break? We are going to deregulate part of Deutsche Bank?  Barclays, a British bank, manipulated electric energy prices in Western U.markets. My constituents don't live in those areas that were hurt by that, but a whole lot of people do in this country.  Credit Suisse, a Swiss bank, illegally did business with I know what the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Arkansas, thinks about Yet we are going to vote--he is going to vote--all of us are going to vote for a bill that rewards a Swiss bank that illegally did business with Iran? Is that the message we want to send? I guess it is.  UBS, another Swiss bank, sold toxic mortgage-backed securities. It goes on and on and on. We are rewarding these foreign banks that have defrauded our constituents and our government and clearly don't have much regard for U.law, and we are going to give them breaks.  Again, we have heard from Governor Tarullo, we have heard from former Fed Chair Volcker, we have heard from former Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Sarah Bloom Raskin on this. They don't want to loosen foreign bank oversight, and they are joined by Republican former regulators, like Sheila Bair, Tom Hoenig, and others, who think this bill doesn't make sense.  The bill also requires the Fed to further weaken the rules just for the dozen or so banks with $250 billion in assets. It subverts the Fed's independence; it subjects the Fed to pressure from FSOC and the Treasury Secretary--the same Treasury Secretary who foreclosed on 40,000 Americans at We are giving more power to help the banks to a Treasury Secretary who, before he became Treasury Secretary, played a major role in foreclosing 40,000 homes, including hundreds of homes in my State of It opens the door for more lawsuits when banks try to avoid the rules they don't like.  The former Commodities Futures Trading Commission Chair, Gary Gensler, wrote to the Senate last week that this change ``may subject the government to additional lobbying and possible litigation from individual banks seeking specially tailored rules.''  Back about 10 years ago, when President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank law, that same day, the top financial service lobbyists in this town--the day Obama signed the bill, the day the President signed Dodd-Frank, the head of the top financial services lobbyists in this town said: Well, folks, now it is halftime.  What did he mean? He meant, OK, we lost the first half, but we are going to go to work to do everything we can to block and misinterpret and reinterpret and eventually scale back and repeal as much of this law as we can. They went to work on the agencies. This is the culmination of their efforts. They now have a pro-Wall Street majority in the Senate, a pro-Wall Street majority in the House, a President whose office looks as if it is a retreat for Wall Street executives, and they are ready to go to help Wall Street, even though--I don't know when; maybe the Senator from Massachusetts knows--1 year, 2 years, 5 years, 10 years, 20 years from now, it makes a bailout more likely.  In fact, the Congressional Budget Office recently said that this bill will make a bailout more likely and that it is a $672 million giveaway to Wall  This bill makes another change to big bank rules that now stops them from borrowing more money than they can afford. The New York Times described this provision as weakening rules ``aimed at keeping banks from being able to take big risks without properly preparing for a disaster.'' Just let that sink in, because Ohio families know how bad a disaster can be; ``aimed at keeping banks from being able to take big risks without properly preparing for a disaster,'' isn't that what we want?[[Page S1426]]  Don't we want bank regulators, don't we want bank rules to stop the big banks from taking risks that could end up in a disaster? As I said, my neighborhood knows what disaster is. As I said, in 2007, there were more foreclosures in my ZIP Code in the first half of that year than in any other ZIP Code in  Families in my State were hurt by this. People lost retirement accounts, people lost their homes, people lost their jobs, plants closed--all of that.  Wall Street lobbyists came out of that last disaster just fine. I am thinking that probably none of them had their houses foreclosed on. I know that nobody who tanked the economy went to jail. So folks in New York and Washington, most of them are doing fine. They might not appreciate what disaster means when we talk about the economy, but Ohio families who lost their homes and their life savings know what that means.  Do you know what else? For 14 years in a row, there were more foreclosures in my State each year than there were the previous year. OK, that is a statistic, and maybe you don't know any of those people. Well, the fact is that every time that happened, people lost their possessions. Their lives were turned upside down. Their kids may have had to go to a different school. They probably lost their family pet because they couldn't afford it. It was one thing after another for those families. We don't think much about them.  Here is how to think about this rollback. Bank capital requirements are like a dam that keeps the risks inside the bank. It keeps the risks from flooding out into the rest of the economy. So if the banks are going to take risks, you want to keep them contained in the bank so that only the bank gets hurt, but this bill punches a hole in that dam by loosening the rules on five of the biggest banks. Once the dam starts to leak, it is more likely that bad decisions by those banks could spill out and harm taxpayers and retirees and bank customers.  These banks have $5 trillion in combined assets. Should we feel safer with a weaker dam around a potential $5 trillion flood of banking assets? If that weren't bad enough, we have a team of lapdogs at our financial agencies who think this bill is just a starting point. Think about who they are. I don't come to this floor and attack individual people, but I do come to this floor and point out the history of some of these regulators.  Secretary of the Treasury Mnuchin was a bank executive who ran a bank that foreclosed on thousands of customers, many of them unfairly or possibly illegally. One of his top people, Mr.Otting, is the new Comptroller of the Mulvaney is the new Director of the Consumer Bureau, and he thinks the Consumer Bureau shouldn't even exist. Those are the kinds of regulators we see. Randal Quarles is the head of supervision at the Federal Reserve, and he said as late as 2006 or 2007 in the Bush Treasury Department that things were fine in our country. These are the people we have entrusted to do the regulations, to hold back this dam that they have weakened legislatively. They are the ones who are charged with holding it back.  If we want to help community banks, let's help community banks. Let's not try to sell it the same way this majority sold the tax cut bill. They said that it was a tax cut for the middle class, but 81 percent of the benefits over time went to the wealthiest 1 percent, so it wasn't a tax cut for the middle class any more than this was a bill for community bankers.  The community bankers will get some help. I want to do that. I know Senator Warren wants to, and I know all of us on the floor want to do that, but that is not what this bill really does. If we want to help community banks, let's help community banks. If we want to help credit unions, let's help credit unions. If we want to help regionals like Fifth Third and Huntington and KeyBank in my State, let's help the regionals like that.  Why do the biggest banks have to say: Give me more; give me more; give me more.  Let's take Wells What has Wells Fargo done to deserve an ounce of leniency? This is a bank that created more than 3.5 million fake accounts, including hundreds in my It is a bank that illegally forced unwanted auto insurance on its customers and charged homeowners improper fees to lock in their mortgage rates. So why would we want to help them with this bill? Just last week, the bank disclosed yet more problems with its money management unit. So why do we want to help Wells Fargo with this bill? It is a bank that outsources jobs. Six hundred call center jobs have been sent overseas by Wells Fargo just in the last year. So why do we want to help that bank in this bill? For those lucky enough to keep their jobs, it is a bank that mistreats its workers, punishing them with a high-pressure sales culture, and some of them lost their jobs as a result. Yet this bank, like the other big banks--they want more, more, more. I don't know why, but this Congress wants to give it to them, apparently.  What has the Senate done to respond to Wells Fargo's misbehavior? Well, first of all, Republicans a couple of months ago passed a $1.5 trillion--that is 1,000 billion--tax cut, and one of the biggest beneficiaries was Wells What did they do with that money? They say that they gave a little bit to employees. They say that maybe they will invest a little more. What they really did--they announced that they are going to buy back $22 billion of stock this year. When they buy back stock, the price of the stock goes up, and executives and shareholders are enriched. So the stock buyback investment--the $22 billion they are spending to buy back stock--is 288 times what Wells Fargo will spend on pay raises for its workers. So it gives a little bit to its workers. Whatever it gave to its workers, multiplied by almost 300--that is what the executives and the shareholders are going to get. So why are we doing favors for Wells Fargo in this bill?  I don't mean to pick only on them. It is not just Wells  What has HSBC done to deserve special treatment? Since the crisis, the Department of Justice prosecuted the bank for laundering money on behalf of the Sinaloa drug cartel. In the midst of an addiction crisis, we are going to reward a bank that illegally laundered money for a drug cartel?  Why are we doing any favors for Citigroup? Last month, Citigroup announced it had systematically overcharged almost 2 million of its customers on their credit cards.  Why are we giving a single ounce of help to these big banks? They are repeat offenders. Not only are they repeat offenders--and as we help these big banks in this bill, we say we want to help the community banks--these repeat offender big banks are banks that compete with our local lenders and probably will put more and more of them out of business as these bigger banks get more and more powerful.  The four biggest banks held 6 percent of industry assets in 1984. In 1984, 33 years ago, 34 years ago, the four largest banks in the country held 6 percent of industry assets. Today, the four largest banks hold 51 percent of industry assets. So what we are doing is giving them more--what we are doing is giving them more. Think about that. Thirty-plus years ago, the biggest banks held $1 of every $16 of banking assets. Now they hold $1 out of every $2. Think about how many community banks these big banks have been able to gobble up. This bill will lead to more consolidation, more concentration, fewer customer choices, less investor choice.  One article from American Banker talking about this bill said it could ``kick-start bank mergers and acquisitions.'' What that means in plain English is that big banks will get bigger. So we are helping the big banks get bigger, and we are falling over ourselves this week to help these banks because they just don't have enough. But we are doing nothing for consumers this week. We are doing nothing for workers, nothing for those tipped employees that the Department of Labor is cheating out of their tips and basically legalizing wage theft. We are doing nothing for middle-class workers. We are doing nothing for those supervisors making $30,000, $40,000 a year, who are having their overtime taken from them. We are doing nothing for them.  If we are trying to help our community banks and credit unions, why give favors to their big competitors--to the big banks?[[Page S1427]]  This isn't the weather. We can do something about the challenges Ohio faces. We can stop these crises that tear apart families and entire communities. We can do that by stopping this bill, to begin with.  Don't take my word for it. The Congressional Budget Office says that the risk of another financial crisis is very low right now because of the rules we passed in Dodd-Just dwell on that for a moment. They said that the risk of another financial crisis right now is very low because of the rules we passed in Dodd-Frank, but they went on and said that this bill increases the risk of another bank failure and another bank bailout.  All of my particularly conservative friends in this body always talk about how they hate bailouts. They are always against bailouts. They are against bailouts for middle-class families. Their voting record doesn't really show that they are against bailouts for the rich, but that is a whole other subject.  This bill that we are about to vote on this week, this bill that the banking industry is salivating over, this bill that they just can't wait to pass and get to the President's desk--and we know all the advisers sitting around the President, all the people in the Oval Office, all the people in the Cabinet room are all whispering in the President's ear: Mr.President, you are going to sign this bill, and this is going to be great.  The President said in his campaign: We have to go after Dodd-All the big bankers in the country know this is going to be a great thing.  We are spending all this time doing this to help the big banks but, again, nothing for workers, nothing for middle-class employees, nothing for consumers, nothing for infrastructure--all the things we ought to be doing.  I am just not willing to ask taxpayers to take that gamble of increasing the chances of another bank bailout. We don't have to. We could amend this bill just to help the small community banks and credit unions that we all agree should be helped. We could amend this bill in a modest way to help the regional banks that have generally been good actors in this equation. I am offering amendments this week that would do just that.  We don't have to give the big banks more just because they come here, just because they have the best lobbyists, just because they ask for it. We don't have to be at their beck and call. Let's do this right this week.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Gardner). The Senator from  ",CREC-2018-03-07-pt1-PgS1423.txt,2106,"LINN, AND MATTHEW BELLINA",2018.0,7.0,March

1983,topic-id,6406,"Mr.President, I would like my colleagues to take a trip down memory lane. Go back a decade or two to 2006, 2007, 2008, and look at the decade before that. My State of Ohio, for 14 years in a row--from the late 1990s through the year 2010--experienced almost a decade and a half of foreclosure increases leading up to the crisis. That meant that in Ohio, literally every year for 14 years, there were more foreclosures than the year before in my  Predatory and irresponsible lenders made dangerous, subprime loans. They often ignored whether borrowers had the ability to repay that loan. The incentives were these: We will keep writing these; we will keep underwriting; we will keep collecting fees. We don't care if the borrower can pay.  We can see that is a setup for disaster. Because of the lack of standards for underwriting, we learned a painful lesson that not all mortgage lending is created equal.  Look at some headlines from that period. On September 18, 2008, the front page of the Wall Street Journal featured three headlines. This was September 18, 2008, so just slightly less than 10 years ago: ``Mounting Fears Shape World Markets As Banking Giants Rush to Raise Capital.'' ``Bad Bets and Cash Crunch Push Ailing AIG to Brink.'' ``Worst Crisis Since `30s, With No End.''  On the same day the Washington Post reported: ``Markets in Disarray as Lending Locks Up.''  How did we get to that crisis? Banks forgot the essential rule of lending. A borrower needs to be able to pay back the loan. It is pretty simple, but a forgotten dictum. Instead, lenders offered loans that required no documentation. They offered loans with teaser interest rates that shot through the roof after 2 or 3 years. They offered loans where borrowers never paid down their principal or they stripped their home's value through cash-out refinances.  So borrowers had these mortgages where they simply paid the interest with the belief the home would go up in value more and more and more, never paying the principal. The homes didn't go up in value, and look what happened.  All of these practices had devastating results for families and communities and the economy. My wife Connie and I live in ZIP Code 44105 in Cleveland, OH, just south of Slavic Village in the great city of Eleven years ago, in the first half of 2007, 44105 had more foreclosures than any ZIP Code in the United States of I can still see the blight brought on by those foreclosures--what it did to individual families, what it did to the neighborhood, what it did to the city of  Think about--and we don't do that very much here. We don't really think all that much when we talk about things like this. We look at numbers. We look at statistics. We read analyses and data, but we don't really think about individual families.  Think about what happens when somebody suffers a foreclosure. First of all, these families understand that things are getting tighter. It is harder[[Page S1650]]and harder to pay their mortgage. Their spouse may have been scaled back to half time, depending on the economic circumstances.  The first thing they do is often get rid of the family pet. It costs too much to take the dog to the vet. The second thing they do is cut back on everything. They just start cutting back on everything. Eventually they have that sit-down with their 12-year-old daughter and their 14-year-old son and their 15-year old son, and tell them: We are going to have to move. We don't know where we are going or what school district we will be in. We don't know how much we are going to get; we have to sell the car. We don't know how much you are going to be able to see your friends. They think about the personal side, but we don't do that much here.  Pope Francis used to admonish his parish priests to go out and smell like the flock. We don't do that very much here. We look at data and ideas, and we don't think about our policies and our votes and the impact they have on individual human beings.  So thinking back to ZIP Code 44105, if those faulty mortgage products weren't bad enough on their own, they were targeted to communities of color. The neighborhood my wife and I live in, ZIP Code 44105, is mostly African American, but pretty diverse. A lot of people look more like me, but there are a lot of people with moderate to low incomes.  These mortgage products were targeted to communities of color. In those communities in particular, even those who qualified for no-frills, no-surprises prime mortgages were often instead steered into subprime loans. Why? Because the lender could make more money on a subprime loan than a straightforward loan that most Members of the Senate generally sign up for. So even African-American and Hispanic borrowers with higher incomes than other borrowers found themselves--because the banks put them there--with subprime mortgages.  These practices of discrimination, which went on for years, stripped a generation's worth of equity from communities that had fought hard for equal access to home ownership. Think about this: The household wealth of communities of color simply hasn't recovered from the last decade. Middle-class Black and Hispanic families lost half of their wealth from 2007 to 2013. In 2016, it was $38,000. The numbers are similar for Hispanic households: $85,000 in 2007, $46,000 in 2016. They all sound like numbers, but what that does to a family who has lost half its wealth, particularly because their wealth is generally in the home that they own--think of what that does.  My colleagues talk about how hard the banks have it, how hard it is to be a banker now, and how hard it is for Wall I would like to revisit what happens when banks stop following the rules. Borrowers with these higher cost loans were foreclosed on at almost triple the rate of borrowers with standard 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages. Between 2006 and 2014, more than 9 million homeowners lost their homes to foreclosure in distressed sales or surrendered their home to the lender--9.3 million homeowners. What does that mean to us? Do we know any of them? Do we ever talk to any of them? Do we listen to their stories about what happens when you get thrown out of your house? Do we sit there and patiently listen and ask them questions and ask them to tell us about what has happened during the last 10 years of their lives? Because when you get thrown out of your home, whether you are evicted or whether you get put out because of foreclosure, you don't just give away the family pet. You don't just cut back on everything. You lose a lot of your possessions because you can't take things with you. You start again in your life, and you start again in debt. Does anybody here care about that?  They talk about how hard it is for the banks and how Wall Street is suffering, but they don't think about the individual homeowners who struggle. Some of them get foreclosed on. Some of them are just struggling. Some of them have lost half of their wealth.  It is not just families of color who lost half their wealth; a whole lot of working class White families have lost a lot of their wealth. Does this place seem to care? Not a whole lot.  It wasn't just subprime mortgages. The crisis revealed a host of other harmful practices, like steering borrowers to affiliated companies, kickbacks for business referrals, inflated appraisals, and loan officer compensation based on the loan product. If you have a certain loan product that might be more profitable, even though it is a little sleazy and a little underhanded, you make a little more money because you steer people into those loan products. It might lead to the ruining of their lives or it might lead to their foreclosure, but they are making more money.  So what does that mean? It means the worse the loan was for the borrower, the more money the lender made. In 2008, the worse the loan was for the borrower, the more money the lender made. That is what our laws were. We fixed that, and we are going to undo some of that in this bill.  After the dust settled, this country realized how twisted our mortgage lending market had become. Congress finally stepped in to do what the market and regulators refused to do for too long.  I believe in free enterprise. I believe in the dynamism of capitalism. But when the market and the regulators did nothing except encourage this kind of behavior--that is why government is involved. That is why government steps in. That is why we did Wall Street reform. It established a commonsense rule that lenders should evaluate whether a borrower has the ability to repay a home loan. The ability to repay rule means that lenders can no longer make a loan based on the home's value or ignore the fact that an adjustable rate mortgage will become unaffordable in a year or two.  A mortgage is the largest financial transaction most families will make in their lifetime. It is a big deal, central to the economic life and the life overall of a great majority of people in this country. Requiring that the mortgage process, services, and fees be transparent and understandable to borrowers is essential. We don't all have great sophistication when we get a homeowner's loan. That is why it is so important that it be transparent and understandable to borrowers. But the bill before us today chips away at that principle. It includes several provisions that, when taken together, weaken transparency and inclusiveness and undermine fairness in mortgage lending.  The bill says lenders need not consider whether a borrower can afford an adjustable rate mortgage after the interest rate adjusts. Banks and mortgage companies make more money when they write more loans. I get that. They should. But when the incentive is only that and there is no requirement that the borrower be able to afford an adjustable rate mortgage after the interest rate adjusts--we know what will happen.  The bill also allows the largest banks to acquire small banks and retains these legal protections for the larger banks.  I spoke to a member of a bank board in Mansfield, OH, yesterday, a longtime friend of our family's. That is where I grew up. I know the locally owned banks in Mansfield, I know that Mechanics Bank works hard for their enrichment. I know they work hard for their customers. They know their customers. Small banks work with their customers. If they lose a job or face a sudden illness, the bank can try to work with them to figure out how to avoid foreclosure. Would a megabank in Cleveland, Columbus, or Dayton do the same thing? Based on the record of Secretary Mnuchin's bank, OneWest, and others during the crisis, we can be pretty sure we know the answer to that, and the answer is no, they won't.  The bill before us also gives lenders a pass on the requirement to escrow for taxes and insurance when making subprime loans. It doesn't cost real money to the lender to put money aside for taxes and insurance; it is part of the calculation when you buy a house. Most of us want our taxes and insurance included so we have a more predictable stream of outflow, so we know how much we are paying next month, and it doesn't change. It may change once a year, but it doesn't change often. By definition, someone taking out a subprime loan is at a higher risk of default. Also, escrow helps a borrower plan for the expenses of taxes and insurance, and it protects[[Page S1651]]the lender from unexpected losses. That is in the bill, and we are stripping that out of the law.  Former FDIC Chair Sheila Bair, appointed by President Bush, is a terrific public servant. She was a high-ranking employee--I believe chief of staff--for Senator Dole when he was a Member of the She steered the FDIC through the worst of the financial crisis. She raised her opposition to this provision in a letter to me.  This bill exempts 85 percent of banks from reporting the HMDA data they are collecting and reporting today. I credit Senator Cortez Masto, who, as the attorney general of Nevada before she joined us in the Senate 14 months ago, saw up close what happened with foreclosures. She is a strong, outspoken opponent of this bill. She has had those discussions with people who have lost their homes. She understands how it happened. She doesn't have the amnesia that apparently a majority of my colleagues have, forgetting what happened 10 years ago and learning almost nothing from what happened 10 years ago. Her amendment would fix HMDA data collection. Without this data, we can't monitor trends in mortgage lending, particularly in rural areas. Without this data, it will be even harder to see who has access to affordable mortgage credit and who does not.  We know that redlining is still happening. The latest report from the Center for Investigative Reporting analyzed tens of millions of mortgage records and found that across the country, people of color are far more likely to be turned down for a loan even when you take into account factors like their income and the size of the loan. Without this data, we won't know when redlining happens. It will make it more difficult to show that community lenders go the extra mile for their customers. That is why the NAACP, National Community Reinvestment Coalition, Unidos, National Urban League, Rural Community Assistance Corporation, and more than 170 State and national organizations have objected to this devastating new hole in lending data. Why in the world would Congress want to keep us from getting that information, keep us from getting that data, so we, in fact, understand better what goes on?  Part of our problem in 2007 and 2008 was that we had a whole bunch of regulators who were asleep at the switch, we had a Congress that was oblivious, and we had a national media that was not paying enough attention to this. Part of that was that the regulators didn't have the information they needed. That is why the head of supervision at the Federal Reserve, Randal Quarles, who was in the Bush administration then, could see nothing but roses and candy in the years ahead. He said that in 2006 and I believe in 2007. He had no idea what was going on, partly because he maybe didn't want to know but partly because we didn't have the data collected that we are starting to collect now. So we are going to say we don't care about that.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from former FDIC Chair Sheila Bair and the letters from civil rights groups in opposition to this provision be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  Any one of these provisions is bad enough, but taken together, they add up to riskier loans for American families and more foreclosures on American families.  Think about this: If this bill passes, a bank could make a subprime loan without considering whether a borrower could afford the higher interest rate when the teaser rate expires. The first 2 or 3 years, you are paying rate X, and then in the third or fourth year, you are paying X plus two or X plus three, and then the next year, maybe X plus that number plus one, to the point you can't afford your mortgage anymore. What happens? You get foreclosed on, and your life turns upside down.  If this bill passes, a bank could make a subprime loan without considering whether the borrower could pay the higher interest rate. A bank wouldn't have to collect taxes and insurance on a monthly basis, making a loan look affordable when it may not be because you have insurance and taxes. Why not put that in the monthly payment so people can predict more and understand their finances better?  The homeowner loses her right to take the bank to court for removing her from her home even though the bank made a loan it knew she could never repay. So the bank makes a loan to a homeowner. The homeowner perhaps doesn't have the sophistication the banker sitting across the table has, doesn't quite understand what the teaser rate will mean to the cost of her house. Then the bank doesn't do the escrow adding insurance and taxes, and the bank convinces this perspective homeowner, the borrower, that she can make these payments, no problem. Then she loses her right to action if she is foreclosed on. She has no recourse even though the bank sold her something that a good banker wouldn't have. It is a recipe for disaster. It is a recipe for more families ending up in homes they were misled into thinking they could afford. Is it too much to ask a lender to consider whether a family can afford the loan they are getting? Are we back here already?  The cherry on top is this bill eliminates data we need to determine whether banks are targeting certain communities for these risky loans. We know this administration and the heads of Departments are not concerned about accountability for financial institutions' equity, lending, and inclusivity. We learned that HUD is considering changing its mission statement to delete references to inclusive communities. Imagine that, Secretary Carson, that you would do such a thing.  I am concerned this bill will put more families at risk of poor housing conditions, particularly in rural communities that are so often ignored in this town. The bill reduces the frequency of required inspections for units overseen by rural public housing agencies that administer 550 or fewer units of HUD public housing and section 8 rental vouchers. For many of these so-called PHAs, HUD will inspect their property once every 3 years rather than every 1 or 2 years. This bill would allow PHAs to inspect more voucher-assisted units just once every 3 years. A lot can happen to an apartment in 3 years that could put residents' health and safety at risk. In my neighborhood, it is in the 90 percent rate, those homes that have toxic levels of lead, and it gets worse as the house gets older and the paint chips. And we are not going to inspect these places.  I understand that PHAs face many challenges in maintaining high-quality housing for families. Due to years of underfunding, public housing alone faces an estimated $26 billion backlog of repairs. My Senate Democratic colleagues and I have proposed an infrastructure package that includes funding for public housing repairs and revitalization to help address these challenges. We have an obligation to make sure these struggling families have safe and decent housing. I have been clear throughout this process that I want to help community lenders and housing providers better serve their customers. We don't do that by reducing accountability. We don't do that by returning to the freewheeling housing market that led to millions of families losing their homes.  When we talk about escrow and lending requirements, it sounds kind of boring, it sounds dry, and it may sound like legalese that don't matter, but it matters when it comes to the biggest, most important purchase most Americans will make.  It just seems that particularly when people buy that first home and they don't really know much about how to do that--maybe they don't have a lot of political sophistication; they are 25 or 30 years old or whatever age they are--we shouldn't make it more complicated, we should make it less complicated. Bankers should not be incentivized only by how much money they make by writing more and more mortgages but instead should walk through what this is going to cost: Here is the escrow. Here is what your insurance costs. Here is what you are going to pay if you have a teaser rate. We are going to make some decisions, and this house may be a little too expensive for you because of that teaser rate, because of what you will be paying 3 years from now in addition to the escrow, the taxes and insurance that you hadn't really planned for.  Weakening a standard here or granting an exemption there will end up causing real pain for real families.[[Page S1652]]  Growth in the housing sector is only sustainable if families can afford their loans and homes are maintained. I know families in my ZIP Code can't afford a repeat of the housing crisis. I know what it has done to my neighborhood. Some of them are still digging out.  Let's stop listening to the big-bank lobbyists and start listening to the people we serve, the families across this country who remember all too well what foreclosures and job losses mean to them.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                February 13, 2018.     Sherrod Brown,     Ranking Member, Senate Banking Committee,     Washington,       Dear Senator Brown: You had requested my views on 2155,      the ``Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer      Protection Act''. At the outset, I would like to commend the      Senate Banking Committee leadership for developing this      legislation on a bipartisan basis, and proceeding in the      traditional way with hearings and a markup. I appreciate that      much work has gone into negotiating its provisions, and I am      highly supportive of most of them, particularly those reforms      which give relief to community and regional institutions, as      well as changes that would give consumers more control over      their credit information.       Regrettably, the bill also includes Section 402 which would      significantly weaken a key constraint on the use of excessive      leverage by the largest financial institutions in the In      these times of market volatility, I would strongly urge the      Senate to reject this provision as imprudent and short-     sighted. Now is the time we should be bolstering bank capital      levels, not chipping away at them.       Banks operated with far too little capital during the run      up to the 2008 financial crisis. In setting capital      requirements, regulators erroneously judged certain      activities--for instance mortgage securities, derivatives,      and European sovereign debt--as having little, if any risk.      Banks piled into these activities because regulators let them      lever returns with borrowed money. The consequences were      catastrophic.       Because their judgments about risk were so wide of the      mark, regulators have made greater use of non-risk weighted      standards since the crisis. The most important of these is      the ``supplemental leverage ratio'' or ``SLR''--a relatively      simple metric which sets minimums for big banks' common      equity as a percentage of their total assets and certain off-     balance sheet exposures. In the US, the SLR has been set at      5% for the largest banking organizations (6% for their      insured bank subsidiaries).       Section 402 is a seemingly innocuous provision which would      exempt from the SLR deposits held at central banks by      ``custodian'' banks. This includes deposits at the Federal      Reserve (Fed), as well as the central banks of other      Organization for the Economic Cooperation and Development      (OECD) members such as Turkey and       As originally introduced, Section 402 was limited to three      so-called ``custodian'' banks, specialized banks which      safeguard customer assets but do not engage in traditional      commercial banking. However, during the markup, the Senate      Banking Committee loosened the definition of ``custodian''      bank, potentially creating a gaping loophole as any bank      arguably serves as ``a custodian'' of depositor money. Most      big banks will likely press the Fed to let them benefit from      Section 402, given the huge competitive advantage it would      bestow. Data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation      (FDIC) indicate that capital reductions for some banks could      approach 30%.       The laudable goal of the sponsors of 2155 is to support      economic growth. But it seems Section 402 will simply give      banks more incentives to take on additional leverage by      parking money with central banks, not making business and      consumer loans. They can arbitrage the near-zero interest      rates they pay on deposits with the 150 basis points they can      get at the That's a nice, tidy margin that will grow      even wider as the Fed raises rates this year.       Central bank deposits do not support lending in the real      economy. They do include the extra reserves created by      central banks when they intervene in the markets through      things like quantitative easing, the practice of buying      government and private securities to increase the money      supply. If the goal of 2155's supporters is to facilitate      monetary interventions, then that should be made clear.      However, even assuming that is the purpose, there is no need      for Section 402. The Fed already has substantial flexibility      to temporarily ease capital requirements during times of      economic stress. The Basel Committee, an international      regulatory forum which includes central bank supervisors, has      said that in times of exceptional macroeconomic circumstances      central banks should have the flexibility to temporarily      remove reserve deposits from the leverage ratio calculation      to facilitate such interventions. Only the Brexit-challenged      Bank of England has removed central bank deposits from its      leverage calculation. Notably, it also made an upward      adjustment in its ratio to mitigate the reduction in capital      levels, something which 2155 does not do.       More fundamentally, why does Congress want to start      designating banking activities as low or no risk, when expert      financial regulators were so spectacularly wrong prior to the      crisis? The SLR's key strength is that it does not reflect      government judgments about risk. Central bank deposits may      seem low risk, but where does this slippery slope end? The      Treasury Department wants US government securities also      removed from the leverage ratio, notwithstanding their      significant interest rate risk. What's next? Housing agency      debt? How about AAA corporate bonds? To the extent these      instruments compete with central bank deposits for banks'      liquid investments, Section 402 will put them at a      competitive disadvantage unless they get similar treatment.      It will also alter the competitive landscape as it provides a      special capital break for big banks that does not apply to      smaller institutions, an ironic result for a bill designed to      help community and regional banks.       Before concluding, I would like to address some of the      confusion surrounding this change, not surprising given the      complexity of bank capital regulation. Assets of pension      funds, mutual funds, endowments and other bank clients that      are held in custody and invested under the control of those      clients are already excluded from the Losses on those      assets fall to the clients, not the bank. The SLR applies to      funding, be they deposits or other borrowings, over which      banks have control. Even though custody banks may not operate      as traditional commercial lenders, they are highly systemic      and have significant operational risk with many trillions      under custody. They can also suffer losses on their      investment portfolios, as they did during the crisis. As      Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Vice-Chair Tom      Hoenig has pointed out, custodian banks were borrowing from      the Federal Reserve $60 to $90 billion dollars a day to cover      funding shortfalls during that tumultuous time.       In the years following the crisis, custodian and other      large, systemic banks have grown and remained profitable      notwithstanding toughened capital rules. Indeed, the higher      capital standards we imposed in the US relative to Europe      have been key to our faster economic recovery. It is true      that during times of market stress, deposits significantly      increase at custodian banks. But this is true of all banks--     FDIC insured deposits went up dramatically during the crisis.      This is why risk-based capital rules have built in counter-     cyclical buffers, and there would certainly be no harm in      Congress recognizing the authority of bank regulators to      provide capital accommodation in times of severe stress when      deposits are increasing dramatically as investors seek out      safety. This is authority I believe they already have.       Government judgments favoring one asset class over another      inevitably distort markets. I would strongly encourage      Congress not to embark down this path. The responsibility--     and accountability--for capital rules should rest with the      Fed and other bank regulators. Weakening capital rules now      will undermine the resiliency of the banking system and      heighten the risk of bank failures during the next downturn.      This current recovery is already long in the tooth by      historical standards. For now, growth is strong and banks are      profitable, but that will eventually change. If anything,      Congress should be encouraging banks and their regulators to      increase capital buffers.       You had also requested my views on other aspects of      2155. As previously indicated, outside of Section 402, I am      highly supportive of this bill with two caveats. First, in      limiting the application of Enhanced Prudential Standards      (EPS) Congress should take care not to weaken pre-Dodd-Frank      authorities to utilize forward-looking supervisory tools and      protect the deposit insurance fund. You would not want to      inadvertently weaken supervisory tools that existed prior to      the crisis. Second, I am troubled by Section 109 which would      exempt many more lenders from escrow requirements for high-     cost mortgage loans. Mandatory escrow of insurance and taxes      for borrowers with troubled credit histories provide both      consumer and safety and soundness benefits. Borrowers who      have difficulty managing their finances may well have trouble      making these essential payments on their own, forcing them to      turn to high cost lenders to cover those costs when they come      due, or worse, defaulting on their mortgage obligations.      Moreover, administrative costs of escrow requirements are not      high and certainly less than costs associated with default.      To both protect consumers from the loss of their homes as      well as the FDIC-insured banks from mortgage defaults, I      would encourage Congress to leave current escrow requirements      alone.           Sincerely,     Sheila                                  ____                                      National Association for the                                Advancement of Colored People,                                    Washington, DC, March 5, 2018.     Re NAACP Strong opposition to 2155, the Economic Growth,          Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection     The Honorable,     U.Senate,     Washington,       Dear Senator: On behalf of the NAACP, our nation's oldest,      largest and most widely-recognized grassroots-based civil      rights organization, I strongly urge you to oppose, work      against, and vote ``Nay'' on passage of 2155, the mis-     named Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer      Protection[[Page S1653]]     This dangerous bill does irreparable damage to fair      lending protections against racial discrimination; it harms      homebuyers; and it contains over two deregulatory provisions      of the financial services industry that were put into place      after the 2008 global crises which led to a recession from      which many American families and communities are still trying      to recover.       Section 104 of the bill would exempt 85% of depository      institutions from full reporting of loan data under the Home      Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA). This would devastate our      attempts to determine--and potentially rectify--racially      discriminatory lending or loan approval patterns at play. The      HMDA dataset contains the most comprehensive publicly      available information on mortgage market activity. Each fall,      new HMDA data are made available. In 2016, almost 7,000      institutions released over 16 million records, making HMDA an      invaluable administrative dataset on housing and      homeownership for policymakers, regulators, and researchers.       Furthermore, 2155 provides exemptions from crucial      mortgage lending protections for buyers of manufactured      homes, such as mobile homes. These provisions would allow      sellers of manufactured homes to overcharge customers and      make the millions of Americans who wish to purchase a      manufactured home more vulnerable to predatory lending      practices similar to those which caused so many--too many--     families to lose their homes in the 2008 crisis.       If we as a nation learned anything from the 2008 financial      crisis, it is that American consumers need more information      and protection, not less. Thus, I urge you to reject 2155      and to focus on policies and proposals to help the average      American consumer. Thank you in advance for your attention to      the position of the Should you have any questions or      comments, please do not hesitate to contact me at my office.           Sincerely,     Hilary Shelton,       Director, NAACP Washington Bureau & Senior Vice President      for Policy and                                  ____                                                    March 8, 2018.     Re Oppose section 104, ``The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act          Adjustment''.       Dear Senator: The undersigned civil rights, fair housing,      consumer, and community organizations write to highlight our      strong concerns with Section 104 of 2155, ``the Home      Mortgage Disclosure Act Adjustment and Study''. This section      would undermine efforts to ensure that the nation's mortgage      lenders are serving all segments of the market fairly by      exempting the vast majority of lenders from the updated      reporting required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and      Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank). Public officials use      this information in distributing public-sector investments so      as to attract private investment to areas where it is needed,      and to identify possible discriminatory lending patterns. The Dodd-Frank Act's Updated HMDA Reporting Reflects Lessons from the                             Financial Crisis       In response to widespread concerns about predatory lending      and opacity in the mortgage market in the run-up to and      following the financial crisis, Congress amended the Home      Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) to require both banks and non-     bank lenders to disclose more information about their      mortgage lending activities--updates finalized by the CFPB in      2015. Although not previously reported and disclosed through      HMDA, these data points are already collected on a routine      basis by banks, credit unions and for-profit mortgage      companies in the normal course of business, either as a part      of basic loan underwriting, for securitization or for other      purposes required by law.     The CFPB Reduces the Reporting Burden on Small Lenders          Without Sacrificing Data About Lending in Underserved          Communities       After considering a number of higher reporting thresholds      and receiving extensive feedback from all size and type of      lending institutions, the CFPB adopted a standard that      applies the new reporting requirements to institutions that      made 25 closed-end mortgage loans or 100 open-end/home equity      lines of credit (HELOCs). Importantly, in response to      concerns raised by lenders and by some in Congress, the CFPB      has already temporarily raised the reporting threshold for      HELOCs to 500 through 2019, in order to further review the      impact of the rule and what the permanent HELOC threshold      should be. In adopting the HMDA thresholds, the agency      balanced several Congressional interests--adopting a uniform      and simplified reporting regime for banks and non-banks;      eliminating the need for low-volume banks to report while      maintaining sufficient data for analysis at the national,      local, and institutional levels; and increasing visibility      into the home mortgage lending practices of non-banks.       Section 104 upsets the careful balance: its proposed      reporting thresholds--500 closed end loans or 500 open-end      lines--would exempt the vast majority of the nation's      mortgage lenders from the updated requirements. Based on 2013      data, under the threshold set by the CFPB, 22 percent (1,400)      of the depository institutions that currently report on their      closed-end mortgages would be exempt. In contrast, if Section      104 is enacted, the agency estimates that 85 percent (5,400)      of depositories and 48 percent of nondepositories (497) would      not have to update reporting on their mortgages. This higher      threshold would sacrifice key data about lending in      underserved communities that would help to ensure the flow of      credit to qualified borrowers, stimulate the economy, and      prevent future mortgage crises.     Tiered Reporting Sacrifices Critical Data Without Reducing          Lender Burden       Section 104 proposes to adopt a tiered reporting approach,      exempting some lenders from reporting the new data points      pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act only. This is purportedly a      way to reduce burden. However, because the data points      covered by the rule are already collected by lenders, the      burden associated with the rule is minimal. Further, as with      any data collection effort, the primary driver of HMDA costs      is in establishing and maintaining systems to collect and      report data, and not the costs associated with collecting and      reporting a particular data field. Therefore, this approach      sacrifices critical information without relieving much of the      purported HMDA reporting burden on banks or non-banks.       Section 104 Would Undermine Fair Access to Mortgage Credit       HMDA was passed in 1975 to provide the necessary tools to      dismantle uneven access to mortgage credit and expand equal      lending opportunities for qualified borrowers, yet important      segments of the market continue to lack fair access. For      people of color, low- to moderate-income families, and      borrowers in rural areas, access to mortgage credit remains      tight. While the numbers of loan originations have gone down      for all borrowers, African Americans and Latinos have      experienced the steepest declines. A Federal Reserve analysis      of lending in rural areas has found higher denial rates in      those communities since the housing crisis than in urban      areas. The new data would help explain and inform responses      to these lending gaps. A new HMDA data point on the      applicant's age is also vital information for evaluating age      bias in lending, especially in conjunction with reverse      mortgages.       The stark disparities in access to mortgage credit and the      continued struggle for economic recovery in the communities      hit hardest by the financial crisis call for a strengthening      of our nation's fair lending laws, specifically HMDA, not a      weakening of them. Quite simply, the updated HMDA data will      provide critical information about whether similarly situated      borrowers and underserved communities are receiving equitable      access to mortgage credit, data that we lacked a decade ago      when the crisis hit. This is not the time to limit the      nation's ability to adequately assess the reasons for      restricted credit access for underserved borrowers. Instead,      we must increase efforts to address the causes behind the      increased difficulty in accessing safe, affordable credit.       For these reasons and more, we urge you to oppose Section      104 and any other efforts to roll back the data collection      and reporting as called for in Dodd-Frank and implemented by      the Should you have any questions or comments, please      feel free to contact Gerron Levi at the National Community      Reinvestment           Sincerely,       National Groups: Americans For Financial Reform, Center for      Responsible Lending, Consumer Action, Consumer Federation of      America, Equal Rights Center, Grounded Solutions Network,      Housing Choice Partners, The Leadership Conference on Civil      and Human Rights, Morningstar Urban Development,      Incorporated, NAACP, National Community Reinvestment      Coalition, National Coalition for Asian Pacific American      Community Development, People's Action, National Fair Housing      Alliance, National Housing Law Project, National Organization      of African Americans in Housing, National Urban League,      Public Counsel, Rural Community Assistance Corporation, Take      Charge America, UnidosUS (Formerly NCLR).

1854,topic-id,433,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Iowa for the time today to talk about this important legislation.[[Page H1416]]  Mr.Speaker, I want to speak on behalf of the Political Appointee Burrowing Prevention This important legislation addresses a problem affecting our Federal workforce.  Our Federal civil service hiring process is supposed to be a competitive, merit-based system where the best and brightest individuals are considered based on their qualifications and ability to do their job, not because of their political connections. However, we have seen a concerning trend where excepted service employees, specifically political appointees, are converted into high-paying, lifelong civil service positions, bypassing the normal competitive hiring process.  This process, also known as ``burrowing,'' defeats the purpose of having a nonpartisan, merit-based civil service. In fact, the Government Accountability Office reports that the Obama administration converted 78 political appointments into career positions, while the Bush administration allowed 135 political appointees to burrow into career positions.  This trend raises significant concerns that individuals who were not chosen based solely on their merits may, at best, not be the most qualified candidate for the job, or, at worst, may not be willing to properly execute the law under a new administration.                              {time}  1530  Political appointees are supposed to serve their appointing President's agenda for a temporary period of time. Part of their duty to the Nation is to know when it is time to step down from their position of power.  Congress must act to ensure this principle is upheld and to protect the independence of our merit-based civil service. That is why I, along with my friend and colleague, Representative Ted Lieu, have offered an equitable solution to ensure this problem is stopped in its tracks.  Our bill, the Political Appointee Burrowing Prevention Act, places a 2-year ban on political appointees being hired for any job in the civil service after they depart a political position.  Additionally, the bill ensures that after the 2-year ban is completed, the head of the agency seeking to employ the individual must submit a written request to OPM detailing why hiring a former appointee is necessary to the agency's mission.  Furthermore, OPM is instructed to deny the application unless the agency head can prove why it is necessary to hire this individual instead of an applicant from the merit-based hiring pool.  This commonsense bill ensures that our Federal workforce is filled with career civil servants who are the most qualified, not the most politically connected.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation that ensures our Federal workforce is being selected by merit, not by political patronage.

I have seen firsthand how these transnational drug cartels can disrupt civil society. In my own district, the opioid epidemic has destroyed innocent people's lives, including kids, while transnational criminal organizations, or TCOs, profit on people's misery and their death.  TCOs have brought heroin to our streets and, along with it, increased crime, placing additional burdens on law enforcement in local communities.  We are in crisis mode, and targeted steps need to be taken to address this epidemic at all phases. We have to crack down on the pusher on the street. We have to crack down on the drug cartels. We have to crack down on the drug companies that have made a profit from overprescription and filling suspect orders.  Most of all, we have to crack down on the intricate faceless and unbelievably complex international criminal organizations that allow the profits from these activities into our economy.  We must eradicate the international illicit financing networks that are the linchpin of any criminal organization's operations. But we don't have a unified national plan.  Luckily, this committee has an opportunity to make a difference by coming up with a national strategy and plan to attack transnational criminal organizations' finances.  Mr.Kustoff's bill would direct the Secretary of the Treasury to provide that plan, a vital first step towards addressing the threat posed by the growing sophistication of illicit financing networks.  Passing this bill is a significant step toward an effective, sustained national strategy to attack the funding that makes these TCOs possible.  Therefore, it is critical that we continue to maximize cooperation among Federal departments to keep our policies ahead of these transnational criminals.

1171,topic-id,305,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend from Georgia for leading on this issue.  I rise today in strong support of his bipartisan bill, the Comprehensive Regulatory Review  It strikes me as common sense that Federal regulators should review their regulations and rules on a consistent basis. They should also seek comment from the people whom these rules actually affect. Mr.Loudermilk's bill helps accomplish this goal by requiring the CFPB and National Credit Union Administration do so every 7 years.  Mr.Speaker, since the implementation of Dodd-Frank, community banks and credit unions have had a more difficult time serving their customers. The red tape and additional burden brought on by Dodd-Frank has increased costs for the consumer and reduced their choices in the market for financial products.  One agency in particular that is guilty for this additional burden is the CFPB, which has finalized over 60 rules since their creation. Many of their rules are duplicative and unnecessary. I think, at the very least, they should review and study how their regulations are affecting real folks in the real world.  I hear from financial institutions back home how the CFPB has done nothing but harm their community bank or their credit union. They are being overwhelmed by the volume and complexity of regulations, and that is just not okay.  Harmonization is the goal of this bill, and that should not be partisan or even controversial. We simply want less people buried in paperwork and more people starting businesses through their local financial institution.

335,topic-id,845,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, earlier this year, Members of Congress heard the President during his State of the Union Address make a specific promise to the American people that the passage of right-to-try legislation would occur. This afternoon, I am proud to stand with the President and the thousands of Americans with terminal illnesses, their families, and their friends, in passing this important bill in the  Since 2014, nearly three out of four States, including my home State of Texas, have passed a version of right-to-try laws. I am pleased that the House is again considering H.5247, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2018, so that terminally ill patients have a chance, or maybe a second chance, at life. These patients are our constituents. They could be someone we know. Let us take this opportunity to improve access to experimental treatments for them.  Over the course of the past decade, our Nation has achieved an unprecedented number of innovations and scientific breakthroughs. Through the contributions of researchers in academia and the private sector, Americans have more innovative treatments at their fingertips.  Despite these achievements, I still hear from patients with serious, life-threatening conditions, including my own constituents in north Texas, who are frustrated with what they see as regulatory barriers from trying new therapies when everything else has failed.  Mr.Speaker, as a physician, I understand that access to investigational drugs and therapies is a deeply personal priority for those seeking treatment for their loved ones with serious, life-threatening conditions.  To my friends on the other side of the aisle, I have a simple question: Why do you not want to allow these patients to exercise their right to fight for their future?  It is worth mentioning that the bill before us today is a revised, more narrowly crafted version of the one that passed the Senate last Since that time, the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health held a hearing in early October to consider the Senate bill, where Members heard from[[Page H1740]]the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, Scott Gottlieb, about the agency's concerns. We also heard testimony from patients and groups that support and oppose right to try.  From then to just recently, our committee engaged in multistakeholder efforts to improve the original right-to-try bill, as passed by the It entailed numerous conversations with patients, advocates, the Administration, authors of the bill, and stakeholders on all sides of this complex topic.  The Food and Drug Administration was never left out of the discussion. In fact, the agency provided valuable input throughout the process and up until the introduction of H.5247. The aim was to open the door to innovative, experimental drugs for terminally ill patients without necessarily compromising the vital work and the mission of the Food and Drug  The current compassionate use program at the Food and Drug Administration does make a good faith effort to help patients who do not qualify for clinical trials. But right to try would actually offer patients an alternative pathway to access eligible investigational drugs, so long as they are certified by a physician who is in good standing and abides by the rules laid out in the bill.  Again, we have worked closely with the Food and Drug Administration to ensure that this new, alternative pathway does not hinder or conflict with the critically important oversight that the agency conducts.  Additionally, this bill protects patients from manufacturers mislabeling or misbranding drugs, requires sponsors and manufacturers to report adverse events to the Food and Drug Administration, and provides certain liability protections for parties participating in the new pathway.  Mr.Speaker, this alternative pathway would also be limited to individuals who are suffering from a disease or a condition where there is a reasonable likelihood of death within a matter of months or significant, reversible morbidity, and who have exhausted all FDA-approved treatment options.  Lastly, it is essential that we do not create additional hurdles in this process so that manufacturers in the drug approval process have the certainty that they need.  The revised right-to-try bill clearly states that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services ``may not use a clinical outcome associated with the use of an eligible investigational drug . . . to delay or adversely affect the review or approval of such drug. . . . `'  After months of work and thoughtful discussions, this legislation is a positive step forward in our shared goal of improving care for America's patients. It strikes the proper balance between ensuring patient safety and granting access to new treatments.  The President outlined in his State of the Union Address that this was an important priority for the administration. In the words of our Vice President and former colleague, Mike Pence: ``It's about restoring hope and giving patients with life-threatening diseases a fighting chance.''  Mr.Speaker, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues in the House to vote in support of H.5247, and I reserve the balance of my time.

368,topic-id,290,"Mr.Speaker, while well-intentioned, this motion to recommit falls short of providing vulnerable patients full access to experimental treatments.  Providing clarity on how negative side effects will be accounted for during drug approvals is helpful. Giving manufacturers, sponsors, physicians, hospitals, and clinical investigators certainty on liability protections is meaningful. Taken together, these improvements to the existing expanded access program could lead to enhanced manufacturer and sponsor participation and increased patient access.  But this would not provide an alternative pathway for patients who cannot get into a clinical trial and have been rejected from participation in the existing compassionate use program.  This bill before us today does provide an alternative pathway, one that strengthens patient protections with clearer informed consent and real-time adverse event reporting. This bill--the underlying bill--also makes certain that the FDA is notified when a patient receives an unapproved drug through the new alternative pathway to ensure proper oversight. These are significant patient protections.  With this motion to recommit, we have a choice. The underlying bill is the only choice that gives those patients in the greatest need of help access to investigational drugs, with their consent, even after they were rejected from participating in a clinical trial or expanded access.  Mr.Speaker, the choice is clear. We need to vote to expand patient access. We need to vote down the motion to recommit. We need to vote for the underlying bill.

1963,topic-id,260,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.

However, I continue to hear from patients with serious life-threatening conditions, including my constituents in north Texas, who are frustrated with what they see as regulatory barriers from trying and experimenting with new therapies when everything else has failed.  When potentially lifesaving treatments exist but remain unavailable to patients, we have an opportunity to move past what has long been a dilemma towards delivering a hopeful message.

Hopefully it is on its way to final reconciliation with the House and hopefully will become law later today.  Before I talk about that, I want to take a second to recognize some provisions that are in the omnibus that we also are going to be voting on in the next few hours, two provisions that are very important to the Pacific Northwest--one, finally a fix on fire borrowing, which is so important to the entire Northwest but particularly in the State of Washington, which has seen the great impact of forest fires in the last several years. This will end the fire borrowing that we have seen that has prevented us from doing the kind of fuel reduction that we would like to see to protect our communities, and it will help us better manage with stewardship contracts and release the funds that should be going to recreation management within our forests.  This fire funding fix has been long in the making. I thank my colleagues, Senators Wyden, Risch, and Crapo, for their hard work, and I thank Bryan Petit from my office, who has worked tirelessly on this as well. We are starting a new day in how we treat our forests and hopefully one that will reduce the risks to many communities.  I thank our colleagues for working so diligently on including a provision on[[Page S1904]]affordable housing. This is the first affordable housing increase in a decade. I want to thank specifically Senator Schumer and Senator McConnell and Senator Hatch, my cosponsor on this legislation, for helping us get this done. This is not everything we would like to see in affordable housing, but certainly it is starting to point in the right direction.  I also thank Anna Taylor, Artie Mandel, Lara Muldoon, and Jay Khosla for working so diligently on trying to make the housing crisis something that we have to deal with here in the U.For us in the Pacific Northwest, the homelessness crisis, our returning veterans, our aging population, and workforce housing have become the 1 issue. For Seattle and the whole Northwest, starting to put more resources on the table to build affordable housing is the right direction, and we need it desperately now, and this legislation will help us.

This national commemorative site, which will remain as part of a city park, is not going to be part of the National Park System, although I am happy to discuss that with my colleagues moving forward. The National Park Service is authorized to enter into cooperative agreements to help provide for education and interpretation of this site.  The Young-Donnelly amendment removes language in the bill authorizing the Park Service to conduct a special resource study and assess its potential for inclusion in the National Park I know my colleague Senator Young is here on the floor, and I thank him for his leadership. I hope that some day he and I can continue, with Senator Donnelly, to expand on this and revisit this issue.

Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the full text of Robert Kennedy's speech in Indianapolis on April 4, 1968, the 50th anniversary coming up next week.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  FULL TEXT OF ROBERT KENNEDY'S SPEECH: INDIANAPOLIS, APRIL 4, 1968       Ladies and Gentlemen,       I'm only going to talk to you just for a minute or so this      evening, because I have some very sad news for all of you      Could you lower those signs, please? I have some very sad      news for all of you, and, I think, sad news for all of our      fellow citizens, and people who love peace all over the      world; and that is that Martin Luther King was shot and was      killed tonight in Memphis,       Martin Luther King dedicated his life to love and to      justice between fellow human beings. He died in the cause of      that effort. In this difficult day, in this difficult time      for the United States, it's perhaps well to ask what kind of      a nation we are and what direction we want to move in.       For those of you who are black considering the evidence      evidently is that there were white people who were      responsible you can be filled with bitterness, and with      hatred, and a desire for revenge.       We can move in that direction as a country, in greater      polarization black people amongst blacks, and white amongst      whites, filled with hatred toward one another.       Or we can make an effort, as Martin Luther King did, to      understand, and to comprehend, and replace that violence,      that stain of bloodshed that has spread across our land, with      an effort to understand, compassion, and love.       For those of you who are black and are tempted to fill with      hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act, against      all white people, I would only say that I can also feel in my      own heart the same kind of feeling. I had a member of my      family killed, but he was killed by a white man.       But we have to make an effort in the United We have      to make an effort to understand, to get beyond, or go beyond      these rather difficult times.       My favorite poet was And he once wrote:     Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget     falls drop by drop upon the heart,     until, in our own despair,     against our will,     comes wisdom     through the awful grace of       What we need in the United States is not division;       what we need in the United States is not hatred;       what we need in the United States is not violence and      lawlessness, but is love, and wisdom, and compassion toward      one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still      suffer within our country, whether they be white or whether      they be black.       So I ask you tonight to return home, to say a prayer for      the family of Martin Luther King yeah, it's true but more      importantly to say a prayer for our own country, which all of      us love a prayer for understanding and that compassion of      which I spoke.       We can do well in this country. We will have difficult      times. We've had difficult times in the past, but we and we      will have difficult times in the future. It is not the end of      violence; it is not the end of lawlessness; and it's not the      end of disorder.       But the vast majority of white people and the vast majority      of black people in this country want to live together, want      to improve the quality of our life, and want justice for all      human beings that abide in our land.       And let's dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so      many years ago: to tame the savageness of man and make gentle      the life of this world. Let us dedicate ourselves to that,      and say a prayer for our country and for our people.       Thank you very much.

636,topic-id,387,"Mr.President, some days we need a reminder of what perspective in the face of crisis really accomplishes. We know that 50 years after this historic speech, we have an understanding about how incredibly magnificent this moment was, so I am so glad to join my colleague in commemorating it. It was about holding the consciousness of a society and how to respond to an unbelievable, tragic, violent event and to hold the consciousness of a society with words--just words. And that is the point--that words matter; that words matter to a society. They are what holds us together. They are what creates unity. They are what creates perspective. In this case, they also created history.  Senator Kennedy spoke to a crowd in Indianapolis and announced the death of Martin Luther King--an unbelievable responsibility. If you watch now in videos of the speech, you will hear the gasps of the audience, who was unaware that that event, in that moment, had taken place. Yet he spoke to the crowd about why violence and retribution should not be pursued. He created calm among chaos. He created a moment where everybody realized that they were commemorating the life of Martin Luther King, that his life had been about a nonviolent response to tragedy and to the challenges we face.  When we commemorate this moment with this designation, we are commemorating a moment, in my opinion, of the human spirit. We are commemorating a moment--the incredible pain Robert Kennedy must have felt, knowing that Martin Luther King had just been assassinated. Yet he spoke to the crowd about keeping the peace and remembering the lessons of  We will never know what kind of Presidency RFK might have given our Nation, but we know this from his speech: We know what kind of man he was, and we know what kind of human spirit and soul can communicate, in that moment of tragedy, the direction of a nation.  It is so important at this moment in our history that we reflect on this 50th anniversary. At a time when it is better to use words to speak calmly and competently in the face of tragedy, I hope that here in Washington, we will remember one of the greatest political speeches of all time.

1325,topic-id,1368,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to talk about the bill we have in front of us, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection That is a mouthful right there, but what it is, is a culmination and reaction to the Dodd-Frank bill that was passed in 2010 as a result of the crisis of 2008 and 2009.  I think it is important for us to note where this is directed. In Dodd-Frank, so much of the focus was placed on large banks and larger institutions, but what has been lost in the debate and what really is an unintended consequence, I think, is that the massive and burdensome regulatory legislation would affect the smaller banks, the community banks, and the credit unions.  Senator Rounds of South Dakota and Senator Blunt of Missouri and my State of West Virginia have more rural areas for the most part, and these community banks and credit unions are absolutely critical to our individuals but also to our businesses. They have been bearing the brunt of Washington's response to that in the form of Dodd- We know that larger financial institutions have the capital, resources, staff, and expertise to handle a lot of these regulatory requirements that are placed on them, but smaller institutions have really struggled under the weight of Dodd-We didn't come to this point today without a lot of discussion, compromise, and thoughtful input from a lot of different entities to figure out the best way to serve all our These smaller institutions play a critical role in a State like West Our small businesses rely on them to open and succeed, our communities rely on them to expand, and our economy relies on them to grow, especially in our rural areas.  Our community banks and credit unions really had to shift their attention away from what they know best, which is relationship-based lending and borrowing, and put it more into this regulatory environment to devote bank resources, time, energy, effort, and legal resources to make sure they are complying with regulations that were really intended for larger financial institutions. It has been tough.  From 2010, which was the year Dodd-Frank was enacted, until 2016, the number of community banks in our country has decreased by 1,600. That is a significant decrease in the number of community banks. With little or no access to community banks, our Main Street borrowers have been forced to turn to larger institutions for loans. That is fine, but a lot of times our Main Street businesses and individuals get lost in the shuffle. Sometimes it is stiffer terms, and sometimes it could mean rejection.  We are talking about farmers, families looking to buy a home, and of course our small businesses. We are really talking about the hard-working men and women trying to live that American dream.[[Page S1415]]  With smaller institutions constantly forced to merge with larger ones to help shoulder the cost of regulation, that relationship-based model that has served our communities for decades is disappearing.  I think it is time now, after much thought, to ease that burden and rightsize those regulations on our smaller financial institutions, and that is exactly what the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act does. It is a balanced approach to regulation. It takes into account the differences--some of them vast differences--between larger and smaller financial institutions.  It improves access to mortgages, which is something I have been interested in since my service in the House when I was on Financial Services and I chaired the Financial Institutions The mortgage issue was something that I introduced, and we worked on many, many pieces of legislation to provide rural areas with greater access to mortgages.  Let's just talk about what happens. If a young couple is trying to get a mortgage or maybe it is even a med student coming out of medical school, trying to get a mortgage for a loan with no real income yet but in a relationship banking situation, that small community banker knows that is going to be a safe bet at the end of the day. A lot of our mortgages have been so constructed by Dodd-Frank that people haven't been able to get mortgages. Let's face it. The ones who face the biggest challenges are the ones we were supposed to be trying to help with Dodd-Frank, and those were in the mid to lower income range who maybe had a credit issue or some other extraneous issue. In a cookie-cutter environment, one-size-fits-all doesn't fit their size, and they end up without the opportunity to own a home.  There are also very critical consumer protections in this bill--protections for our seniors. I am going to go out on a limb here and say that this is probably one area in which we haven't, as a Congress, joined together with financial institutions and other consumer advocates to protect our seniors from being preyed upon financially. It is rampant. Sometimes you are preyed upon by your own family. So the Senior Safe Act, which is Senator Collins and Senator McCaskill's bill, protects our seniors from financial exploitation--this is part of the bill--and fraud. This has been a consistent priority of mine.  It also works to protect our veterans, who can be very vulnerable when seeking financial assistance, and also for individuals who have gone through tough times financially. The legislation clarifies a lot of the CFPB regulations to help benefit those consumers.  Student borrowers and student loans--we talk a lot about the increasing debt that our students are incurring, the difficulty that students, after they graduate, have in paying down these debts, but a bill that I helped to introduce with Senator Peters is included in this agreement. It says that when student borrowers from private loans have the opportunity, they can rehabilitate their credit following a default. They can't do that now. If you have a government loan, you can do that, but if you have a student loan through a private institution, you can't do that. So we are seeking parity between a government loan and a private loan, and we think this will help those students repay and relook at their finances.  Finally, in light of recent data breaches that have put many at risk, this legislation puts in place important cyber security standards and safeguards. Every committee we are on talks about cyber security. The financial institutions, I think, have been on the leading edge of trying to detect cyber invasions into information or into their financial institutions. We have to stay one step ahead here because this is very fast-moving.  These are all priorities and solutions on which I have worked hard, both as a leader on the House Financial Services Committee and now, as I chair the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations  For community financial institutions, regulatory relief and economic growth go hand in hand. We just passed the tax relief bill, and a lot of our small businesses are able to increase their bottom lines, grow their businesses, grow jobs and wages. We want to see those financial institutions grow alongside that.  Working men and women and small business owners deserve a fair shot at mortgages. Owning a home is the American They also deserve a process that takes into consideration the kind of community where they live.  We deserve relief from these burdensome and unbalanced regulations we have been forced to contend with for too long. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act does just this. It gives us an opportunity to send a clear message to Main Street, and that is: We support you. We support you.  I encourage all of my colleagues to stand with me. I want to thank Chairman Crapo for his dedicated insistence that this come to the floor of the U.Senate and that we have bipartisan support. It is very well thought-out. It doesn't have the whole kitchen sink in it. It has the provisions that I think are the top priority for our financial institutions but also for all of us who represent Main Street here in the U. Thank you.  I yield the floor.

236,topic-id,948,"Mr.President, I would like to bring the Senate's attention to Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) Fairness Act of 2018, the common sense legislation I am introducing with the junior Senator from Maryland today. This legislation seeks to eliminate a barrier that potential college students with difficult personal and financial circumstances face when applying for Federal financial aid.  This body has worked to improve the college application process for students and their families over the last several years and successfully lobbied the Department of Education to allow students and their families to submit their FAFSA application in October and utilize prior-prior year tax data. These changes provide future college students and their families with several months to submit their financial information instead of a short time frame between January and February to meet State and institutional based deadlines for need- and merit-based financial aid programs. These steps have made it easier to students to sit with their families and make informed financial decisions on which college or university will provide the student with the highest quality yet least expensive college education.  Despite our work, a number of our students are being left behind and cannot take advantage of these changes. Those students, who face difficult personal and financial situations, including those who have left home due to abusive family environments, have parents who are incarcerated, or are unable to locate their parents are unable to fill out the FAFSA application. Rather than fill out one universal Federal financial aid application form, a potential college student must contact each institution they are applying to and undergo a ``dependency override'' process before a college or university will put together an estimated financial aid package for the student. Under this process, a student applying to one university in my state must submit nine different pieces of financial information, personal statement, and references in order to verify their independent status. These students, often first generation students unfamiliar with the process for applying to school, may give up on the dependency override process and fail to finish the college application process or leave significant Federal financial aid on the table.  The FAFSA Fairness Act would seek to correct this inequity for some of our most vulnerable students. If enacted, my legislation would allow students in these difficult personal and financial circumstances to fill out a FAFSA as a ``provisional independent'' student that colleges and universities would be able to provide those students with an initial financial aid award package. Once the student has had the opportunity to review the financial aid award packages from the schools they applied to and selected the school of their choice, that school's financial aid administrators will work with the student to complete the ``dependency override'' process and finalize the student's financial aid award package.  I'm proud to lead the Senate efforts with my seatmate from Maryland and appreciate the work of my colleague from Maryland's 7th Congressional District to lead this effort in the House of I urge my colleagues to join in this effort to help students achieve their dream of higher education despite their difficult family and financial circumstances.

Mr.Nussman joined the ASA's government relations team in 1992 and became president and chief executive office of the association in 2001. I am proud to call him a fellow  Sportfishing provides outdoor recreation for more than 47 million Americans each year. In Maryland, we are blessed with some of the best fishing opportunities in the From fishing for striped bass--``rockfish''--on the Chesapeake Bay, to fly fishing for trout on the Gunpowder, to fishing for smallmouth bass on the Potomac, we have great waters and angling throughout our Whether casting for yellow perch and pickerel on the Eastern Shore or trolling for tuna and white marlin off Ocean City, fishing in Maryland provides opportunities for young people and families to get into the great outdoors and enjoy our public lands and waters.  Like many other outdoor industries, sport fishing is sometimes overlooked as a significant job generator and economic engine. The U.Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that, nationwide,[[Page S1943]]recreational fishing generates $48 billion in retail sales, $115 billion in total economic activity, and 828,000 jobs. In 2016, Congress passed the Outdoor Recreation Jobs and Economic Impact Because of that legislation, in 2018, the U.Commerce Department Bureau of Economic Analysis included outdoor recreation's impact, including fishing and boating, in our Nation's gross domestic product, GDP, for the first time.  Possibly the most important aspect of recreational fishing is that sportfishing manufacturers, anglers, and boaters pay for most of State fish and wildlife agencies' fisheries conservation and boating programs. Through special Federal excise and fishing license sales, anglers and boaters are providing more than $1.2 billion each year in funds that are allocated to the States  Much of this progress is due to the leadership of Mr.Nussman, who hails from Crownsville, While ASA has been a trade association since 1933, it has really been in the past 25 years--a period that coincides with his tenure--that the organization has assumed more of a leadership role in the angling community.  With the support of ASA, the aforementioned excise taxes have been expanded to cover programs such as wetlands restoration, boating safety and infrastructure, and the establishment of the Recreational Boating & Fishing Foundation, In fact, Mike Nussman led the effort to establish RBFF to turn around a decline in recreational fishing participation, which started to appear in the 1990s. The most recent data indicate an upward trend in recreational fishing, including among more diverse and urban communities.  Mr.Nussman's success should come as no surprise. He worked for the Senate Commerce Committee and then-Chairman Fritz Hollings of South Mr.Nussman was the lead professional staff member for the subcommittee that oversees fisheries policy, the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, and the U.Coast Prior to that, Mr.Nussman worked for the South Carolina Sea Grant Program, earning undergraduate and graduate degrees in science, and an MBA from the University of South  Mr.Nussman's tenure at the ASA also has improved the organization's business operations. The sportfishing industry's annual trade show is now the largest in the world. His leadership has made the organization financially strong, helping it weather economic downturns. He has also served on numerous boards of directors and advisory groups, from the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership to the Blue Ribbon Panel on Sustaining America's Diverse Fish and Wildlife He has served as a U.Commissioner on the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic  Trade associations serve a unique role by allowing companies in the same industry to come together to express their views on issues affecting the entire industry. They are an important segment of our U.private sector and provide a legal, accepted mechanism to allow small and large companies in an industry to have a common voice when working with the Congress, the Executive, the States, and local governments. When Mr.Nussman joined the ASA, he brought special expertise as a former Senate staffer to the recreational fishing industry and conservation communities. So upon the occasion of his retirement, I think it appropriate that he be recognized and congratulated today for a job well done. Anglers and sportfishing-related businesses in Maryland and across our Nation can be thankful that he has been at the ASA helm.  I wish him all the best as he begins the next chapter in his life which will include, presumably, even more time for fishing.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-22-pt1-PgS1942-2.txt,,WE MUST PROTECT THE SOVEREIGNTY OF OUR NATION,2018.0,22.0,March

In 2009, she joined a Helsinki Commission delegation I led to Sarajevo, where she championed the efforts of university students who saw the politics of ethnicity and nationalism--and the corruption it perpetuates--as denying them opportunities for a brighter future in a more prosperous She also worked to ensure those guilty of war crimes in the former Yugoslavia were prosecuted and to provide humanitarian relief to victims of the conflict.  As part of her efforts to promote human rights around the world, we traveled together on a commission delegation to Greece in 1998 to advance the rights of Roma, Europe's largest ethnic minority population that historically faced persecution, were the victims of genocide during the Second World War, and continue to face disproportionate levels of racism and discrimination to this day.  Few other Members of Congress, House or Senate, matched her ongoing and effective engagement. During her time on the Helsinki Commission, Louise represented the United States at numerous meetings of the Organization for Security and Co-operation In Europe, OSCE, Parliamentary Assembly, an interparliamentary body which has encouraged diplomats to focus on issues of concern and importance to the United States, especially human rights and fundamental freedoms. From 1993 to 2010, she participated in more than a dozen assembly meetings as a member of U.delegations, helping to show the depth of our country's commitment to transatlantic relations.  Louise was born in Her father was a blacksmith for a coal mine. She had a sister who died of pneumonia as a child, which impelled Louise to pursue degrees in microbiology and public health at the University of She moved to New York to work for Procter & Gamble and was elected to the New York State Assembly in 1982 and then to the U.House of Representatives in 1986. We were House freshmen together. She coauthored the Violence Against Women Act--VAWA--secured funding for breast cancer research, and was responsible for establishing an office of research on women's health at the National Institutes of Health, In 2007, she became the first woman in U.history to chair the House Committee on  Louise was legendary in the Rochester area as her constituents know well. Her background as a microbiologist shaped her priorities in securing infrastructure upgrades, research funding for local universities, and bringing two manufacturing institutes to the area. She most recently secured funding for Rochester's new Amtrak station, which is rightfully being renamed in her memory.  Louise was universally respected, and it has been an honor to call her a friend and colleague, as well as to have served on the Helsinki Commission with her for two decades. My thoughts and prayers go out to her children and the rest of her family, friends, and constituents during this difficult time. She had an extraordinary life and her myriad accomplishments on behalf of her constituents, other New Yorkers, all Americans, and indeed all of humanity secure her legacy and are a wonderful testament of her commitment to public service.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-22-pt1-PgS1941.txt,,DEMAND SERIOUS TREATMENT OF THE GUN VIOLENCE PROBLEM,2018.0,22.0,March
380,topic-id,427,"Mr.President, today, as the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I wish to recognize America's small business development centers, SBDC, and the vital role this national business assistance and counseling network plays in supporting economic development, job creation, and success at our Main Street small businesses.  The mission of the nationwide SBDC network is to help America's entrepreneurs realize the dream of businessownership and assist existing small businesses in adapting to the changing marketplace and compete in the global economy.  SBDCs are hosted by universities, colleges, and State economic development agencies and funded in part by our Small Business There are nearly 1,000 SBDC service centers and 4,000 SBDC consultants available to provide free and low-cost business consulting and training to help entrepreneurs write a business plan, access capital, market their products, and recover when a disaster strikes.  SBDCs offer a great return on investment for taxpayers. It is estimated that SBDC small business clients create a new job every 5 minutes and a new business every 30 minutes and generate $100,000 in capital every 10 minutes. Job growth for SBDC clients is more than 14 times higher than job growth for an average business.  Last year, the Maryland SBDC at the University of Maryland in College Park assisted almost 8,000 businesses, counseled 2,200 entrepreneurs, and helped train nearly 5,700 businessowners. Small business services provided by the Maryland SBDC led to the creation of 208 businesses and 1,251 jobs and access to $49 million in capital.[[Page S1874]]  Behind the statistics are real Marylanders who realized their small business dream with the help of an SBDC consultant, like a women-owned restaurant in Baltimore called  In 2015, Julia and Vanna Belton went to their local SBDC office for help securing a business loan. After months of tinkering with their business plan and adjusting their loan paperwork, their SBDC consultant guided Julia and Vanna to approval on an $800,000 SBA loan they used to purchase and renovate a building for their restaurant.  Today, the restaurant has $1.2 million in revenue and 30 full and part-time employees. Last year, they were named Maryland's ``2017 Women-owned Business of the Year.''  Flavor is just one of the millions of small businesses and entrepreneurs who have been touched by America's Small business development centers over the last 35 years. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the dedicated men and women of America's small business development center network and to thank them for their commitment to the small businesses that drive the American economy.

1034,topic-id,1606,"Mr.President, I rise to recognize March as Women's History Month and today, March 8, as International Women's  Both at home and abroad, how a country treats its women is very much a barometer of its success. When women live without limitations on their ability to work, societies prosper. When women live without restrictions on their access to jobs, healthcare, or justice, societies prosper. When women succeed, so do their families, their communities, and their countries.  International Women's Day reminds us that America's global leadership starts with our progress here in the United Unfortunately, President Trump moved the United States in the wrong direction when he decided not just to reinstate the global gag rule but to expand it. The global gag rule disqualifies international organizations from receiving U.family planning assistance if they use any non-U.funds to provide abortion services or even counseling.  What President Trump fails to realize is that access to the family planning services that these organizations provide is one of the best tools we have to prevent abortions. When enforced, the global gag rule has closed the door on some of the most effective, lifesaving women's health programs in developing countries. By reinstating and expanding the global gag rule, President Trump is denying millions of women and their families access to critical healthcare services and is endangering their lives and the lives of their children.  International Women's Day is the appropriate time to remind my Senate colleagues that we must end the global gag rule once and for all.  It was also recently reported that the State Department is removing references to women's rights from this year's human rights report. I am troubled to learn that the Trump administration, apparently, doesn't feel that women's rights are important enough to include in our conversation on human rights. I was equally troubled to learn that the State Department removed gender equality integration from the Foreign Affairs The Foreign Affairs Manual is the chief document for instructing our foreign policy leadership on the ways to integrate gender considerations into our diplomatic efforts. Abandoning that signals a reversal of decades' worth of work in promoting global gender equality.  The United States should be taking the lead on fostering an open and honest dialogue about women's issues internationally, not silencing it. We are better than this.  Here at home, women have succeeded this past year in taking control of the narrative on sexual harassment, and they have forced deaf ears to listen. We are witnessing the rise of a new, more equitable social order that is built on the raw guts and courage of women who are speaking out to say, ``Me too.''  Hearing so many of my fellow Americans--mothers, sisters, wives, daughters, friends--retell and relive some of their most traumatic experiences has been deeply troubling, but it has also been a lesson in bravery, in tenacity, and in women's unbreakable spirits.  It is that bravery which we must now meet with our own as individuals and collectively. If we witness harassment, we must be brave enough to intervene. If we are told about abuse, we must be brave enough to take decisive action. If we hear about gender discrimination, we must be brave enough to fight it even when doing so may not be politically expedient or popular. Scores of women have proved their moral strength. It is time for us to demonstrate ours.  This Women's History Month, let us take a moment to reflect on the thousands and thousands of ``Me Too'' stories that go untold and unheard.  Let us recognize the single working mother making barely more than minimum wage, living paycheck to paycheck, and struggling to turn $5 into a meal for three. When her coworker begins propositioning her, there are no cameras and cable talk shows waiting to expose him. She bears the burden alone, often feeling forced to choose between enduring disparaging behavior at work or providing for her children at home.  Let us recognize the college graduate working in an office, empowered and excited about the direction of her career. Yet, in every meeting, her boss undermines her ideas and, one day, when they are alone, questions her suggestively about her method of birth control. Weeks later, his lewd remarks evolve into inappropriate physical contact, and he tells her that if she ever complains, he will ensure she never finds another job in her chosen profession.  Let us recognize the immigrant woman working hard at her new job in her new home, motivated to become part of the American dream. Her male coworker calls her by disparaging names and suggests openly to their supervisor that she should make less than he does in the event she ever becomes pregnant and costs the company money. She begins to fear both for her job and for herself, but to quit would mean to lose the new life she has so painstakingly built.  For an untold number of women, these stories are painfully familiar. The ``Me Too'' movement has proven that sexual harassment and discrimination know no age and no income level. These experiences are felt by all women of all backgrounds, so it is up to all of us to combat it. Sexual harassment is about power. It is about the harassers and authority figures feeling emboldened by being able to behave the way they want, wherever they want, with impunity. So let us end the sense of impunity.  If behavior is about exerting a twisted kind of power, let us arm women with the most powerful tool in our legal system--the U.Let us finally pass the Equal Rights The Equal Rights Amendment is barely longer than a tweet, but it would finally give women full and equal protection under the Section 1 of the ERA states, quite simply: ``Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.''  When Congress proposed the ERA in 1972, it provided that the measure had to be ratified by three-fourths of the States--38 States--within 7 years. This deadline was later extended to 10 years by a joint resolution. Ultimately, only 35 out of 38 States had ratified the ERA when the deadline expired in 1982--three short. Note that the deadline was not contained in the amendment, itself. The deadline was contained in a joint resolution.  Article V of the Constitution contains no time limits for the ratification of amendments, so the ERA deadline is arbitrary. To put the matter in context, the 27th Amendment to the Constitution, which prohibits congressional pay raises without an intervening election, was ratified in 1992--203 years after it was first proposed. The Senate should vote to remove the ERA deadline immediately, and every State in our Nation that has not yet taken up its consideration should do so without further delay.  Nevada became the 36th State to ratify the amendment last March, leaving the ERA only two States short of the required three-fourths of the State threshold under the Constitution if the deadline were to be abolished. I think many--perhaps most--Americans[[Page S1540]]would be shocked to learn that our Constitution has no provision expressly prohibiting gender discrimination.  The ERA would incorporate a ban on gender-based discrimination to be explicitly written into the It would change outcomes in unequal pay cases by requiring the Supreme Court to use the higher standard of ``strict scrutiny'' when assessing those cases--the same standard it uses on racial and religious discrimination cases.  Just as importantly, it would provide a constitutional basis for claims of gender-based violence and give the Congress the constitutional basis to pass laws that would give women who have been victimized by gender-based violence legal recourse in Federal courts.  In a 2011 interview, the late Justice Antonin Scalia summed up best the need for an Equal Rights  He said:       Certainly the Constitution does not require discrimination      on the basis of sex. The only issue is whether it prohibits      it. It doesn't.  So I, most sincerely, ask my Senate colleagues this question: Are we willing to do what must be done to prohibit gender discrimination by including protection against it in the Constitution? Progress has no autopilot feature. We must be its agents. We must be its champions. When we wake up each day to the loud and growing chorus of women saying ``me too,'' how can we deny them the legal tool as powerful and important as our own country's Constitution?  The people being affected by systemic gender inequality are our constituents. They are our wives, our daughters, and our granddaughters. They are American citizens and human beings who deserve basic respect and equality.  We are capable of so much more than lip service. We are capable of celebrating Women's History Month by making history. I call on this Senate to remove the deadline on passing the Equal Rights Amendment and show the American people we are the leaders they sent us here to be, and we will take action. Let us prove that we will use our voices when silence becomes complicity, and we will use our votes when our values need defending.  Women deserve to see that their Nation's founding document values them and treats them in a fashion equal to men. They are right to expect that gender equality should be an explicit, basic principle of our society. Let us all work together to get this done.  Women's rights are human rights, and human rights are not and never should be a partisan issue.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  ",CREC-2018-03-08-pt1-PgS1529-7.txt,,WILLIE O'REE SHOULD BE INDUCTED INTO THE HOCKEY HALL OF FAME,2018.0,8.0,March
1410,topic-id,970,"Mr.President, I rise today to commemorate the 200th speech the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr.Whitehouse, will make here on the floor of the U.Senate on the need to act on climate change.  When global challenges arise, countries throughout the world look to the United States for leadership. Climate change is an issue that affects billions of people worldwide, and the United States can and should be a leading voice in combating it.  Despite making significant progress under President Obama, President Trump has decided to reverse course and take a backseat while the rest of the world tackles this issue head-on. Over the last year, the United States has pulled out of the Paris Agreement, weakened air and water protections here at home, moved away from renewable energy, and implemented drastic funding and staffing cuts at the Environmental Protection Agency,  President Trump's decision to retreat from our commitment to combating climate change comes at a critical time for the state of our environment. His abdication of responsibility is calamitous. The vast majority of scientists have concluded that climate change is real and caused by human activity, and Americans are already feeling the effects.  Last year, for instance, our Nation experienced one of the most destructive hurricane seasons on record and a series of deadly wildfires. On top of this, sea levels continue to rise at record pace, posing an existential threat to coastal communities throughout the country. This is especially dangerous for the State I represent, as many Marylanders live in areas that are acutely susceptible to rising tides and flood damage. As such, much of our essential communication, transportation, energy, and wastewater management infrastructure is at risk.  This begs the question: What kind of environmental legacy do we want to leave for our children and grandchildren? I believe that it is our responsibility to leave our beaches, farms, towns, and wetlands healthier than we found them.  The most recent research suggests that our actions over the next 5 years will shape the course of sea level rise for generations. Therefore, the time is now to take decisive action on climate change. If we fail to do so, we will be left to explain to the next generation why we failed to act in the face of so much incontrovertible evidence.  Some of my colleagues argue that tackling climate change is too costly an undertaking. They claim that any action we take to protect human health and the environment will inevitably cost jobs and hurt the economy. The reality is that nothing poses a bigger long-term threat to our economic and national security than climate change.  As sea levels and temperatures climb higher, so do the costs of doing business. Changing weather patterns increase risk for homeowners. Our attempts to cool a heating planet will strain our energy supply. These are just a few of the economic consequences that we will face if we fail to take action.  The progress we have seen in Maryland demonstrates that we can preserve our environment while maintaining a robust economy. Marylanders have taken decisive action on a range of environmental issues, and the State is currently on track to meet the guidelines established in the Paris Thanks, in part, to the partnerships within the Chesapeake Bay Program, the health of the Bay has been steadily increasing for years.  At the same time, Maryland's farming industry, which employs over 350,000 Marylanders, has remained vibrant. Our success in Maryland is a testament to what we can do as a nation on climate change.  The key to our success will depend on the degree to which we are willing to cooperate with each other. This includes interstate partnerships such as the Chesapeake Bay Program, as well as international partnerships like the Paris We should not let President Trump's decision to remove the United States from the Paris Agreement discourage us from working together to achieve our goals. In the spirit of collaboration, we should continue to partner with the States, localities, universities, and business that have decided to honor the global commitment we made under President  I am especially proud to see the city of Baltimore, Hyattsville, Takoma Park, the University of Maryland School System, and all the other localities and organizations lead this effort in Maryland by joining the America's Pledge project.  America's Pledge is a new initiative co-led by California Governor Edmund ``Jerry'' Brown, Jr., and the U.Secretary-General's Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change Michael Bloomberg, which aims to assess the scope and scale of climate actions being taken by U.States, cities, businesses, and other non-Federal actors. I am proud the Center for Global Sustainability at the University of Maryland is among the institutions providing the project their research support.  I encourage my colleagues to put our planet, our environment, and the future of humanity over partisan politics and President Trump's stubborn insistence on retrograde policies. We must do what is best not just for ourselves, but for future generations, too. The United States of America has been a world leader on so many issues, which redounds to our own benefit. Now is not the time to abdicate that role. The world and our children are watching.  We are fortunate to have climate change leaders like Senator With a dogged persistence, he has come to this Chamber month after month to educate, to cajole, and to inspire us to take action.  Most of all, he has warned us of the grave danger climate change presents. Will we be like the Trojans of ancient Greek mythology, who ignored the prophecies of Cassandra about the imminent destruction of their city? We do so, like the Trojans, at our own peril. Cassandra's prophecies came true. If we listen to Senator Whitehouse and learn from him and take action now, we can change our fate for the better.

1994,topic-id,487,"Mr.President, I rise today to introduce a common sense piece of legislation that will expand the ability of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to nurture innovative and high-growth small businesses in Maryland and across the country.  Let me first say, I recently returned to the Senate Committee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship as the Ranking I look forward to continuing the important work of helping America's 29 million small businesses--the job creating engine of the country--access the essential capital to grow, to earn their fair share of Federal contracts, and to take advantage of SBA's counseling and mentoring programs that help entrepreneurs market and manage their businesses.  The Small Business Investment Opportunity Act is straightforward. It[[Page S1581]]modifies SBA's Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program by increasing the amount of capital that SBICs with a single fund can invest in qualifying small businesses.  The SBIC program stimulates investment in America's high-growth small businesses. SBICs are privately-owned and managed investment funds that use their own capital--plus funds borrowed with an SBA guaranty--to capitalize small businesses.  Last year, SBICs made 36 investments totaling $61.3 million in 12 innovative Maryland firms. Over the past five years, the program has channeled more than $21 billion of capital to 6,400 American small businesses across a variety of industries.  The program operates at no expense to taxpayers. Instead, the cost of the program is covered by fees paid by SBICs and their portfolio companies.  Consider this: since the program launched in 1958, SBIC has:  Deployed more than $67 billion of capital;  Made more than 166,000 investments in American small businesses; and  Licensed more than 2,100 investment funds.  Some of America's most iconic brands have received investment capital from SBICs, including Apple, Tesla, Whole Foods, Staples, Intel, FedEx and Costco, among others.  Under current law, SBA can guarantee up to $150 million of an SBIC investment fund. Our legislation increases that cap to $175 million and unlocks additional capital for small businesses with high-growth potential. The cap has not been raised since 2009.  Raising this cap would simply keep up with inflation and maximize the amount of capital SBICs can direct to innovative small businesses that hire our workers, support our communities, drive innovation and help our country maintain its competitive edge.  This bill also builds upon a change that Senator Risch, Senator Shaheen and I passed in 2015 to increase the maximum amount of leverage to SBICs with more than one fund. As some of my colleagues will recall, those types of SBICs are known as ``Family of Funds.''  As with the bill in 2015, the legislation we are introducing today is also bipartisan and bicameral. I am pleased the Small Business Investment Opportunity Act has the support of our Chairman, Senator Risch, as well as Senators Shaheen and An identical bill passed the House last year, and the legislation is endorsed by the Small Business Investor  Thank you, I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-08-pt1-PgS1580.txt,,TAX REFORM,2018.0,8.0,March
27,topic-id,2426,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak about title XI of divisions S of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, H.1625. Title XI of Division S, the Fair Agricultural Reporting Methods Act, or the FARM Act is identical to the text of 2421, which was introduced on February 13, 2018, and which was referred to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, where I serve as ranking member. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of 2421.  The Environment and Public Works Committee held two legislative hearings on the text of 2421. The first was on 2421 as introduced, in the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Superfund, Waste Management, and Regulatory Oversight on March 8, 2018. The second[[Page S1925]]hearing was held by the full committee on March 14, 2018, on a committee draft of legislation, the ``Agriculture Creates Real Employment (ACRE) Act.'' The text of 2421 was included in the committee draft of the ACRE Act, as section 3.  2421 exempts most farms from the hazardous substance release reporting requirements under section 103 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, CERCLA, for air emissions from animal waste, but leaves intact reporting requirements under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, The FARM Act also preserves reporting requirements and enforcement authority under State and local laws, as neither CERCLA nor EPCRA would preempt such requirements.  As I said during those hearings, I believe our country's environmental laws serve our entire Nation, including our farmers, quite well, but I recognize that sometimes environmental requirements can be complex and confusing to those who farm, especially when these rules suddenly change.  This is what happened in April 2017 when the DC Circuit Court of Appeals invalidated an EPA rule from 2008, which exempted all farms in the Nation from reporting requirements for hazardous air emissions from animal waste under  That same rule also exempted many farms from reporting requirements under section 304 of EPCRA, but left in place reporting requirements for large concentrated animal feeding operations, known as This is because EPA received numerous comments from local officials and the public in support of having farms report these emissions. Since January 2009, EPA has required large CAFOs to report their emissions of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide from animal waste under section 304 of  With the court's decision to vacate the 2008 rule, all farms that exceeded releases of 100 pounds in a 24-hour period of ammonia or hydrogen sulfide were now subject to reporting requirements under section 103 of CERCLA and under section 304 of Farms had no experience with CERCLA reporting, because the 2008 rule exempted all farms from reporting under section 103 of that statute. The FARM Act provides a statutory exemption to the reporting requirements under section 103 because the DC Circuit found that EPA did not have the authority to exempt farms from these releases. This restores the CERCLA reporting exemption under which farmers have operated since 2009.  Reporting requirements under EPCRA have been quite different. As I noted before, the Bush administration chose to only exempt some farms from reporting releases of extremely hazardous substances from animal waste under section 304 of EPCRA, and since 2009, large CAFOs have been successfully reporting these releases to their State emergency response commissions and to their local emergency planning committees. The DC Circuit vacated the rule that exempted farms that weren't large CAFOs from EPCRA reporting requirements under section 304.  One thing I worked hard on with Senators Fischer and Barrasso as we were developing the FARM Act was to ensure that, at the same time we exempted farms from hazardous substance reporting requirements under section 103 of CERCLA, we chose to make no changes to how extremely hazardous substances should be reported under We heard testimony from multiple witnesses during both of our hearings on this point, namely that this legislation did not change reporting requirements for releases of extremely hazardous substances under We also heard testimony from a local government official about the ways that he and his constituents would use the information in these reports.  Another important aspect of the FARM Act is that it in no way modifies any of EPA's response or remedial authorities under CERCLA, nor does it in any way limit or reduce liability associated with a release from any facility, which of course includes farms. This fact is made explicit in section 3 of 2421 and in section 1103 of H.1625, division S, title  I want to thank Senators Fischer and Barrasso for working with me and agreeing to not amend EPCRA in 2421, and similarly in title XI of division S of H.1625. That was critical for many Members on the Democratic side who have repeatedly heard concerns from State and local officials, the public health experts, and other members of these communities who have the right to know about what is in their air.  Finally, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a Congressional Research Service memorandum titled ``Supplemental Analysis: Fair Agricultural Reporting Method Act/FARM Act (2421).'' As I have already noted, the text of the FARM Act in division S, title XI, of the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.1625, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, is identical to 2421. Therefore, the analysis contained in the CRS memo on 2421 applies equally to the language in the omnibus. There is additional analysis on the FARM Act by CRS that is part of the hearing records on 2421 and on the ACRE  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               Congressional Research Service Memorandum                                                   March 13, 2018.     To: Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works     Attention: Kusai     Cory Booker, Ranking Member     Subcommittee on Superfund, Waste Management, and Regulatory          Oversight     Attention: Adam     From: David Bearden, Specialist in Environmental Policy     Subject: Supplemental Analysis: Fair Agricultural Reporting          Method Act/FARM Act (2421).       This memorandum responds to your request for a more      detailed discussion of the analysis presented in a CRS      memorandum provided on March 7, 2018. CRS prepared this      earlier memorandum to respond to your initial request for an      analysis of amendments to the Comprehensive Environmental      Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) in the      Fair Agricultural Reporting Method Act or ``FARM Act'' (     2421), as introduced on February 13, 2018. As discussed in      the March 7th CRS memorandum, 2421 would exempt air      releases of hazardous substances emitted by animal waste at      farms from reporting requirements under CERCLA, and would      have a bearing on the applicability of reporting requirements      under Section 304 of the Emergency Planning and Community      Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).       This supplemental memorandum elaborates upon the analysis      presented in the March 7th CRS memorandum to outline      circumstances in which the emergency notification      requirements in Section 304 of EPCRA would apply under      current law, and the bearing of 2421 on the applicability      of these requirements to air releases emitted by animal      waste. The March 7th CRS memorandum provides additional      background information in support of this analysis, and      offers a broader examination of how 2421 would define the      terms ``animal waste'' and ``farm'' for purposes of the bill.      I hope that this supplemental memorandum is helpful to      address your questions about circumstances in which EPCRA may      continue to apply if 2421 were enacted. If you need      further assistance from CRS in consideration of this      legislation or related issues, please do not hesitate to      contact me.                          Section 304 of EPCRA       As explained in the March 7th CRS memorandum, Section 304      of EPCRA outlines three situations in which the reporting of      releases of extremely hazardous substances or hazardous      substances into the environment is required. In each      situation, the person responsible for the release must notify      the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC) and the      appropriate Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) that      covers the local jurisdiction where the release occurs. Two      of these situations are contingent upon the release being      subject to notification under Section 103 of CERCLA for      reporting to the National Response Center! The third      situation is not contingent upon reporting under The      three situations covered in Section 304 of EPCRA are as      follows.       Section 304(a)(1) requires notification of releases of      extremely hazardous substances listed under EPCRA, if the      release would require notification for hazardous substances      under Section 103 of       Section 304(a)(3) requires notification of releases of      other hazardous substances that are not separately listed as      extremely hazardous substances under EPCRA, if the release      would require notification under Section 103 of       Section 304(a)(2) requires notification of releases of      extremely hazardous substances[[Page S1926]]     listed under EPCRA (but that are not subject to notification      under CERCLA), if three criteria are met.       In this third situation, releases of extremely hazardous      substances listed under EPCRA would require notification      under Section 304(a)(2), if the release:       (A) is not a federally permitted release as defined in      Section 101(10) of CERCLA;       (B) is in an amount in excess of a reportable quantity that      the U.Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designated      under Section 302 of EPCRA; and       (C) ``occurs in a manner'' that would require notification      under Section 103 of                                2421       2421 would amend Section 103(e) of CERCLA to exempt      ``air emissions from animal waste (including decomposing      animal waste) at a farm'' from reporting to the National      Response Center regardless of the quantity of the release of      hazardous substances in air emissions. The bill would not      amend Section 304 or any other provisions of Although      2421 would not amend this statute, the bill would have the      effect of eliminating reporting requirements under Section      304(a)(1) and Section 304(a)(3) of EPCRA for air releases of      hazardous substances emitted by animal waste at farms, in so      far as the terms ``animal waste'' and ``farm'' are defined in      the bill.       Both Section 304(a)(1) and Section 304(a)(3) of EPCRA are      contingent upon reporting required under Section 103 of      Exempting a release from reporting under Section 103      of CERCLA thereby would have the effect of exempting the same      release from reporting under Section 304(a)(1) and Section      304(a)(3) of The April 2017 court decision referenced      in the March 7th CRS memorandum (Waterkeeper Alliance, et      al., v. EPA) described this statutory relationship in terms      of ``a release that triggers the CERCLA duty also      automatically trips the EPCRA reporting requirements in      subsections (1) and (3)'' of Section 304.       2421 would not have a bearing on the reporting of      releases of extremely hazardous substances under Section      304(a)(2) of EPCRA though, as this provision is not      contingent upon reporting required under Section 103 of      If the exemption from CERCLA in 2421 were enacted,      the applicability of Section 304(a)(2) therefore would remain      the same as in current law. An air release of an extremely      hazardous substance emitted by animal waste at a farm would      be subject to Section 304(a)(2) if all three statutory      criteria for reporting were met.       An air release of an extremely hazardous substance emitted      by animal waste would satisfy the first criterion in Section      304(a)(2)(A) if it were not a federally permitted release.      Section 101(10) of CERCLA defines the term ``federally      permitted release'' to mean releases regulated under other      specific laws. Section 101(10)(H) authorizes a federally      permitted release for ``any emission into the air'' subject      to a permit, regulation, or State Implementation Plan,      pursuant to the Clean Air CRS is not aware of the use of      these authorities to regulate air releases emitted by animal      waste upon which a federally permitted release presently      could be based. If such air releases were permitted under the      Clean Air Act, the releases would be exempt from reporting      and liability under CERCLA as a federally permitted release,      and thereby exempt from reporting to state and local      officials under Section 304 of       An air release of an extremely hazardous substance emitted      by animal waste would satisfy the second criterion in Section      304(a)(2)(B) if the quantity of the release were to exceed      the quantitative threshold for reporting that EPA designated      in federal regulation pursuant to Section 302 of For      example, EPA separately listed ammonia and hydrogen sulfide      (substances commonly emitted by animal waste) as extremely      hazardous substances, and designated 100 pounds released      during a 24-hour period as the threshold for reporting under      Section 302 of Air releases of ammonia or hydrogen      sulfide emitted by animal waste in excess of 100 pounds      during a 24-hour period therefore would satisfy this second      criterion in Section 304(a)(2)(B).       An air release of an extremely hazardous substance emitted      by animal waste (e.g., ammonia or hydrogen sulfide) would      satisfy the third criterion of Section 304(a)(2)(C) of EPCRA,      if the release were to occur in the same manner as a      ``release'' that would require reporting under As      outlined in the March 7th CRS memorandum, the term      ``release'' in CERCLA is relatively broad with respect to the      manner in which a hazardous substance may enter the      environment, including spilling, leaking, pumping, pouring,      emitting, emptying, discharging, injecting, escaping,      leaching, dumping, or disposing into the environment. The      term ``environment'' is defined in Section 101(8) of CERCLA      to include surface water, groundwater, a drinking water      supply, surface soils, sub-surface soils, or ambient air.      Section 329 of EPCRA defines the terms ``release'' and      ``environment'' similar in scope to The federal      regulations promulgated under Section 304 of EPCRA reflect      these statutory definitions. Both CERCLA and EPCRA generally      treat emissions into the ambient air as releases into the      environment.       In implementation, EPA has treated the phrase ``occurs in a      manner'' in EPCRA Section 304(a)(2)(C) to mean the nature of      the release in terms of how a substance enters the      environment, not that reporting is required under Section 103      of Otherwise, Section 304(a)(2) would be rendered      meaningless in covering releases of extremely hazardous      substances that do not require reporting as hazardous      substances under CERCLA, while requiring reporting under      CERCLA at the same time.       The March 7th CRS memorandum observed that the exemption      from reporting under Section 103 of CERCLA in 2421 may not      necessarily exempt releases of separately listed extremely      hazardous substances from reporting under Section 304(a)(2)      of The applicability of this provision to a particular      release would depend on whether all three statutory criteria      outlined above are met. Regardless of these criteria though,      Section 304 in its entirety may not apply to air releases      from animal waste at farms if the Trump Administration's      interpretation of the exemption for substances used in      routine agricultural operations is not challenged. 2421      would not have a bearing on this exemption.       Also as noted in the March 7th CRS memorandum, potential      reporting requirements under state or local laws may continue      to apply regardless of an exemption in federal law, as      neither CERCLA nor EPCRA would preempt such state or local      requirements.

33,topic-id,1651,"Mr.President, we are here today to discuss what we call an omnibus bill. I know that ``omnibus'' is another funny-sounding word that we use sometimes here in Washington, but it simply means a bill that covers a lot of topics.  There are provisions in the omnibus legislation that deal with everything from homeland security to the environment to veterans and science, just to name a few. It is particularly fitting that we are discussing an appropriations bill that covers such a wide range of topics, as I come to the floor to recognize the service of a member of our staff who has worked on most of the policies covered in the omnibus legislation--maybe all of them.  Gabrielle Batkin, seated to my left, will probably wish that I wasn't doing this right now, but there is no doubt that she deserves to be recognized for her more than 20 years of hard work in the U.For as long as I have known her, Gabrielle has been an incredibly gracious person--kind, easy with praise, making sure that her own staff and the staff across the aisle were appropriately recognized for their efforts. Now I think she deserves some recognition of her own.  To all of the young staff members who may be watching this right now or to those who aspire to be staff members of the Senate someday, I would present Gabrielle Batkin as a shining example of what it means to be an exceptional staffer and a true public servant.  Every now and then we hear the term ``nameless, faceless bureaucrat.'' This is not a nameless, faceless bureaucrat. This is a beautiful public servant. She works tirelessly and really believes in making government work better for the people that it serves.  Gabrielle and I first started working together back in 2014, when she came to lead my team on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee when I served as its chairman. Then, a little over a year ago, she seamlessly transitioned to her current role as staff director for the minority on the Environment and Public Works This encapsulates just a fraction of her service.  For over a decade, Gabrielle served as an appropriations staff member to former Senator Barbara I think she was the 2 person on Barbara's appropriations team. Gabrielle started on the Appropriations Committtee's Subcommittees on Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and then moved on to the Commerce, Justice, and Science Subcommittee, where she handled everything from NASA to the grasses on the Chesapeake  Before that, she served in the office of the late Senator from New Jersey, Frank She also worked on the House side for Congressman Frank Pallone from New Jersey and also served on the Senate Budget  Gabrielle has worked on everything from blue crabs to the Hubble telescope to cybersecurity and Central Those who know her will confirm that few people can shift between issues or committees as gracefully as she does, while also delivering results every step of the way. The day-to-day functions of the Federal Government are possible because there are people like Gabrielle Batkin who toil away behind the scenes making sure the hard work gets done for the American people.  She has been a tenacious and effective leader on my staff, but she also has what I like to call the ``heart of a servant.'' Even as the boss, Gabrielle is in the trenches when things get tough or hectic around here, and she always takes time to make sure that those who work hard for her are doing Her incredible work ethic, combined with her humility, means that she can be briefing Members of Congress on complex policies one minute and helping an overwhelmed junior staffer staple packets the next. That is just who Gabrielle is.  No matter how stressful her high-pressure career in the Senate was, Gabrielle never let it take her away from her most important job; that is, being the mother to three young men who are up in the Galleries tonight:[[Page S1929]]Henry, Will, and She has always said to me: ``My most important job is being a mom,'' and she is a darn good one. All of her family are up in the Galleries--not all of them, but some of the most important ones--her three sons and her husband Josh of 20 years and her sister Erin, who is, I understand, not just a sister but a great friend, a great aunt, and just a wonderful support system for Gabrielle during the times she has needed it.  I want to thank the three boys and Josh for sharing your mom and your wife with all of the people of our country, and I want to thank Erin for being just a terrific sister and supporter.  A few years back, Gabrielle brought her oldest son Henry to our staff holiday party at the Buena Vista in New Castle, At the time I was talking with Henry, I think he was 12, and I asked him to tell us one thing his mom taught him. Henry told us that his mom tells him all the time that as long as they try to do their best in everything he and his brother do, that is always good enough for her. Think about that. As long as he and his brother do their best, that is always good enough for their mom. She just wants to make sure they do their best.  She has always given us her best for all these years--20 years and counting. I am immensely grateful to Gabrielle for her service to this institution, for her service to the American people, and for her indispensable counsel to me over the past 4 years that I have been fortunate enough to work with her--I like to say ``to work for her.'' She is a great boss and a wonderful friend. I have learned a lot from her and treasure her and her friendship.  While we are sad to see her go, I am excited for her new adventures to come, and I wish her and her family--her husband Josh, and her boys, Henry, Will, and Charlie--all the best in this next chapter of their lives. I know her boys are her biggest fans and are so proud of the work she has done here in the I promise you, she is going to keep making you guys proud.  I will close with this. Every now and then throughout our lives, we meet people and sometimes are even fortunate enough to work with them--people who are just a joy to be with, people who make our days brighter and our workload lighter. I know I speak for so many people when I say that Gabrielle is just that kind of person.  We had breakfast today in the Senate Dining When we walked out, going through the Capitol Building back to our offices in the Hart Building and the Dirksen Building, we passed so many people she knew, people who knew her by name. I am the only person who calls her Gabrielle, which is her real name. Everybody else calls her The janitors, custodians, people running the elevators, the pages--she is Gabby to them.  Sometimes people rise to senior and leadership positions, whether they happen to be elected or members of our staff, and maybe forget where they came from, or maybe they are not the same person they were when they started. She is probably smarter. She started out really smart, but she has gotten even better informed and just a more knowledgeable member of our team as time has gone by.  I will go back to when I interviewed her for the position of staff director on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee when I was chairman. We talked about growing up, going to college, and her influences as a young woman. As it turned out, she went to school in the Midwest, Bradley in  I said: Did you ever work while you were going to school?  I worked a couple jobs while I was going to Ohio I had some help from the As it turned out, she worked full time while she was going to school at Bradley--not that she volunteered this, but I found out later on that she worked full-time for several of those years that she was an undergraduate--I think at the Social Security Administration--and carried a full load and a straight 4.0 average. I think that is amazing. As soon as she said that, I thought, I should be working for you, sister. But she has let me work with her, and we have had a great time and a great run.  I know I speak for the other members of the Environment and Public Works Committee who have an opportunity to see staff--Democrats and Republicans--and a chance to see her handiwork and the magic she brought to the committee. She had a good 1-plus years as a staff director when I was privileged to chair Homeland Security, and everybody--Tom Coburn, my colleague from Oklahoma, and a whole bunch of other people--certainly know her work and salute her.  In the Navy, when people do an especially great job, we have two words that we say: Bravo I certainly say those words this evening to We also have a saying when people are ready to weigh anchor and sail off into the sunrise and go on to their next challenge or next assignment. We always like to say: Fair winds and following seas. I say those words this evening somewhat reluctantly but with a great deal of affection and respect.  Gabrielle, we love you, we will miss you, and we will leave the light on.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

399,topic-id,462,"Mr.President, it is with great pleasure that I rise on behalf of the Delaware delegation to honor the exemplary service of Tony Pratt, administrator of the Shoreline and Waterway Management section within the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Tony has devoted his life's work to preserving our coastal communities and documenting its beauty through his talented photography.  Tony, sometimes known affectionately around Delaware as the Sand Man, is an expert on natural coastal infrastructure including beaches, dunes, and wetlands. He has ensured that Delaware has safe, clean, and broad beaches for its nearly 3 million visitors a year to enjoy. As a leader of the American Shore and Beach Preservation Association, he has an understanding of the complexities facing the coastal resources not just in Delaware, but around our great He is so well respected in his field that, in February 2017, he testified before the U.Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works on the value of beaches, dunes, wetlands, and other natural coastal infrastructure.  Tony has been a key figure in turning around Delaware's beaches from being in a state of chronic erosion in the 1990s, to today serving as a top tourist destination and providing protection during the strongest of storms. These storms have continuously battered the coastline and back bays; however, Delaware coastal communities have fared better than most due to beach renourishment projects and mitigation work in the back bays. Tony has led these efforts not only to try and prepare for the next superstorm, but learn from past storms in order to keep our roads, bridges, homes, businesses, and animal habitats safe from rising waters.  You would be hard pressed to find him behind a desk, especially during a storm. You are more likely to find him standing in the water, investigating the environment, and possibly even taking photos of the beautiful land and sea. He is there for Delaware any time of the day and night, on weekends and holidays. He is personally vested in his work and has somehow maintained that same level of passion for nearly four decades.  On behalf of Delaware Senator Chris Coons and our Congresswoman, Lisa Blunt Rochester, I wholeheartedly thank Tony Pratt for his service to His model leadership and dedication has served to improve our coastal communities and Delawareans' quality of life. We offer Tony our sincere congratulations on a job well done and wish him well as he embarks on the next chapter of his career.  When people in the Navy accomplish extraordinary things in their lives, we say, ``Bravo Zulu!'' Today we are in your debt, and we are deeply grateful, as well, to your family for sharing with the people of Delaware and America for all these years a very good man.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-22-pt1-PgS1943.txt,179,ALLOW STATES AND VICTIMS TO FIGHT ONLINE SEX TRAFFICKING ACT OF 2017,2018.0,22.0,March
1404,topic-id,1355,"Mr.President, I am Tom Carper, and I approved this message.  I have had the privilege of serving on the Environment and Public Works Committee for--oh, my gosh--17 years and now serve as the senior Democrat on the committee. I have had the opportunity of serving with Sheldon Whitehouse for more than half of those years. He is a senior member of our committee, a good friend, and, I think, someone who is respected by Democrats and Republicans and Independents alike here in the He is the junior Senator from Rhode Island, but he casts a long shadow on a lot of issues, none less than the issue we are discussing here today.  I join my friend Senator Coons in thanking Sheldon sincerely for his passion and for his persistence in highlighting what the vast majority of the world recognizes as the greatest environmental challenge of our time, and that is climate change.  Our friend from Rhode Island is a well-known climate champion, but what some may not know is that Sheldon has spent over 500 hours here on the Senate floor in reminding all of us that it is long past time to wake up, that it is time to wake up and get serious about addressing this ever-growing threat. I learned early on in the Senate that if we want to get anything done, we have to be persistent, and we have to stay on message. He has been staying on that message through 200 floor speeches, and the theme has always been ``time to wake up.'' For nearly 6 years now, Sheldon Whitehouse has reiterated what his constituents in the Ocean State and what constituents in our State, the First State, see every day--climate change is real, human beings are making it worse, and it is threatening our economy and our way of life. Those of us living in coastal States also know all too well that we can no longer ignore the issue or wait to take real action.  While our friend from Rhode Island is--what they like to say in Rhode Island--wicked smart, you don't have to[[Page S1671]]take his word for it that climate change is a growing threat, for leading scientists in our country and around the world have been saying this not just for a couple of years but for decades. Scientists and medical professionals have also linked climate change to increased air pollution, deadly high temperatures, and more pests in our food and water--all of which negatively impact our health and disproportionately affect the most vulnerable among us.  These days, you don't need a degree in science or medicine to see the disastrous effect of climate change on the world in which we live. Rising sea levels and extreme weather events from climate change are the new norm. In 2017 alone, we had multiple category 5 hurricanes--I think maybe for the first time in history. We had the second hottest year on record, catastrophic fires in the West, and severe flooding in the These events place extreme burdens on the American people, on our economy, and on our budget, having cost our Federal Government literally hundreds of billions of dollars not over the last 10 years but last year--in 1 year.  The effects of rising sea levels are even more harmful in low-lying, coastal States, like Senator Coons explained that Delaware is the lowest lying State in America, where the highest piece of land in our State is a bridge. There is a combination of things going on in coastal States like ours. In our State, the land is sinking, and the sea is rising. That is not a good combination for Delaware or any other place, and our friends from Rhode Island know of what I speak.  I am delighted that Senator Whitehouse is a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee with many of us because, whether we are discussing environmental policy or infrastructure investments, the Senator from Rhode Island never fails to remind our colleagues of the unique and significant challenges that coastal States face as a result of climate change.  Many people may not know this, but as I said before, you can go to Delaware, the lowest lying You can come with me and drive south on State Highway 1, past Dover Air Force Base, make a left turn on Prime Hook Road, drive to the edge of Delaware Bay, and look across toward New There is a concrete bunker--I don't know--maybe 500 feet out in the water, poking up out of the water. What used to be there at the water's edge was a parking lot, where people used to park their trucks and launch their boats and go out and fish or whatever. That concrete bunker out in the ocean, out in Delaware Bay, used to sit 500 feet west of the dune line. It is now out in the ocean and is largely covered when we have high tide.  I invite my colleagues who deny climate change to visit our Come to Delaware and see firsthand what I just described at Prime Hook Come with us to a place called Southbridge, which is just at the southern edge of Wilmington, DE, or to the roads that are washing out in Odessa, which is about 30 miles south of Wilmington, where the strongest storms have ravaged our beaches and the sea level has risen, as I mentioned earlier, at Prime Hook  One colleague who has been to Delaware more than a few times is Sheldon I like to call him affectionately ``the Whitehouse.'' A few years back, Senator Whitehouse came to the First State to see a spectacular natural event that Delaware is lucky to host every year--the arrival of the red knots. They fly for literally thousands and thousands of miles, from south to north and north to south. They stop for lunch in They eat the eggs of our horseshoe crabs, and they refuel for their journey. Imagine it. They are not this big. They are maybe half the size of the birds that are right here, but they can fly literally thousands of miles--almost 10,000--before stopping to refuel.  Each year, Delaware Bay hosts tens of thousands of tiny but tough birds--the red knots. The red knot regularly migrates some 19,000 miles, it turns out, each year from the southern tip of South America all the way up to the Arctic It stops in Delaware to feed on horseshoe crab eggs and refuel for the rest of its journey. It is an incredible journey for such a small shorebird. Its arrival on our shores is a must-see event, as our friend from Rhode Island can attest.  You might think that a bird as hearty as the red knot, which flies across the globe every year, might be able to escape the effects of climate change, but warming temperatures, ocean acidification, and sea level rise are threatening their food supply and their nesting grounds all along their journey. If nothing else, we should be working together to ensure that our children and our grandchildren will be able to experience natural phenomena like the arrival of the red knots for years, for decades, for centuries to come. We should also recognize that we share a home with these creatures. It is not just our planet; it is their planet too. If we allow climate change to determine their fate, it will undoubtedly determine ours eventually.  I will close with this. I know that fighting climate change is a personal matter for me. I also know that the same is true for our friend from Rhode We are fighting for our constituents' way of life, and our Senator from Rhode Island and I will continue to speak truth to power.  To the climate science deniers who are still out there, I borrow the fitting words of our Ocean State colleague: It is really time to wake up. Climate change is no longer in the distant future; it is here, it is now, and we need to meet that challenge head-on.

Shortly after, he attended Lincoln University where he graduated in 1960 with a bachelor of arts degree. In May 2011, he received an honorary doctorate in humane letters from Lincoln  Before retiring from government service in 1991, Bill served as a confidential assistant to the U.Secretary of Commerce during the Carter administration and later served as associate director of the U.Department of Commerce's Office of Business Liaison, working as an assistant to the secretary. Bill provided years of invaluable service to the Department and embodied what it means to be a public servant.  Bill went on to become vice chair of the Bethune DuBois Institute, and it was in this role that he founded the annual Children's Christmas Dinner Party for disadvantaged children, first held in Washington, In 2004, through the Philadelphia Martin Luther King, Association for Nonviolence, Inc., he orchestrated the first Annual Children's Christmas Dinner Party for underserved children from the Philadelphia and surrounding areas at the Wyndham Franklin Plaza Hotel, which serviced over 3,800 children that year.  As a committed community activist, Bill has dedicated his life to defending others. He has served as president of the Associated Real Estate Brokers of Philadelphia and a board member of the National Negro Business League, the Urban League of Philadelphia, the Philadelphia Chapter NAACP, and many others. His commitment to helping shape his community has been an inspiration to us all.  Bill set the prime example of leadership and courage during his life. His activism and many years of community and public service are significant to many who have been touched by his work. I wish Bill a happy 90th birthday and express my gratitude for all the work he has done.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-04-09-pt1-PgS2011-2.txt,1828,ACADIA NATIONAL PARK BOUNDARY CLARIFICATION ACT,2018.0,9.0,March

633,topic-id,2032,"Mr.President, I rise this afternoon to talk about an issue we have talked about a lot in Washington but frankly haven't done enough about, and that is gun violence. In the next number of hours--certainly all day Saturday--we are going have demonstrations across the country. Young people will be going into local communities, as well as coming to Washington, to march on behalf of those whose lives have been lost and to urge us to take action. The exact name of the effort being undertaken is March for Our We have never seen on this issue--and maybe any other issue--this kind of intense activism that young people have undertaken across the country.  This march on Saturday, March for Our Lives, will be unprecedented in recent American history. I am going to be in the city of Philadelphia, and I know some people will be marching in Washington, as well as in communities across the country.  The focus of the work of young people across the country--starting with the students in Parkland, FL, but growing all across the country in these many weeks--will be taking action, demanding that the U.Senate, the U.House, and any other legislative body that can have an impact on this should take action. That is what they are demanding. I think there are a number of folks in Washington who have wanted to take action for years.  I hope, in response to that activism, in response to those marches, when we come back after our break--and I hope days and weeks after that--that there will be a response here in the Senate and that we will debate the issue or debate one amendment or one bill and then vote on it, and then take the next bill and vote on that, and keep going until we have a number of votes. It doesn't mean that we can be certain of the outcome. In my judgment, the reason to have a vote is to make sure that the American people see us debating this issue and voting on it.  Otherwise, to take no action, to simply say that there is nothing we can do about a uniquely American problem--the other option of course is to surrender, to say that gun violence is just part of American life, we have to get used to it, there is nothing we can do about it, and surrender to the problem. I think most Americans don't want to keep reading that number of deaths that pile up every year. At last count, there were 33,000 gun deaths in 1 year. I don't think many Americans want to settle for that. That is not the America I know. That is not the America most people know.  In America, we take action on tough issues. We tackle them or try to tackle them. We don't surrender to the problem. We don't surrender to one political point of view and say that paralysis leads to no solution. That is not  Back in December of 2012, when Sandy Hook Elementary School was the scene of the kind of horror and carnage that we have rarely seen in American history, there also was that predisposition to just move on and do nothing, to say there is nothing we can do. I was confronted with those questions that same weekend because I knew, in the months ahead, there would be a series of votes. There turned out to be a vote on background checks, a vote on the limitation of high-capacity magazines--in essence, how many[[Page S1902]]bullets can an individual shoot at any one time. That is the reason for the mass casualties. That is the reason we have so many people who die in school shootings or in movie theaters or in nightclubs or in so many other settings, and, most recently, in yet another school. The third vote, of course, was a vote to ban military-style assault weapons.  Knowing I would be facing those votes, which turned out to be in the early part of 2013, I had to ask myself a basic question, and I think this is a question a lot of Americans are asking at times like this: Is there nothing the most powerful country in the world, the most powerful country in the history of the human race, could do to at least reduce the likelihood that we will not have more mass shootings, we will not have more school shootings, we will not go year after year, after 33,000 people lost their lives from gunshot wounds--a number that is likely to grow if we don't take action. That is the choice: Do almost nothing, nothing itself, or take action. That is the fundamental choice we face. That is why we need votes and debates preceding those votes.  It is hard to comprehend that it has been half a decade--5 years--since we had a sustained debate on the floor of the U.Senate on gun violence. We have had intermittent debates. We have had limited discussions. We have had some speeches. I guess all of that is helpful, but we have had no sustained debate on one of the major issues facing the American people.  They don't expect us to solve this problem in a couple of days or weeks, but they do expect us to vote, and they expect us to debate. After 5 years, it is about time we had a sustained debate.  Many of us receive letters on a range of issues, depending on what the issue of the week is or the issue of the month is. I recently received mail in a form we don't see enough of anymore--postcards. These were written by students and individuals too young to even be referred to as students. Here is one that is only age 5. His name is He said in his note to me that he doesn't want to have guns in his school, and he wants me to do something about it. It goes on from there in the short note, and he attached some artwork in the back. That is what Corey said; he doesn't want to have guns in school.  Then there is Mason, who wrote to me and said:       I want to feel safe in school. There should not be guns in      my school.  He goes on to talk about what he is worried about. He said: ``I want to feel safe in school.''  Then, finally, probably the one who summed up these issues the best was a young man by the name of He wrote to me and said:       I am a 5th grader and I don't feel safe because it is too      easy to get a gun permit. I should not know about this stuff.      I don't feel safe.  Then he ended with this question: ``Am I worth it?'' Then Hayden asked again: ``Am I worth it?'' He asked that twice in a postcard where he is just writing a few sentences. Then he put a heart on the other side. In a few sentences, Hayden is summing up the challenge we face in the Senate and across the country. He said twice in the same letter: ``I do not feel safe. . . . I don't feel safe''--something probably most people my age or in my generation, so to speak, never had to worry about.  We didn't think of going to school and being threatened by gun violence. There might have been anxiety in school, there might have been things we were worried about, but this wasn't one of them. This is new, and this was a uniquely American problem. No other country in the world faces this kind of a problem.  We have to ask ourselves if a young person in fifth grade doesn't feel safe because of these mass shootings, and mass shootings in school, and then asks us, ``Am I worth it,'' every one of us in both parties should say: Of course, you are worth it, Hayden is worth the effort to try to keep him safe in school.  If the answer to that question is yes, that he is worth us doing something about it, then you have to ask the question, What am I going to do about it? Are we just going to do what we usually do around here, just don't vote, don't have any sustained debate, and pretend it is not happening because there are forces out there that have a stranglehold on the process that say: You are not even allowed to vote, let alone debate and pass a bill.  There are forces out there that don't even want us to debate the issue, but I think we can do more to respond to Hayden's request and, of course, respond to what young people across the country are demanding.  You have young people who are not old enough to vote yet--and I am not just talking about Hayden and his postcard but all those young people who are coming to Washington and going to town squares in small towns and big cities to march for their lives. Many of them are not 18 years old yet. They can't vote, and they are leading the country, suggesting to us how to vote, demanding that we take action. It is rather ironic that this problem has gotten so bad that young people who still cannot cast a vote are asking us to do our jobs and to vote.  It is not difficult to vote in the U.Usually, you just have to be standing and put your hand up or thumb up or some indication to the individuals in the Senate who record those votes. It is not that difficult. It doesn't require a lot of exertion. It doesn't require a lot of energy. You just have to be on the floor, be standing, and say yes or no. If someone wants to vote against all these gun measures, if they want to vote against background checks and limitation on the high-capacity magazines and still let what we have in American law now, which is a terrorist can get a gun in America--if you want to continue that, fine. That is your choice. That is your choice, but at least vote. At least have the sense of responsibility to vote on a tough issue.  We will have an opportunity to answer the postcard and answer the question Hayden asked--is he worth it? I think he is, and I think we ought to vote.               Developmental Disabilities Awareness Month  Mr.President, I will be brief. I just want to note one of the recognitions of this month. I want to take a moment and remind everyone that March is Developmental Disabilities Awareness  In 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 14 percent of children in the United States have a developmental disability; that is, almost 10 million children. Developmental disabilities include autism, Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, learning disabilities, and many other congenital disabilities.  In the past, we took a rather paternalistic point of view with regard to people with developmental disabilities--taking care of them but not raising them up and fostering their skills and abilities. This was shortsighted on our part.  Today, with the help of such laws as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act--we heard a lot about that referred to by its acronym, IDEA--the Americans with Disabilities Act, so-called ADA, and then my legislation from a couple of years ago, the ABLE Act, each of these pieces of legislation are breaking down barriers to encourage and support people with developmental and all types of disabilities.  People with developmental disabilities contribute numerous benefits to our society. In Pennsylvania, thousands of people with developmental disabilities are working in competitive, integrated jobs at such places as SAP, FedEx Ground, PNC Bank, Giant Eagle grocery stores, and many small businesses throughout the Commonwealth of  People with developmental disabilities make our lives richer and fuller. As we celebrate them, I pledge--I know this is a pledge many in the Senate make--to protect their rights and the rights of all people with disabilities to have equal access to all of our society.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from                              Nominations  ",CREC-2018-03-22-pt1-PgS1892-2.txt,1828,WE MUST PROTECT THE SOVEREIGNTY OF OUR NATION,2018.0,22.0,March

To assist Elina in her efforts, as a senior member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I introduced the Protecting Girls' Access to Education Act, bipartisan legislation that could help millions of young girls across the globe.  Children who are denied an education, because they live in an area that is torn by chaos and war, have little chance of ever attaining a stable existence. Girls, in particular, are subject to exploitation and the pitfalls of human trafficking, violence, and poverty.

1162,topic-id,247,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.4607, the Comprehensive Regulatory Review  I want to thank Chairman Hensarling and the entire Financial Services Committee for their continued critical work on financial regulations.  As chairman of the House Small Business Committee, I consistently hear from Main Street businesses, small businesses from all over the country, that overregulation is preventing business expansion and job growth.  Just last week, I chaired a hearing on a recent report by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office that explored whether financial regulations were adversely impacting community banks and credit unions. One of the major takeaways from that report was that we need to improve the tools available to financial regulators to reduce those burdens.  Because small businesses most often rely on conventional bank borrowing to finance their development, any additional red tape that reduces access to capital can be a monumental problem for the Nation's smallest firms. The bill that we have before us today, which would reform the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996, is a move in the right direction.  Making sure all financial regulators have a comprehensive process in place to review regulations will strengthen our financial sector and make it more possible for America's small businesses to have access to the capital that they need to grow and expand and create more jobs for more Mr.Speaker, I therefore urge my colleagues to support the commonsense reforms that are in H.4607, and I urge them to support this legislation.

1256,topic-id,966,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 762, which provides for the consideration of H.1119, the Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving the Environment--or SENSE--Act, and provides for consideration of H.1917, the Blocking Regulatory Interference from Closing Kilns--or BRICK--Act of 2017.  Mr.Speaker, for many years our domestic energy industry has suffered under unnecessary and politically motivated regulations and burdensome, bureaucratic red tape, prohibiting growth and innovation. President Trump and his administration have been working hard, along with this Congress, to undo the policies which have so harmed our domestic energy industry.  Today's rule allows for the consideration of two bills, which will further those efforts and reform our regulatory framework so our energy producers can do their jobs more efficiently and economically, along with safeguards that will still be in place to protect health and safety. These bills provide a commonsense solution to tailor EPA emission standards, and they provide reasonable compliance timelines for the specific regulated industries.  The first bill, H.1119, the SENSE Act, is sponsored by my colleague, Mr.Rothfus from This bill would provide for targeted modifications to the EPA's Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, MATS, as it applies to coal refuse-to-energy facilities. The EPA has included certain emissions limits in the new standards that are just simply not achievable for these refuse plants.  These specialized power plants have been developed to recycle coal refuse by using it as an energy source to generate affordable, reliable electricity. These facilities have thus far removed 214 million tons of coal refuse from the environment, at no expense to taxpayers.  In addition to helping address coal refuse, these facilities have created an estimated 1,200 direct jobs and 4,000 indirect jobs in areas that have been economically distressed for many years.                              {time}  1230  There are 19 of these coal refuse-to-energy facilities, many of which are at direct risk of being shut down absent passage of the SENSE  The SENSE Act would create a way for coal refuse-to-energy facilities to continue their much-needed work by allowing these plants to demonstrate compliance with EPA's hydrochloric acid standard by using sulfur dioxide as a proxy and assuming that a 93 percent reduction in sulfur dioxide demonstrates compliance with the hydrochloric acid emissions reduction standard.  The bill would still require these coal refuse-to-energy facilities to be subject to emissions limitations and to achieve substantial declines in emissions; but it would do so in a way that these facilities can achieve while also remaining operational, recognizing the crucial role they play in providing energy, and helping to clean up coal refuse sites.  Mr.Speaker, our rule also provides for consideration of H.1917, the Blocking Regulatory Interference from Closing Kilns, or BRICK, Act of 2017 sponsored by my colleague from Ohio (Mr.Johnson). This bill will help preserve America's brickmaking industry and its 7,000 jobs and protects them from an EPA rule that created a far too rushed compliance timetable for businesses across the  The emissions standards in this rule apply to kilns at brick and structural clay products manufacturing facilities and at clay ceramic manufacturing facilities. Industry has estimated the cost of this rule, if allowed to go into effect, would potentially exceed $100 million annually, which is four times higher than what the EPA initially estimated. This is yet one more example of how poorly thought-out and misguided regulations are harming industries and have been a severe hindrance to the kind of job creation we know we can now see unleashed across our  We have got to ensure businesses have time to comply and that regulations make sense. We should not force them into arbitrary time lines that will make them shut down. H.1917 provides that needed time and makes compliance possible.  The BRICK Act also includes the text of the Relief from New Source Performance This legislation was authored by my Democratic colleague from Minnesota (Mr.Peterson). The provision in this bill will help both manufacturers and users of wood heaters by providing relief from overly burdensome and arbitrary time lines that have been imposed by the EPA's New Source Performance Specifically, this bill provides an additional 3 years for businesses to comply with this rule.  Wood heaters are an affordable source of home heating, especially in rural America, and it is critically important that we protect this low-cost source of heating. The New Source Performance Standards for wood heaters, which took effect in 2015, include a provision that is proving nearly impossible, once again, for manufacturers to comply with as they are struggling to design compliant models in the short timeframe allowed by the agency. As a result, we have seen workers laid off and other companies fearing that they will not be able to stay in business after 2020.  Wood heater users in many low-income households across the country face the likelihood of having to pay more and having a reduced product choice. This is one more example of Federal overreach in which the agency failed to take into account the real impact of these regulations on everyday Americans across our country.  It is crucial that we pass the BRICK Act, which would extend the deadline for the second phase of the wood heater standards from 2020 to 2023, and provide time for meaningful judicial review of the Brick and Structural Clay Products: National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants before the owners and operations of these facilities are required to make significant and potentially irreversible decisions regarding capital investments, or driving them out of business altogether.  Mr.Speaker, we must ensure emissions standards are reasonable and do not unnecessarily cripple small businesses, which we know are the drivers of our economy.  Mr.Speaker, therefore, I encourage support for the rule for these important bills, and I reserve the balance of my time.[[Page H1453]]    ",CREC-2018-03-07-pt1-PgH1451-6.txt,99999999999999,RECOGNIZING JESSICA MELNIK FOR HER WORK IN FIGHTING AGAINST SEX,2018.0,7.0,March

1267,topic-id,1869,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I enjoy very much serving on the Rules Committee with all of my colleagues on the committee. One of the things that I am often asked because I am a new Member of this body is: What has surprised me most about being a Member of Congress?  My answer is: Often you see on the outside what looks like a lot of vitriol between the parties, but, in actuality, I believe that every Member of this body is here for the right reasons. They are here because they want to serve the people of their districts, the people of their States, and the people of this  I think it is crucially important, Mr.Speaker, particularly when we are talking about something as sacred as the safety of our children, that we not engage in the kind of partisan attacks, that we not exploit tragedy, that we not engage in the kind of questioning of motives that I just heard my colleague on the other side of the aisle do.  I know my colleague, Mr.Hastings, knows that we may have disagreements, but the reason that I, as a mother, feel so strongly about the Second Amendment is because I want to keep our kids safe. I know he knows that my beliefs about the Second Amendment, though they are different from his, are not based upon any campaign donations and any campaign contributions. I know he knows that they are based very firmly on a fundamental commitment to the importance of the Second Amendment as part of what makes this Nation safe, as part of what makes our individuals secure, and how important it is for us not to use this tragedy to take steps--that may make people feel better--that fundamentally violate our constitutional rights and that won't keep our kids safe.  When you go down the path that we have heard so many on the other side of the aisle suggest we go down, whether they are talking about banning entire classes of weapons, whether they are talking about expanding background checks so that they are somehow universal--our background check system right now is broken. It doesn't work.  We have a situation in which States are not reporting in the way that they ought to report. So when I hear my colleagues on the other side of the aisle suggest that what we ought to do, frankly, is expand a system that is failing and call that progress, I can't help but think that that is pretty much their standard operating procedure: No matter what the policy is, let's expand the broken system, let's ignore whether or not it is really working, and let's call it progress.  Mr.Speaker, I will not be a party to that. I will not be a party in a situation in which we have had tragedy after tragedy, a situation in which in this most recent tragedy law enforcement fundamentally at all levels failed our children. When you have individuals inside of a school who were killed because armed officers outside the school failed to enter, when you have children who are killed because call after call after call to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and to the local law enforcement officials went unheeded because specific tips about this particular individual went unheeded, that is not a time, Mr.Speaker, for us to say: What we ought to do then is prevent law-abiding Americans from having access to the firearms that they need to defend and protect themselves.  I think, Mr.Speaker, if you look at what those on the other side of the aisle are attempting to do with respect to the debate about guns and the debate about school safety, it is critically important for all of us to stand up and say: No, we will not go down a path that is going to violate constitutional rights, that will not keep our children safe, and find some kind of false comfort in that.  When you are talking about the bills that are before us today, Mr.Speaker, we are in a similar situation. We have had 8 years in the Obama administration where they imposed regulation after regulation after regulation in the name of somehow protecting the environment.  Mr.Speaker, President Obama's own EPA Administrator testified in front of Congress that the Clean Power Plan would, in fact, not have any sort of positive impact on the environment or on global temperatures, yet they imposed it anyway, imposing massive costs on our industry in the name, I suppose, of trying to feel better and trying to feel like they are doing something. But what they are really doing is actually putting ourselves in a situation where we are harming small businesses, where we are strangling them, and where we are preventing their ability to grow and to thrive. We know we can do that, Mr.Speaker, in a way that also protects our environment.  Mr.Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues, Mr.Rothfus and Mr.Johnson, for their work on these very important bills.  In Wyoming, Mr.Speaker, we know that our coal and our fossil fuels are national treasures. They are absolutely crucial to providing the power that runs this I am proud of all that we in this body and President Trump together have done to roll back dangerous and ill-advised Obama-era regulations that have been aimed at killing our fossil fuel industry.  We can no longer go down the path of allowing these regulations to exist in a way that devastates industry, puts the fundamental reliability of our electricity and of our energy grid at risk, and achieves no measurable impact for the environment. It is long past time for that indefensible approach to end. That is what we are doing here today.  These are good bills. They are important bills. They will take this next step in rolling back the kind of overwhelming regulation that we have seen, Mr. Mr.Speaker, I urge the adoption of both the rule and the underlying bills.  The material previously referred to by Mr.Hastings is as follows:          An Amendment to 762 Offered by Mr.Hastings       At the end of the resolution, add the following new      sections:       3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the      Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare      the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on      the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.     3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment      of status of certain individuals who are long-term United      States residents and who entered the United States as      children and for other purposes. The first reading of the      bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against      consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be      confined to the bill[[Page H1457]]     and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled      by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on      the After general debate the bill shall be      considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All      points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At      the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the      Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with      such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous      question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and      amendments thereto to final passage without intervening      motion except one motion to recommit with or without      instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports      that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the      next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the      third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,      resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further      consideration of the bill.       4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.3440.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

While in Congress, I have served with nine Presidents during times of conflict and peace. We have debated policies from trade to taxes to terrorism. We have engaged in heated arguments. But even in full disagreement, I believe all our motivations begin at the same point: the sincere desire to serve our States and country.  No one remains in the House or Senate who was here when I first took office in January 1973, but I am particularly thankful for the friendship and leadership of the senior Senator from Vermont, Mr.He and I have fought side by side with each other and sometimes face to face against each other, always with friendship and respect.

It is a tradition in the Senate, like schoolchildren used to do, to sign the drawers of our desks. Senator Stennis signed this desk drawer. He noted the beginning of his service in 1947 and added a dash. He never filled in the date signifying the end of his Senate service in 1989. Perhaps there is symbolism there, that our service does not end when we depart this  I have been honored by this body to serve as chairman both of the Appropriations and Agriculture I am thankful to my colleagues, past and present, and to the committee staff for assisting in crafting responsible funding priorities for our country and for developing strategic agriculture policy to ensure the best use of our natural resources to provide affordable and healthy food for our citizens and people around the world.  I thank my talented and dedicated staff, many of whom have worked for many years in service to our country. All of us in this body know we could not achieve our priorities without exceptional staff. I have staff members who have served the Senate since my first term. I have one staff member, Doris Wagley, who was already in the office working the very first day I showed up for work in the House of Representatives in 1973. Whether they have been here for 45 years or a shorter tenure, I am grateful for their good assistance.  I ran my first Senate reelection campaign in 1984, largely on constituent service. I will always be proud of my State staff for their work on behalf of State staff help us keep our promises to our veterans, find opportunities for small businesses, ensure the elderly or infirmed receive care, and cut through bureaucracy. I am sure members of your State staffs, like my staff, have hearts for their fellow citizens, regardless of their political affiliation.  All our citizens have the right to be heard and to have a voice in their government. I believe our job as their servants is not to tell others what to think or tell others what to do. Our job is to represent them. I have endeavored to do that the best way I possibly could; and now the time has come for me to pass the power granted by the people of Mississippi, the power of service, to someone else.  When John Sharp Williams of Mississippi left the Senate, he delivered a farewell speech at a dinner organized by the Mississippi Society of It is sometimes called the ``Mockingbird Speech.'' While I do not share some of the cynicism of that speech, there are sentiments I can appreciate. Here is an excerpt of that speech given March 3, 1923:       I am going back to Yazoo City and to my old home on a rural      free-delivery route. I want to get up again each morning as I      hear the rooster's crow . . . and as night and the time for      bed approaches, I will listen to the greatest chorus of      voices that man ever heard, music that will charm me and make      me ready for repose, the voices of my mockingbirds trilling      in the trees. And in that way I want to live the rest of my      life, and when the end comes, I hope to be carried out of the      house by my neighbors and laid to rest among my people. Now,      some may say that is not a very wonderful future, all of this      I have mapped out for myself, but I say there is merit in      calm retirement . . . Perhaps it is a sign that I ought to      retire, for retirement brings repose, and repose allows a      kindly judgment of all things.  I will now return to my beloved Mississippi and my family and friends there. I will miss this stately Chamber and this city. I will not miss this power or politics. I will miss people: you, my colleagues. I will treasure your courtesy and kindness. I trust, if your travels bring you to Oxford, MS, you will not hesitate to visit and join me for a refreshment on the porch. We can listen to the mockingbirds together.  Thank you.

780,topic-id,936,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman for his gracious comments. I appreciate the time, and I appreciate the fulsome praise.  I do want to talk just a little bit about process because I think, if you are not on the Appropriations Committee, you probably haven't been able to follow a lot of this. And, frankly, this process can be made better; there is no doubt about it. I suspect, processwise, my friend from Massachusetts and I are not very far apart on where we think it ought to end up. But I do want the full body to understand what we went through to get to this point.  First, it is important to remember that all 12 subcommittees of the Appropriations Committee produced legislation last year. There were full hearings and fulsome debate, and each subcommittee reported out their product. Then the full committee dealt with each subcommittee's report and presentation, and in doing so, all amendments were open from both parties.  Eventually, of course, all those 12 were put into a single bill. There were hundreds of amendments from both sides of the aisle that were made in order in that process. That bill was brought to the House floor in mid-September, and it was passed.  So, the House effectively did all of its work. It did the hearings; it did the markups; it reported it to the floor; and it moved it across the floor. We have been waiting for about 180 days for the Senate to respond. I could point some fingers. I am not going to. They didn't get a single appropriations bill across the floor, and only a few out of the full committee.  We have finally, about 4 weeks ago, had a bipartisan negotiation at the leadership level that reset the numbers: a big increase from the Budget Control Act for defense spending. That is something Republicans very much wanted, and many Democrats did as well. And, frankly, also, an increase from nondefense discretionary spending as well--so new numbers.  At that point, we began what is a pretty normal appropriations process at the committee level. That is the so-called four-corner prospect, when the ranking member of each subcommittee and the chairman of that committee sit down with their Senate counterparts and negotiate the differences between what were effectively Senate committee bills, but bills that the House had moved fully across the floor.  There is a great deal of give-and-take in that. When you go as far as you can to the subcommittee level, you kick them upstairs to the chairman at the next level. They negotiate, and they solve those.  I can give you an example. In Labor-HHS, we had 12 issues unresolved in a $170 billion bill. That is actually awfully good. They were moved up to full committee. Nine of those issues were resolved there. Eventually, three more were kicked up to the leadership level, and they were all resolved there.  That happens for each and every subcommittee. So there is a great deal of give-and-take.  Frankly, we begin this process knowing it needs to be a bipartisan product in the end. You have to have 60 votes in the United States There are 51 Frankly, over here, obviously, they will take both Republican and Democratic votes. So there is a good deal of give-and-take in this particular process.  At the end of the day, we have got a bipartisan bill that both the chairman and the ranking member brought before us last night. Again, as I mentioned earlier, from a Republican standpoint, you are probably most pleased with the defense number. That is something we have wanted and the administration wanted.  But in the nondefense area, there are many, many things that both sides agree on are very important for the national well-being: a $3 billion increase at the National Institutes of Health, the largest increase in a generation; substantially more money on opioids, a crisis we know affects all of our districts, $3 billion this year and $3 billion next year spread over a number of subcommittee jurisdictions.  There is a substantial increase in early childhood education and childcare, something, again, that people on both sides of the aisle feel strongly about. There is lots of money for mental health to follow up on some of the initiatives that were laid out in the 21st Century Cures Act, again, a bipartisan product. Now you are seeing bipartisan appropriations to try and match the money with the legislation that was created by the Committee on Energy and  There is money for school safety. This is probably the largest single increase we have had. I think last year under, title 4, we did about $400 million. This bill has $1.1 billion, a pretty substantial increase in something I think we all care about. So, again, it has been pretty extraordinary.  Also, I want to point out--we are all proud of our respective committees--that Chairman Frelinghuysen and Ranking Member Lowey produced an omnibus last year in April or They have done three supplementals for the disaster relief. They now have produced this omnibus which will fund the government for fiscal year 2018, and they are hard at work on the next one. So they have been extraordinarily productive.  My friend is right. I wish more of this work got piecemeal to the floor so we could look at each bill. Hopefully, we can do that going forward since we now have a top-line agreement between the two sides for fiscal year 2019 as to what the bill will be.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

782,topic-id,1063,"Mr.Speaker, we have the possibility of having a more regular measure. But whether that can be achieved or not, I don't know. In passing this bill, we have at least laid the groundwork for it.  I particularly want to single out Chairman Frelinghuysen and Ranking Member Lowey because they have shown how Congress can work together. They have managed all 12 of these bills--multiple bills in multiple areas--and gotten them to the floor and across the floor in a bipartisan manner.  So, if we can do the same thing in the body as a whole, I think there would be much more appreciation and understanding and, frankly, much more input. That would be a good thing. My friend is right about that. But if we are going to do that, I would also add we have to think through how many amendments there will be.  How much floor time do you want to give us?  If you are going to come down here with 200 or 300 amendments on each side of the aisle, I guarantee you that all you will be doing is appropriations for the whole year. As appropriators, we might like that. As legislators in other areas, you might not. I think there has got to be some leadership give-and-take on what the appropriate structure is going forward.  But none of that should take away, number one, that the rule itself is[[Page H1764]]bringing to the floor an extraordinarily important product. If we don't get that product passed here on a bipartisan basis and in the Senate by midnight tomorrow night, both parties will have participated in shutting down the government of the United I don't think that is something either of us want to do. As a matter of fact, each of us have tried this once or twice, and we now know it is not a very productive way to proceed.  I think we have got an opportunity, by passing of the rule--and I urge passage of the rule--and then the underlying legislation, to do some really good things for the American people to fulfill our obligations.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I guess I would just say to my colleague from Oklahoma that I have no problem with the appropriators. I think that is what Ranking Member Lowey was talking about yesterday when she talked about the process. The appropriators have done their work. They work in a bipartisan way and it is not their fault that we are at this moment. As I said, it is not even the fault of the Rules It is the fault of the Republican leadership.  This bill that we are doing now could have been done last December, but the Republican leadership couldn't figure out a budget agreement until last month. Without top numbers, no one could move forward in the House or in the  It turned out that what was more important was a tax cut for billionaires. That was the priority. So they passed the tax cut for billionaires and we get five CRs and two government shutdowns as a result. This process cannot be explained away, cannot be justified, and cannot continue.  I probably should have had the bill in front of me here for dramatic effect, but it is 2,200 pages long. Again, it is not what I know is in the bill that I have a problem with. It is what I don't know is in the bill that concerns me. I know it concerns Democrats and Republicans alike.  I just want to go back to something the chairman of the Rules Committee referenced with regard to DACA and President Trump's, somehow, support for these incredible people.  Let's not forget there was no reason at all--none--for this President to end There was no deadline, there was no court case, there was no law that required that the program come to an end. It was just plain, old-fashioned cruelty and stupidity. That is what was at play here: red meat for the extreme rightwing base that can never get to ``yes'' on anything regarding immigration.  The way we are treating these young people is unbelievably cruel. The frustration level throughout the country is at an all-time high. Every poll I have seen, Democrats, Republicans, and Independents all overwhelmingly support us helping the DACA recipients. There are unbelievably high approval ratings for moving forward and passing a bill like the Dream Act, yet we can't even get it to the House floor for a vote.  We talk about a lousy process. That is what we are also talking about.  We talked earlier about guns. We have record-high levels of gun violence in this country and we have massacres that occur on a regular basis. I am so grateful that millions of young people are going to be out on the streets protesting on Saturday, demanding that their government do something. They are frustrated that this Chamber, supposedly the greatest deliberative body in the world, can't even find the time to bring something to the floor for a debate. All we do is have moments of silence in the aftermath of massacres.  It would give me hope for the future of these young people, because they are not going to take it anymore. They are sick of the indifference. They are sick of the lack of action. They are sick of Members in this Chamber not listening to their voices.  I feel hopeful that, ultimately, we will take action and do the right thing. I will tell you right now, for those who continue to turn their backs on the demands of these young people, I don't think they are coming back here after  But, again, the frustration that you are hearing on our side here today--and I know that a lot of my Republican friends feel the same way--is that this place is broken. This process stinks. There has to be a better way to do this. None of us want to shut the government down.

23,topic-id,1001,"Mr.President, I want to make three points in response to the objection that was raised by my friend and colleague from Washington  The first is timing.  According to the Senator from Washington, we have all the time in the world. Regrettably, that is not true.  Starting next month, insurers are beginning their calculations on what rates they are going to charge for insurance policies on the individual market next year. They are also making the decision as to whether they are even going to sell in particular counties across this country. There is already not much competition, so the time is urgent for us to act. Those rates get approved by the State insurance commissioners, and they are published on October 1. So the idea that we have tons of time to take care of this problem is just not accurate.  Indeed, as Senator Alexander just said, the chairman of the HELP Committee, the HELP Committee has spent months on these concepts, has worked really hard on these issues, and has had extensive hearings and roundtables and discussions. The one thing we do not have is time, and that is why the National Association of Insurance Commissioners has urged us to act on this bill.  The second is the concept that somehow this bill has brandnew concepts in it. The only thing that is new is the amendment that was just filed by the Senator from Washington I have no idea what is in that. It was not shared with me. To my knowledge, it was not shared with the Senator from I have no idea whether it covers cost savings reductions that help our lowest income people pay their copays and deductibles. I have no idea what it does to silver-loading, whereby insurers jack up the prices of silver plans in order to draw down more Federal dollars. I have no idea what it does on a whole variety of issues because I have never seen it.  By contrast, the language of the Collins-Alexander proposal was shared with the minority. Indeed, I have had several discussions with the Senator from Washington State about the language, and all of the concepts in our bill have been debated. Hearings have been held on them. They have been talked about extensively. They are not new. There was a change in the reinsurance provisions, which I authored with my friend and colleague, the former State insurance commissioner from Florida, Senator Nelson, and that was to add a third year to the reinsurance.  I would have thought my Democratic friends would have been thrilled with that--a third year. That was at the suggestion, I would say, of Congressman Costello and Congressman Walden in the  We also put in a Federal backstop so every State could be assured of the benefits of reinsurance in the next year, even if they had not had time to file the application for a waiver under section 1332. Again, that is a concept my Democratic friends were pushing for us to include. It was one that I, frankly, had reservations about, but that is in there. So those are two changes in the reinsurance that our Democratic colleagues, I would think, would be applauding because it helps to drive down rates.  Third, I hear from my Democratic colleagues that this is an enormous change in the application of the Hyde amendment because it applies to commercial insurers. That is just not true. The Hyde amendment already applies to the Federal Employees Health Benefits That is the insurance program for 8.3 million Americans who are Federal employees, spouses, or family members of Federal employees, or retired Federal employees--8.3 million. How does the Presiding Officer think that program is administered? The answer is, it is administered through commercial insurers like Blue Cross Blue Shield, United Health Insurance, and many others. This is not the first time, and the language actually for the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program is more strict than what is in the bill we have proposed. So the idea that this is some new approach is just not accurate.  The Federal Government spends about $1 trillion on healthcare through various programs--its share of Medicaid, Medicare, VA programs, the Children's Health Insurance Program, the TRICARE Program, the Federal Employees Health Benefits It is about $1 trillion. Guess what. That is 100 times more than the amount that is covered in this bill--100 times more. So this is not a new concept in any way.  The reinsurance provisions and the cost-saving reductions have been discussed for months in the HELP Committee, both formally in hearings where, by the way, there was widespread support for them and in informal roundtables and in Senator-to-Senator discussions.  Make no mistake about the stakes here, if we do not act--and it appears, due to the objection on the Democratic side, that we are not going to act--insurance rates will go up on October 1. That is going to hurt everybody who has to buy insurance who wants to be insured and has to buy through the individual market because they don't get insurance through the workplace. That is going to hurt very low-income people. That is also going to hurt those who receive no government help at all and do not have employer-provided insurance because they are self-employed.  Why don't we want to take advantage of this opportunity to decrease insurance rates by as much as 40 percent over the next 2 years?  Do you know how welcome that would be by the people in my State of Maine? Maine is a low-income We don't have Microsoft headquarters in the State of We are a low-income We need insurance rates to fall. This bill would do it. Oliver Wyman, the well-respected healthcare consulting firm, has verified that rates would fall. The CBO says premiums would be less, and Oliver Wyman says 3.2 million more people would be insured. Surely--surely--this should be a goal we can all embrace.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2018-03-22-pt1-PgS1919.txt,2121,"LINN, AND MATTHEW BELLINA",2018.0,22.0,March

I saw from the start that this gentleman from Mississippi was so bright, insightful, and creative yet also humble, kind, and devoted to helping others. He treated everyone with such dignity. He was nice to everyone, from the elevator operators to the highest officials around the world. He truly is one who leads by example.  Those qualities are his legacy, and I have seen them time and again as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee when Thad was an important member and, of course, when he became the chairman.[[Page S1896]]  Last year was the 150th anniversary of the creation of the Appropriations Committee, and Thad marked that occasion by reminding all of us of our great responsibility to make thoughtful and informed decisions in the allocation of public funds. In managing appropriations bills, he was always so inclusive, willing to incorporate ideas and priorities from everyone who could make a persuasive case. The fact is, Thad has always placed careful consideration and compromise above partisan politics. That really reflects how Thad has led his life.  He has excelled at everything he has ever undertaken. When he joined the Boy Scouts, he became an Eagle In his high school, he was valedictorian. In college, he had the highest scholastic achievements. He excelled in serving in the Navy, and, of course, we know how much he has accomplished as our esteemed and dear colleague here in the  When Thad served as chairman of the Appropriations Agriculture Subcommittee, he traveled to the State of Maine with me, and we met with Maine's potato farmers and blueberry growers--not exactly staple crops of Thad listened intently to these farmers and growers. It was clear that he cared about them and that he valued our family farms and our rural communities.  That night, we had a lovely Maine lobster dinner at an inn on the coast. During that dinner, Thad shared with me his passion for good literature, his love of music, and his passion for education that had been instilled in him by his parents.  Of course, another issue that brought Thad and me together was making sure that our naval fleet was strong. As a U.Navy veteran who served for a time in Boston, MA, Thad has always been a dedicated advocate for his shipyard in Mississippi, as I am for Bath Iron Works in the State of Thad has twice visited BIW with me to see the great work done there.  In 2013, Thad received the Navy's Distinguished Public Service Award in recognition of his longstanding commitment to American sea power.  Through four decades in the Senate, plus three terms in the House of Representatives, Thad has compiled an admirable legislative record on issues ranging from education to libraries, the arts, our national defense, scientific and biomedical research, conservation initiatives, and civil rights. But perhaps his greatest legacy is that he taught us how a Senator should act, and that legacy will live on forever.

643,topic-id,3833,"Mr.President, we have the opportunity today to take immediate action to lower the cost of health insurance by as much as 40 percent and to increase the affordability of insurance for millions of Americans who purchase plans in the individual market.  I commend Senator Alexander, the chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, for his extraordinary leadership and hard work in this area.  I am also very pleased with the work that has been done by Representative  Greg Walden, the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Representative  We have come together, along with a substantial number of our colleagues, including Senators Graham, Rounds, Isakson, and Murkowski, among many others, on this very important insurance stabilization and rate reduction package.  Let me begin by outlining the major provisions of what it is that we are proposing, because there has been, unfortunately, a lot of misunderstanding and, dare I say, misinformation.  First, our legislation, based on the Alexander-Murray bill, would fund the cost-sharing reduction subsidies for 3 years. These are vital for Americans who have incomes that are below 250 percent of the poverty level. CSRs provide government assistance to help them pay for their deductibles and their copays.  Second, our proposal also improves the ability of the States to take further steps to lower insurance premiums for their citizens. We provide meaningful flexibility for States by revising section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act, which authorizes State innovation waivers.  Third, based on a bill that I authored with Senator Bill Nelson, our proposal provides a total of $30 billion over 3 years for States to have reinsurance, or invisible high-risk pools, by applying for a waiver under the section 1332 program I just mentioned.  As I know the Presiding Officer well knows, reinsurance is a proven method for dealing with high-risk, expensive claims. It reduces uncertainty and has benefits not only for those who have preexisting conditions and need expensive healthcare but for the entire individual market, and it has been proven to work in States like Maine and  We have also included $500 million to assist States with the planning of the designs of their own reinsurance, or invisible high-risk pools. In the House, the Costello bill also had a Federal fallback in recognizing that we were late in the year and that we wanted to provide help immediately, which we have included for 2019, to give States[[Page S1909]]time to apply for waivers under section 1332.  What does our bill not do?  Our proposal does not change the Affordable Care Act's essential benefit requirements. It does not change the guarantee that an individual will be able to buy insurance. It does not change the protections for people with preexisting conditions. Yet it ensures that the Federal funding directly benefits consumers and not insurance companies.  In considering this plan, Congress faces a fundamental question: Do we want to take action to significantly reduce the cost of health insurance for millions of Americans or are we just going to sit back, say no, and let this opportunity pass us by?  Time is short. If Congress fails to act, insurance rates in the individual market will skyrocket this fall. This will directly harm the 9 million Americans who pay for their own insurance without government or employer assistance. That is, for example, the fisherman in my State who is self-employed, the electrician, the plumber, the carpenter--there are so many--the hair stylist. They are already paying far too much for their healthcare costs. Well, all of them will be facing another double-digit premium increase if they are to be insured, and rates can only be expected to continue to climb.  Healthcare premiums are already too expensive under the Affordable Care That is one of the problems with the Affordable Care Act that I have been committed to fixing. Last year, the average price of the Affordable Care Act silver plans, which are the most popular plans, increased on average by 34 percent. A growing number of counties in our country are at risk of having no insurers or only one insurer, leaving hard-working individuals with few or no choices for health insurance coverage. Inaction will only exacerbate the premium spikes and the market instability we have already experienced.  When our country is confronted with such a serious problem--I mean, what is more important to people than healthcare?--Americans expect us to come together. They expect us to work constructively. They expect us to provide real relief from the rising cost of health insurance, which makes health insurance unaffordable for far too many Americans, and that is precisely what our plan would do.  Let me be crystal clear. Our proposal is the last opportunity--the last opportunity--to prevent these rate increases that will go into effect, which will be announced on October 1. Our package will help to stabilize the insurance markets and make them more competitive.  Every study has shown that our bill would make health insurance more affordable. According to the leading healthcare experts at Oliver Wyman, our bill would lower individual health insurance premiums in the individual market by as much as 40 percent compared to what people will otherwise pay if Congress fails to act. According to Oliver Wyman, it would also expand coverage to an additional 3.2 million  I want to touch on a complicated but important issue that some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have raised as a reason not to pass this bill. There have been two reasons. One is the application of the Hyde amendment, which has been law for decades, which I will talk about subsequently, but the first has to do with what is referred to as silver-loading and zero-premium bronze plans.  First a little background. The Affordable Care Act was designed to provide two key subsidies for enrollees who purchased coverage on the exchange and qualified from an income standpoint. The first are premium tax credits to help cover the cost of premiums for individuals earning between 100 and 400 percent of the Federal poverty level. The second are cost-sharing subsidies, or CSRs, to help cover the cost of deductibles and copays and other out-of-pocket expenses for individuals who are very low-income--earning between 100 and 250 percent of the Federal poverty level.  Despite the fact that Congress never appropriated the funds to pay for the cost-sharing reductions, the Obama administration paid them anyway. The House sued to block this strategy and won in Federal district court.  Lacking an appropriation from Congress, President Trump stopped making these payments last year. That concerned many of us, but let me make clear--he was following the court's decision. In response, insurance companies came up with the silver-loading strategy, under which they increased the price of their silver plans to compensate for the cost-sharing reduction payments they were no longer receiving. In essence, insurers have created silver plans that mimic CSRs for low-income enrollees. Because the ACA's tax credits are tied to the silver plan premium, the tax credits ballooned in size, producing credits so large that they are often sufficient to fully cover the premiums on the bronze plans for lower income enrollees and, by the way, greatly increased the cost to Federal taxpayers, which is why the bill we put together, by right-sizing the market and avoiding the games that were played, actually pays for itself.  We all remember the old saying that ``if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.'' Well, free bronze plans for low-income individuals sounded too good to be true, and they are. I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are listening to this explanation. The fact is that free bronze plans are only a good deal for low-income Americans who never get sick, who never get hurt, who never need to use their insurance. If they do, they will pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars more out of pocket.  While these plans might have lower monthly payments or even be free, they have much higher deductibles and copays. Based on publicly available data pulled from the exchanges, I am going to describe an example illustrating that individuals with free bronze plans will face much steeper costs when they try to access care than if they paid the small premium for the silver plan.  Let's take the example of Chris and Caroline, ages 34 and 32, who live in Portland, They bought coverage on the exchange for themselves and their two young children for 2018. They make about $34,500 a year, which is about 140 percent of the Federal poverty level. They saw that they could get a ``free'' bronze plan, or they could choose to buy the cheapest silver plan for $54.83 a month. They chose the free bronze plan, not realizing that the silver plan would have given them access to subsidies, which provide lower deductibles and copays to low-income people. If Caroline gets pregnant this year and they are under the free bronze plan, they are going to have to pay out of pocket $7,350--and they make $34,500 a year. Had they picked the least expensive silver plan, they would have had to pay $500.  Consider a hypothetical couple in their early thirties, Jacob and Emma, with two young children, living in Seattle, They are making just under $35,000 a year. When they went shopping for coverage on the exchange, they, too, saw that they could get a free bronze plan, or they could buy the least expensive silver plan for about $84 a month. Jacob and Emma chose the free bronze plan, which doesn't come with the subsidies included in the silver plan to help low-income families with deductibles and copays. If someone in this young family faces a serious illness this year, the silver plan in Washington State would have capped Emma and Jacob's additional expenses at $660. Unfortunately, they have the so-called free bronze plan that some of my colleagues have been touting. They would face up to $7,210 in out-of-pocket expenses--hardly an affordable option for this low-income family.  It used to be well understood by the affordability advocates in and out of the Senate that low-income Americans struggled to meet deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses. Just 1 year ago today, the Kaiser Family Foundation issued a report arguing against the House reform bill because it did not contain CSRs, noting that ``cost-sharing reductions are a key part of the financial support currently provided to [low-income] enrollees'' and that without such support, deductibles ``are often out of reach for people with lower and modest income.''  A prior Kaiser Family Foundation report from 2015 showed that only 1 in 10 individuals earning between 100 and 250 percent of the Federal poverty level--those are the individuals who would be eligible for CSRs under our bill--has savings or other assets large enough to cover a $6,000 deductible. In other[[Page S1910]]words, without CSRs, 90 percent of these individuals will have to wipe out their savings to cover their medical expenses before they even meet their deductible. Those who can't meet their deductible won't get reimbursed. For these Americans, a zero-premium plan will really mean a zero-benefit plan.  I cannot believe that silver-loading and free bronze plans is a credible long-term strategy. First, I would note, in addition to the examples I have given, that CBO assessments from last year were that the silver-loading strategy would cost the Federal taxpayers $194 billion over the budget window. Second, because low-income individuals will struggle to meet their deductibles, they will be unable to secure reimbursement of expenses. Sooner or later, taxpayers are going to be asking why they are paying nearly $200 billion more to subsidize policies that deliver such poor benefits.  To be clear, the amendment we are offering prevents this strategy, protecting lower and modest-income enrollees, low-income families and individuals and the taxpayers.  Now, let me discuss the Hyde amendment. I am disappointed, to say the least, that Democrats, who ought to have embraced this proposal, have instead rejected it because its funding is subject to the Hyde amendment. As a pro-choice Republican, I must say this puzzles me. The Hyde amendment has prohibited the use of taxpayer dollars to pay for elective abortions for more than 40 years. It is not new policy. The entire Labor-HHS title of the omnibus before us today is subject to the Hyde amendment.  There are variations of the Hyde amendment in other titles of the omnibus spending bill. It applies to a long list of Federal programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, TRICARE, Veterans Affairs, Indian Health Service, the Peace Corps, the Bureau of Prisons, Immigration and Customs I have heard it said that it doesn't apply to commercial insurance that is offered by the Federal Government--that is just not true. It applies to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, through which 8.3 million employees, retirees, and their families get their health insurance coverage. I have not seen my Democratic friends make any effort to change the applicability of Hyde to that insurance program.  Together, these programs account for more than $1 trillion in government spending each year--all of which is covered by the Hyde amendment. That is 100 times the amount of reinsurance we are proposing in our amendment. A trillion dollars of Federal healthcare funding is already covered by the Hyde amendment, which has been policy for 40 years. So how is this, in any way, a radical departure from current policy?  I find it frustrating that some on the other side of the aisle are choosing to block this important package that will provide relief to those who need it most because of the application of the Hyde amendment. Let me say, they cite the Stupak amendment, which is section 1303 of the Affordable Care We leave that in place, we don't touch it, and we do not change the Hyde amendment's exemptions found in section 507, which allow private entities, State governments, or individuals to use their own funds to provide coverage for abortion. In other words, this is nothing radical or new, and it is baffling and gravely disappointing that this should be used to block this package.  Dozens of healthcare consumer and business groups, as well as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners--those State commissioners whose job it is to look out for consumers--have called upon Congress to take action to lower premiums for millions of Americans and their families. These groups include the American Hospital Association, Blue Cross Blue Shield, the U.Chamber of Commerce, the American Medical Association, the American Cancer Society, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the Federation of American Hospitals, and there are a wide range of groups representing people with diseases, such as arthritis, cancer, epilepsy. The United Way has called for action, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the American Lung Just yesterday, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners put out a new letter in support of market stabilization.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that these three letters be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  Mr.President, how incredibly disappointing it would be if some Members derailed this serious effort to reduce the cost of health insurance for millions of While Members may disagree with certain provisions, the time has come for each and every Senator to decide: Are you for lower rates and more affordable coverage for the 18 million Americans who get their insurance from the individual market or are you content to just sit back and let their insurance rates soar once again this fall, making health insurance even less affordable than it already is?  In my view, the answer is clear and obvious. We must not lose sight of our goal, and that is making health insurance more affordable for millions of Including our insurance package in the omnibus funding bill is the right thing to do, and it is urgent that we do it now.  Thank you.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         National Association of Insurance Commissioners & The            Center for Insurance Policy and Research,                                                   March 21, 2018.

Senate, Washington,     Patty Murray,     Ranking Member, Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions          Committee, U.Senate, Washington,     Susan Collins,     U.Senate, Washington,       Dear Chairman Alexander, Ranking Member Murray, and Senator      Collins: Members of the National Association of Insurance      Commissioners (NAIC) continue to urge congressional support      for health insurance market stabilization reforms and applaud      the Senate leaders who have worked across the political aisle      to advance them. If Congress does not act to stabilize health      insurance markets, continued uncertainty regarding federal      funding, the health of the risk pool, and regulatory      requirements will result in even higher premiums and,      possibly, fewer carriers participating on the exchange--     perhaps even bare counties.       This is why commissioners from across the political      spectrum have contacted their congressional delegations,      testified before House and Senate committees, and urged      federal policymakers to take immediate action to stabilize      the health insurance markets.       Specifically, state regulators support market stabilization      reforms that would:       Provide federal funding for reinsurance programs to address      the deteriorating risk pools;       Fully fund cost-sharing reduction (CSR) payments that are      owed to insurance carriers that provide low-cost sharing      plans to lower-income enrollees; and,       Make the Section 1332 waiver process more streamlined and      predictable for states.       These concepts have received bipartisan support and,      contrary to some rhetoric, are in no way a ``bailout'' of the      insurance industry. They directly benefit consumers and help      stabilize the risk pool. CSR payments reimburse carriers for      providing a lower cost version of their Silver plans to      eligible consumers, and establishing reinsurance funding      acknowledges that the risk pools in many states are much      sicker than anticipated and help is needed to backstop      markets that might otherwise cease to exist in some counties.      Section 1332 waiver flexibility will provide states clearer      guidance and quicker action to address their market      realities, while preserving guardrails to protect consumers.      And finally, the Senate rightly acknowledges that ``sales      across state lines'' are best left to the states in the form      of interstate compacts.       As insurance commissioners, we attempt to assess these      reforms with an apolitical perspective, but we recognize that      the political process in Washington does not always allow for      a perfect result. What is clear, however, is that without      these reforms markets across the country will continue to      deteriorate, and consumers will pay the price for this      inaction. We applaud Senators who have worked to advance      these reforms and we urge all Members of Congress to support      them and stabilize health insurance markets for our nation's      consumers.

In the      coming months, insurers will set plan rates for 2019 and a      shaky marketplace will likely result in premium spikes--     putting health insurance out of reach for many patients and      families.       Several bipartisan proposals under consideration could      preserve and even expand access to affordable health      insurance for middle class families. They include cost-     sharing reduction policies that could improve affordability      for low-income Americans and the creation of a reinsurance      program to help keep premiums stable for those with pre-     existing conditions. We urge Congress to move swiftly, so      that plans on state exchanges can stabilize, and perhaps      lower, premiums for the millions of Americans who will turn      to the marketplace for coverage next year.       Both parties in Congress have pledged to protect people      with pre-existing conditions, but recent regulatory actions      taken by the Trump administration to expand association and      short-term health plans could undermine existing protections.       Recent data indicates that the number of Americans who are      uninsured is on the rise again for the first time since 2008.      At the end of 2017, 12.2 percent of U.adults lacked health      insurance--up from 10.9 percent at the end of 2016, an      increase of 3.2 million people.

We came together earlier this month to stress the      importance of congressional action to lower healthcare      premiums. Time is running out.       In the next few weeks, health insurance providers will      begin to file premium rates for 2019 in the individual      market. In October, individuals and families who buy their      own coverage will review their options, see their premiums,      and make their choices. Without Congressional action now, the      plans offered to Americans will be nearly 30 percent more      expensive than they would be otherwise.       Congress is working on an omnibus appropriations bill that      it must act on by March 23. As providers of health care and      coverage to hundreds of millions of Americans, we urge you to      ensure that bill includes elements that will reduce premiums,      improve affordability, and improve the individual market for      2019 and beyond:       Establish a premium reduction/reinsurance program to help      cover the costs of people with significant health care needs.       Provide multi-year funding for cost-sharing reduction (CSR)      benefits.       According to independent analyses by Avalere Health and      Oliver Wyman, enacting both legislative provisions could      lower premiums by up to 21% in 2019 and increase enrollment      and expand coverage to over 1.5 million By 2020,      premiums could be 40% lower with an additional 2.1 million      Americans enrolled and covered. Moreover, this legislation      will help physicians and hospitals better serve the health      care needs of patients in their community and lower costs for      businesses that provide coverage to their employees.       Time is running short. We urge you to deliver on the      promise to reduce premiums for millions of Americans and      their families.

It is a commitment that is shared by dedicated educators and staff, involved parents and community members, and enthusiastic students.  Public education has had a profound impact on our Nation's history and continues to shape our future. Nine out of 10 students in the United States attend public schools. Last year, our public high schools achieved an alltime high graduation rate of 83 percent, and nearly 70 percent of our high school graduates went on to higher education. Public schools both inspire students and give them tools to achieve their dreams.  Not only do our public schools create lifelong learners, but they also help to foster active citizenship. In addition to academics, athletics, and the arts, schools throughout Maine offer programs to encourage environmental responsibility, civic engagement, and community service. I am so proud that every Veterans Day and Memorial Day, schools throughout my State hold assemblies to honor the men and women of their communities who served our Nation and defended our freedom.  Our schools have become so much more than places where children are taught. From nutritious meals to health and emotional support services, public schools play a vital role in the lives of our young people.  Education has been described as ``not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a flame.''

This bill would require the Director of the Office of Personnel Management to issue a report to Congress on the use of social media checks in background investigations for security clearances.  In recent years, a number of agencies have begun pilot programs to help develop the best methods of incorporating social media into those background checks. For example, the Army initiated a pilot program that found that while checking social media is a[[Page H1417]]valuable tool, it can be costly and may raise some legal issues.  This bill would require that OPM conduct a comprehensive study on those issues and report back to the This one-time report would describe the current uses of social media postings for investigative purposes and any legal concerns or impediments that may arise. In addition, the report would summarize the results of any pilot programs on the use of social media conducted to date and provide cost estimates for implementing their widespread use in background investigative processes.  The report would greatly assist Congress, I believe, in determining whether further legislative action is needed when it comes to the Federal Government's use of social media in background investigations.  This bill was approved without opposition by our committee, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, last year, and I certainly commend it to our colleagues today.

1852,topic-id,365,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, the bill before us is H.1132, the Political Appointee Burrowing Prevention Act, as amended.  I want to thank my friends on the majority for working with us to improve this bill since its consideration by the committee. Because of the improvements we have been able to make, I support moving this bill forward in the legislative process; however, I continue to believe that some further changes may be needed.  The bill would make it very difficult to hire former political appointees into career positions in the Federal It would prohibit hiring a former political appointee into a career position for 2 years after that individual held a political position.  It would also add significant hurdles for agencies seeking to hire an applicant to a career position who separated from a political appointment in the last 5 years. The agency would be required to certify to the Office of Personnel Management that the appointment is ``necessary to the agency's ability to meet its mission.''  There are several controls already in place to ensure that the process used to hire former political appointees into career positions is fair, open, and based on merit. For example, the Office of Personnel Management must ensure, right now, that the appointment process was free from political influence and report the results of its reviews to  A February 2017 report found that OPM reviewed just 16 requests by agencies to hire former political appointees from October 1, 2016, through January 20, 2017, and did not find any reason to deny any of those requests.  We all want the best people in the Federal service, and there should be no undue favoritism in the hiring process.  In comments on this bill, OPM suggested that certain provisions may conflict with the merit system principles that have formed the basis of the Federal civil service for over a century.

951,topic-id,1687,"Mr.President, I rise in this historic Chamber to offer my thanks, my respect, and to pay homage to an incredibly valued member of my staff who is about to retire from the U.Senate after decades of dedicated service.  A New Englander by birth and a Delawarian by choice, Mary Ann Kelley has served as my deputy scheduler now for 7 years and is due to retire tomorrow, March 9.  Mary Ann Kelley--or MAK, as she is affectionately called in my office--started a career with the U.Senate way back in December 1990 as a staff assistant for then-Senator Joseph Robinette Biden, Except for a break in service, Mary Ann served on Senator Biden's team until he resigned to become Vice President in 2009. She stayed on through the tenure of Senator Ted Kaufman and joined my scheduling team late in 2010.  In her having served now three U.Senators, Mary Ann brings a breadth of knowledge and experience to my front office and scheduling team. She helps to maintain my schedule, helps to organize and evaluate and to track hundreds of invitations and scheduling requests to coworkers and constituents. Mary Ann's professionalism and business acumen are unwavering and valued. She always maintains her composure despite the stress and sometimes craziness this unique position offers. My team in Delaware appreciates her ready wit, balanced judgment, and calming presence.  Krista Brady, my talented casework manager, said:       MAK adds that something extra Irish to the office. Every      morning, she comes in wearing her snazziest outfit, drinking      her cappuccino from Starbucks, and ready to tell a funny      story.  Krista reminded me about Mary Ann's love for cats, her famous Halloween mask, her curry chicken, and,[[Page S1568]]of course, her wicked New England spirit.  Mary Ann's story is rooted deeper than in just her years of Senate service. MAK's authenticity, personality, and devotion to friends and family make her a staff favorite and valued member of my team. To properly honor Mary Ann, let me share some details about her background and her persona.  A graduate of Cardinal Spellman High School and Framingham State University, Mary Ann was born and lived in Massachusetts until she moved to Delaware in 1979. Ask MAK about her hometown, and she will quickly chime in with ``Brockton, MA--home of Rocky Marciano and Marvin Hagler!'' Thanks to Rocky and Marvin, world heavyweight and middleweight boxing champions, Brockton is recognized as the City of  If Rocky and Marvin are Brockton's boxing champions, Mary Ann is the city's undisputed world champion in cooking, whether it be baking, roasting, or toasting. Like Rocky and Marvin, Mary Ann has a passion and talent for her own chosen sport, one that she has practiced and refined over many years. Marvin Hagler explained what makes a winner, and what Mary Ann did to become a well-seasoned top chef is the same thing. Marvin Hagler, the boxer, once said, ``Every fighter has got [to] be dedicated, learn how to sacrifice, know what devotion is all about, make sure you're paying attention and studying your art.''  Mary Ann learned to cook at an early age. She will say that she was born with a love of cooking. This interest is something she has pursued through her college years and into today. She earned a bachelor's of science in food and nutrition from Framingham State in 1967 and subsequently mentored and educated students as a home economics teacher for 5 years. Mary Ann taught classes on food, nutrition, and, of course, cooking.  Over the decades, our very own MAK perfected a wide range of delicacies to soothe and feed family, friends, and fellow Often, the people she fed and cared for were through her efforts at the Ministry of Caring in Wilmington, Mary Ann worked for a decade as the head chef at the Ministry of Caring, a community-based nonprofit that provides a network of social, health, and support services for those who are living in poverty or who are homeless. Mary Ann used her professional education, her faith, and her experience to feed the souls of people and provide them comfort through food served at the Ministry's Emmanuel Dining  When Mary Ann returned to the Senate after her break in service, she rallied her coworkers to volunteer and serve food monthly at the Emmanuel Dining Room, where I, too, have volunteered. When I took office as a Senator, we continued this outreach, and it served as a great opportunity for my casework team and others to connect with constituents.  Besides MAK's involvement with the Ministry of Caring, for many years, she owned and operated her own excellent business, Creative Catering To this day, she still receives catering requests and calls from friends for cookies, cakes, and other treats. Mary Ann's depth and variety of dishes are unique and storied. Staff favorites include MAK's mouth-watering filet mignon, cranberry coffee cake, Irish cake, banana pudding, and a wide variety of pound cakes. Lynne Phifer, my intern coordinator, speaks highly of Mary Ann's homemade oatmeal cookies and other confections. Lynne and the rest of the team, however, are unanimous in their vote for MAK's curry chicken.  Mary Ann's food is influential and, I would say at times, even transcendent. I am confident, if MAK's menu had existed in earlier times, it could have changed the course of history as we know it. If this sustenance had been available in 1775, Founding Father Patrick Henry may have exclaimed, ``Give me Mary Ann's curry chicken or give me death!''  Mary Ann goes to great lengths, in all seriousness, to prepare meals for those she loves. She gets the best and freshest ingredients. Some on my staff remember the day Mary Ann returned from her lunch break with a half dozen lobsters--the main course for a dinner prepared in honor of her son's birthday.  Desiree Burritt, my immigration case worker, who also worked for Senators Biden and Kaufman before me, said:       Mary Ann has always been our in-house chef, always there to      pull up a chair, quick to smile, laugh, and listen. MAK is      like a mother to all of us.  Mary Ann may not know just how much she inspires and influences those around her. I have been moved to hear and witness the impression that she has made on my staff, on her friends, and her family.  Terry Wright, who also previously worked for Senator Biden--a member of my Service Academy Selection Board--has known Mary Ann for many years. Terry said Mary Ann is ``generous with an absolute willingness to help anyone in any way she can. When she's your friend,'' Terry said, ``you have a friend for life.''  Elena Sassaman, a newer member of my casework team, said:       Mary Ann is one of the nicest and most thoughtful people      I've met both here, working in the Senate, and in everyday      life. MAK was one of the first people to include me in the      office family dynamic when I first started.  Elena has developed a love for knitting, crocheting, and other crafts thanks to Mary Ann's encouragement and valued friendship.  When I am not in DC, I am usually in my Wilmington office in Delaware, and we enjoy the opportunity to have lunch as a group with everybody on the Delaware staff. I love those lunches, listening to Mary Ann tell funny stories, share observations, even show photos of or brag about her grandkids.  My dad, whom I miss dearly, was born in Boston, MA, himself, and Mary Ann, who never lost her remarkable Boston accent, has provided me a familiar and comforting presence whenever she speaks.  I love her Massachusetts spirit, her soul, and her positive attitude. Mary Ann is a good and decent person and a great presence in our office. She is at the same time both a fixture and a breath of fresh air.  Mary Ann's work in the Senate and her career as a chef shows us all the importance of working hard and embracing what you love, using your strengths to help your friends and neighbors and to better the country and community.  Mary Ann said she would miss all aspects of working with us in the It has been such a big part of her life, I know. Mary Ann, I know you will also miss the comradery of your coworkers in the Delaware office.  As a longtime chef, I am confident, Mary Ann, that you already have a recipe for retirement and will embrace the joy of not working. Your retirement will surely be filled with activities such as cooking, knitting, and outings with your friends Jill, Norma, Sue, and Tanya, and you will spend more time with your sons Michael and Terence, daughters-in-law Nell and Jennifer, and beloved grandchildren Cole, Mitch, Meredith, and Nolan, who all live right nearby, just over the line in Whether their Nan is joining them for dinner or attending a Unionville High School rowing event, I know you will be there in high spirits, prepared with a great story and an even better dessert.  Mary Ann, I know you look forward to trips to Westborough, MA, and to spending holidays and warmer weekends with Terence, Jennifer, Meredith, and  Let me conclude by saying to Mary Ann, thank you for your years of service to the Senate, to our community, and to the people of the First You have been a valued member of my team, and I will close with a traditional Irish blessing:     May there always be work for your hands to do.

1403,topic-id,594,"Mr.President, I come to the floor this evening inspired by the determined efforts of my colleague Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode  My colleague has made clear, by delivering his 200th floor speech on climate change, that he is committed to raising awareness about and urging action on this very real threat to our environment.  Let me speak briefly as someone trained in science as a chemist. I am troubled that time and again I am called to this Chamber to defend and advocate for science. We live in a time of unprecedented scientific advances. Throughout our history, we have turned to science to help us solve both domestic and international crises. Science was there, for example, to do battle against the Ebola outbreak, threats from hurricanes and other natural disasters, and the dangers of cigarette smoke and lead exposure. It was scientists who helped find a cure, provide early warning, who educated us, and who influenced politics to lead to policies that led to stronger industry and consumer safety standards in facing all of these threats. The scientific method has saved lives and ensured our survival, so why don't we more widely embrace the science of prediction, mitigation, and adaptation to the effects of climate change?  Climate change is real. We know climate change is already happening, although it is slow, gradual, and often hard to perceive. Its effects will impact human health, agricultural production, national security--an unbelievable range of concerns that should motivate us together. Yet I have colleagues who either aren't convinced or don't understand that climate change is a real and pressing threat.  Let me briefly cite one meta-study of scientific opinion. It surveyed 13,950 peer-reviewed articles and studies on climate change and found that only 24 of them rejected global warming--less than 0.2 percent. Although there is not unanimous opinion, when there is 99.8 percent agreement in the scientific community, we should agree that this degree of certainty is enough to take action.  ``An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure'' is an aphorism that dates back to the early 1700s. Why are we waiting? Let's change our ways. Let's work together to lower greenhouse gases, combat pollution, and slow the impact of climate change.  As someone who represents the State of Delaware, I am passionate about this because we are the lowest mean elevation State in I have heard from folks up and down the First State--from my colleague Senator Carper, from our Governor, from our community leaders, and from concerned citizens from Wilmington, to Rehoboth, to Middletown--that they are concerned about sea level rise and its likely impact on our We need to do more because, in my small State, sea level rise is happening at twice the national rate. In about 100 years, everyone in Delaware will finally have a beach house--just not the way they want it.  Let me conclude by saying we need to look forward, not backward, when addressing climate change and sea level rise. We need action, not reaction. We need policy, not politics. We should act today, not tomorrow.  Again, I thank Senator It was my pleasure to have him visit my home State of Delaware and see what we are doing to plan for and to combat sea level rise as a result of climate change. It was my honor to join him this evening and lend my support to him, to our environment, and to the fight against climate change.

This sale will involve the release of sensitive      technology to Saudi The RSLF seeks to purchase the      155mm M109A6 Paladin Medium Self-Propelled Howitzer system.      The Paladin M109A6 howitzer is the fourth product improvement      to the original M109 self-propelled howitzer. It features      improvements in the areas of survivability, reliability,      availability, maintainability, responsiveness, and terminal      effects. The M109A6 is an armored, full tracked howitzer      carrying 37 complete conventional rounds and two Copperhead      projectiles and operated by a crew of four. It is designed      with a new turret structure that facilitates integration of      the various turret improvements and vulnerability reduction      measures. It improves overall crew compartment layout and      space. The howitzer can travel at a maximum speed of 38 miles      per hour and has a maximum cruising range of 186 miles. The      M109A6 can operate independently, from on the move, it can      receive a fire mission, compute firing data, select and take      up its firing position, automatically unlock and point its      cannon, fire and move--all without external technical      assistance. Firing the first round following a move in under      60 seconds, a ``shoot and scoot'' capability protects the      crew from counterbattery fire. The M109A6 is capable of      firing up to four rounds per minute to ranges of 30      kilometers. The M109A6 features increased survivability      characteristics such as day/night operability and Nuclear,      Biological, Chemical (NBC) protection with climate control      and secure voice and digital communications. The crew remains      in the vehicle throughout the mission.       2. The Electronic Fire Control System (EFCS). Commonly      referred to as the Paladin Fire Control System (PFCS), it is      the major change for the Paladin M109A6 Howitzer from the      manual fire control system used on the The integrated      electronic digital Fire Control System includes an Embedded      It gives the howitzer the ability to operate over a      widely dispersed area and to move and emplace using the      onboard fire control system (Dynamic Reference Unit Hybrid      Replacement Inertial Navigation System) and a plug-in AN/PCN-     13A Defense Advanced Global Positioning System Receiver with      a Selective Availability Anti-spoofing Module (SAASM). The      M109A6 can move and position within an assigned position      area, process technical firing data, and fire a mission      without relying on aiming circles and wire lines. The M109A6      can change position more frequently, an advantage against      enemy fire.       3. The Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System      (AFATDS) provides the multiservice automated Fire Support      Command, Control and Communications portion of the Army      Battle Command System (ABCS). AFATDS enables the maneuver      commander to plan and execute attacks on the right target, at      the right time, with the right weapons system, and the right      munitions. It provides for maximum utilization of the fire      support assets available on an expanding battlefield. It      supports the close, deep, and rear battle fire support      requirements of land and littoral doctrine. AFATDS is      designed for full interoperability with the other ABCS      Battlefield Functional Areas as well as with the Fire Support      capabilities of the Navy's Joint Maritime Command Information      System (JMCIS) and the Air Force's Theater Battle Management      Core System (TBMCS).       4. The Driver's Vision Enhancer Wide (DVE Wide) improves      survivability and mission capability by providing drivers      with wider fields of view as well as the elimination of blind      spots to safely navigate through dust, sand, haze, smoke,      light fog and the blackest night. The front facing DVE Wide      integrates three state-of-the-art 640 480, 17 m      uncooled infrared sensors, which output a stitched video of a      107 30 field of view (POV). The DVE Wide can receive, manage[[Page S2005]]     and display video from multiple external cameras on the      vehicle. The driver can electronically pan through the      107 deg. total horizontal field of view allowing the driver      the ability to see both sides of the road. The vehicle wheel      track indicators aid the driver in clearly identifying any      potential impediments to safe operation. The DVE Wide is      fully backwards compatible with all fielded DVE units, which      means that any vehicle currently equipped with a DVE system      can be readily upgraded. It is also forward compatible with      new, high resolution, touch-screen displays. The DVE Wide is      an UNCLASSIFIED system.       5. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain      knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements of      the M109A6, the information could be used to develop      countermeasures or equivalent systems which might reduce      weapon system effectiveness or be used in the development of      a system with similar or advanced capabilities.       6.

The MOB technical data and documentation are            b. The MQ-4C Triton UAS Forward Operating Base (FOB) (MD-     3B) is used for aircraft launch and recovery and is      physically located at the same location as the MQ-4C Triton      aircraft. The FOB MCS is similar to the MOB MCS, but the FOB      MCS does not process or control any payload information. The      FOB MCS is manned by air vehicle operators only and used for      line of sight Aircraft C2 while beyond line of sight control      is used as a back-up communication line. The FOB MCS consists      of requisite data links, communication systems, antennas,      computer work-stations and hardware/software for air vehicle      operator control. The FOB technical data and documentation      are       c. The MQ-4C employs a quad-redundant Inertial Navigation      System/Global Positioning System (INS/GPS) configuration. The      system utilizes two different INS/GPS systems for greater      redundancy. The system consists of two LN-251 units and two      Kearfott KN-4074E INS/GPS The LN-251 is a fully      integrated, non-dithered navigation system with an embedded      Selective Availability/Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM), P(Y)      code or Standard Positioning Service (SPS) It utilizes a      Fiber-Optic Gyro (FOG) and includes three independent      navigation solutions: blended INS/GPS, INS-only, and GPS-     only. The Kearfott KN-4074E features a Monolithic Ring Laser      Gyro (MRLG) and accelerometer. The inertial sensors are      tightly coupled with an embedded SAASM P(Y) code Both      systems employ crypto graphic technology that can be      classified up to       2. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain      knowledge of specific hardware, the information could be used      to develop countermeasures which might reduce weapons system      effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with      similar or advanced capabilities.       3.

The M795 Insensitive Munitions Explosive (IMX) 101      Explosive Fill 155mm HE Projectile is The M231/     M232A1 Modular Artillery Charge System (MACS) consists of two      propelling charges, the M231 and the M232/232A1, and      associated packaging. The system is compatible with all      current and planned 155mm field artillery weapons. MACS uses      a ``build-a-charge'' concept in which increments are      identical to all others in the same lot desiccation, retained      for future use. The M231 is fired either singly (Charge 1-L)      or in pairs (Charge-2L) to engage targets. The M232/M232A1 is      fired in groups of 3 (Charge-3H) or groups of 4 (Charge-4H)      or groups of 5 (Charge-5H) to engage targets. The highest      classification level of the charge is       2. Although the charges are UNCLASSIFIED, they have      associated technology that is sensitive. Certain aspects of      the performance, specifically the interior ballistics      characteristics, and some of the design features are      considered sensitive data. This UNCLASSIFIED sensitive data      could be used by a technologically advanced potential enemy      to duplicate the charges through reverse engineering. No      technical data packages or test information should be      supplied.       3.

198,topic-id,2147,"Madam President, I rise today to speak about the omnibus bill that we are going to be voting on either later today or tomorrow.  I came to the Senate almost 12 years ago. I have 9 months left in my term. I told folks back home that I couldn't imagine serving more than two terms. Yet it has been an incredible privilege to be here. When I ran, I ran concerned about our Nation's fiscal issues, and I ran on the combination of pro-growth tax reform and entitlement reform and dealing with the tremendous deficits that our country has. I really thought we would do something about it.[[Page S1888]]  We had the financial crisis that took place back in 2007, 2008, 2009--building in 2007 and occurred in 2008. We dealt with much of it over 2009. I remember talking to people around our country not just about the financial crisis but about the tremendous deficits that our Nation was creating. I was still hopeful in my first term that we would rise to the occasion and actually deal with the fiscal issues that are going to haunt these young people who are our pages sitting before me. We have $21 trillion in debt today and over $100 trillion in unfunded liabilities with our long-term programs, our mandatory spending programs. So during that period of time, near the end of my first term, I kept saying to people around the country: There is no question that the Senate and the House, with leadership from the executive branch, will deal with this fiscal issue.  I am convinced today that that is not going to happen until there is a crisis in our Let me say it one more time. Without extreme leadership at the very top, I do not think we will deal with this issue until there is a crisis, because I just don't see the will here to do the things that need to be done.  During December we had a debate on the pro-growth tax reform side of this, and I think it is well documented that I had concerns about it. As a matter of fact, when the bill came through the Senate, I voted against it. I continued to work with some of my counterparts on the Democratic side--Chris Coons and others--and the White House, to see if there was some way to potentially alter the bill so that if growth projections didn't achieve what we thought they might be, we had some way of ensuring that we would not have deficits. At the end of the day, when it came to the floor, I supported it--pro-growth tax reform, again, being one of those things that I ran on back in 2006.  What concerns me is that today, or maybe tomorrow, we have a 2,232-page omnibus bill before us that sets a base in spending that will be about $2 trillion in deficit spending over the next 10 years. By the way, that doesn't include some of the supplemental items. I am talking about just the baseline in spending.  I think everyone knows that, like the Presiding Officer, I am a very strong supporter of our men and women in uniform. No doubt we all understand that the defense numbers in this bill are way beyond even what the executive branch asked for. Somehow, in these negotiations, we have ended up, over a 2-year period, with an average increase in base spending of about $150 billion. When you multiply that times 10, that is $1.5 trillion. We know there are going to be increases over that 10-year period. Then, if you look at the interest on the debt that it is going to create, we are voting on a bill tonight or tomorrow that is going to add--there is no question--a minimum of $2 trillion in deficits over the next 10 years.  What was fascinating during the month of December, when we were dealing--let me stop for a second.  Let me just say this. There are a lot of discussions about the fact that maybe the Republican Party has lost its soul. There is a lot of discussion about that around the country--that maybe the Republican Party has lost its soul.  I will say that for the Republican Party to have the Presidency, for the Republican Party to have the Senate, and for the Republican Party to have the House of Representatives, and for us to be passing a bill today--obviously, it couldn't happen without us; we control the agenda here--for us to be in this situation where we are getting ready to pass a bill that adds $2 trillion in deficits over the next 10 years, or sets the stage for that by passing the first 2 years with a huge increase in base spending with no offsets to speak of, does have to be a wake-up call for people as for whether that is the case.  I can't imagine, for instance, had the 2016 election gone a different way and we had a Democratic President and we controlled the House and Senate, our being in a situation where we would vote tonight or tomorrow for a bill that is going to add $2 trillion in debt without offsets. As a matter of fact, I can just tell my colleagues, absolutely, that would not be the case.  So here we are. There are going to be all kinds of things in this bill that people don't even know about. It is just human nature. When you have the pen in your hand and you are working in a back room some place--and I don't criticize back rooms; that is how these bills get written--people do things that benefit themselves. They just do. That is the way it works. I don't even want to speak to that. That will be something I hope the media will speak to over the next two or three weeks, when we find, in these 2,232 pages that no one has read, the things in this bill that are going to be egregious to the American people--highly egregious.  I hope people will find them. I hope the media will report them. I know they are in there. I just don't know what they are yet because the bill has just been produced. That is of concern.  What is of grave concern to me is that we have made no attempt whatsoever to create any kind of offsets and no attempt whatsoever to try to solve our fiscal issues. Together, Republicans and Democrats are running off a cliff and passing a bill.  Now, let me speak to I am criticizing Republicans, as I should, with this piece of legislation, when we control the executive branch, we control both Houses of Congress, and we are getting ready to pass a bill that will add $2 trillion for these young people to pay for down the road, which will compound, compound, compound. We have $21 trillion in debt today, not to speak of the $100 trillion of unfunded liabilities.  My Democrat friends, raised unmitigated H-E-L-L over the tax bill that was potentially going to create some deficits if growth projections didn't occur. I have not heard a word from them--not a word, not a word--about the fact that there is no question that we are adding $2 trillion in debt here--no question. This is money gone, down the tube, out the door, and no way to pay for it. I haven't heard a word from them--not a word. My friends in the media were beside themselves--beside themselves--in I mean, the world was going to come to an end if the growth projections that were laid out didn't occur, and the deficits that might be created by this tax bill if we didn't have the growth projections. They were just beside themselves. I have not heard a word from them. It is amazing. Somehow or another, spending more money than we have is different than hoping to create pro-growth tax reform.  So let me just say this. I am optimistic about our future. I see young people around our country who are just so impressive. I go to schools. I go to colleges. I see people in townhall meetings, in restaurants, at the grocery store and in other places, and I could not be more upbeat about the generation of people coming after us--who care about others, who care about the future, and who are engaged in issues. We will have a big crowd up here this weekend, caring about a particular issue that they should care about.  But I could not be more discouraged about where we are today with our adult leadership here in Congress and at the White  This is one of the most grotesque pieces of legislation I can remember.  One of the best votes I ever made was the Budget Control It was criticized, but it kept domestic and discretionary spending on a level. We should have done the rest of it. The rest of it was people getting together to solve our long-term problems. That didn't happen. We created sequester, and I know that has built some of the pressure that leads us to where this bill is today.  This is a grotesque piece of legislation--grotesque--that we would pass a piece of legislation that would set the standard for $2 trillion in deficit spending not offset.  I am discouraged. I am discouraged about where we are today. I am discouraged about the fact that we continue to be engaged in generational theft--my generation.  We will not deal with mandatory spending--mandatory spending that benefits my generation. To these young people sitting in front of me, we are engaged right now in generational theft because we are transferring from you to us your future resources, because we don't have the courage or the will to deal with issues.  By the way, unfortunately, the American people are not there. The[[Page S1889]]American people do not care about this issue because we are living fat and happy today and because the crisis has not yet occurred and because we can slough it off on you and keep ourselves from making these tough decisions.  By the way, these tough decisions play themselves out in the polls because people get angry about the fact that we need to be responsible and that we need to make sure that you guys are not going to pay these huge tabs. By the way, your standard of living, when we pass this bill, will be diminished. When you go on to college and graduate and start working in your job, just know that what we are getting ready to do tonight or tomorrow is going to diminish your standard of living, because we are going to pass a huge bill, unpaid for, that you are going to pay for and your children are going to pay for. That is what we are doing.  That is what we are doing because we don't have the will as a body to say: OK, if we are going to spend this additional money, what is it that we are going to cut over here? What are we going to do relative to the fact that right now Medicare recipients take about three times out of the program what they put in. What are we going to do about that?  Well, see, we are going to do nothing about it because that is unpopular, and people don't want to hear the truth about these things. Instead, what they would rather do is say: Well, let's worry about that down the road.  But let me tell you who is going to be worrying about it. You are going to be worrying about it.  I know you have seen some outstanding people. I serve with outstanding people in this body. I really do. They are intelligent, hard-working people. I really do. It has been a great privilege. But what you are going to see tonight and tomorrow is a bunch of hard-working people pass a piece of legislation that is going to make your lives and your kids' lives worse.  I will not support this piece of legislation. I know it is going to pass overwhelmingly because there is too much in it to make people happy for the moment. But let me just say that down the road the American people are going to be very unhappy with our lack of responsibility.  Not only do I question the soul of my own party, I question the soul of the other party, and I wonder where the media is and why they are not out crying over what we are getting ready to do.

1037,topic-id,258,"Madam President, I enjoyed listening to the comments of my friend from I think you guys are going to like the amendment I am getting ready to offer.  Today I rise to offer an amendment to 2155--the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act--of which I am a cosponsor.  My amendment is a simple correction that would clarify the intent of this original bill as it relates to custodial banks.  As originally introduced, section 402 was intended to provide better tailored capital requirements for true custodial banks. However, there have been concerns raised that the current definition of this section, following revisions during the committee consideration, could open this provision to a wider group of financial institutions.  I know that was not the intent of my colleagues, and this technical correction amendment makes clear that section 402 applies only when the primary focus of the banking organization is custodial activities.  Section 402 is not intended to provide relief to an organization engaged in consumer banking, investment banking, or other businesses, and that also happens to have some custodial business or a banking subsidiary that engages in custodial activities.  In conclusion, section 402 was intended as a very narrowly tailored provision, focused on true custodial banks. This technical correction amendment would clarify the scope of 402.  I am requesting a vote and urge my colleagues to support adoption of this amendment.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

1221,topic-id,455,"Mr.President, I will be very brief as I know numbers of people here would like to speak to this bill, which will be an accomplishment for us, and we greatly appreciate the Senator's leadership in making it happen.  I was here when Dodd-Frank was passed. I was on the Banking Committee at that time. I didn't support it. The reason I didn't support it is for the many reasons and the many things we are doing today to correct it.  Whenever regulation passes, it begins at the targeted group, which, in this case, was made up of the larger institutions in our country which failed. Then, over time, the regulatory processes seeped down to the smaller entities, the smaller banks, that were housed in the communities all across our respective States--the members of the Rotary Club, the Kiwanis Club, the Lions Clubs International, the Chamber of Commerce--the people who make things happen in our communities back home. We have ended up in a situation now in which our community banks and credit unions, which serve our communities and cause economic growth to occur, have these large back office operations that are spread over a smaller asset base. It has made them noncompetitive and has made it very difficult for them to do the jobs we all cherish that they do back home, which is to help to grow those economies. This bill is focused on them.  Senator Tester, I know, has been focused on this for many years, but what[[Page S1356]]we are doing here is giving relief to those institutions. It is about time. We have had enough time to see what needs to happen. This was done in a bipartisan way, for which I am thankful.  Mr.President, I would like to thank Senator Crapo for his leadership here in working with people on both sides of the aisle to create a responsible bill that is not an overreach. Some of the provisions of Dodd-Frank, we all know, are good. Some of them are good, and we are leaving many of those in place. At the same time, what we are doing is taking a very constructive step to make sure that these smaller institutions, which represent a very small amount of the assets in our Nation but have such outsized impact on the communities they are in, have the ability again to flourish and do the things that are necessary for our economies back home to grow.  I thank Senator I am proud to be a part of this and a cosponsor. I thank Senator Crapo for letting us be a part of it, and I hope that collectively we will ensure that this is a very successful effort.  I yield the floor.

205,topic-id,1697,"Madam President, I rise to mention one piece of legislative business and then will pay tribute to the senior Senator from Mississippi, Senator Thad  Last night, the Appropriations Committee, which Senator Cochran chairs, released the 2018 Omnibus appropriations bill. It includes a proposal that I feel very strongly about, and I am grateful to him and all of our colleagues for their support. I particularly want to acknowledge the advocacy of the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to make sure this provision is included in the omnibus bill. The House will soon vote on the omnibus, and then I hope we can quickly follow suit here in the  The provision I am referring to is, in shorthand, called Fix NICS, of course, is the National Instant Criminal Background Check I think it is a reasoned and reasonable response to the shootings that have, appallingly, occurred in our schools, our churches, and in our public spaces.  Just this last week, a gunman opened fire at a high school in Maryland, not far from here, and, of course, shootings have occurred in Florida, Texas, Nevada, Charleston, SC, and elsewhere. Our constituents are frustrated, frightened, and fed up. They want us to do something. More importantly than that, they want us to do something that will be effective and save lives. I am happy to say the Fix NICS bill fits that description.  People who haven't been active on this issue now are raising their voices and demanding that they be heard. Students are worried, understandably, and parents of students are worried. They simply don't want what happened in Parkland, FL, to occur to them. We need to listen to all of these voices, including to these students, who obviously will shape our Nation's future. They don't want to go to school and wonder whether bullets will rain down their hallways or whether their friends might be the next victims.  In a recent interview, one teenager said something that was trite but true. She said: ``Guns are not the problem. The people are the problem.'' I happen to agree with that.  One question about school shooters is, How did they get to the point at which they thought that shooting up public places was what they really wanted to do? How did they justify it in their own minds, as warped as that might be? Also, what is it about our culture, their home environments, or their mental states that allows them to rationalize violence that does such tremendous harm? How does slaughter--because that is what it really is--become justified in their warped perspectives? I admit that those are tough questions to answer, and they are tough to even ponder, but we still can and have to do what is possible to protect our schools, our churches, parents, teachers, and our children.  Recently, 13 families from Parkland, FL, wrote in support of this particular legislation--legislation that would improve school safety, that has been sponsored by our colleague, the senior Senator from Senator Hatch's bill would fund the creation of and provide training for threat assessment teams--in other words, to evaluate beforehand where people are vulnerable. It includes security measures and anonymous reporting systems. This bill is widely supported and shows that even on a divisive issue, there is plenty of room for common ground.  In that same letter, the 13 Parkland families said they supported Senator Hatch's school safety measures. They also expressed support for the Fix NICS bill, which they said is desperately needed to improve compliance with firearms purchasing background check systems.  A recent Gallup Poll showed that the public broadly supports proposals like Fix More than 9 in 10 see the importance of background checks.  Over the last few weeks, there has been a true groundswell of support for this bill that I and the junior Senator from Connecticut, Mr.Murphy, cosponsored. The supporters now include not only victims' rights advocates, gun violence prevention groups, and prosecutors, but also the U.Conference of Mayors, the National League of Cities, the Major County Sheriffs of America, as well as other law enforcement groups. All of these organizations have endorsed Fix NICS and signed a letter that asks that the majority and minority leaders put this measure to a vote. Now, in its having been included in the Omnibus appropriations bill, we will finally have a chance to do that--first in the House and then in the  These organizations and the general public agree that fixing our background check system should be a national priority and that we should better ensure that convicted criminals with past histories of violence and mental illness do not purchase or possess firearms, as the law currently in effect provides. They see merit in trying to fix our system that currently has allowed these same people to slip through the cracks and purchase firearms in order to kill innocent people, like the 26 who were gunned down inside the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, TX, just outside of San  Some have said that Fix NICS doesn't go far enough, that it is a modest measure. I have to question that sort of description. Is it really a modest measure if it will, in fact, save lives? I think not. It is a necessary measure and one that brings people together across the political spectrum, Republicans and Democrats alike. Even if Fix NICS were to save just one life, that would be reason enough to enact it, but I think that is unlikely. I think it will save many lives once it is enacted into law and signed by the  We have 78 cosponsors of this legislation. I can't think of another piece of legislation that has enjoyed such broad bipartisan support, including by the majority leader and the Democratic leader, Senator In today's hyperpolarized environment, that kind of support speaks for itself.[[Page S1892]]  I look forward to its passing in the House as part of the funding bill, and I hope the Senate will do the same before the end of the week.                        Tribute to Thad Cochran  Madam President, I close by saying a few words about our friend and trusted colleague, the senior Senator from Mississippi, Thad Cochran, who has announced his retirement from the I know the real tributes are about to kick off in a minute when the majority leader comes out, but since I am up here, I thought I would take the opportunity to say a few words.  Senator Cochran has represented the State of Mississippi in the U.Senate since 1978. He is one of the longest serving Members of Congress in the history of the United His career and his life speak for themselves.  He is the son of a school principal and math teacher. Not surprisingly, he was a gifted high school athlete. He is a piano player and a former college yell leader. Yes, even like me, he is a recovering lawyer, but we will not hold that against him.  Before he joined Congress, he served in the U.Navy because he loves this country and the opportunities it has afforded him and his family. He is a man with a strong sense of duty and gratitude for the opportunities he has been given in life. After ROTC at the University of Mississippi, he received orders to join the USS Macon, and after that he joined the staff of the Navy commandant in New Later, he ran for public office. He first served in the House of He then, of course, came here to the Senate, where he quickly established himself as a cordial but formidable presence.  Before I came to the Senate, Senator Cochran was chairman of the Senate Republican He has chaired the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee too. Most recently, he has alternated between serving as ranking member and chairman of the all-powerful Appropriations  Throughout his 45 years in Congress, he has participated in crafting and enacting historic legislation, but his main focus has always been on the people of His highest priority has always been on the men and women he was elected to represent in places like Jackson, Gulfport, Greenville, Starkville, and One example is when he fought so hard for recovery funding after Hurricane Katrina had destroyed large swaths of the southern part of Many people forget that that awful storm was much bigger than New Orleans'. Mississippi was hit almost equally as hard, and Senator Cochran made sure his State got the help it needed to get back on its feet.  His storied career is one of service and collegiality even amidst the fractious debates. He treats friends and political adversaries with respect. He listens to what people have to say. We need more people like that in public life.  The majority leader has called him the ``quiet persuader,'' one who knows ``there's a big difference between making a fuss and making a difference.''  Judge Grady Jolly, of the U.Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, who has known Senator Cochran as long as anyone, said that back home, he is known for his ``modesty and his retiring nature''--not attributes you would normally associate with somebody in politics, but he is a class act. He is also known for the consistent attention he has paid to the Mississippi Delta--one of the poorest regions in the Nation's poorest The judge calls Senator Cochran the ``ultimate model of sincerity,'' one who ``never engages in ad hominem or personal attacks'' and always ``keeps a sense of humor about himself.''  My office spoke to one Mississippi resident this week because we wanted to learn a little bit more about what Senator Cochran has meant to her. That woman, who had met Senator Cochran only a handful of times, said she had always respected and admired Senator Cochran's statesmanship and the dignity with which he represented Her comments are a good note to end on--statesmanship and dignity.

1031,topic-id,1008,"Mr.President, I guess I have to give my friend, the Senator from New York, credit. Once he made his bed, he decided he had better lie in it.  Democrats made a risky gamble when they bet against the American people in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that we passed in No Democrat supported it--none--and now I think they are beginning to worry that it is actually working. Otherwise, I don't understand why the Democratic leader, the minority leader of the U.Senate, would say: We need to raise your taxes because we can spend your money better than you can. I guess he means that we also need to eliminate the doubling of the standard deduction, which makes sure that the first $24,000 earned by a married couple is tax-free--zero tax rate. I guess he thinks we ought to repeal the doubling of the child tax credit.  As much as he rails about corporations, the fact is, what we did on the business side with taxes has made the United States more competitive globally. It is the same argument that he, President Obama in a State of the Union speech, and the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Wyden--it is the same argument they made that we embraced.  We got a little more aggressive than they did in terms of the rate. We lowered it, not to 25 percent, as Senator Wyden had proposed, but to 21 percent; thus, we made ourselves roughly average in the industrialized world, making America more competitive. We were seeing people going overseas and investing because they had better tax rates than we had here in  Who owns the stock? You have heard the Democratic leader talk about stock buybacks. He said: Well, these corporations are using this money to buy their own stock back. Do you know who owns stock in America? I am not sure of the exact percentage, but a huge percentage of it is owned by retirement funds and pension funds of firefighters, teachers, and others who want to see that their retirement is not only safe but also grows. What they have seen since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was passed in December is the value of their retirement funds go through the roof. The stock market is at an all-time high--or thereabouts. It has set huge records.  I know our friends on the other side of the aisle are worried because they made a dangerous gamble against the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but the fact is, all the polling is showing that as people are seeing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act actually being implemented, they are seeing more money in their paychecks. Because the withholding tables were changed to reflect lower tax rates, people are seeing more take-home pay. And as the economy continues to grow, there is going to be more competition for workers.  Unemployment claims are the lowest they have been since 1969. As there is more competition for workers, that is going to force employers to pay more wages, so everyone is going to benefit from a growing economy.  Sometimes I think our colleagues across the aisle have settled for too little. They settled for a stagnant economy, frozen wages, and an America that could no longer compete in the world when it came to attracting business and investment. We changed that.  Every single person on this side of the aisle--all 51 of us--voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Everyone on that side of the aisle voted against it. I think the Democratic leader now is getting pretty worried, especially leading up to the November elections, when a number of his colleagues on that side of the aisle are going to have to go to voters and say: I voted against your pay raise; I voted against take-home pay; I voted against increasing the standard deduction; I voted against an increase in the child tax credit. I think they are pretty worried about it; otherwise, I couldn't imagine the Democratic leader coming out here and saying what he said today.  He said: Well, we want to raise your taxes so we can spend it. I think the folks I represent--the 28 million Texans I represent--would say: No thank you. We want to spend our own hard-earned money the way we see fit, not send it to Washington to see it go into some black hole, and then we will not know what we actually benefited from.  I didn't necessarily intend to come to the floor to talk about that, but I couldn't resist responding briefly to my friend's comments.  Mr.President, I do want to congratulate the senior Senator from Idaho for a moment, Mr.Crapo, the chairman of the Banking Committee, on the bill that is pending on the floor. He has done stellar work to bring this Dodd-Frank reform bill to the floor, one that will release some of those shackles on small community banks and credit unions.  They were the victims of overkill when it came to regulation under the name of Dodd-Frank, which was designed to address Wall Street and the excesses of Wall But as I have told my friends who are community bankers and members of credit unions back home: You weren't the target, but[[Page S1533]]you were the collateral damage. We are going to remedy that on a bipartisan basis, thanks to the Banking Committee, its chairman, Senator Crapo, and our colleagues.

1313,topic-id,1947,"Mr.President, listening to my friend from New York--and he is my friend--we have worked together on a number of projects, even though we have diametrically opposed views on many policy prescriptions. To listen to him talk, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was a bad thing because it took money from the Federal Government and let the people who have earned it keep it and spend it the way they see fit.  I know they made a bad bet. They bet that it would fail. They bet that we would not get the votes to pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but we did, and the American people and American families are the beneficiaries of that.  I have come to this floor time and again, telling those stories, most recently about a plumbing company in Cleburne, TX, that has seen the benefits in terms of bonuses and increased pay, more take-home pay, along with the lowest claims for jobless benefits since 1969--the lowest claims for jobless benefits since 1969. But when we come to the floor, our Democratic colleagues, who bet against the American economy and this resurgence, the reawakening of this great economic engine known as the American economy--they bet against it. They are still sticking with the same old story, regardless of the facts.  I know the American people know better. They have noticed in their paychecks starting in February--because the tax tables were rewritten by the IRS--that they actually have more take-home pay. I have family members who are ecstatic about that. One of my daughters called and just couldn't be more excited, and I know that is happening to families all across the country.  I guess it is just one reason we have two political parties--Democrats and Republicans--because while we may agree in some sense on the outcome, we certainly don't agree on the means to achieve that outcome. They are the party of Big Government, higher taxes, and more spending. We are the party of smaller government, effective government, one that provides essential services to the American people, like defending our Nation and maintaining peace around the world, but we believe in the individual. We believe the people who earn the money ought to be able to keep more of it and spend it as they see fit, and they believe that government ought to keep more of that and spend it as Washington sees fit. That is[[Page S1408]]the reason we have two political parties, and people have to make their choices, and they do each election.  Yesterday, though, Mr.President, we voted to proceed to a very important bipartisan bill that would provide relief for small and midsized banks and credit unions across the country. This was an important step in what has been a long time coming.  You might ask: Why do we care about providing regulatory relief for banks and credit unions, especially the smaller ones that are in our communities? Well, that is where people go when they want to buy a house and they need a mortgage, when they need some startup money for a new business, where they need to go borrow money, for example, to buy seed and equipment to plant a crop. If you are in the agriculture sector, that is where they get access to credit, and that is why it is so important.  Unfortunately, since the Dodd-Frank law passed in 2010, we have seen a lot of that access to credit, particularly among small and medium-sized banks and credit unions, dry up because what they had to do was hire more people, but not for the purpose of making more loans. They hired more people because they needed to comply with the redtape and regulatory burden imposed by  We are peeling that back; we are reversing that--not for the big banks. The regulations stay in place, but for community banks and small credit unions, we are peeling that back so that it is a more rational and reasonable regulatory regime.  Ever since the law known as Dodd-Frank was passed in 2010, community and regional banks have been trying to get their voices heard. They have been clamoring to get lawmakers to understand that their businesses are much different from the titans of Wall Street that Dodd-Frank went after, following the financial crisis. Usually, when I am talking to the community bankers and the credit unions from my State, I say: You didn't cause the great recession of 2008. You didn't cause the great financial crisis, but you are the collateral damage. And they nod their heads sadly.  These banks want us to know they are from Main Street, not from Wall Street, and they want the rules to reflect that fact. After yesterday's vote, we finally started on a pathway not only to listening to their concerns but also to acting on them.  Dodd-Frank, the regulatory legislation that was passed in 2010, was almost 250 pages long. It required more than 10 Federal agencies to write more than 400 new rules, imposing some 27,000 mandates on financial institutions of every size, from large to small. In doing so, Dodd-Frank's rules imposed billions of dollars in new costs. Much of the weight fell on the backs of banks and credit unions that posed little systemic risk to the overall economy, and they have had a much harder time than Wall Street firms complying with excessive and complex reporting requirements.  Here is the irony. It is actually the big banks and big financial institutions that have the heft and the money to be able to comply with all of this new spider's web of regulations. It is the smaller community banks and credit unions that can't afford it, so they have been going out of business or being gobbled up in mergers by the big banks. This isn't what Congress intended in 2010. That wasn't the focus, but that is the consequence.  As the Senate majority leader said yesterday, based on one survey, compliance costs--those are the costs of dealing with the redtape in the financial sector--have gone up by 24 percent. What has happened as compliance costs have increased? Well, banks have closed in small towns in rural America, for one, which has led to a growing number of places with no bank branches at all.  In Texas, for example, we lost about 165 bank charters, a 26-percent reduction. In smaller rural areas that lacked multiple options to access credit, this is a serious problem. It is one of the many issues this bill we are voting on this week attempts to solve.  As the Wall Street Journal noted, the bill mainly ``eases administrative burdens'' on community banks. These banks incredibly ``make up about 98 percent of financial institutions, but [hold] only 15 percent of [U.banks' total] assets.''  Our colleague, the senior Senator from Idaho, the chairman of the Banking Committee, has spearheaded this effort, which is called the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection I heard him say yesterday that it does all three of those things. It helps stimulate economic growth; it provides regulatory relief; and it protects consumers. We all appreciate the tremendous amount of hard work he has poured into the difficult and elaborate negotiations. His leadership has been indispensable.  As Senator Crapo has pointed out, the reforms in the bill will rightsize existing regulations on community and regional banks and credit unions while ensuring consumer safety at the same time. Anyone who lives and works in the real world knows that a one-size-fits-all approach just about never works, and banking and the financial sectors are no exception.  Dodd-Frank never worked as intended, but it was especially disastrous for smaller financial institutions that shouldn't be subject to many of its provisions, which weren't meant for them in the first place. The bill, therefore, will relieve the burden on small and midsized businesses that are being treated unfairly. Again, it is not so much the banks and the credit unions that we are worried about; it is the people they lend money to, who need access to credit to live their lives, to build their business. That is who we are mainly concerned about.  Surprisingly and gratefully, this bill is supported by Democrats who passed Dodd-Frank in the first place. This bill is supported by Democrats and Republicans, as well as the Trump administration and top Federal Reserve officials. This is actually a little bit of a bright light in an otherwise, sometimes, dark atmosphere here in Washington, DC, when it comes to dealing with some of these problems. This actually will help solve some real-world problems, and it is supported by Republicans and  One specific objective is to raise the threshold at which banks face the stricter Dodd-Frank oversight, but it will also--and I want to emphasize this--keep in place requirements for much larger financial institutions, like rigorous stress testing, for example.  As I said, negotiations have been going on for this legislation for years; I think it is 4 years to be exact. But because of the resistance of the former administration, the Obama administration, as well as the former Senate majority leader, Senator Reid, we couldn't get these reforms passed before this week--and next week, if necessary. This is a new day, a new administration, a new leadership, and we are making progress.  In the meantime, though, American families and businesses lost out. Some farmers and ranchers, looking to actually buy what they needed to bring in the crops so that they could earn a living, couldn't get the loans they needed. Young people couldn't find a mortgage at a price they could afford and purchase their starter home.  In Texas, bankers confirmed that these reported difficulties are real. They recently signed a letter that urged the Senate to seize this opportunity and to pass this bill as quickly as possible. As the Independent Bankers Association of Texas has pointed out, community banks neither participated in nor profited from the excesses and bad behavior that precipitated the financial crisis, yet they are paying a disproportionately high price in attempting to deal with the aftermath. That just about sums it up.  Another group from my State, the Texas Bankers Association, has said that they are pleased to see this bill has finally been brought to the floor for a vote. That group represents about 450 banking institutions in my Sometimes we see the credit unions and the banks as rivals. They often see themselves as rivals for the same line of business. But the banks and credit unions agree. The credit unions in my State say that passing this bill would allow them to more fully serve their members' needs, whether that be providing mortgages or small business loans, instead of spending so many hours and so much money trying to deal with the redtape--and to what purpose? It doesn't help grow the economy. It doesn't help access to credit.  It is really regulatory overkill that we are trying to deal with here. As the[[Page S1409]]majority leader said yesterday, there are a ``wide diversity of views on Dodd-But there is widespread agreement that we should not continue allowing'' unintended consequences to wreak havoc on community banks and small credit unions.  I hope all of our colleagues will join me in supporting the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection It is good for American families. It is good for communities across our country that are underserved and for people who lack access to credit. It just makes sense.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

1570,topic-id,2287,"Mr.President, ever since President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, we have seen how one law can literally transform the economic landscape across the country. The New York Times has reported that there is a wave of optimism surging among job creators.  Let me just footnote that the New York Times was certainly a skeptic as to what the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would be, but they now report that a wave of optimism is surging among job creators.  Since January 2017, 2.3 million jobs have been added in the United States, and unemployment is at a 17-year low. U.weekly jobless claims are at their lowest since 1969. Many people who thought that stagnant growth and flat wages were the new normal have been surprised--and maybe a better word is ``gratified''--to see what the impact of this policy has been on their take-home pay, on their confidence in their future, and on investments and new jobs. It is pretty exciting. In 2017, average unemployment rates decreased in 32 States according to the Bureau of Labor  Mr.President, 186,000 manufacturing jobs have been added over the last 12 months. I know the President and all of us are concerned about manufacturing moving offshore because the cost of doing business in some places around the world is much lower than it is in the United States, but we should all be excited about the fact that 186,000 manufacturing jobs have been added in the last 12 months.  As I mentioned, consumer confidence is now at its highest level since November 2000, and real disposable incomes have seen their biggest gain since April 2015.  According to a National Federation of Independent Business survey, more small businesses than ever now believe it is a good time to expand. This is a very important part of the equation, and I will say more about small businesses in just a moment.  In Texas, where I am from, a survey of Houston businesses found that 2 out of 3 companies there will increase hiring and wages, while nearly 9 out of 10 said they expected to see an increase in their revenue. The head economist of the bank that conducted the survey didn't waste any words, saying that ``something real is happening in the economy.'' I agree. The positive gains from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are real and undeniable.  Recently, my office heard from one of my constituents by the name of Judy Judy lives in Cleburne, TX, which is roughly an hour from Dallas, down U.Highway 67. Judy owns a plumbing company called P&She said that her plumbing company will be giving both raises and bonuses to all of its employees this year because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and she just wanted to let us know that she appreciates what we are doing.  Well, all of us who have the honor of representing constituents here in the Senate hear from our constituents from time to time, and they don't always give us an ``attaboy'' or words of encouragement. Frequently they say ``Can't you all do better'' or ``You have done this, and I don't like that much.'' So it is nice to hear from people like Judy the encouragement that she has given us for the Tax Cuts and Jobs I can say, for my part, to Judy that we are thrilled you decided to pay the savings forward to other folks in the Cleburne area. Plumbers are a good example of the untold stories on tax reform.  Here in Washington, we are not always conscious of the ripple effect--the way in which the changes we have enacted affect small businesses and individual lives. Judy reminds us of the positive impacts that are felt all over. It is not just the big players, the Fortune 500 companies with thousands of employees and operations around the world; it is small businesses like P&P in Cleburne, too, that are busy helping out those small communities and making lives better. Those examples are just as important as those in the Fortune 500.[[Page S1345]]                               Fix NICS Bill  Mr.President, another issue I will continue to be focused on concerns a bill that I cosponsored with the junior Senator from Connecticut, Mr.Murphy, called Fix The President, when we were over at the White House last week, said: Well, maybe you need a better name for the bill. I had to explain that NICS was the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and that we believed it was broken and needed to be fixed; hence the name ``Fix NICS.'' But I take the President's point--maybe we ought to do a better job branding what it is we are selling here, and what we are selling is something vitally important that will save lives.  The Fix NICS bill will fix holes in the background check system that is utilized when firearms are purchased by individuals in the United As we know, when you go buy a gun at a gun store, there is a background check that has to be conducted. That is current law. When federally licensed firearm dealers like McBride's Guns, Inc., in Austin, TX, that I patronize--when you go in to buy a new shotgun to go bird hunting or something like that, they will run a background check. Of course they ask you to answer the questions, but the problem we discovered in Sutherland Springs is that not everybody is performing their responsibility and uploading the information that would show that people who are purchasing guns are lying on their background check and are legally disqualified from purchasing those firearms.  For many, the aftereffects of the shooting last month at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL, still resonate--I know that is true for all of us--and the pain and frustration aren't going away. I always worry, though, after one of these events occurs, that given the relentless carpet-bombing of news and other information that we all sustain here in Washington, in the Nation's Capital, it is too easy to begin to lose sight of our objective to make things different and to improve outcomes when it comes to terrible events like this. Sometimes we get distracted and we move on to other topics, but we can't allow ourselves to do that. We have heard from Stoneman Douglas students themselves who are angry and deserve to be so.  Last week, the junior Senator from Florida, Mr.Rubio, and I met with Andrew Pollack, the father of a victim who lost her life at Stoneman Mr.Pollack's daughter isn't coming back, sadly, but the least we can do is to prevent others like her from losing their lives in similar incidents in the future.  I wanted to tell Andrew that steps have already been taken, and I wanted to say: This will not happen again. Your daughter and other future victims have pushed us, finally, to change.  But I couldn't do that, not with a straight face, and I still can't. Here we are almost a week after the meeting and we have taken zero steps forward, even though the Fix NICS bill is now cosponsored by 50 Senators on a bipartisan basis. The majority leader, a Republican, and the minority leader, a Democrat, are cosponsors of the bill. Senator Murphy from Connecticut and Senator Cornyn from Texas--we are the principal cosponsors of the bill. We agree about very little in other areas of public policy, but we agree in this case that this is simply too important of an issue and that we really need to demonstrate our competence and to try to regain the public's confidence in our ability to actually function in a way that will save lives in the future.  Well, unfortunately, much like the DACA debate, people want to make this bill a Christmas tree, trying to decorate it with other legislative ornaments that look nice to their political base but stand no chance of passing this body or the I think we have to call that what it is--political posturing. It is not about getting a result. It is not about passing a bill that will actually improve the background check system to prevent people like the shooter at Sutherland Springs, for example, from actually purchasing a firearm by lying on the background check.  Thankfully, Andrew Pollack sees all this with clear eyes. He has said to me and Senator Rubio that we need to focus on what is achievable. He, himself, is focused on school safety, and I certainly support that.  I know my colleague Senator Hatch has introduced a bill that is bipartisan and widely supported by all sides, which I support.  Another reform that is achievable today, if we were allowed to vote on it, is Fix NICS--to fix our broken background check system. We should start with what is achievable and what will actually save lives, and that describes the Fix NICS bill. It will help prevent dangerous individuals with criminal convictions and history of mental illness from buying firearms. This bill could easily pass the It has already passed the The President would sign it, as he told me when he called me last Thursday night. He said he supports the Fix NICS bill. There are other things he would like to do. There are other suggestions people have made, but we need to do what is achievable, and we need to do that as soon as we possibly can.  Several publications have endorsed the Fix NICS bill, saying it is a commonsense proposal that is a ``test of [Democrats'] sincerity.'' Do our colleagues really want to work together to prevent further shootings at churches and schools? Voting on this bill would be one way to do it.  The New York Times calls Fix NICS a ``rare piece of gun legislation that has no meaningful opposition and that has bipartisan support.'' That is one of the most maddening things about working here in Washington, DC--when there are bills that have no meaningful opposition and have bipartisan support and they still don't go anywhere.  The Dallas Morning News said the bill ``keeps deadly weapons away from people already prohibited from owning them.'' The San Antonio Express News calls Fix NICS a ``relatively easy place to start.'' That would be wonderful if it were true in the The Express News calls the bill ``narrow'' and ``necessary.''  I am not suggesting it is a panacea, but why don't we want to take the first step in the direction of passing legislation, which essentially enforces existing law and one that will save lives?  If the shooter at Sutherland Springs had run into the FBI background check system in the Air Force, in that case, and they uploaded his felony conviction as well as his conviction for domestic violence, where he fractured the skull of his infant stepson--if they had uploaded that information into the background check system, he would not have been able to legally purchase a firearm, but he did purchase those firearms, and he used them to walk around a little Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs one Sunday morning when people were worshiping inside. He didn't go inside at first. He shot through the wall. It wasn't a stone building. It wasn't a brick building. It was made out of wood. It was a simple little Baptist Church in Sutherland People were gathered to worship, and 26 of them were gunned down. He walked into the church, after he shot dozens of rounds through the building, and he went inside and shot them and killed them--26 people. There were 20 more wounded. Fortunately, they did not die from their wounds.  I believe, with all my heart, that those 26 people would be alive today if we made sure our broken background check system worked by enforcing current law and passing a bill like Fix I believe that would have saved their lives, and it would have stopped the change that the 20 who were wounded are now going to experience as a result of their life-altering injuries.  I told myself, at that time, I am not going to come back to that small community and look those families in the face unless I have done everything humanly possible to change the outcome in the future. How can any of us, in good conscience, look our constituents in the face, those who lose their loved ones to incidents like this--how can we look them in the face, in good conscience, and say we have done our duty, when we failed to act where we could on an achievable bill, with no opposition and broad bipartisan support?  The Waco Tribune says: ``Second Amendment advocates who regularly stress the need to enforce existing gun laws rather than forging new laws should welcome'' the bill. This bill is supported by the whole political spectrum when it comes to guns and the Second Amendment, from the NRA to people who say, well, they really have[[Page S1346]]reservations about law-abiding citizens owning guns even for their own defense or for recreation or hunting purposes. The whole political spectrum agrees this is a commonsense, achievable bill, and so do 49 colleagues in the Senate, both Republicans and  I have said it before, but I am here to say it again: Let's pass Fix NICS now. Andrew Pollack and the rest of the Nation are waiting for a sign that we are serious about preventing wanton acts of violence that should not and cannot continue.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

1651,topic-id,2225,"Madam President, this week, we will complete work on an important bipartisan bill. Thanks to the leadership of the Senator from Idaho, Mr.Crapo, who is chairman of the Banking Committee, they passed it out of the Banking Committee, and now it is time for us to do our job and pass it out of the Last week, we voted to proceed, and we will vote to pass it out of the Senate in the next few days.  Senator Crapo explained why this work is so important. Since the passage of the Dodd-Frank legislation in 2010--as we all recall, after the great recession of 2008, when Wall Street melted down together with our financial institutions, there were reform efforts undertaken known as Dodd-Frank--Senator Dodd and Congressman Frank--which imposed regulatory requirements on banks large and small. The problem is, the small community banks--the ones that are disproportionately harmed by this overregulation--weren't the cause of the great recession, the financial meltdown of 2010 and 2009, but they are the collateral damage. What has happened is, there has been a lot of consolidation. Many small community banks and credit unions have simply had to close or been consolidated with other larger banks and institutions. It has taken a toll on our economy, and it has taken a toll on our communities across the country. What happens is, these community banks have less money to loan because they have had to use the money they would loan to hire more people to help them comply with all the unnecessary redtape because of the Dodd-Frank overregulation. Some have had to basically defer that sort of investment in their communities and[[Page S1620]]others have had to shutter completely because of the financial burden.  The second-order effect is, some people don't have access to capital; that is, to loans they need. They can't get credit they need in order to start a small business, grow an existing business, or even get a mortgage to buy their first home.  Let's be clear, though, about which financial institutions this bill is tailored toward helping. It is small community banks, midsized regional ones, as well as credit unions. The bill we are considering somehow does not exempt large banks from those regulations, and saying it does, which some have said, doesn't make it so. It is a claim too eagerly peddled by those who want to maintain the status quo, to the detriment of our smaller communities and small businesses. Large banks are still subject to measures designed to protect the stability of the overall economy, like rigorous stress testing.  After all, this bill is called the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection What it actually does is rightsize those regulations. It does this by providing targeted exemptions from risk-weighted capital requirements, for example, and the Volcker rule. It also provides a qualified mortgage safe harbor for small banks and raises the SIFI threshold so community banks are not lumped into the same overall category as giant financial institutions operating on Wall  The majority leader recently said: ``In an era of online banking and multinational corporations, smaller institutions remain uniquely able to build community connections,'' and that is important to our civic fabric as well as the economies in rural and smalltown  Based on research, community banks provide more than half of all small business loans. That could translate into small banks getting to know their customers on a personal level and then extending credit to entrepreneurs and families who might not have access otherwise.  That is certainly the situation in parts of my State, the State of I have heard from banks and communities there that are more than ready to finally be freed of the shackles of Dodd- As the chief executive officer of the Independent Bankers Association of Texas put it, ``Congress holds the key to unchain community banks from the burden pushing them toward consolidation''--in other words, mergers, forcing them to become big banks, which seems to me to be an odd way to deal with this problem, to be sure, or putting them out of business altogether.  In the IBAT's view--Independent Bankers Association of Texas--rules meant to curb the abuses of banks deemed too big to fail have instead trickled down to harm their much smaller counterparts. Because of this effect, in essence, community banks have become too small to survive as mergers and acquisitions have occurred all over the map.  Independent bankers have reported that since 2009, Texas has lost nearly one-third of its banks--one-third of its banks. They have said that based on Federal data on rural counties, approximately one-third don't have a local credit union or bank at all. This bill addresses that situation. It enjoys wide bipartisan support, and I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting passage before the end of the week.                             Fix NICS Bill  Madam President, on another matter, I want to emphasize another point and talk about a new milestone reached and announce some good news.  We have now reached 64 total cosponsors for a bill I have introduced with the junior Senator from Connecticut, Mr.Murphy, called the Fix NICS, which is the background check reform bill we cosponsored together.  In an institution like this, during polarized times, it is pretty remarkable that you have 64 Senators--32 Democrats and 32 Republicans--coming together and saying: Yes, we have a problem, and, yes, we want to work together to fix it.  This is the kind of legislation the Nation has been waiting for, as people continue to be frustrated, frightened, and depressed by random acts of violence that have broken out in and around some of our churches, our cities, and our schools. I am talking about shootings like those that occurred at Sutherland Springs, TX, outside of San Antonio, in Las Vegas, and, of course, Parkland, With Fix NICS, we are saying the status quo is not acceptable.  I am happy to hear my friend the Democratic leader, Senator Schumer, say there are other things he and his colleagues on the other side of the aisle would like to do. I would just quote to him some ancient wisdom; that ``the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.'' We ought to take that first step and do what we can do today and do what is achievable in order to make our communities safer.  I have talked about it before, but if the background check system had been working the way Congress intended, the shooter who murdered 26 people as they worshiped on Sunday morning in Sutherland Springs, outside of San Antonio, and injured 20 more would not have been able to legally purchase firearms because the background check system would have reflected the fact that he was a convicted felon, he had been convicted of domestic violence, and he had been in a mental institution. All three of those things are disqualifiers from being able to legally purchase firearms under current law, but if the background system isn't uploaded with the appropriate information for the FBI to maintain, then those convictions will never be discovered, and someone can merely lie their way into purchasing firearms and committing atrocities like we saw in Sutherland  Fix NICS is designed to make sure convicted felons can't get access to firearms because, under current law, they are disallowed from doing so. It is designed to make sure people who commit domestic violence can't buy a firearm because they are currently prohibited by law from doing so. It is designed to make sure people who are dishonorably discharged from the military can't legally get a firearm because the current law prohibits them from doing so.  Sometimes criminals with domestic abuse convictions, records of mental illness, and violent erratic behavior slip through the cracks and get their hands on guns, despite what the law already prohibits. That is why it is so important for us to pass this legislation now--again, with 64 cosponsors of the legislation, evenly divided between Republicans and  The effectiveness of doing this sort of background check system has been confirmed by academic research. A recent study by RAND Corporation found evidence that dealer background checks may decrease firearm homicides by as much as 20 percent or more. In other words, it saves lives. One specific part of that study further suggested that enforcing background checks for felony records may have a similar diminishing effect. In other words, enforcement matters, and enforcement is what we are trying to ensure.  We have learned from Sutherland Springs that the NICS system is not operating as Congress intended and that the military, in this instance, was not uploading certain records, but they are not alone. Recent news reports out of places like Ohio have shown it is often the case at the State level as well. We know, a few years back, the shooter at Virginia Tech, near Washington, DC, had been adjudicated mentally ill by the State of Virginia, but the State had never uploaded that information on the background check system, so he was able to purchase a firearm.  This bill will save lives. I know my friend the Democratic leader, the minority leader, has said: Well, it is not enough, but if it saves lives, isn't it a good start? I am grateful to him for cosponsoring the legislation. You couldn't tell he cosponsored the legislation by his comments here, acting like this is somehow not a very important step, but it is because it will save lives.  This bill has the backing of the President as well, whom I have spoken to personally, and the minority and majority leaders in the Senate and is supported by gun groups across the spectrum from--yes, the National Rifle Association but also Everytown for Gun They are at the opposite ends of the ideological spectrum when it comes to the Second It is not just them. It is others like the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, Sandy Hook Promise, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the[[Page S1621]]National Domestic Violence Hotline, and the National Sheriffs'  It really is remarkable when you have groups with such widely divergent views, when it comes to the Second Amendment, come together and say: Well, this is where we can find common ground. This is where we can actually do something. That is reflected in the 64 bipartisan cosponsors we have for the bill.  The bill would do this: First, it would require Federal agencies and States to produce NICS implementation plans, in other words, to fix what is broken, including measures to verify the accuracy of the records.  It would hold Federal agencies accountable if they fail to upload the relevant information.  I think it is accurate information, but I have heard that after the shooting in Sutherland Springs, the military has now gone back and uploaded 4,000 additional records into the NICS background check system that weren't previously loaded. Those are 4,000 people now in the system who, if they attempted to buy a firearm legally through a gun store or Federal licensed firearm dealer, would not be able to do so because there would be a hit on the FBI background check system.  I think if we provided similar incentives to the States, we would see a similar increase in compliance and public safety continue to be enhanced.  This bill would reward States that comply with their NICS implementation plan through Federal grants incentives. It would reauthorize and improve law enforcement programs to help State governments share relevant criminal record information. Let's not forget, this is not just a Federal problem.  Finally, the bill would provide important technical assistance to Federal agencies and States that are working to comply with NICS record-sharing requirements.  We have all the support we need. What we need is a vote. I know that despite the minority leader's comments here today, he does not oppose this bill. He says it is merely not enough, but why can't we pass this bill that we all agree on and then build from there? I am not afraid of having any debate or any vote on any matter related to the Second That is why our constituents sent us here, to debate and to vote and to be held accountable for those votes.  I know there is pressure from those who want more controversial measures to be added, but frankly they are ones that can't pass the Senate, much less the House, or be signed into the law. I would hope we focus--focus our attention on what is achievable, what is bipartisan, what brings people together at the opposite ends of the ideological spectrum and pass the Fix NICS bill. Again, NICS is the National Instant Criminal Background Check It will improve our background check system and in the process save lives.  If we did nothing else--and I am not advocating that for a moment, but if we did nothing else in this space other than pass this background check reform system, we would save lives. I don't know why that is not compelling enough to everyone to actually get it done. I hope it is, and I hope we do so without further delay.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

1990,topic-id,849,"Mr.President, just 2 days ago, the White House announced its plans to reduce gun violence in our Nation's schools. This is an important issue, and the White House's recommendations should be taken seriously. I certainly do.  The President's blueprint attempts to address this pervasive problem from multiple angles during what has been a period of heightened tension and discord across the country. Parents and children continue to grapple every day with the aftermath of the shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, But, of course, the problem didn't start with that single event and what I think can only be fairly called a catastrophic failure across the board, which resulted in this terrible tragedy.  One important piece of the White House plan is to train school staffers. The President strongly supports a bill introduced by the senior Senator from Utah that would authorize funding for school safety improvements. You wouldn't think that would be controversial. Those school safety improvements include training efforts, school threat assessment, and crisis intervention teams. This bill is called the STOP School Violence We ought to pass it, and we ought to pass it today.  As Senator Hatch said last week, there has been little disagreement but a lot of discussion and debate and not much legislative progress. He said: ``To break the impasse, we must unite on the issues where we agree.''  I couldn't agree with Senator Hatch more. We must unite on the issues where we can agree. One of those issues relates to a bill that I have introduced with the junior Senator from Connecticut, Mr.Murphy, to improve background checks on gun purchases.  NICS is the National Instant Criminal Background Check As of earlier today, the bill called Fix NICS now has 69 cosponsors. That is nine votes more than we need in order to pass legislation, so clearly we could and should get it done.  The numbers speak for themselves: 32 Republicans and 36 Democrats want to strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check Why? Because we want to save lives.  There have been some who have come to the floor and have said in public comments: Well, we want to do more.  Well, God bless you. I hope that we will have other ideas presented that could do even more, but we know this has the political support and the critical mass we need to get this done in the Senate and to get it done now.  The reason this particular legislation is supported by so many Senators is, essentially, that it enforces current law. In other words, current law states that a felon--a person convicted of a felony in any court in the Nation--cannot buy or possess a firearm. It also says that a person who has committed and been convicted of an act of domestic violence cannot purchase or possess a firearm. If you entered the country illegally, you cannot possess or purchase a firearm, and so on and so forth. There are also provisions that if you have been adjudicated as a person with mental illness, you cannot legally purchase or possess a firearm. The problem is that many States and the Federal Government have done a very poor job of uploading the appropriate information into the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System, so there are gaps in the system.  The most notable one recently occurred in Sutherland Springs, TX, outside of San Antonio, where 26 people were killed and 20 more were injured by a gunman who purchased the guns illegally. He lied on his background check and, sadly, the Federal Government had failed to discharge its duty to upload the appropriate information, which would have revealed that at the point of sale. I am convinced that those 26 people who are dead would be alive today and the 20 more who were wounded would not have been shot if an appropriate background check system had been in place. We have reached critical mass, and I believe we are at a tipping point.  I believe the public is demanding that we do something. That is what we usually hear when these mass shootings occur. People say: Well, do something.  My question is, OK, what is it that you want us to do?  This is something concrete and specific. It enjoys broad political support and will save lives, so I believe it is worth doing, and it is worth doing today, if possible.                               Tax Reform  Mr.President, the other topic I want to address is the legislation that was signed into law in December called the Tax Cuts and Jobs That is the formal name of the comprehensive overhaul of our Nation's Tax The tax change we made was a change in the law that doubled the standard deduction, meaning that for the first $24,000 a married couple earns, they will pay zero income tax.

For hundreds of years, people have come to our shores[[Page H1455]]in search of a better life for themselves and for their children.  Immigrants from across the world have made incredible contributions to our country. We know that as fact. From starting businesses to healing the sick, to harvesting our fields and putting food on America's dinner table, to ensuring safety and pursuing justice, immigrants have made America a great nation because of their contributions. Yet there have been times when our Nation has struggled to live up to our own ideals, and right now, I think, is one of those times.  This week, the President's deadline, March 5, 2 days past, to end the DACA program took effect, threatening hundreds of thousands of lives of Now, let us remember, this is because of President Trump's unilateral action last September to repeal DACA that we are in the position that we are in today.  Mr.Speaker, I am standing here with the Dreamers, with over 80 percent of Americans, and with many of my colleagues who believe we ought to fix this problem. I ask Speaker Ryan and I call upon this Chamber to vote now on the bipartisan, bicameral Dream  This bill would provide permanent legislative protections for our Dreamers, immigrants who were brought to the United States' shores as children at the average age of 6 years. For them, America is the only country they have ever known. The Dream Act will provide these young people with legal status and, ultimately, a path to citizenship.  In my district, there are thousands of DACA recipients, thousands of Dreamers, currently, over 600 at the University of California, Merced, and more than that at my alma mater, Fresno  President Castro at Fresno State and I had a meeting with a group of Dreamers recently. Let me tell you about one student whom I met, who would be helped by the Dream Act, What a story he had to tell, along with the other students.  Rodolfo came to the United States with his mother and siblings when he was 4 years old, at great risk. He is set to graduate from Fresno State with a degree in chemistry this year.  DACA gave him the ability to work through school and help his family. And after all, isn't that the immigrant way?  Just last week, Rodolfo got some great news. He learned that he was admitted to the University of California, San Francisco's School of Pharmacy, one of the best schools in the His dream as a Dreamer is to use his education and skills to give back to our communities by providing healthcare to underserved communities.  Rodolfo, we want Dreamers like you here in the United There are over 800,000 of you, all contributing and giving. Many of you serve in our armed services today.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to bring the Dream Act to the floor for a vote. Support this legislation. They should not be held hostage for other agendas that are out there, and clearly this is the case.  This is common sense. I ask my colleagues to do the right thing. Let's bring the Dream Act to the floor as soon as we can.  ",CREC-2018-03-07-pt1-PgH1451-6.txt,1774,"ECONOMIC GROWTH, REGULATORY RELIEF, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT--",2018.0,7.0,March
1503,topic-id,723,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to talk about the challenges that we face, not only in my constituency as it relates to California agriculture, but a host of other issues as well.  We are in the process of trying to reauthorize the farm bill, something we do every 4 years. It used to be--and we hope it will continue this year--one of the more bipartisan efforts we are engaged in.  I represent not only the heartland of the San Joaquin Valley, but third-generation farmer.  Last week--as I do every weekend when I go home--I was walking the rows of the almond trees on my ranch outside of Fresno, They are beautiful. They are in full bloom this time of year. There is not a time, though, in the year, in the San Joaquin Valley, where the incredible bounty of the 300 crops that we grow are not on display because they are always out there.  The blossoms in the spring grow into the almonds, walnuts, and pistachios until late summer. Tomatoes are harvested in August and September, followed by cotton in October and The dairymen and dairy processors work every day because those cows have to be milked every day year-round to produce the finest quality milk, cheese, and butter.  As I walked through my orchard, I remembered the countless stories and insights by my fellow California farmers, ranchers, dairymen and -women shared with me over the past year, and I think about my father, who farmed all of his life, and my grandfather.  In anticipation of the 2018 farm bill, I have held round tables and listening sessions, attended agriculture townhalls, and met with our farmers and farm workers, who, every day, work so hard to put those food products on America's dinner table.  I have done this to hear firsthand the concerns and priorities of our local producers, farm workers, and nutrition organizations regarding our Nation's food supply.  I have also had numerous meetings with key agriculture and trade officials, including Agriculture Secretary Perdue, who has been out to California a number of times.  And as we in Congress move together with farm bill negotiations, we must maintain strong support for the cultivation and production of fresh fruits and vegetables, which are the foundation of a healthy diet. California produces over half of the Nation's fruits and vegetables. It is truly amazing. Three hundred crops.  We must also make sure that we do not abandon our Nation's most vulnerable through inhumane cuts to the nutrition programs that provide a steady source of food to our Nation's food supply. We are talking about our safety net, we are talking about the SNAP program, and we are talking about Women, Infants, and This has been part of the glue on a bipartisan basis that has kept Democrats and Republicans together in the reauthorization of the farm bill.  But we must have a safety net for those who are most unfortunate in our society. We should work to expand foreign markets for our products and to incentivize sound conservation practices and research. Research is very important to ensure the sustainability. Sustainability is critical--and continued growth of American agriculture.  We have the opportunity with the farm bill to address the crippling agriculture labor crisis afflicting our farms, and it must be addressed as we look at a broken immigration system that not only impacts our Dreamers--the DACA program--but a reliable supply of farm labor.  These are all among the issues that we must address to ensure that our Nation's food supply is reliable, because, guess what, it is a national security issue. People don't look at it that way. People go into the grocery store and they think: Well, what is the problem; grocery stores have all the food in the world. They go to the restaurants, and they have all the food that you need.  But the food doesn't go to the grocery store or to those restaurants without it being grown by America's men[[Page H1377]]and women who labor--less than 3 percent of the Nation's population--to produce the finest, highest quality, greatest yield, most nutritious food anywhere in the world, every night on America's dinner table.  That is why we must come together--Democrats and Republicans--to improve our Nation's food supply by passing a strong, bipartisan farm bill.

1499,topic-id,829,"Mr.Speaker, almost exactly a year ago, when the Trump administration came into office and the new Republican majority again elected its leaders, they promised to focus on the forgotten American, the middle class families that have been left behind, according to the speeches that were given at that time.  Well, there is no issue which I think resonates more powerfully with middle class families than the unrelenting rise in the cost of college and higher education.  Again, the numbers surround us: $1.3 trillion in student loan debt, according to the Federal Reserve  Just a few weeks ago, some colleges and universities, the real flagships of our Nation, the Harvards, the Yales, announced that tuition, room and board now will exceed $70,000 a year.  Again, not every college charges that much, but, unfortunately, if you look historically, as those colleges and universities surpass these unfortunate milestones, most colleges follow right in the wake.  We need action and we need change in terms of making sure that that ticket to success, whether it is in science, technology, engineering, and math, for young Americans is actually going to exist, and this Congress has neglected and failed to move forward.  Just within the last month, what we have seen is the following. The IRS just issued their follow-up rules to the Republican tax bill, which clarifies that families can no longer deduct home equity loans to pay for college. So for a family who has diligently paid their mortgages, whose kid has been accepted to a college and university, who doesn't qualify for Pell grants, who has exhausted their Stafford loans, because those are capped, and who wants to actually use the equity in their house to help pay for college, they can no longer deduct the interest on those payments.  I am very much thankful to the Republican tax bill, which, again, took great care of people who earn over $400,000, whose top marginal rates were drastically cut, or corporations whose rates were drastically cut; but middle class families are, again, now being asked to bear a higher cost for college by cutting off that avenue that, again, millions of families have used over the years in terms of using their home's equity.  In addition, the Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos--400 days in office and she has never stepped foot in the Education and the Workforce Committee, which I sit on--last Friday, issued a rule that basically preempted the ability of States attorneys general to issue rules and regulations to protect students and families from unscrupulous loan servicers.  Again, our offices get flooded with calls with frustrated students who graduated and, again, have loan servicers who lose documents, who lose payments. And, again, what was happening at the State level, both Republicans and Democratic attorneys general were putting into place rules and regulations to protect those people caught in these predicaments.  On Friday, the Secretary of Education, a Republican, who supposedly believes in States' rights, told those States that they will be issuing rules preempting States from protecting those people caught in these situations.  Lastly, last week, the Office of Inspector General, which is a nonpartisan arm of government--its job is to look at government negligence and malfeasance and problems--issued a warning that the Republican higher education bill, which was reported out in December, the misnamed PROSPER Act, will, again, lift all the regulations on for-profit colleges, which, again, take advantage of students, overpromising skills and degrees that turn out to be worthless at the end. Again, we know about ITT Tech, Corinthian Colleges, which was shut down by the last administration because of the outrageous practices that they were involved in.  The PROSPER Act basically lifts all of those controls that the Department has over them, and it is open season in terms of students who are going to be subject to that kind of environment.  By the way, the group that is probably the most vulnerable are veterans,[[Page H1510]]because their GI Bill is so rich in benefits, those are the ones that for-profit colleges target.  Why do I know that?  Holly Petraeus, General David Petraeus's wife, who was in charge of warning veterans about these problems a couple of years ago--again, the term that she uses is that for-profit colleges see servicemembers as nothing more than dollar signs in uniforms--again, has warned us that this sector of the higher education community needs more scrutiny in terms of making sure that there is real gainful employment for people who go through these colleges, and to make sure that those colleges actually do not siphon off precious GI Bill dollars, Pell dollars and Stafford loans.  It is time for this Congress to wake up and respond to what was one of the most powerful issues in 2016 about the cost of colleges drowning middle class families. But just again in the last month, we have seen this Republican administration and this Congress go in exactly the opposite direction.

955,topic-id,3768,"Mr.President, I rise again today to speak further on 2155, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection  We have had a lot of discussion on the floor about this bill in the last few days. Anybody who took the opportunity to watch all of that debate sees that there is a strong bipartisan support for this bill and a strong debate coming from some quarters trying to say that the bill creates greater risk in our financial community. I would like to address exactly what this bill does and then respond to some of those charges, which I consider to be completely unfounded.  The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act is aimed at rightsizing regulation for financial institutions--including community banks and credit unions--making it easier for consumers to get mortgages and to obtain credit.  I have said a number of times, and I will repeat, back when we were debating the Dodd-Frank legislation about 10 years ago, it was marketed to the public as a bill to address excesses and problems on Wall Street by the big megabanks of our country, but its provisions hit hardest on Main  As I have said, I actually held a news conference in Boise, ID--in my home State--on Main I said the crosshairs of this bill and the bulls-eye are on Main Street, not Wall  What has happened in the last 10 years? The Wall Street banks have been phenomenally profitable. They have been very successful, and the smaller banks--the credit unions, the community banks, even the regional banks--have been hammered.  We are losing credit unions and, more specifically, community banks across this Nation at an alarming pace, and the reason--the primary reason--is the phenomenally significant increased regulatory burden they face.  I have heard colleagues of mine on the floor in the last couple of days talking about specific community banks and credit unions in their States that have had so much pressure put on them, so much burden and financial costs put on them by the excessive regulations that they have either gone out of business or stopped issuing mortgages, just stopped doing mortgage business or stopped doing loans of certain types that are beneficial to our small businesses. So the real victims aren't even just the community banks and credit unions; they are the people--the people who want to get a loan in their local communities and who are entirely worthy of getting a loan to buy a house, but their credit unions and community banks are no longer in that business or they are no longer in existence. That is what this bill is addressing.  The bill also increases important consumer protections for veterans, senior citizens, victims of fraud, and those who fall on tough financial times. The provisions in this bill will directly address some of the problems I frequently hear about from financial institutions. Let me explain in a little more detail just what that is. I have already discussed some.[[Page S1571]]  Community banks and credit unions are simple institutions, focused on relationship lending and have special relationships with the people in their communities. The bankers and their customers go to church, play ball, or their kids go to school with each other. They know their customers, and they are willing to work with them to help them be successful. They provide credit to traditionally underserved and rural communities, where it may be harder to access banking products and services or to get a loan.  Dodd-Frank instituted numerous new mortgage rules and complex capital requirements on community banks and credit unions that have hindered consumers' access to mortgage credit and lending more broadly.  I guess I will just insert here, this phenomenon we often see in Washington of one-size-fits-all or cookie-cutter solutions to a problem is directly the kind of problem we are seeing here.  Our smaller financial institutions are treated as though they were large megabanks and as though their business models and their portfolios contain the same kind of risk as the larger banks. Yet they don't have the same business models; they don't have the same risk footprint, but they are forced to go through phenomenally expensive regulatory burdens for no good reason.  I can't tell you how many of these small bank and credit union folks have said to me: Our industry did not cause or have any part in the financial crisis, but we are being asked to pay the price. That is what this bill deals with.  In July of 2016, the American Action Forum attempted to estimate the number of paperwork hours and final costs associated with these rules and regulations that I am talking about. In total, the forum estimated that the law had imposed more than $36 billion in final rule costs and 73 million paperwork hours as of July 2016. What does that mean? To put these figures into perspective, the costs are nearly $112 per person or $310 per household.  Additionally, it would take 36,950 employees--that is 36,950 employees--working full time to complete a single year of the law's paperwork based on the agency's calculations themselves.  Our bill is focused on providing meaningful relief to our community banks and credit unions, helping them to prudently lend to consumers, home buyers, and small businesses--small businesses that we all acknowledge are the engines of our economy, yet lack credit and lack access to capital because of these unnecessary rules. That is why the first part of the name of this bill is ``economic growth.'' This bill will provide a needed shot in the arm for our economy across this country.  By responsibly expanding the qualified mortgage safe harbor, addressing severe appraiser shortages in rural areas, reducing superfluous HMDA reporting requirements, and exempting certain loans from escrow requirements, our bill will ease the compliance and regulatory reporting requirements borne by many of these small financial institutions and free up scarce resources for their communities, enabling more individuals to find a home loan or get the funding to start a business. And this does not increase financial risk.  A number of local credit unions have weighed in on the positive impact our bill will have on increasing access to affordable mortgage credit.  Additionally, had our bill's provisions on a rule called TRID--a 3-day waiting period--had they been in place in 2017, it would have helped over 1.5 million credit union members at over 3,800 credit unions throughout the Nation, enabling them to take advantage of a lower interest rate and to avoid potential delays in the mortgage origination process. I will tell my colleagues, anybody who has had to go through the mortgage origination process today knows the paperwork I am talking about.  Our bill also drastically simplifies the capital regime for certain highly capitalized community banks compared to the current Basel III requirements that are more appropriate for larger, sophisticated financial institutions.  Rebecca Romero Rainey, the former chairman and CEO of Centinel Bank of Taos and CEO-elect of the Community Bankers of America, made a commonsense observation. She said:       Under Basel III, community bank capital regulation has      become significantly more punitive and complex. Do we really      need four definitions of regulatory capital, a capital      conservation buffer, and impossibly complex rules governing      capital deductions and adjustments?       Applying the rule to community banks in a one-size-fits-all      manner harms the consumers and businesses we serve.  She added:       I seriously doubt that my grandfather would have founded      Centinel if he had to comply with Basel III and the other new      regulations that exist today.  We want to encourage people to bank in their communities.  Dodd-Frank also dealt with midsized and regional banks, and our bill does too. Dodd-Frank swept many simple midsized and regional banks into its enhanced prudential standards, but it was meant for the largest and most complex institutions. Each new regulation poses a tradeoff between hiring new employees to help comply with those standards versus employees to provide customers the products and services they want and need.  Deron Smithy, executive vice president and treasurer for Regions Bank, a regional bank based in Alabama, described the implications of this on his institution, saying, ``We now have more people in our organization devoted to compliance-related matters than we do for commercial lending'' and that ``the direct cost, as well as management's time and attention to meeting these rules, creates a disproportionate burden on regional banks. Collectively, the incremental cost of regulatory compliance exceeds $2 billion annually.'' The $2 billion in costs that Mr.Smithy mentioned were just the direct costs. Indirect costs include management and other business units' time being diverted from fully serving their clients.  These are not just empty numbers; behind these numbers are real economic consequences. That is a fact Mr.Smithy noted in his testimony before the Banking       For a company like Regions, that standard being lifted      would likely liberate as much as 10 percent additional      capacity for lending, which--  In his bank's case--     would be $8 billion to $10 billion.       That is capital and access that are not available to      individuals, families, and small businesses in this      That is one bank.  During another Banking Committee hearing, Robert Hill, CEO of South State Corporation, a midsized bank, noted that when their institution crossed the $10 billion threshold, ``South State was impacted by over $20 million per year, a significant sum for a bank our size. What impact does that have on our local communities? For us, that equates to 300 jobs. Approximately 10 percent of our branches were closed, and even more jobs diverted away from lending to regulatory compliance.''  Section 401 of our bill raises the SIFI threshold for applying enhanced prudential standards from $50 billion to $250 billion--a level that many, many financial experts have encouraged for years--and the $10 billion threshold for applying an annual, company-run stress test to midsized banks while maintaining important safeguards against risks to the U.financial system. This will free up valuable financial and human resources to help keep more branches open, increase lending to consumers and small businesses, and lower the cost of borrowing for consumers.  The bill also deals with housing policy. Our bill provides some important improvements to HUD programs, making them more effective and efficient and enabling public housing authorities across the country to better address the housing needs of their local community.  Our bill enhances HUD's Family Self-Sufficiency Program, which will enable a greater number of families currently assisted by HUD to obtain job training, education, childcare, and ultimately achieve financial independence. Specifically, the bill would broaden the scope of supportive services that can be offered to these participants, including home ownership assistance, training in asset management, obtaining a GED, and education in pursuit of a postsecondary degree or certification. It would also streamline the administration of the program, making it easy for local public housing authorities to deliver it in their communities.[[Page S1572]]  For the first time ever, our bill will enable many families who live in privately owned apartments backed by project-based rental assistance to also participate in the FSS  Our bill would also provide targeted regulatory relief to small public housing agencies operating in rural communities. While smaller public housing authorities typically have far fewer staff and resources than larger urban agencies, they, too, are currently held to many of the same burdensome regulatory requirements as some of the largest ones in the country. As a result, this means that more of their time and money are spent completing paperwork and less are able to be dedicated to promoting access to affordable housing in these communities.  Our bill would provide tailored regulatory relief that recognizes the unique challenges faced by smaller public housing authorities in rural areas. Specifically, it would provide a simpler option for calculating utilities, simplify environmental review requirements for new developments, streamline inspection requirements, and make it easier to coordinate efforts, such as enabling shared waiting lists with neighboring agencies and enabling neighboring agencies to pool their resources to develop larger projects.  These changes will set up these small agencies for success and enable them to direct a greater amount of time, effort, and resources toward their core mission: promoting access to affordable housing.  The bill is also a consumer protection bill. It ensures that key consumer protections remain in place and increases protections for consumers who have fallen on hard financial times or become victims of fraud.  Following the Equifax data breach, we held two credit bureau hearings. These hearings demonstrated bipartisan support for some important measures. The bill provides 1 free year of fraud alerts for consumers potentially impacted by the Equifax breach or other instances of fraud. It gives consumers unlimited free credit freezes and unfreezes during the year. It allows parents to turn on and off credit reporting for children under 16.  The bill also includes important protections for veterans and senior citizens. The Department of Veterans Affairs Choice Program provides veterans non-VA medical care if they can't access care at a VA medical facility. Unfortunately, the VA Choice Program has been rife with issues, including delayed payments and misassigned medical bills to veterans. As a result, veterans have experienced negative credit items on their reports, which unnecessarily complicates their and their families' lives.  The largest credit reporting agencies took a step to alleviate this problem by delaying reporting medical debt on a consumer's credit report for 180 days, but more can still be done. Our bill goes a step further by prohibiting medical debt arising from the Choice Program and other non-VA healthcare providers from being reported to credit-reporting agencies for 1 year and provides veterans a process to dispute or remove incorrect information already on their reports.  According to a study conducted by MetLife, seniors lose at least $2.9 billion annually in reported cases of financial exploitation. Despite the prevalence of senior financial fraud, the National Adult Protective Services Association estimated that only 1 in 44 cases of financial abuse is ever reported.  Current bank privacy laws make it difficult for the financial institutions and their employees to report any potential fraudulent activity without incurring legal liability, and as a result, few cases of financial abuse are reported. Our bill would give financial advisers civil liability protection when reporting suspected financial abuse of seniors. This will empower and encourage our financial service representatives to identify warning signs of common scams and help stop financial fraud targeting our seniors.  Now I wish to turn for just a moment--I have gone over some of the positive benefits and provisions in this bill. I would like to turn for a moment to the criticisms, because, if my colleagues have been listening to the attacks, the attacks are that this is an effort to go help the big banks in America get richer at the expense of poor people. This is a very common type of attack on almost any proposal to fix a regulation in the financial system.  One of the things we have heard is that it gives the regulators too much flexibility to tailor regulations to the size of the institution being regulated. This bill carefully balances the need to provide regulators with the appropriate discretion at the technical level, while imposing specific directions to ensure appropriate tailoring for Main Street banks and maintaining core supervisory tools for the largest banks.  Regulators will still be required to ensure that banks operate in a safe and sound manner and still retain extensive authorities to do so.  The bill also requires regulators to do more to tailor regulations to ensure that the level of regulation and scrutiny of banks reflects the potential risks posed by the institutions--something that folks in my State would say is just common sense.  In the face of all of this, we have talked to a lot of the regulators themselves to see what they think of the idea, and they are consistently saying: Let us have the flexibility to regulate appropriately, and we will do the job. We will ensure that we have safety and soundness, and we will ensure that we are not putting undue regulatory burdens on our financial institutions, particularly the smallest ones.  Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell said:       You know, we really want the most stringent things to be      happening at the systemically important banks--the most      stringent stress tests, in particular--and we want to tailor      or taper, as we go down into less significant, less      systemically important institutions.  Powell added: ``Those banks [below $100 billion] are not systemically important.  What he meant by that is they don't present systemic risks to the economy. We should analyze them and regulate them and supervise them in a more appropriate fashion.  Federal Reserve Vice Chairman for Supervision Randy Quarles has also noted the importance of tailoring, saying:       One of the important general themes of regulation is      ensuring that the character of the regulation is adapted to      the character of the institution being regulated, what has      become the word ``tailoring.''       I fully support that, and I think that it's not only      appropriate to recognize the different levels of risk, and      types of risk that different institutions in the system pose,      but that it also makes for better and more efficient      regulation, and efficient regulation allows the financial      system to more efficiently support the real economy.  That is what we are talking about here.       So I do think that we should look very carefully . . . at      tailoring capital regulation and other types of regulation to      the particular character of the institutions that are      regulated, and that includes their size, and that includes      other aspects of the character.  Another critique I have heard is that the bill erodes the power of stress testing as a supervisory tool. In one way or another, many have stood on this floor and talked about the need to have this kind of flexibility, and others have stood on this floor and said it creates a huge threat to our economy.  We have a hearing each year called the Humphrey-Hawkins hearing when the Chairman of the Federal Reserve comes and testifies to the Senate and then to the This year, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve came before the To ensure that people and Members understood what this bill does, I asked Chairman Jay Powell: If this bill were to pass, is it accurate that the Federal Reserve would still be required to conduct a supervisory stress test for any bank with total assets between $100 billion and $250 billion to ensure that it has enough capital to weather economic downturns?  He replied: Yes, it is.  I asked: Is it accurate that the bill's change of the threshold from $50 billion to $250 billion for enhanced prudential standards does not weaken oversight of the largest, globally systemic banks?  He said: That is correct.  The Dodd-Frank Act established a $50 billion asset threshold to apply enhanced prudential standards to banks. Applying enhanced standards broadly to regional banks with simple business models and low-risk profiles has had significant consequences in the marketplace. Although there has been much debate about the appropriate[[Page S1573]]level for the threshold, there is bipartisan agreement that $50 billion is too low, including among Federal Reserve Chairman Powell, former Federal Reserve Bank Chairman Yellen, former Acting Comptroller Noreika, and former Comptroller  Current Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell said: ``Our view has been that that combination of raising the threshold and giving us the ability to go below it in cases where needed gives us the tools that we need.''  Former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has said:       We've already said that we would favor some increase, if      Congress sticks with a dollar threshold--that we would      support some increase in the threshold. An approach based on      business model or factors is also a workable approach from      our point of view. Conceivably, some of the enhanced      standards should apply to more firms with lower levels of      assets, and others with higher levels. So I think either type      of approach is something that we could--we could work with      and would be supportive of.  That is the former Chair of the Federal  Our bill rightsizes regulations by raising the $50 billion threshold to $250 billion. Banks with total assets below $100 billion are exempt immediately from these enhanced standards, while those with between $100 billion and $250 billion are presumed exempt 18 months after the bill is enacted unless the Federal Reserve Board determines that they need to have some additional level of standard applied, and the Federal Reserve is given full authority to do so. The provision allows the Federal Reserve to tailor regulations to a bank's business model and risk profile.  This provision in no way diminishes the effectiveness of prudential regulations, and it provides the Federal Reserve sufficient regulatory and supervisory discretion to apply these enhanced standards on any firm it deems a threat to systemic risk or safety and soundness.  Let me restate that. If you have heard any of the attacks, you have heard that the Federal Reserve will not be able to adequately regulate the banks anymore. The past two Chairmen of the Federal Reserve have said that is not correct, but the bill itself provides that the Federal Reserve continues to have the authority to apply enhanced standards on any firm it deems a threat to systemic risk or safety and soundness.  So, again, for those who are attacking the bill, I think their arguments are unfounded and, frankly, based in an effort to try to create concern about a risk that does not exist.  This provision also requires the Federal Reserve to apply a periodic supervisory stress test to banks with between $100 billion and $200 billion in assets, something that is often overlooked by those commenting on the bill.  I have tried to go over some of the positive aspects of this bill and explain why its title is Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act and respond to some of the false, unfounded attacks on this bill.  This bill does not create any increased risk at the level of supervision for the megabanks, those that were intended to be the target of Dodd-Frank when it was adopted, but it does provide increased support for those community banks and credit unions, and those regional banks and midsized banks that are being so badly hurt and whose customers are being so deprived of needed and justified access to credit and capital. That is what this debate is about.  I encourage all of my colleagues to support this legislation as we move forward and help us bring economic growth, regulatory relief, and consumer protection to all  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2018-03-08-pt1-PgS1565.txt,250,NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR COMBATING THE FINANCING OF TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL,2018.0,8.0,March

The primary purpose of this legislation is to make targeted changes to simplify and improve the regulatory regime for community banks, credit unions, midsized banks, and regional banks to promote economic growth.  Many of us represent rural States where community banks and credit unions are the primary providers of credit and financial services. These institutions hold a competitive advantage over their larger counterparts, operating with a relationship-based knowledge of their customers and an understanding of their unique needs. They are decidedly disadvantaged when it comes to keeping up with the ever-increasing compliance and examiner demands coming out of  Our bill offers much needed reforms that will reduce unnecessary burdens on smaller financial institutions so that they can use more of their capital serving customers rather than complying with Federal regulations that were never intended for them. It also adds protections against fraud and identity theft for consumers, veterans, senior citizens, and others, as well as for those falling on hard financial times.  This bill is the product of robust, bipartisan negotiation. It was years in the making. It is the outgrowth of feedback and input garnered from a process we initiated in the Banking Committee across all stakeholders in America, as well as from previous meetings, briefings, and many conversations and negotiations among the members.

In fact, when the Dodd-Frank legislation was initially proposed and we were debating it on the floor of this Senate, I held a news conference in Idaho, on Main Street in one of our cities. I said that this bill was not targeted at Wall Street, as it was being marketed; instead, it was being targeted at Main Street--our small financial institutions and communities. That has turned out to be exactly the case. Since the passage of Dodd-Frank, our big banks have profited wonderfully, but our small banks, our small financial institutions--credit unions and community banks--have suffered terribly.  2155 is aimed at right-sizing the regulation for financial institutions, primarily community banks and credit unions, which makes it easier for consumers to get mortgages or obtain credit. It also increases important consumer protections for veterans, senior citizens, victims of fraud, and those who fall on tough financial times.  Congress has held numerous hearings in prior years exploring many of these issues, and the product before us today is the result of a years-long process and careful vetting.  This bill has received widespread support from commentators, regulators, businesses, and institutions representing millions of hard-working Americans and consumers, including over 10,000 community bankers, more than 100 million credit union consumer members, and thousands of small business owners and entrepreneurs, among others.  The reforms in this bipartisan bill help tailor the current regulatory landscape, while ensuring safety and soundness and relieving the burden on American businesses that are unfairly being treated like the largest companies in our economy.  The passage of this legislation holds real promise for local economies across America, and I encourage all of my colleagues to support its passage.  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

1715,topic-id,1097,"Mr.President, I rise to speak today on the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act, or This measure is the result of a strong bipartisan partnership among many Senators, including Senator Whitehouse, Senator Risch, Senator Booker, Senator Hatch, Senator Murkowski, and Senator Durbin, along with myself and a number of other Senators who have worked with us on this legislation.  I want to give special thanks to Senator Whitehouse, who is here with us today. He has been my tireless partner in this effort. I thank Senator Whitehouse for his hard work and the assistance of his staff. Sometimes, even on the easiest of legislation--and this is not in that category; this is a critical, strong piece that has taken a lot of attention--but sometimes it just takes a lot of work and effort and time. I appreciate Senator Whitehouse's efforts to stick with us, as he actually helped move this ball forward as we have tried to get this across the finish line.  I also want to express strong thanks to Senator Risch, who also deserves strong recognition for his tireless work to get this bill advanced.  This is a Senate companion to a House measure of the very same name, introduced by Representatives Weber, Eddie Bernice Johnson, and Lamar We have been working together to get this bill passed for some time, and I am eager to work with my House colleagues to make sure that NEICA is enacted as soon as possible.  We all recognize that innovation within the nuclear industry must continue and must build on American preeminence in nuclear research and development. Having grown up in Idaho Falls, ID, I am a strong supporter of nuclear energy and the Idaho National Lab, which is a world leader in R&D and a key partner in sustaining our Nation's commercial nuclear power sector. The INL has been home to more than 50 one-of-a-kind nuclear test reactors. It has led innovation after innovation and breakthrough after breakthrough. The imagination, ingenuity, and hard work of the scientists at the Lab, along with the scientists at Argonne and Oak Ridge, ensure that the United States remains the leader in development and commercialization of nuclear power.  Today, many in the industry are focusing on what it takes to keep the current fleet of reactors alive and operational. Industry leaders are worried about the waste issues, the economics of operation, and navigating the requirements of the Nuclear Regulatory Understandably, many are not focused on the future of nuclear power and what lies beyond the current generation of reactors.  Congress must find a way to help industry deal with the very real challenges that the current fleet faces. Congress must address the waste issue, and we must evaluate the costs and benefits of regulations that the government has placed on this industry. Many of the burdens on the nuclear industry are government-created, and so they must be government-solved. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee to provide sound solutions.[[Page S1422]]  Congress can't ignore the challenges of the current fleet, but we must not allow these challenges to keep us from looking forward. The nuclear power industry in America is, for better or worse, increasingly paralyzed by government redtape.  Congress must lead in focusing government agencies toward preparing for the next generation of nuclear reactors. We should create an environment in which industry can grow and advance. If we don't, we will lose to foreign competitors as companies take their technologies and business overseas. This is happening already. Companies are increasingly going to places like China, Russia, South Korea, and These countries want to export nuclear technology and are investing heavily toward that goal. If we continue down our current path, these countries will take the lead in setting the rules on proliferation and safety in the advanced nuclear industry. I would prefer that America continue to lead in this area.  The Senate version of NEICA does four very important things to encourage innovation in advanced nuclear power.  1, it directs the Department of Energy to carry out a modeling and simulation program that aids in the development of new reactor technologies.  This is an important first step in allowing the private sector to have access to the capabilities of our National Laboratories to test reactor designs and concepts.  2, it requires the Department of Energy to report its plan to establish a user facility for a versatile reactor-based fast neutron source.  This is a critical step that will allow private companies the ability to test principles of nuclear science and prove the science behind their work.  3, NEICA directs the Department of Energy to carry out a program to enable the testing and demonstration of reactor concepts proposed and funded by the private sector.  This site is to be called the National Nuclear Innovation Center, and it will function as a database to store and share knowledge on nuclear science between Federal agencies and the private sector. The Senate version of NEICA encourages the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to work together in this effort. We would like to see the Department of Energy lead the effort to establish and operate the National Nuclear Innovation Center while consulting with the NRC regarding safety issues. We would also like the NRC to have access to the work done by the center in order to provide its staff with the knowledge it will need to eventually license any new reactors coming out of the center. If these reactors are ever to get to the market, the NRC must be able to understand the ins and outs of the science and work behind their development. The NRC needs the data in order to make data-driven licensing requirements.  4, finally, it requires the NRC to report on its ability to license advanced reactors within 4 years of receiving an application.  The NRC must explain any institutional or organizational barriers it faces in moving forward with the licensing of advanced reactors.  NEICA is an important step in maintaining U.leadership in nuclear energy. It will enable the private sector and our National Labs to work together to create cutting-edge achievements in nuclear science. NEICA encourages the smartest, most innovative and creative minds in nuclear science to partner together to move the industry forward. This is a very exciting piece of legislation, and I look forward to working with my congressional colleagues to help American nuclear energy thrive today and prepare for the future.  Thank you.

1898,topic-id,1762,"Mr.President, I have been very encouraged by the reaction of my colleagues and their support for the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act over the last few days.  We have heard many stories about how the regulatory burden on our financial institutions has had a direct impact on Main Yesterday, Senator Moran talked about the ranchers who couldn't get a loan because they lacked collateral in an emergency. Senators Heitkamp and Perdue explained the benefits of relationship banking and the advantage of lending based on a personal knowledge of the customer. Senator Corker talked about Dodd-Frank's unintended consequences for small financial institutions. Senator Tester discussed bank consolidation and the real impact it has had on communities in Senator Donnelly went through the various important consumer protection items included in this bill. Senator Kennedy also talked about some of the important consumer protection provisions and about the lack of access to credit for small businesses in Senator Warner spent a good amount of time defending this robust bipartisan bill against its critics and some of the false information being shared about the bill.  Today, we have heard even more Senators come to the floor with similar stories and expressions of similar sentiments about the need to help free up our small community banks and credit unions around this country from the overpowering burdens they are facing right now in the regulatory world.  Many of my colleagues who are not on the Banking Committee have asked if they could have the time and opportunity to speak about the bill, as well, and we will see them coming to the floor, as we have started to see today, to discuss these kinds of issues. Senators McConnell, Cornyn, Portman, Lankford, and others have been very supportive of these efforts to enact pro-growth, pro-jobs legislation.  We also heard from the bill's critics yesterday. But the resounding message from Congress was that our constituents have asked for regulatory relief and consumer protection and economic growth, and we stand ready to deliver it.  We and our neighbors have noticed that many of our community financial institutions have closed their doors over the last decade. In fact, we have seen almost no new community financial institutions chartered or new branches being opened over the last few years.  These financial institutions, of all sizes and forms, provide critical services in our communities. They help businesses manage operations, help entrepreneurs get funding to start their businesses, help families buy a home, help all of us save for our kids' educations, and help us deal with financial emergencies.  Community financial institutions are the pillars of towns and communities across America, particularly in rural States like my own, They have certain advantages compared with their larger counterparts, operating with an understanding and history of their customers and, therefore, a willingness to be flexible.  Unfortunately, increased regulatory burdens and one-size-fits-all regulations have limited their ability to help customers. The operating landscape of these institutions has changed dramatically over the last few years, and community banks and credit unions across the country have struggled to keep up with the ever-increasing regulatory compliance and examiner demands coming out of  I regularly hear from small banks and credit unions in Idaho about how one-size-fits-all regulatory approaches are impacting their businesses and product offerings and hindering their ability to serve their communities.  For example, Koreen Dursteler from the Bank of Commerce in Idaho Falls, a small bank with just over $1 billion in assets, has written about the avalanche of regulation over the past 8 to 10 years. Due to excessive regulations related to qualified mortgage loans and the cost of hiring extra compliance staff to help keep up with additional regulation, her bank has had to stop offering consumer mortgages and real estate loans. That is a big deal. This is not an isolated incident. I hear stories like that all the time.  Another example: Val Brooks works at Simplot Employees Credit Union, which serves Canyon County, She noted that Simplot has long been proud to serve this area, where some folks come from lower income households and may be underserved. Simplot worked to obtain the necessary education, compliance certification, and licensing standards to better serve its customers and the community. However, after the CFPB increased already burdensome mortgage regulations, such as the qualified mortgage and HMDA, Simplot credit union had to make the very difficult business decision to stop offering mortgage loans altogether. It was just too cost prohibitive and resource-draining.  When these small financial institutions are not able to offer certain products within the communities they serve, it is a direct hit to the citizens of Idaho and to all of our  To be absolutely clear, it is not that folks are against all regulation, but rather, to the people outside of Washington, it seems as if regulatory changes are made without much thought as to how they will truly affect customers and financial providers.[[Page S1424]]As policymakers, we have a responsibility to diligently and frequently study the state of our economy, our regulatory framework, and how these things are impacting our communities and citizens, including people's access to financial services.  We must encourage regulations that not only ensure proper behavior and safety for our markets but also are tailored appropriately to the size and risk type that is being regulated. This means making sure the burden on financial institutions is not so large that consumers, businesses, and our communities are deprived of financial services and suffer as a result.  This has been an important issue to Members on both sides of the aisle. Congress has held numerous hearings in prior years exploring many of these issues, including a series of hearings in the Banking Committee in 2015. Then, in March of last year, the Banking Committee issued a request for legislative proposals that would promote economic growth. We held bipartisan hearings and briefings and meetings with stakeholders across the spectrum, vetting potential ideas for right-sizing the regulatory dynamics. We began the process by holding a hearing on the role of financial companies in fostering economic growth, which included former regulators, stakeholders, and the chief economist of the AFL- At our next two hearings, we examined proposals that would tailor existing laws and regulations to ensure that they are proportionate and appropriate for small financial institutions and midsized regional banks. Then, in June, the financial regulators provided feedback on their Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act, or EGRPRA, report and the proposals discussed in previous hearings. As a result of this process, we introduced the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, which is now 2155.  I repeat that often there are those who say we are dismantling the regulatory system. This legislation focuses on the smallest financial institutions in our country. The legislative system that was put into place was marketed as being aimed at Wall Street excesses, but I held a townhall meeting when we were debating this legislation on Main Street in Boise, ID, and said then that although the justification for some of these regulations was focused on Wall Street, the crosshairs were on Main Unfortunately, that has turned out to be all too true. Large banks have profited tremendously in the last 6 to 10 years. Small banks and credit unions have suffered dramatically. We have lost many of our banks and credit unions across this country. As I indicated earlier, very few new ones have started up because they simply cannot meet the compliance burdens of being required to meet regulatory requirements that are designed, in the first instance, for huge banks.  What we need is a regulatory system that recognizes there is a difference between a community bank or a credit union in a small community and a megabank on Wall Street that is doing its business globally. We need to have our regulatory system tailored so the risk posed by a particular financial institution is taken into consideration in the regulations applied. That is what this legislation seeks to accomplish. Like I said at the outset, I am very glad we have had broad support for this.  I would like to take a minute and go over some of the specific provisions in the bill. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act is aimed at rightsizing regulation for financial institutions, including community banks and credit unions, making it easier for consumers to get mortgages and to obtain credit.  As I have often said, the real victims of what I am talking about are not really the community banks and the credit unions but the people, the small businesses--those who need to have access to credit and need to have the ability to get a loan to purchase a house or to start a small business or to expand a small business or other important needs.  This bill also increases important consumer protections for veterans, for senior citizens, victims of fraud, and those who fall on tough financial times. The provisions in this bill will directly address some of the problems I frequently hear about from the financial institutions in Community banks and credit unions are simple institutions focused on relationship lending and have a special relationship providing credit to traditionally underserved and rural communities where it may be harder to access banking products and services or to get a loan.  Dodd-Frank instituted numerous new mortgage rules and complex capital requirements on community banks and credit unions that have hindered consumers' access to mortgage credit and lending more broadly. On July 20, 2016, the American Action Forum attempted to estimate the number of paperwork hours and final costs associated with the Dodd-Frank rules. In total, the forum estimated that the bill had imposed more than $36 billion in final rule costs and 73 million paperwork hours as of July 2016.  To put those figures into perspective, the costs are nearly $112 per person, or $310 per household. Additionally, it would take 36,950 employees working full time to complete a single year of the law's paperwork based on agency calculations.  Our bill is focused on providing meaningful relief to community banks and credit unions, helping them to prudently lend to consumers, home buyers, and small businesses.  I have more I want to say.

This bipartisan bill extends efforts to promote the dual goals of recovering certain fish species protected under the Endangered Species Act, while ensuring the continued reliability of water and power operations in the  I would like to thank the Members of Congress, both Republican and Democrat, who have cosponsored my bill. I also appreciate the work of  Rob Bishop as chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee and his help over the last several months to move my bill through the legislative process.  I think it is also worth mentioning that we have received over 20 letters of support for this bill from a wide range of stakeholders, including water conservation districts, Indian Tribes, conservation organizations, State governments, and more.  With a total water storage capacity of more than 30 million acre-feet and a capacity to generate over 5 billion megawatt hours of energy annually, the Colorado River Storage Project, or CRSP, has been vital to the economics of the Upper Colorado and San Juan River Basin States of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming, and  Four fish species listed under the Endangered Species Act also call the basin home, and the threat of water and power restrictions resulting from these listings prompted the affected States to enter into an agreement with Federal and non-Federal partners to ensure the continued reliability of the water and power operations in the  These agreements resulted in the Upper Colorado River Endangered Fish Recovery Program and the San Juan River Basin Recovery Implementation In 2000, Congress enacted legislation to establish Federal participation and cost-sharing agreements, including the authority to use CRSP power revenues, to support these two programs.  Congress reauthorized the programs in 2012, but also added necessary oversight and accountability reforms to ensure that funds are going towards recovery.  H.4465 extends the use of CRSP power revenues through 2023, which aligns with the recovery deadline for these programs and does not require any new Federal spending of Americans' hard-earned tax dollars.  In addition, the bill extends the existing transparency improvements and adds a report to highlight the programs' performance. This reauthorization is necessary to ensure that the more than 2,300 water and power projects in the five-State region can continue to operate in compliance with the Endangered Species  I am hopeful that at the conclusion of this reauthorization through 2023, these programs will have accomplished what they are seeking to achieve: the recovery and delisting of four endangered fish species.

1212,topic-id,519,"Mr.President, Montanans want to access and enjoy our State's public lands, and for a very good reason. Nothing beats our way of life in Montana--our hunting, fishing, hiking, biking, skiing, backpacking, climbing, all with a backdrop of breathtaking views and a very rich history of conservation. That is why Congressman Gianforte and I introduced the Protect Public Use of Public Lands  Our bill protects our pristine natural resources while also ensuring that Montanans are able to recreate in U.Forest Service lands that are not wilderness, but they have been locked up in regulatory limbo for decades. Congressman Gianforte's second bill deals with similarly locked-up Bureau of Land Management lands.  Here is what the Protect Public Use of Public Lands Act does. It ensures public access to land within five wilderness study areas across They are also called While there are thousands more acres of public land that are still in limbo, I put these five[[Page S1353]]WSAs in my bill for two simple reasons. First, the Forest Service determined that these lands were not suitable for wilderness in their final plan. In fact, that was a charge given by Congress in 1977. They said: Go out and study these Forest Service lands and tell us which acres are suitable for wilderness and which are not.  The acreages I am proposing we should release are those that were deemed not suitable for wilderness in the final plan by the Forest  Second, there is strong local support for unlocking these lands from the grassroots up, including the Montana State Legislature, countless local community members, and dozens of sportsmen, county commissioners, and wildlife groups, including the Western Montana Fish & Game Association and the Montana Sportsmen for Fish and  Unlocking these lands from a WSA does not--does not--automatically authorize any particular use of the land. It simply opens up and allows for public conversation about how the lands should be used by setting up the planning process for public comment. In fact, protections like the 2001 roadless rule, the Endangered Species Act, and the existing forest and travel management plans remain intact. Do you know what this means? You can't construct a new road, and that would be kept after the release of the  This has been a bottom-up approach from the get-go, and here is the bottom line. Montana's public lands are meant for everyone. They are meant for people who like to recreate in many different ways--for those who love to hike, of course, but also folks who enjoy recreating with mountain bikes, hunting, snowmobiling, and riding  Creating access to our public lands is critical to Montana's jobs and our $7 billion outdoor economy. In fact, communities in Montana understand this is an important local economic driver that will strengthen local economies that depend on outdoor jobs. In fact, just recently, the Bureau of Economic Analysis agreed. They said that outdoor recreation generates $373 billion of the GDP across our country, mostly from motorized vehicles, boating, fishing, hunting, and shooting.

731,topic-id,534,"Mr.President, today I wish to recognize and honor the extraordinary service and sacrifice of Boone County Deputy Jacob Pickett of Zionsville, His life was characterized by selflessness, dedication to his community, and a deep love for his family and faith.  Jake graduated from Brownsburg High School in 2002. He graduated from the Marion County Sheriff's Office Training Academy in 2010 and the Indiana Law Enforcement Academy in 2014. He was employed as a detention deputy with the Marion County Sheriff's Office for 3 years. After serving the Marion County Sheriff's Office, he served as a deputy at the Tipton County Sheriff's Department from 2013 to 2015. In 2015, he began his work in Boone County as a taser instructor, K-9 team leader, and a member of the Fraternal Order of Police 110. From the start, his colleagues say they knew he would be a great officer and that he was the one who would be there to help if anyone ever needed him.  Jake grew up with a kind heart, always standing up for those in need. He was described by Steve Reeves, his little league coach and pastor who baptized him as a teenager, as someone who ``had a kindness about him. He wanted to do well.'' His selflessness carried over into adulthood; whether it was serving in uniform, organizing a Christmas card drive, or volunteering to rescue animals, he continuously gave back to his community. Ultimately, Jake put his life on the line to protect the community he loves, and for his service, we are forever grateful.  The morning that he was killed, he was greeting students at Perry-Worth Elementary with his sidekick K-9, a German Shepherd named Those who knew Jake best said his love for Brik was unwavering, and he extended that love to his family and those in the community he worked to protect.  On Friday, March 2, 2018, Jake was fatally shot following a pursuit in Lebanon, He was kept on life support for a few days, so that his life of service could continue through organ donation. After he was taken off life support, his heart was donated to a patient in need at Vincent Hospital in  A devoted and loving father and husband, he is survived by his wife, Jennifer Pickett, a teacher at White Lick Elementary School; his two sons; parents Marlin and Rebecca Pickett; sister Kristi Woo; niece Hannah Woo; parents-in-law Jon and Carol Lindstrom; brothers-in-law Jeremy Lindstrom and Christopher Lindstrom; his faithful K-9 partner Brik; and many other relatives and friends. Jake went above and beyond for his children, and it was well known that the happiest day of his life was when he became a father. He was often seen giving his sons rides around the yard on the lawnmower for fun, and he will be remembered by his loving spirit.  Jake set an example for others and will be remembered for his love for his family, his faith in God, and his bravery.

1227,topic-id,819,"Mr.President, I want to thank Chairman Crapo and my good friend from Kansas, whose statement is so similar to mine in many ways.  In rural Indiana--you talked about relationship banking. That is, in many ways, the heartbeat of a community. Our small businesses, our farms that are handed down from generation to generation--you find the grandsons of our farmers dealing with the grandsons of the person who developed the bank. It is a privilege to be part of this.  I thank the chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Crapo, for leading this debate and for his good-faith efforts to make this a bipartisan process.  As we debate the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, the Senate is on the verge of doing something significant. We are breaking through the gridlock on a bipartisan legislative package to reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens on Main Street banks and credit unions, while also expanding protections for consumers, servicemembers, and veterans.  This is an example of what we can achieve when we work together. I am proud to have worked closely with my friend the chairman, Senator Crapo, among others, to craft this bipartisan legislation that, as my friend Senator Tester mentioned--13 Republicans, 12 Democrats, 1  I have worked on this issue since I came to the Senate in 2013. This bill is[[Page S1359]]the result of dozens of meetings, Banking Committee hearings, and a 7\1/2\-hour committee markup, where more than 100 amendments from both sides were filed, and 36 were considered and voted on. This bill is carefully written and narrowly tailored.  This commonsense legislation is intended to help Main Street community banks and local credit unions to focus more on traditional banking--our small businesses, our farms, our families--while maintaining the safety and soundness of our financial system.  In rural areas and in many towns across my beloved home State of Indiana, Main Street community banks and credit unions are the institutions that Hoosiers turn to--whether it is a family seeking a mortgage for their first home to make their dreams come true or an entrepreneur with a dream who is looking to start a small business, create more jobs, and make his or her community grow.  Unfortunately, the 103 community banks and 154 credit unions in Indiana have been unintentionally burdened by rules and regulations that were intended to hold Wall Street accountable, to make sure they would never damage our economy again. Since 2008, the number of small business loans is down 41 percent nationally. That is according to our Federal banking regulators.  This package includes a number of important new consumer protections as well, including for servicemembers, as I mentioned, for veterans, seniors, and tenants.  One provision is based on my bipartisan Protecting Veterans Credit It ensures that veterans are not wrongly penalized when the Department of Veterans Affairs is late in paying a vet's medical bills.  In response to Equifax's massive data breach and other data breaches, for the first time, every American--let me repeat that--every American would be able to freeze and unfreeze their credit free of charge and set year-long fraud alerts.  This bill also provides free credit monitoring for all Active-Duty servicemembers.  This makes a big difference. It helps folks like Cpl Logan Hartz, a Hoosier, who serves proudly in the U.Marine He was training at Camp Lejeune when he learned his personal information may have been compromised by He said it was really stressful to try to figure out what to do and challenging to get his credit frozen. Corporal Hartz says the free credit monitoring in this bill would provide peace of mind to servicemembers like him whose first focus is on protecting our country.  I also want to highlight another provision I authored on manufactured housing, which serves as a vital source of affordable housing not only in Indiana but across our country, particularly in rural and underserved communities. This effort provides a narrow exemption to allow consumers to receive general financing information from a manufacturer, while creating new disclosures to prevent conflicts of interest and prohibiting retailers from directly advising consumers on financial transactions.  This legislation has broad bipartisan support, it maintains strong financial oversight, and it adds new consumer protections. It is reasonable, it is balanced, and it is the result of very thoughtful negotiation and hard work. I am very hopeful it will pass the Senate soon.  Again, I thank our chairman, Senator Crapo, for his bipartisan work, for his willingness to be flexible, to stay with it when it looked so difficult to get done. As a result, there are families who are going to be in homes for the first time from loans they were able to get from a banker who knew them in town, who, when every computer program showed something different, they knew the family was worth investing in. That is what this bill is going to do.  I very much thank the chairman.  ",CREC-2018-03-06-pt1-PgS1350-2.txt,1850,NOTICE OF INTENT TO OBJECT TO PROCEEDING,2018.0,6.0,March

1452,topic-id,1814,"Mr.President, today I wish to pay tribute to the remarkable life of Charles Pence Slichter, a University of Illinois professor emeritus of physics and of chemistry, who died on Monday, February 19, 2018, in Boulder, CO, at the age of 94.  Slichter was a pioneer in the development and application of nuclear magnetic resonance, NMR, spectroscopy to elucidate the structure and behavior of matter at the atomic scale and a renowned expert on superconductivity. Slichter's seminal contributions to the fields of condensed matter physics and chemistry have been recognized with numerous awards, including the 2007 National Medal of  Slichter is revered at the University of Illinois, where he served on the faculty for 57 years, for his fostering of the ``Urbana style,'' a way of tackling longstanding scientific problems by a combination of theory and experiment that emphasizes close interdisciplinary collaboration and mutual respect. Known by everyone for his brilliant smiles, infectious enthusiasm, and trademark bowties, Slichter exemplified science at its finest: creative, rigorous, curious, and scrupulously honest. His inspired teaching trained generations of American physicists and chemists and, through them, enabled a host of modern technologies.  NMR studies atomic nuclei by probing them with radio waves and measuring their response. The nuclei respond only when the radio waves are tuned to specific resonance frequencies, which depend on both the properties of the nuclei and their local magnetic field. The measured spectrum of resonance frequencies, as well as the time dynamics of the resonance response, gives information about the local environment of the nuclei. Magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, widely used in medicine, is an extension of NMR that enables 2D and 3D images to be reconstructed from NMR spectra.  Slichter pioneered many fundamental techniques in He was a codiscoverer, with H.Gutowsky and D.McCall, of indirect spin-spin coupling, known as J-coupling, in molecules. This phenomenon enables structural information about molecules to be deduced from their NMR spectrum and is a key analytical tool in modern chemistry. With T.Carver, Slichter performed the first dynamic polarization of nuclei using electron spins. Dynamic nuclear polarization can be used to increase the sensitivity of NMR dramatically, enabling the study of more complex molecules and smaller samples. Extensions of the technique are used to determine aspects of molecular structure or to provide a method of operation for the three-level maser, a microwave-frequency precursor to the laser.  Slichter and his student L.Hebel performed the first NMR studies on superconductors, materials in which electric current can flow without resistance. This was a major feat in itself because superconductors exclude the magnetic fields and radiowaves used to perform NMR spectroscopy. The results of their experiments are recognized as the first proof of the electron-pairing concept central to the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer, BCS, theory of superconductivity, which was developed concurrently, also at the University of Illinois, and was honored with the 1972 Nobel Prize in Slichter conceived of the experiment while listening to a presentation from Bardeen, and the analysis was carried out with substantial collaboration from the BCS authors, even while they raced to prepare their own theoretical work. This strong collaborative interaction between theory and experiment typified the ``Urbana style'' of research, and Slichter played an important role in setting this tone for colleagues. Another research ``first'' of Slichter's, the measurement of the Pauli spin susceptibility, came after a chance hallway meeting with colleague David Pines, who had just derived a more precise theoretical model for the effect, but lamented to Slichter that ``no one can measure it.'' Slichter, who had worked on some related problems as a graduate student, replied, ``David, I know how to measure it,'' and the experimental results were published shortly thereafter.  Other notable research achievements include discoveries on the behavior of high-temperature superconductors, fundamental studies of metal surfaces for catalysis, the introduction of phase sensitive detection to pulsed NMR, the theory of chemical exchange and its effects on NMR spectra, studies of charge density waves and the Kondo effect, and the theory of chemical shifts in fluorine.  At the University of Illinois, Slichter directed the research of 63 doctoral students and more than 15 postdoctoral researchers, including Nobel laureate Sir Peter Mansfield, coinventor with Paul Lauterbur of Slichter's textbook, Principles of Magnetic Resonance, now in its third edition, has trained students around the world for nearly 60 years. Slichter said in 2004, ``I really love doing physics; the personal connection is the way I love to do it. If I were not in a university setting, I would have to find students to work with.''  Slichter's contributions to science were not limited to the laboratory and the classroom. He served the Nation with distinction as a member of the President's Science Advisory Committee from 1965 to 1969; the President's Committee on the National Medal of Science from 1969 to 1974; the President's Committee on Science and Technology Policy in 1976; and the National Science Board from 1975 to 1984. In 1975, Slichter chaired a delegation of U.solid-state physicists selected by the National Academy of Sciences in an initiative to open scientific exchanges with the People's Republic of On this trip, he met his future wife, Anne FitzGerald, who worked for the National Academy of Sciences and acted as translator for the U.delegation.  In academia, Slichter served for 25 years from 1970 to 1995 as a fellow of the seven-member Harvard Corporation, Harvard University's highest governing body, including 10 years as senior fellow. He chaired the selection committee that chose Neil Rudenstine as the president of Harvard in 1991. Slichter was the president of the International Society of Magnetic Resonance from 1986 to 1989. His service to U.industry included membership on the board of directors of Polaroid from 1975 to 1995, and on science advisory committees to IBM from 1978 to 1993, and United Technologies from 1972 to 1982.  Among his many honors and awards are the National Medal of Science in 2007; the Comstock Prize, shared with E.Hahn, of the National Academy of Sciences in 1993; the Irving Langmuir Prize in Chemical Physics in 1969 and the Oliver Buckley Prize in Condensed Matter Physics in 1996 from the American Physical Society; the Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award, shared with H.Gutowsky and D.McCall, from the American Chemical Society in 2016; and the Triennial Prize of the International Society of Magnetic Resonance in 1986. He received honorary doctor of science degrees from the University of Waterloo in 1993 and the University of Leipzig in 2010 and an honorary doctor of laws degree from Harvard University in 1996. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1967, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1969, and the American Philosophical Society in 1971.  Sir Anthony Leggett, Nobel laureate and the John and Catherine T.[[Page S1628]]MacArthur Professor and Center for Advanced Study Professor of Physics at the University of Illinois, described Slichter as ``a towering figure in condensed matter physics, on both the national and international stage. He was a warm and supportive figure in the Urbana physics department right up to his last years.''  University of Illinois emeritus professor Gordon Baym said, ``Charlie was a remarkable colleague, one of the last of the great physicists of the postwar generation. He was always intellectually curious and remarkably wise. At the same time he was a great human being, amazingly encouraging and supportive of his colleagues, students, and friends, whether young or old. Just seeing his warm smile would brighten everyone's day.''  Head of the University of Illinois Department of Physics and professor Dale Van Harlingen said, ``Charlie Slichter was a legend, a role model, and a friend to everyone who ever had the opportunity to meet him. His passion for good science, his contagious kindness, and his remarkable energy has inspired me throughout my career, and I think everyone else at the University of Illinois and beyond. In many ways, Charlie has best defined the Urbana style that characterizes the culture and spirit of the Department of Physics at Illinois through his stellar contributions in NMR that have significantly impacted our understanding of condensed matter physics, especially superconductivity, and the chemistry of materials, his excellence in teaching and mentoring of students, and his unparalleled warmth and friendliness. He is truly one the great scholars and gentlemen of our generation. Charlie has made a lasting impression on all of us--he will be missed but never forgotten.''  Slichter was born on January 21, 1924, in Ithaca, NY, to Sumner Huber Slichter, a labor economist who became the first Lamont University Professor at Harvard University, and Ada--nee Pence--Slichter was named after his paternal grandfather, Charles Sumner Slichter, a noted professor of applied mathematics and dean of the graduate school at the University of His maternal grandfather, William David Pence, was a professor of railway engineering at the University of From a young age, Slichter was interested in science and mathematics. It was his senior-year physics course at the Browne & Nichols School in Cambridge, MA, that made it clear, without a doubt, that he wanted to be a physicist.  Slichter studied physics at Harvard University, receiving his A.in 1946; M.in 1947; and Ph.in 1949 degrees there. During World War II, while an undergraduate at Harvard, he worked as a research assistant at the Underwater Explosives Research Laboratory at Woods Hole, MA, where he constructed oscilloscopes, an experience that prepared him for his doctoral research with Edward Purcell, who led the group at Harvard that codiscovered nuclear magnetic resonance. Slichter was his third graduate student, beginning research with Purcell shortly after that discovery.  Slichter came to the University of Illinois in 1949 as an instructor, recruited by then-department head Wheeler Loomis as an integral part of an effort to build a world-class faculty in the emerging field of solid-state physics. Slichter was appointed assistant professor 2 years later and quickly rose through the ranks to full professor in 1955. At Illinois, he held additional professorial appointments at the Center for Advanced Study from 1968 to 1997 and the Department of Chemistry from 1986 to 1997. After his retirement in 1996, Slichter maintained an active research program at Illinois, holding an appointment as research professor of physics and continuing to advise graduate students from 1997 to 2006.  Slichter is survived by his wife, Anne FitzGerald Slichter, of Champaign, IL; by his children William Almy Slichter of Minneapolis, MN; Jacob Huber Slichter of Brooklyn, NY; Ann Thayer Slichter of Los Angeles, CA; Daniel Huber Slichter of Boulder, CO; and David Pence Slichter of Binghamton, NY; and by his grandchildren, Sarah Thayer Slichter of Kingston, NY; Thayer Ellery Slichter and Lila Mackinnon Slichter of Minneapolis, MN; and Trevor Hagar Slichter and Isabela Hagar Slichter of Boulder, He was preceded in death by his son Sumner Pence Slichter, policy director for U.Senator Russ He is also survived by his first wife, Gertrude Thayer Almy of Mitchellville, MD, who is the mother of Sumner, William, Jacob, and                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-12-pt1-PgS1627.txt,2123,50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RBC HERITAGE PRESENTED BY BOEING GOLF,2018.0,12.0,March

134,topic-id,1580,"Mr.President, it has been nearly 4 years since the collapse of Corinthian Colleges and almost 2 years since the collapse of ITT Tech, two of the largest college collapses in U.history.  These infamous companies left tens of thousands of students in the lurch, interrupting their education and leaving them with worthless credits and tons of debt.  Rather than being anomalies, these companies embodied the for-profit college industry, an industry that enrolls only 9 percent of all postsecondary students but accounts for 33 percent of all Federal student loan defaults. The same predatory practices that took down Corinthian and ITT Tech are commonplace throughout the for-profit college industry, even today.  So this notion that some would have you believe--that, with Corinthian and ITT Tech gone, this industry is magically cleaned up and purged of bad actors--is nothing more than an attempt by the industry to justify rolling back important consumer protections like the Gainful Employment and Borrower Defense rules.  Case in point: Ashford University is owned by Bridgepoint This is a company that, from its very inception, has shown a determination to work the system in order to profit.  It all began in 2005, when a group of investors bought a tiny Catholic college in Iowa, which at the time had an enrollment of 312 students, but what came along with that small campus was the gold for Ashford: regional accreditation. That accreditation opened the company's coffers to millions in Federal student aid funds.  Since that time, Ashford has closed the Iowa campus and become an online giant, enrolling more than 40,000 students across the country and taking in almost $390 million in Federal title IV funds.  Boy, have Ashford executives and owners gotten rich. From 2014 to 2016, Bridgepoint's CEO, Andrew Clark, made more than $10 million in total compensation.  Meanwhile, its students have been left buried in debt with worthless diplomas that employers often don't recognize. According to a recent Brookings study, as of 2014, Ashford student cumulatively owed almost $6 billion in Federal student loan debt, making it one of eight for-profit schools in the top 10 schools whose students owe the most cumulative debt. Of the Ashford students who left in 2009, nearly half had defaulted on their debt 5 years later.  Just like Corinthian and ITT Tech, Ashford has been the subject of numerous Federal and State investigations and lawsuits.  Ashford is currently being investigated by State attorneys general in Iowa, Massachusetts, New York, and North Carolina, as well as the U.Securities and Exchange Commission and U.Department of The California Attorney General is currently suing Ashford for ``defrauding and deceiving students.''  In addition, in 2014, Ashford was forced to pay $7.25 million in a settlement with the Iowa Attorney General for consumer fraud. Once again, Ashford used false and misleading statements, as well as unfair and high-pressure sales tactics to lure students into enrolling and taking on debt.  Just last year, Ashford agreed to pay $30 million to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for deceptive acts and practices, including misleading students about their student loan payments.  Also like Corinthian and ITT Tech, Ashford uses mandatory predispute arbitration clauses to hide its misconduct and prevent students from holding them accountable in court.  These clauses, often buried in stacks of enrollment documents that students must sign in order to take classes, force students to give up their right to sue the school of misconduct either as individuals or part of a class. The practice is almost unheard of at public and legitimate not-for-profit institutions, but is a hallmark of the for-profit college industry.  Not only does the practice steer disputes into arbitration proceeding where the deck is often stacked against the student, nondisclosure agreements often prevent the alleged misconduct or the outcome of the arbitration proceeding from becoming public. This hides misconduct from regulators and accreditors, often allowing for-profit colleges like Ashford to continue illegal practices for years without detection.  In addition to receiving millions of dollars in Department of Education title IV funds, Ashford also heavily recruits veterans and servicemembers who qualify for Department of Veterans Affairs G.bill funds.  You see, for-profit colleges see veterans and servicemembers as gold.  Federal law prohibits for-profit colleges from receiving more than 90 percent of their revenue from Federal sources, but rather than counting all taxpayer-funded education assistance programs, including VA G.bill and Department of Defense tuition assistance, current law only counts title IV funds as Federal revenue.  This means that by aggressively targeting and recruiting veterans and servicemembers, for-profit colleges like Ashford can receive an unlimited amount of their revenue straight from the Federal  Marine veteran James Long found himself on the receiving end of that aggressive recruiting. A few years ago, Bloomberg told his story:       His Humvee was struck by artillery shells in He      suffered a severe brain injury. While recovering at Camp      Lejeune, he was visited by an Ashford recruiter who signed      him up for classes. But despite knowing he was enrolled, his      brain injury was so severe that he couldn't remember what      courses he was enrolled in.  The California Attorney General's complaint against Ashford includes the stories of two other veterans.  First, an Army Reserve veteran referred to as P.was encouraged by Ashford representatives to attend courses at a local community college while taking classes at  P.was told that, by attending a ground-based campus rather than just Ashford's online classes, he would qualify for a higher monthly housing allowance under the G.bill, and he could transfer his community college credits toward his Ashford program. He was later ``alarmed'' to find that Ashford limited the number of credits he could transfer and refused to recognize some of the courses he had previously completed.  As a result, P.had to take additional courses at Ashford, receiving the lower housing allowance rate, to make up for the lost credits. He then ``fell behind on his rent, had to take on another job to keep up with his bills, and his credit score suffered.'' In addition, he wasted part of his limited G.bill education benefits on courses that he could not put toward a degree.  Another veteran, ``P.J.,'' was told that Ashford would accept most of the 140 credits he had earned at other institutions and could expect to graduate within 18 months. He was also assured that he would be able to transfer his Ashford credits to a community college.[[Page S1936]]  After he had already enrolled and began taking classes at Ashford, P.discovered that Ashford had accepted none of his credits from other schools despite their promises. When he later tried to transfer his Ashford credits to two other schools, he found that neither would accept them.  This is how Ashford treats veterans.  In recent years, Ashford has taken in as much as $38 million in G.bill funds and is currently engaged in a fight to maintain eligibility to receive these funds in the future.  Here is what it boils down to: Ashford is not approved for G.bill benefits by the California State Approving Agency, a requirement for it to be eligible for G.bill funds nationwide. The company has spent months on dubious legal action and other schemes to skirt Federal G.bill eligibility requirements. The matter is now in court.  With its G.bill eligibility in doubt, Ashford announced in November it would voluntarily suspend new enrollments of veterans using G.bill funds. This would prevent new veterans from being put at risk and additional taxpayer dollars being wasted should the company lose eligibility.  As reported by The Chronicle of Higher Education, the company resumed new G.bill enrollments in February and acknowledged on a call with investors that the suspension had ``negatively impacted fourth-quarter performance.'' That is right; the company made the blatant decision that profits are more important than veterans.  Last week, Senator Hassan and I sent a letter to Bridgepoint's CEO, Andrew Clark, expressing our outrage and calling on him to immediately halt new enrollments until their G.bill eligibility is resolved with the If the company fails to do so, it will lay bare the true disregard they have for the students, especially veterans, they claim to serve.  Also last week, Bridgepoint announced that it is up to even more shenanigans. It will attempt to separate from Ashford and another school it owns to become an Online Program Management company while Ashford seeks to become a not-for-profit college. If approved, this complicated maneuver would mean that Ashford would no longer have to abide by the Federal 90-10 rule or other accountability measures focused on for-profit colleges.  At the same time, other for-profit conversions have been structured in a way that their owners are still able to personally profit from the new not-for-profit entity. It is the best of both worlds for owners and investors; the school is able to shed Federal accountability requirements while still profiting off of students and taxpayers.  I call on the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Education, and Ashford's accreditor--the WASC Senior College and University Commission--to carefully scrutinize this proposal in light of other dubious for-profit conversions and Bridgepoint's own long record of misconduct.  Despite the closure of Corinthian and ITT Tech, companies like Ashford continue to exploit students and veterans while raking in billions in Federal taxpayer dollars, using every possible scheme they can think of to do it.  Until Secretary DeVos stops siding with her friends in the for-profit college industry or Congress acts, students will continue to be harmed and taxpayer dollars will continue to line the pockets of cheats and crooks.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-22-pt1-PgS1935.txt,326,ISSUES OF THE DAY,2018.0,22.0,March

200,topic-id,2033,"Madam President, I use the term loosely, but last Saturday, the 17th of March, was one of the high holy days in Chicago--Patrick's They color the Chicago River green. Everybody wears green. There are great parades, great celebrations. I look forward to it each year--going back to my parish, Old Pat's, for mass and celebration and having a wonderful day of a lot of good feelings.  During the course of the Patrick's Day Parade, I walked along with various groups who were going to march and came upon the Chicago Police Department's bagpipe and drum band. I noticed that the banner they were carrying for the day was in honor of a wonderful man by the name of Commander Paul  Paul Bauer, a commander of the Chicago police force, was downtown in the Loop of Chicago on February 13. He was attending an important meeting, and he heard over his radio that a fugitive was trying to escape. He dropped what he was doing, joined in, and participated in trying to catch this fugitive. He was cornered in the stairwell by this man and shot dead. The man who shot him got off six rounds and killed this wonderful man who had served not only the city of Chicago but our Nation in his role with law enforcement. He left behind a young wife and beautiful teenage daughter. He was from the Bridgeport community of Chicago, and when his funeral was held, massive crowds showed up, people paying tribute to Paul  The reason I raise that is because they traced the gun that was used to kill this brave policeman. It was a gun that was originally sold legally through a federally licensed dealer in Madison, WI, and then the person who purchased it sold it, without a background check, to a member of his gun club. We don't know whether that person was disqualified, under the law, from owning a handgun, but we do know that the next purchase was the purchase that made a difference. That person decided to sell the gun on the internet, with no background check, and ended up selling it to a convicted felon--a person disqualified, under the laws of this country, from owning a gun. That is when that handgun got into the world of crime. It was used in the commission of a crime months before the shooting of Commander Bauer, and it was used to kill him on that day, February 13.  The reason I raise that is we know what we need to do. We need universal background checks--no ifs, ands, or buts about it. Whether selling to a person at a gun show or over the internet, there ought to be a background check. There is no excuse for selling a gun legally in the United States to someone who is prohibited by our laws from owning it--none. That is what happened. That is why that wonderful man, that brave policeman, lost his life.  The reason I raise that is we have a bill before us now. It is an Omnibus appropriations bill, and it includes some provisions about gun safety. They are good. I don't argue with them. One is called Fix NICS--try to make sure more information is put into the background check system. There is another one related to school violence, which provides grants to schools to make them safer and such. I have no objection whatsoever. But we are not getting to the heart of the issue.  This is the heart of the issue: We have a Second Amendment that gives rights to Americans to legally own guns and use them responsibly, and the Supreme Court has made clear that we can draw clear lines as to what is permissible in that gun ownership and gun usage. We can draw lines that say: Yes, if you have been convicted of a felony, you cannot own a gun. You cannot assert a Second Amendment right. You have disqualified yourself. We can say: If you are mentally unstable, you can't legally own a gun in You can't assert Second Amendment rights in that circumstance. We can put provisions in the law relating to the type of gun that you own, how old you have to be to buy that gun, what kind of background check takes place. But none of that--none of that--is included in this omnibus bill.  My fear is that many Members of Congress will say: Well, we got a lot of contacts after the Parkland, FL, situation, and met with a lot of people. Now we have taken care of our constitutional obligation with the provisions in this omnibus bill.  It will be a sad day if that is the case because what we have done in this omnibus bill would not have stopped that killer from taking the life of Commander Paul Bauer--not at all. So as far as I am concerned, we have fallen far short from where we need to be when it comes to gun safety.  Something is about to happen this Saturday, a week after our Patrick's Day There are going to be marches and parades across the United States on March 24. Tens of thousands of students and their supporters are going to march right here in Washington, in Chicago, where I will join them, and in cities and towns all across America, including Springfield, They will march to urge lawmakers--like me--to finally pass meaningful gun reforms that help keep our children safe and our communities safe.  There are things that happen in our personal lives that we bring to our professional lives, and I will share one of them with you.  After the terrible shooting that occurred in Florida, my daughter, who lives in Brooklyn, NY, was talking to her daughter, my little granddaughter, a first grader. Her daughter, that first grader, said: Mom, the teacher told us that if there is a shooter in our school, stay away from the windows and get down on the floor.  In first grade, they are being warned about shooters coming into their classroom. Who would have dreamed that[[Page S1890]]America would reach this point? It has. Who would possibly argue that the Second Amendment envisioned that possibility, that we would arm teachers so we could have some sort of a shootout in a first grade classroom anywhere in this country?  The marches that will take place on Saturday are a sign that perhaps America has reached a tipping point on gun safety. The fact that a majority of gun owners have stepped up and said that we should have universal background checks is an indication that we are reaching that point. The younger generation is standing up, speaking out, and, frankly, confronting us--those of us who are in positions of power, elected office--confronting us to do something and stop talking about it.  These young people are tired of living in fear, as are many students across this country. They are fed up with the status quo, in which hundreds of Americans are getting shot every day while politicians sit on their hands in fear of the gun lobby and the National Rifle  I don't care what my scorecard is with the National Rifle I know, incidentally, it is a failing grade, which I wear with pride. I don't care about my scorecard there. I care about my scorecard with the people I represent in Illinois, and I particularly care about the students and the parents who are worried about whether the school for their kids will be the next site of gun violence.  These young people who are going to march on Saturday are fed up with lawmakers who ignore the overwhelming majority of Americans who want to close loopholes in the background check system. Through their powerful advocacy and eloquence, these juniors and seniors in high school are already bringing about change.  Listen to what businesses across the country are doing. They are distancing themselves from the National Rifle It is no longer considered just another political organization. They are voluntarily changing their business practices so they don't give a break to a gun lobby that will not give a break to honest Americans who want to be safe in their homes and schools. The students from Parkland, FL, have helped these businesses recognize that they need to be part of this effort.  We are seeing new gun safety reforms passed in State legislatures--not so much here in Washington but in States like Florida that have a long tradition of voting the other way on gun issues.  Unfortunately, the Republicans, who control the House, the Senate, and the White House, still haven't gotten the message. What we have included in this omnibus bill is weak soup; 17 lives in Parkland, FL, are worth more than what we are putting in this bill. Even after Parkland, after all of the lives that have been lost to violence, even as the school shootings continue, including a shooting in a Maryland high school this week, President Trump and the Republican majority of Congress are still unwilling to push for universal background checks and an end to high-capacity magazines and assault weapons.  There were modest measures included in this bill. Is that all we get? Is that it? Is that the end of the national debate on gun safety for another 5, 6, or 8 years?  There is important language that I included in the defense portion of the bill, directing the Department of Defense to not only submit all its relevant records for NICS background checks but also to flag and prevalidate the records that would prohibit a person from buying a gun. It is a step in the right direction. It is necessary, but it is not sufficient to really make a difference when it comes to gun safety.  The prevalidation and flagging are important for the FBI to help us and will help them quickly confirm whether a person should be blocked from a gun sale. But let's be honest; this omnibus bill that we are considering today and tomorrow doesn't address the fundamental challenges our Nation faces when it comes to gun violence. It takes a pass.  It is time for Congress to start considering legislation on gun violence that the gun lobby might not like. We can't let the National Rifle Association have veto power over gun policy in this Politicians need to recognize the obvious. The gun lobby is increasingly angry, sometimes paranoid, often isolated in its political positions. It no longer speaks for the majority of people who own guns responsibly in  Remember, the gun lobby cares about one thing more than anything: selling firearms. It is all about the business side of the ledger--the bottom-line profit margin.  Violence prevention is not the focus of the gun lobby's agenda. In fact, the gun lobby usually opposes violence prevention legislation just in case it might hurt gun sales. It has reached the point where the NRA endorsement of gun reform proposal is typically a sign that the proposal is not meaningful.  We can't settle for the status quo anymore. We are facing a public health crisis of gun violence, and half-hearted measures are not enough. We need to fight for meaningful gun safety reforms. We need to call up measures like universal background checks and ending high-capacity magazines.  Tell me why a person who owns a firearm, whether it is handgun or a semiautomatic weapon, needs to have a high-capacity magazine so that they can fire 30 or 60 rounds at a time. Tell me why. You might need that if you are in the military. You might need it when it comes to police work and keeping our communities safe. There could be circumstances where they are needed, but why would an individual citizen need the capacity to fire 30 or 60 rounds at one time? Those are the clips that are being used, incidentally, by these shooters. Those are the clips that are being used for mass killing in Those clips do one thing: They take human lives.

300,topic-id,720,"Mr.President, millions of men, women, and children across the world are victims of human trafficking. But it is not a problem that stops at our shores.  Eight years ago, I held a hearing in the Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law entitled, ``In Our Own Backyard: Child Prostitution and Sex Trafficking in the United States'' to raise awareness about this problem.  Sadly, not much has changed since then. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children receives about 9,000 to 10,000 reports of suspected child sex trafficking each year. It estimates that more than 80 percent of the trafficking incidents have occurred online. The worst offender is the website Backpage.com, which the National Association of Attorneys General has called a ``hub'' of human trafficking.  The U.Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations spent 2 years looking into sex trafficking and its facilitation online. After a thorough inquiry, the subcommittee found that more than 93 percent of Backpage's ad revenue in 2011 came from its so-called ``adult'' section, with projected revenue reaching nearly $250 million by 2019. However, ``adult section'' is really a misnomer--many of Backpage's ads were designed to sell children for sex.  One of those children was Desiree Robinson of When she was 16, Desiree ran away from home. A pimp soon found her and sold her repeatedly on On Christmas Eve, Desiree was taken to a garage to meet a john. Hours later, she was found dead in that garage. She had been raped and beaten, and her throat had been slashed.  Last year, Desiree's mother, Yvonne Ambrose, testified before the Senate Commerce Committee about her daughter's tragic murder. She described how her daughter was, quote, ``preyed on and sold online by pimps who took advantage of her.'' She went on to say:       On . . . December 24th, 2016, Desiree, my baby, was      brutally murdered and now my life is changed forever. . . .      If there were stricter rules in place for posting on these      websites, then my child would still be alive with me today.       The truth is [that] Backpage.com and other sites are making      millions of dollars by exploiting our children and allowing      them to be taken advantage of by predators. If we don't speak      up now, these websites will continue to profit off      trafficking our babies. It could be your child, your niece,      your nephew, your cousins, your friend's children next if you      don't stop this.  Yvonne went on to urge the Senate to pass the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, or  SESTA is a narrowly crafted bill that would ensure that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act does not provide legal immunity to websites like Backpage that knowingly facilitate sex trafficking. For years, Backpage and others have successfully exploited this loophole and avoided legal liability, despite hosting advertisements for the sale of sex acts with young victims of trafficking. Their ability to hide behind this reprehensible defense will come to an end with the passage of this bill.  SESTA was incorporated into House companion legislation called the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, or The House overwhelmingly passed this bipartisan, compromise legislation last month, in a 388 to 25 vote.  The combined legislation will ensure that victims and survivors of sex trafficking can seek justice against websites that knowingly facilitated the crimes against them. It would also enable state law enforcement officials--not just the Federal Department of Justice--to take action against individuals or businesses that violate federal sex trafficking laws.  The bill has been endorsed by major anti-trafficking groups, law enforcement organizations, and numerous technology companies.  We need to protect victims of trafficking, and we need to hold websites like Backpage accountable for their exploitative, criminal actions. As we prepare to vote on this bill, consider Yvonne Ambrose's plea:       I would not wish this pain and hurt on my worst enemy. And      I pray that Desiree's life can make a difference, so no one      else has to ever endure this pain again. I'm asking you, the      U.Senate, to amend Section 230 and be the change you want      to see in this world--not only for justice for Desiree, but      for all of the countless Jane Does out here and the other      little girls to come who don't have a voice.  I urge my colleagues to support this critical legislation.  ",CREC-2018-03-21-pt1-PgS1849-8.txt,326,PROVIDING FOR A CORRECTION IN THE ENROLLMENT OF H.R. 1625,2018.0,21.0,March
404,topic-id,491,"Mr.President, last week Congresswoman Louise Slaughter of New York passed away after representing the Rochester area of that State for more than three decades. She was tough, unfailingly gracious, and wonderfully effective in helping people throughout her life.  Louise carried titles you don't see often around here. She was the Congress's only microbiologist. She was also a blues and jazz singer as well. She was a fighter, first and foremost, earning the respect of her colleagues and even those who disagreed with her. I have counted her as a friend and an ally in many causes.  She hailed from Harlan, KY, the daughter of a blacksmith in a coal[[Page S1882]]mine. Louise can trace her lineage to the legendary Daniel Boone, and you can hear it in her voice.  She went to college and graduate school at the University of Kentucky to study microbiology and public health to honor her sister who passed away due to pneumonia at a young age.  She went on to serve in both the Monroe County legislature and the New York State Assembly before joining Congress in 1986 to represent the Rochester New York area, which includes the area around the historic Seneca Falls  She was one of only 29 women in Congress when she first arrived and quickly became a champion and a trailblazer for the American worker and the American women.  Louise coauthored the landmark Violence Against Women's Act in 1994, curbing domestic violence and aiding its victims.  She also helped shepherd the Affordable Care Act through Congress as the very first woman to chair the House of Representatives Rules  Louise's storied career has included defending her constituents against Big Business and bringing national attention to pressing medical issues. She introduced the first legislation barring genetic discrimination in 1995. It finally became law in 2008.  She introduced a bill every Congress to fight drug-resistant bacteria.  In 2015, President Obama incorporated parts of Louise Slaughter's plan to identify superbugs and increased funding for new antibiotics and vaccines into the administration's initiative to encourage the responsible use of antibiotics in livestock.  Louise also introduced the first bill to ban insider training by Members of  She did all of this, and some of it controversial, and still won the respect of her colleagues.  I worked with her on many projects, from the Bicameral High-Speed and Intercity Passenger Rail Caucus, to demanding the Supreme Court adopt an ethics code.

448,topic-id,890,"Mr.President, back in 1985, I was a second-term Member of the House of Representatives and a member, I was proud to say, of the House Appropriations The Committee chairman was a man by the name of Jamie He was from the State of He was a Mississippi Yes, there used to be Mississippi  Jamie Whitten had been a witness to a great deal of American history. He was on the floor of the House as a newly minted Congressman from Mississippi on December 8, 1941, when Franklin Roosevelt delivered his ``Day of Infamy'' speech.  There I was speaking to this same man 44 years later, and I was a junior member of his Appropriations I knew that Appropriations, under the House rules, had several members who were also represented on the Budget So one day I went to Chairman Whitten from Mississippi and suggested to him that I wanted to be on the Budget Committee in the slot reserved for Appropriations members. Chairman Whitten looked down at me and he asked: Why do you want to be on the Budget Committee?  I said: I think it is good because the Budget Committee makes the spending decisions and blueprints that Appropriations and other committees follow.  He kind of sat back in his chair and Chairman Whitten said to me: Well, if you want to be on that committee, you can be on that committee, but I want you to remember one thing, the Budget Committee deals in hallucinations and the Appropriations Committee deals in facts.  I will never forget that exchange. I served on the Budget Committee and again in the Senate on the same Budget Committee, and I have come to believe that Chairman Whitten was not that wrong in his conclusion. I call that ``Whitten's Law.'' It remains one of the most important lessons I have learned about the Federal budget.  I have learned other lessons from Mississippi politicians, and one of them is a man by the name of Thad Cochran, my colleague from the State of Mississippi and one of my friends who cochairs the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee with me. I shouldn't say cochairs; I am the ranking member on that committee and he, of course, is the chairman. Thad Cochran taught me and others many important lessons about the Federal budget and about public service in general.  Thad Cochran is a man of humility and integrity, and he is a man of his word. He is a conservative Republican who values principle and cooperation over pointless confrontation. He prefers common ground to scorched Earth because he knows it is better to build on.  Senator Cochran and I have served together in the Senate for more than two decades. For much of that time, we have both been on the Senate Appropriations He has been the committee's ranking member and chairman twice. In all of those years, I can only think of a time or two when he and I disagreed so completely on an issue that we found ourselves unable to find that principled compromise. Some may call that ``old school.'' I call it leadership in a representative democracy.  As a member and two-time chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Cochran's skill as a negotiator has served Mississippi and the United States exceedingly well. He has helped keep his State and our Nation strong and safe and economically sound.  In a time that increasingly prizes the quick profits and short-term vision, Thad Cochran has helped to protect and increase America's investments in scientific, technological, and medical research. That is a proud part of the legacy he leaves.  His voice is common and quiet, but don't be fooled. When it comes to protecting the interests of his State or this Nation, he is tenacious.  That was never more apparent than in the weeks and months after Hurricane Katrina pummeled the Mississippi gulf coast and other States in 2005. Senator Cochran helped secure appropriations that enabled thousands of homeowners in Mississippi to rebuild after their insurance companies turned them down.  As the former chairman and now ranking member of the Appropriations Committee Defense Subcommittee, I worked closely with Chairman Cochran to protect critical national security priorities in my State of Illinois, and he has worked hard for his  Behind every Senator, of course, there are hard-working staff members without whom we could not do our jobs. Senator Cochran's personal staff and his committee staff are first-rate public servants. I want to thank them too. They have been part of a winning team with Senator Their hard work and loyalty on his behalf and on behalf of the Senate has served this Nation well.  I wasn't surprised the other day when I learned that Senator Cochran had been an Eagle I was surprised to learn, however, that he once failed in pursuit of a Boy Scout merit badge as a young man. He learned a lesson from that experience that he said has stayed with him all his life: Always be prepared.  Thad Cochran's adherence to that lesson, his remarkable skill as a negotiator, and his deep integrity and honesty are qualities we could all do well to emulate.  I thank Senator Thad Cochran and wish him all the best as he departs the Senate, and I thank him for his great service to Mississippi and to                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-21-pt1-PgS1881.txt,326,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2018.0,21.0,March

Earlier this month, the New York Times announced a new feature called ``Overlooked,'' celebrating the lives of people from underrepresented communities. March, being Women's History Month, the New York Times started by publishing obituaries for 15 women who never received them. The first on the list: Ida Now, Ida is not from Illinois, but her incredible life's journey brought her to Chicago near the end of the 19th century, where she lived until her death in 1931.  Born into slavery, less than a year before the Emancipation Proclamation, Ida Wells was an intrepid journalist and a trailblazing activist in the Civil Rights and woman's suffrage movements. Ida was recognized worldwide for her writings exposing the truth behind why Black men were being lynched in the Ida Wells' work forced her from her home in the South, and after traveling to New York and England, Ida settled in  Among her many accomplishments, including helping launch the National Association of Colored Women and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Ida Wells became an early pioneer in social work, fighting for justice and equality. Following her death, the Chicago Housing Authority, recognizing the need for affordable housing for African Americans in the late 1930s, began a project to provide 1,662 apartments, two and three story row houses, sitting on 47 acres of land in the Bronzeville and Oakland neighborhoods of They were named the Ida Wells She certainly left her mark in  Not far from my Chicago office, Ida Wells is among the 65 women honored in the Chicago Women's Park & The park also includes a beautifully moving monument called ``Helping Hands,'' recognizing the contributions and legacy of Jane Addams, one of the world's most influential social reformers.  In 1888, Jane Addams and her friend Ellen Starr visited a settlement house called Toynbee Hall in the slums of London, which provided a variety of services to poor industrial workers. It sparked what would become their lifelong mission helping the poor and championing the rights of all, including immigrants, women, and children. Jane Addams and Ellen Starr were determined to bring that model to the United States, which was emerging as an industrial giant and in the early years of an immigration boom.  In 1889, Jane Addams and Ellen Starr returned to Chicago and started Hull House, the first settlement house in the United Its humble beginnings started by simply inviting people from the community to hear readings from books or look at slides of paintings. They listened to those who came, and it became clear that many of the neighborhood's women were in desperate need for a place to bring their children. So they started a kindergarten and daycare for working mothers. As it expanded, Hull House helped prevent the exploitation of immigrants living on the West Side of Chicago by providing services such as housing, child, medical aid, educational, and vocational classes.  In addition to her contributions in the field of social work, Jane Addams was known as one of the leading antiwar activists in the country. During World War I, she became the chair of the Women's Peace Party and president of the Women's International League for Peace and Jane Addams' efforts to end the war earned her the 1931 Nobel Peace, becoming the first American woman to receive the honor.[[Page S1873]]  In the spirit of these remarkable women, I would like to fast forward to today and mention the work of two of my heroes who belong to the Sisters of Mercy of the Americas religious order: Sister JoAnn Persch and Sister Pat Between the two of them, they have nearly 200 years of doing God's work here on As was true in Jane Addams' day, immigrants, refugees, and individuals seeking asylum so often arrive in our country and communities with urgent needs: food, clothing, shelter. For years, they have supported immigration reform, marching at rallies, speaking at news conferences, and lobbying Illinois State senators and representatives in They have become so well known in immigration circles, they are simply known as ``the Sisters.''  In 2007, when ``the Sisters'' were told they couldn't provide pastoral counseling to immigrant detainees in jails and in the Federal Immigration Detention Center on Broadview, they said: ``We'll see about that.'' So they founded the Interfaith Committee for Detained Immigrants, or The next year, the ICDI persuaded the Illinois General Assembly to change the law and allow immigrants, refugees, and asylum-seekers in detention in my home State to receive pastoral counseling, if they choose, and they didn't stop there. ICDI has since grown to provide a broad range of services to immigrants who are detained and those who are awaiting action on their cases, from legal assistance and help learning English, to healthcare, and more. ICDI also runs two hospitality houses in the Chicago area, one for men and the other for women and children in Hyde I have seen the good work being done in Hyde Park, and let me tell you, Jane Addams would be proud.  I will close with a story about one of the many families that ICDI has helped: the Saffaf family. Four years ago, Marwan Saffaf was a banker, living with his wife and their four children in Hama, Syria, a town about 85 miles from This was 2 years into Assad's bloody assault on the Syrian people. Marwan knew that he and his family had to leave Syria after he was kidnapped and threatened by gunmen who mistook him for a government official. The family fled to the United Arab  After 2 years, Marwan received permission for most of his family to come to But for some reason, his eldest child--his only daughter--was denied permission to join her younger siblings. So Marwan and his wife made one of the hardest decisions of their lives. Marwan and the boys would come to His wife and daughter would wait in the UAE for permission to join them. With help from ICDI, Marwan and the boys found a new home, an apartment in Des Plaines, IL, and landed a new job.  Two years after Marwan and his boys arrived in Chicagoland, Marwan's wife and daughter finally received permission to come to Then came President Trump's first Executive order--banning immigrants from seven majority-Muslim nations--including Syria--from entering the United Marwan's wife and daughter's future in this country was unclear. Fortunately, the President's order was blocked, and after 2 years of living apart and in fear, the Saffaf family was finally reunited. Thank goodness for ``the Sisters'' and  We could use more strong, courageous women like Sister JoAnn Persch and Sister Pat Murphy who fearlessly follow in the footsteps of trailblazing women like Ida Wells and Jane This March, as we once again honor the women who have moved this country forward and inspired each of us, let's renew the challenge to build on their legacies and fight for the country they envisioned.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-21-pt1-PgS1872-3.txt,326,"ECONOMIC GROWTH, REGULATORY RELIEF, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT--",2018.0,21.0,March
495,topic-id,1250,"Mr.President, this crisis we face in this country involving DACA is a crisis that was created when President Trump announced the end of the program on September 5 of last year and gave us a deadline of March 5 of this year to come up with an alternative. Many of us, including the Presiding Officer, battled mightily to do that--a bipartisan effort with compromise on both sides--but we never could come up with a proposal the President accepted. As a consequence, the destiny of the DACA recipients is uncertain.  They are now temporarily protected by an injunction from two different Federal lawsuits--an injunction which could end in a matter of weeks or months. In the meantime, their status is so uncertain that it is difficult for them to make plans for their lives. That is where we are today.  DACA has been a huge success. It is a program designed to give those who were brought here as children, toddlers, and infants an opportunity to become part of America--a legal part of America--and an opportunity to one day become citizens.  DACA was an Executive order of President Obama's which President Trump has now abolished. There is no protection, other than the court injunction for those who are facing the end of  Yesterday, I convened a meeting with some of my Senate colleagues with the Secretary of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Here is what we learned: As of yesterday, more than 35,000 DACA renewal applications are pending because of these court orders. Of these pending renewal applications, 10,000 were from recipients whose DACA protection had already expired. Tens of thousands more Dreamers have DACA protection due to expire soon. Around 13,000 DACA permits could expire in March, another 5,300 in April, and nearly 14,000 more in  Understand what happens: When a person is protected by DACA and loses that protection, technically, they can be deported. In addition, they cannot legally continue to work in the United  There is some good news, though. Secretary Nielsen promised me that the Department of Homeland Security will not deport any DACA recipient with a pending DACA application, even if their DACA status has expired. I thank her for that commitment, and I intend to hold her to that commitment. Many lives are at stake.  However, for DACA recipients whose status has expired, that same Department will not authorize them to work unless and until DACA is renewed, so there can be a gap in their employment. Understand that the people we are talking about are not folks, by and large, with part-time jobs. They are teachers. They are medical professionals. Some of them are serving in our military.  What we now know about the expiration of this work permit is that tens of thousands of DACA-eligible individuals could be forced to leave their jobs while their applications for renewal are pending and before those applications are approved.  Then consider the fate of Dreamers who are eligible for DACA but never reached the necessary age to attain that status. They can no longer apply for DACA because President Trump's decision prohibits them after September 5. If a child turns 15, the youngest age at which they can apply for DACA, they are now blocked from applying because of the President's decision.  The nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute estimates that in addition to 800,000 DACA recipients, there are an additional 1 million Dreamers eligible for Because of President Trump's decision to end DACA, 1.8 million Dreamers are at risk of deportation and cannot work to support themselves and contribute to the only country they know and the country they love.  President Trump called on Congress to legalize DACA, but he has, unfortunately, refused to accept six different bipartisan offers to achieve that. One of those offers also included $25 billion for his wall. Yet he wouldn't accept it.  Let me tell my colleagues the story of one of these young people, as I have done before. I have come to the floor of the Senate more than 110 times to tell these stories. I just think when you hear the stories of an individual, it helps us understand what the real issue is.  This is a photo of Irving He is the 112th Dreamer I have talked about on the Senate floor. When he was 7 months old, Irving was brought to the United States from Mexico by his parents. He lived in California for 10 years and then moved to Texas where he currently lives. His childhood memories include Disneyland, going to the beach, and celebrating Christmas and the Fourth of July with his family.  Irving found out he was undocumented when he was 12 years old. At first he didn't believe it because he said there is nothing about him that wasn't Then, as he got older, he realized he couldn't get a driver's license, he couldn't work, he couldn't save money for college, but he didn't give up.  In high school, Irving maintained a 4.0 grade point average. He was a member of the Honor Society and the student council. He served as president of the school's chapter of the Future Business Leaders of America, played varsity basketball and tennis.  Because of his accomplishments, Irving was accepted into the University of Texas at In college, he served as director of the Hispanic Business Students Association, and under his leadership, the group adopted a street to clean. Irving organized events for underrepresented high school students and middle school students and volunteered at an orphanage every Thanksgiving.[[Page S1883]]  He graduated from the University of Texas with a bachelor's degree in business administration. Thanks to DACA--created by President Obama and then eliminated by President Trump later--Irving was able to put his degree to work. For the last 3 years, he has worked as an information technology business analyst at General He creates software systems for one of the largest automakers in the United  He wrote me a letter, and here is what he said:       I've always felt completely I've been here since      I was 7 months old. It's the only place I know and the only      place I've ever considered home. Being an American is not      something that is just given to you; it's about the work you      put in. . . . I feel that I have contributed to  I do too. It would be an American tragedy to deport someone like Irving, who has overcome so many obstacles and has so much to contribute to our country. People like Irving Calderon are the reason more than 400 business leaders signed a letter to Congress urging us to pass a bipartisan Dream The letter and these business leaders say:       Dreamers are vital to the future of our companies and our      economy. With them, we grow and create jobs. They are part of      why we will continue to have a global competitive advantage.  President Trump created this crisis, but instead of working toward a solution, he has sabotaged every effort we have tried to make on behalf of Now it is up to Republican leaders in Congress to take yes for an answer and accept any one of the six bipartisan solutions we put on the table to save these young people.

My relationship with Senator Cochran was fortuitous. There used to be two giants in the Senate--Ted Stevens and Danny Inouye--and forever and ever they were the two, a Democrat and Republican--who were in charge of the Department of Defense Appropriations bill, and we bowed to their knowledge and wisdom. Then the day came when they were both gone, and the new people stepping in were Thad Cochran and Dick  I felt totally undeserving to be given that responsibility, and certainly could never follow the act of Danny Inouye, as great as he was in serving our country, both in the military and the U.Senate, and Thad had the responsibility of following Ted Stevens as the Defense Committee chair.  While we both knew we were being held to high standards as people compared us, as they inevitably would, the thing we decided to do from the beginning was to do it together--to learn on the job and to work together. It really hearkens back to a Senate that I remember--and I am sure Senator Shelby and others remember--when we first got here, when the Appropriations Committee assignments were really bipartisan assignments, start to finish.  My work on the Defense Subcommittee with Thad Cochran was bipartisan from the start. It always was. There was mutual respect. If I ever had an issue, I could go to him. He knew the same thing was true, if there was an issue related to his concerns or the State of Mississippi, he could come to me. We never ever set out to trouble or embarrass one another publicly. We tried to always have a good, positive working relationship. The very few disagreements we had were behind closed doors and usually resolved behind closed doors.

Thad Cochran, you made it easy when you were chairman of the Defense Committee for this ranking Democrat to be an active partner of yours in doing some important things.

652,topic-id,3020,"Mr.President, we are in the process of considering an omnibus budget bill. It is over 2,000 pages long. In fairness, it includes many provisions of legislation that has been worked on by many of us for months, so it isn't a surprise package, by and large. There are elements in it that are new and that have been recently negotiated, but the underlying bill--the appropriations bills included in it--has been the subject of committee hearings and negotiations literally for months. I know that because since last year, we have been working on the Defense Department appropriations, which is included in the bill.  My reason for coming to the floor, though, is to address an issue that is not included in the omnibus bill--one that I believe should be and one that is timely and compelling--and there is no reason why it is not included. It relates to those young people who were brought to the United States by their parents when they were infants, toddlers, children, and ended up in undocumented status in this country.  Some of them--a very small number of them--may have been smuggled across the border into the United More likely, a common situation is that they came here on a visitor's visa with their parents, the visa[[Page S1916]]expired, and they stayed. That accounts for almost half of those who are currently undocumented in the United  The difference is obvious. We are talking about children who really had no voice in their parents' decision about coming to this country and who literally grew up here, many times believing they were legal in the United It wasn't until later in life, usually when they were 10 or 12 years old, that their mothers and fathers sat down and said to them: We never filed the appropriate papers. You are undocumented in It means that your life is different from the lives of all the other kids you go to school with.  These kids may be worried about making the football team or getting an A in math, but then their parents say: You also have to be worried about somebody knocking on our front door and deporting our family back to some other country.  Your life in the United States could end at any moment. Be careful. Be careful not to violate the law. Be careful to keep your head down. Whatever you do, don't tell people that you are undocumented because it could subject you and members of your family to automatic deportation.  That is what they grew up with. Through no fault of their own, they were brought to the United They are living in this country. They are standing in classrooms in our schools, pledging allegiance to that flag every single day, yet not legal, not documented in the United They are undocumented.  Sixteen or seventeen years ago, I introduced a bill called the DREAM Act, which said that those young kids deserve a chance--a chance to earn their way to legal status, earn their way to citizenship. If they become part of drug gangs or criminal enterprises, so be it--they will forfeit any right to become any part of America's future; if not, if they are prepared to finish school and prepared to either continue their education, enlist in our military, or get a good job, we will give them a chance. That is what the DREAM Act said, and for 17 years, I have been trying to make it the law of the land, and I have fallen short.  President Obama, when he was a Senator here from Illinois, was my colleague, and he was my cosponsor on the DREAM So when he became President and it was clear that we couldn't pass the DREAM Act in Congress, I asked him: As President, can you do something to help? And he did. He created the DACA  Under the DACA Program, these young people could come forward, pay about a $500 filing fee, and go through a criminal background check to make sure they were no danger to this country. If they passed it, they would be given permission under President Obama's Executive order--under the DACA order--to live in the United States for 2 years at a time and then to renew their status. During that 2 years, they couldn't be deported, and they could legally work.  It was a big decision for a lot of these young people. Remember what I said earlier--that their parents had warned them: Don't tell the government who you are. Don't tell them where you live. They could use that information against you.  But 780,000 young people came forward, trusting this government--trusting that if we invited them to be a part of the United States on a renewable, temporary basis, it would not ultimately hurt them--780,000.  What did they end up doing? Most of them went to school, but going to school as an undocumented person in America is a different challenge. You don't qualify for one penny of Federal assistance--no Pell grants, no government loans--so getting through college under those circumstances means borrowing money from some other source or working jobs to pay for your education, which many of them did.  Over the years, these DACA recipients ended up graduating from school. There are 20,000 of them teaching in schools across They are the teachers in the grade school and middle school and high school classes, and they have DACA protection. Nine hundred of them volunteered to serve in our military. Think about that for a moment. They stood up and took an oath to serve the United States in the military and to literally risk their lives for a country that does not recognize their legal status. Nine hundred of them are in that circumstance.  Many of them have done amazing things in their lives. I have come to the floor and told maybe 100, 110 stories of these They are amazing young people. They are resilient; they are talented; they are promising; they are exciting. Yet they are not legal in the eyes of the law in  So we tried. We tried to make sure there was a way to protect them when the new President came into office. President Trump had said very clearly in his campaign that immigration was a big issue. He said a lot of things. Some of them were inflammatory, but, interestingly enough, he said several times that Dreamers are different. These young people are different.  He told me personally: Senator, don't worry about it; we are going to take care of those kids. I believed him. I was hoping he would find a way to either embrace the Dream Act or extend DACA so that these young people would have their chance.  But on September 5 of last year, President Trump made an announcement with Attorney General He said: This is the end of This is the end of protection for these young people. By March 5 of this year, 2018, the program will no longer exist. He said to Congress: Do something about it. He challenged us to pass a law.  The March 5 deadline was looming. Young people were falling out of the protection of DACA status, and their lives were uncertain. Some of them had quit school. They just didn't think there was any future or hope for them. Some of them faced the prospect of losing their job when they lost DACA protection. That was the reality.  So there we sat, with that March 5 deadline looming--a deadline we knew was important because that was when all protection and all renewals would end for many, many thousands of these young people. A number of us took it up as a challenge, six of us--three Democrats and three We sat down for months to try to write a new DACA law--and then there was a breakthrough.  On January 9 of this year, President Trump called about 24 or 25 Democrats and Republicans, House and Senate Members, to actually come to a meeting at the White House in the Cabinet room. It was an interesting meeting. It was the fourth time I had ever spoken to President Trump, and he invited me to sit right next to him. It was a little surprising that a Democratic Senator would be allowed to do that, but he invited me to, and we spent an hour, with the television coverage constant, discussing this issue. The President said some things that were encouraging about what we could do to solve this problem--a problem he had created when he eliminated the DACA  He said many things during the course of that meeting. He said: ``We're going to do DACA, and then we can start immediately on . . . phase two, which would be comprehensive.'' He was referring to other immigration measures. Then he said: ``We do a phase one, which is DACA and security, and we do phase two, which is comprehensive immigration.''  The President added that as part of any immigration deal, he wanted to end the diversity visa lottery--a separate issue--and change our longstanding laws that have allowed families to stay together and eventually be reunited as He referred to this as chain migration.  When the President made that offer to solve the problem, which he had created when he eliminated DACA, several of us came back to Capitol Hill and said: We have to get this done.  We labored quickly and made some tough decisions, Democrats giving on some issues, Republicans giving on others. We came up with a bipartisan bill--just what the President had asked for.  We called him. It was 2 days later--January 11. I know; I made the call. I said: Mr.President, we have a bill. Senator Graham, a Republican of South Carolina, and I, as well as four other Senators, have come up with a bipartisan bill.  He said: Bring it to the White Don't waste any time. I want to get this done.  That was at 10 in the morning. We were scheduled and went to the White[[Page S1917]]House at noon. By the time we arrived, it was pretty clear that something dramatic had happened in the meantime, because someone in the White House had invited five other Members of Congress from the Republican Party, all of whom opposed our effort. The meeting was pretty well stacked against us. I will not get into the detail of the meeting. It has been widely reported. But at the end of it, President Trump rejected a bipartisan approach to solving this problem.  It wasn't the only time he rejected a bipartisan approach. Senator Schumer and Leader Pelosi had offered him a similar approach before, saying: We can work together. It appeared they had an agreement, but it evaporated in a matter of hours.  We know, as well, that there were offers made of bipartisan approaches. Senator McCain and Senator Coons offered a bill on the floor of the It was a good bill--not exactly what I wanted by any means, but at least it solved the problem. It was vehemently rejected by the Trump administration.  All in all, there were six different bipartisan proposals offered to President Trump to solve the problem he had created by eliminating He rejected every single one of them.  He sent to the floor of the Senate a bill offered by Senator Grassley of Senator Grassley's bill embodied the President's approach to this. Now, understand the Senate's scorecard here. There are 51 Republican Senators and 49 Democratic So when the President called his own bill, one of our Senators, Senator McCain, was away ill, but there were 50 Republican Senators and 49 Democrats who voted on that day.  How many votes did the President's immigration proposal get? Thirty-nine. The President got 39 votes. It was kind of a shock that the President's own party didn't support the President's bill--at least not all of them.  When we offered the one I supported, the plan offered by Senator Rounds and Senator King, it ended up with 54 votes. Eight Republicans joined to have a bipartisan measure. But it wasn't enough; 54 votes will not do it. On an issue like this, it takes 60. So we have nothing--nothing. What that means is, in the eyes of the law, for the time being, these DACA-protected young people have no legal protection--save one other element.  While we were debating, the courts were also involved. Two different Federal courts issued an order to the Trump administration and said: Don't do another thing; don't deport these kids. In fact, allow them to renew their DACA status.  Former Senator Sessions, now the Attorney General, filed an emergency effort before the U.Supreme Court to stop that decision, and the U.Supreme Court rejected it. So now, today, there at least has been a postponement of deporting the young DACA kids. We don't know if that postponement will last a week, a month, a year. There is no telling. It is a pending court case. That is the only thing that is stopping the deportation of these 780,000 young people. That is it.  The obvious question is, Well, why did you stop? If you failed to meet the March 5 deadline, why didn't the Congress--why didn't the Senate, why didn't the House--continue the effort to try to solve this problem? Isn't that what you were elected to do, Mr.Senator?  The answer, obviously, is: Yes, we should. But we haven't.  That is why I have come to the floor today. We have this 2,000-page bill that does not solve the DACA problem. We have this 2,000-page bill that addresses every subject imaginable but doesn't address the looming deadline we face in We are one court decision away from hundreds of thousands of young people being deported.  What do the American people think of this idea of undocumented people, here but not recognized by law? I will tell you what they think. Eighty-five percent of the American people believe we ought to do what is right and fair for these young people. They support the Dreamers, and they support giving DACA protection. Eighty-five percent--60 percent of those who voted for President Trump--say that we should fix the DACA  But we have failed again. We have failed to do what the President challenged us to do, as he continues to reject every bipartisan proposal that has been brought before him--every one of them.  I am going to be making a unanimous consent request when this is over. I think I know how it will end. Any single Senator can object and stop the protection of these DACA young people, and one is prepared to do it. It is my understanding that he is going to demand that we instead pass the President's immigration plan, which received--remember--39 votes. Not even all of the Republican Senators supported it. It wasn't bipartisan in any way. There are provisions in the President's plan that are just plain wrong, and even 14 Republicans realize that and voted against it.  So here we are at this moment, with an important bill with many positive aspects in it for all of America, including my State of Yet there is one critical element still missing. We have failed to include a provision to solve the DACA problem created by President His refusal to accept any bipartisan compromise leaves us emptyhanded and these poor young people struggling to figure out what their lives will be.  Last week, I was in the Chicago for what I refer to as high holy days in Chicago--the Patrick's Day weekend, with parades and parties and breakfasts and lunches. I skipped one of the traditional breakfasts to go out to Loyola University's school of medicine. The reason I went there is called Match Day at medical schools. It is when graduates of medical schools apply for their residencies. Residency, of course, is a continuation of their education, leading up to their becoming actual practicing physicians. It is a huge day in each of their lives. They have gone through college; they have finished medical school; and now they wait for that letter that gives them a chance to finish their medical education.  I wanted to be there because six of the graduates of the Loyola University Chicago Stritch College of Medicine were protected by They are young people who are extraordinarily talented from all over the United They were given a chance to go to medical school, and here they were in a situation, waiting to see if they could become doctors. It turned out that because of our failure--because of the President's removing the DACA Program and our failure to pass a replacement, two of them have their residencies in doubt. A residency is a job. It is a big job. You don't just work 40 hours a week. It is sometimes 60 to 80 hours a week. It is a big undertaking. These young people, without DACA protection, cannot legally work in America and, therefore, found it next to impossible to find hospitals and universities that would take them and allow them to complete their medical education. That is the real-life consequence of our failure to act.  That is the real-life consequence of our failure to include in this omnibus bill--or any bill to this point--a solution to the problem created by President That is why I am going to make this unanimous consent request that will, in fact, pass the Dream Act, solve this once and for all, and create a law that protects these young people and others in similar categories--one that has been offered on a bipartisan basis in the Senate and one that I believe should be passed immediately.                   Unanimous Consent Request--1615  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of 1615 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration. I further ask consent that the bill be considered read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.

800,topic-id,1940,"Mr.President, this past Saturday was Patrick's The city of Chicago celebrated, as it has every Patrick's Day since 1962, by dyeing the Chicago River a deep emerald green.  In the Windy City and in cities and towns throughout Illinois, across America, and around much of the world, people wore green and attended Patrick's Day parades and parties.  No nation--including Ireland herself--celebrates Patrick's Day with as much enthusiasm as Americans do. Whether your ancestors came to this country from Dublin or the Dominican Republic, from Galway or Greece, on March 17, as the saying goes, everyone is  But America didn't always love the From the middle of the 19th century and well into the 20th century, it was not uncommon for employment ads in America to carry the warning: ``No Irish Need Apply.'' In 1857, Harpers Weekly asserted that ``nearly 75 percent of our criminals and paupers are Irish . . . [and] 75 percent of the crimes of violence committed among us are the work of Irishmen.''  Irish immigrants had been an integral part of America since our earliest days as a nation. Nine of the 56 men who signed the Declaration of Independence were Irish They included four men who were born in And Irish Americans fought and died in the Revolutionary War to secure America's freedom from  The Irish who came to America beginning in the mid-1840s, however, were different than the earlier arrivals from Erin's shores. These were ``the Famine Irish.'' They fled Ireland to escape one of the greatest catastrophes ever to befall that nation.  We know it today as ``the potato famine.'' In Ireland, it was called ``the Great Hunger'' or, in Gaelic, the old Irish tongue, ``An Gorta Mor.''  In 1845, a fungus, carried to Ireland from America, destroyed all of Ireland's potato crops. All across Ireland, potato fields turned black and rotted from the blight.  Ireland was not an independent nation then, as it is now. It had been occupied and ruled for hundreds of years by England, and most of the land was owned by absentee English landlords.  The native Irish were mostly tenant farmers, what Americans would call ``sharecroppers,'' allowed to farm only tiny plots of land. The calorie-rich potato became the subsistence crop for the Irish, the one crop they could grow on their small parcels of land that could feed a family.  When the potato crops failed, England refused to intervene. Some in England warned that providing emergency food relief to the starving Irish would disrupt with the workings of a free market. Others declared that famine[[Page S1934]]and death were God's way of punishing the  Starving Irish who could no longer pay their rent were driven off their land and into workhouses. Others died on the sides of roads, their mouths stained green from eating grass. Soon, typhus and cholera were claiming as many lives as starvation.  When the Great Hunger began, 3 million people lived in Three years later, 1 million people had died, and another 1 million had fled Ireland, most of them to In the period between 1845 and 1860, approximately 20,000 Irish a month were flooding into  They called America ``An t-Oilean Ur''--``The Fresh Land,'' but many of the old prejudices followed them. The Famine Irish, the first large group of non-Protestants immigrants to America, were derided as superstitious Papists incapable of adapting to America's Anglo-Saxon culture.  Irish Americans were denounced as ``simian'' or apelike.  An editorial published in the Chicago Tribune in 1855 captured the antipathy with which many native-born Americans regarded Irish immigrants. It asked, ``Who does not know that the most depraved, debased, worthless and irredeemable drunkards and sots which curse the community are Irish Catholics?''  In the 1850s, a new political party emerged. The Native American Party, better known as the ``Know Nothings,'' was virulently anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant.  Many politicians were cowed by the anger of the Know Nothings, but Abraham Lincoln was not. Lincoln employed Irish staff at his home in Springfield and, later, in the White He donated to Irish famine relief.  In a letter he wrote to a friend in 1855, he came out foursquare against Know ``How can anyone who abhors the oppression of Negroes, be in favor or degrading classes of white people?'' he asked. ``Our progress in degeneracy appears to me to be pretty rapid,'' As a nation, we began by declaring that `all men are created equal.' We now practically read it `all men are created equal, except Negroes.' When the Know-Nothings get control, it will read `all men are created equal, except Negroes, and foreigners, and Catholics.' When it comes to this,'' Lincoln continued, ``I should prefer emigrating to some country where they make no presence of loving liberty--to Russia, for instance, where despotism can be taken pure, and without the base alloy of hypocrisy.''  A decade later, Lincoln's brave refusal to embrace the bigotry of the Know Nothings helped save the Although Irish Americans were mostly Democrats, they heeded the call of America's first Republican President to save the Union when slavery threatened to destroy it.  During the Civil War, more than 150,000 of the reviled Irish rallied to the side of Lincoln and the They included some of Lincoln's best generals.  Among them was Brigadier General Thomas Francis A brilliant orator and the son of a wealthy Catholic family in Ireland, Meagher was a leader in a failed 1848 revolution in Ireland called the Young Ireland He was convicted of treason and sentenced to a life in exile in an Australian penal colony. Within 3 years, he had escaped to New York and became a prominent attorney.  Thomas Meagher's remarkable, improbable life is told in an excellent new biography, ``The Immortal Irishman,'' by National Book Award winner Timothy I recommend it highly.  When the Civil War broke out, Tom Meagher wrote to President Lincoln seeking permission to form an ethnic Irish brigade. He recruited a full company of infantrymen to be attached to the U.69th Infantry Regiment New York State  ``The Fighting 69th'' fought in some of the war's bloodies conflicts, including the first battle of Bull Run and the battles of Antietam and After seeing Meagher's men at the Battle of Fredericksburg, General Robert Lee declared, ``Never were men so brave.''  The Fighting 69th was not the only Irish brigade fighting for the  This year, Illinois is celebrating its 200th anniversary as a Among the countless chapters in our State's history in which we take pride is the story of the 23rd Regiment of the Illinois Infantry, Illinois' own ``Irish Brigade.''  The brigade's commander, James Mulligan, was born in New York and moved to Chicago as a boy. He became the first graduate of Chicago's first university, Mary's of the Later, he became a lawyer and a friend and confidant of Stephen  When the Civil War broke out, Mulligan placed an ad in the Chicago Tribune on April 20, 1861, calling for a rally that evening. Thirty-two men enlisted at the rally; 3 days later, 1,000 men had joined the regiment.  Mulligan's Irish brigade spent most of the war in They participated in Siege of Petersburg, and they were present for Lee's surrender at  James Mulligan did not live to see the Union victory. He was wounded on September 19, 1864, at the third battle on As his Irish soldiers rushed to his side, Mulligan saw that the colors of the 23rd Illinois were about to be captured, and he gave his men an order, ``Lay me down, and save the flag.''  The colors were saved; Mulligan was captured and died of his wounds in Confederate captivity.  Private Albert Cashier was an Irish immigrant who fought for 3 years with the 95th Illinois Infantry, Company At just 5' 3'', he was the smallest man in his company and, many said, the bravest.  He returned to Belvidere, IL, after the war, and in 1869, he moved to Saunemin, IL, where he made his living as a farmhand and church janitor.  In 1911, after he was hit by a car and was no longer able to work, Albert Cashier moved to the soldiers and sailors home in Quincy,  His mental state deteriorated, and he was moved to Watertown State Hospital for the It was there that hospital staff discovered his secret and told it to newspapers: Albert Cashier was born Jennie  The reactions were disastrous for Private The government charged him with defrauding the government in order to receive a pension. The case was dropped after Private Cashier's comrades from the 95th Illinois rallied to his defense.  The hospital staff forced Private Cashier to wear women's clothing. At 67 and frail, he tripped on his skirt, broke his hip, and spent the rest of his life despondent and bedridden.  He died on October 10, 1915, and was buried in the Army uniform he had kept intact all those years. His tombstone was inscribed ``Albert Cashier, G, 95 Inf.''

He tried to ban visitors from seven predominantly Muslim nations from entering the United He has cruelly placed Dreamers in legal jeopardy. He has recommended cutting legal immigration--legal immigration--to America by one-half, to its lowest levels since the 1920s.  President Trump's anti-immigrant, antirefugee proposals are an affront to America's history as a nation of immigrants, and they would deal a harsh blow to our economic future. If you doubt it, just ask yourself: Where would America's economy be today without the contributions of immigrants Sergey Brin and Elon Musk, or Steve Jobs, the son of a Syrian immigrant?  I believe that future generations of Americans will look back on today's anti-immigrant agitators with sadness[[Page S1935]]and bewilderment.

1012,topic-id,1506,"Mr.President, I wish to speak about the ongoing horrific violence in the nation of Syria, which seems to have hit yet new lows in terms of barbarity and Russian enabling. The senseless violence--in service of nothing more than enabling Syrian strongman Bashir al-Assad to maintain ironfisted rule over a country he has personally driven to ruin--demands the world's attention.  Quite simply, President Trump, who lambasted President Obama's approach to Syria, has sat by as the regime continues to use chemical weapons, relentlessly bomb civilians, ignore the unanimous U.Security Council ceasefire, and allows Iran to build its radical foothold in One missile strike is not a long term policy. President Trump's silence as Russian President Putin not only continues to meddle in our democracy but also empowers and enables the Syrian butcher is simply inexplicable and diminishes American leadership.  Let me start with the horror that has unfolded in Eastern Ghouta in the last few weeks. This area has actually been under siege by Syrian Government forces since 2013, but last week, Assad's henchmen stepped up their attacks. For over 2 weeks, Syrian forces supported by Russian warplanes have relentlessly bombarded Eastern Ghouta in a campaign that has killed over 1,000 people, wounded almost 5,000, and left 400,000 civilians trapped without food or medicine.  The siege had already led to chronic food and medicine shortages, devastating the population of Eastern Ghouta and leaving scores severely malnourished. The bombings have forced people to take shelter in their basements rather than risk death. Too frightened to venture outside to face the onslaught of mortar shells, barrel bombs, cluster bombs, and bunker-busting munitions, the civilian residents of Eastern Ghouta are being compelled to spend days without food or fresh air, suffocating in the heavily polluted air.  Despite the U.ceasefire, the number of dead climbs every day--from bombings, from ground assaults, and from hunger. Only yesterday, Assad's forces killed over 90 civilians and wounded over 300.  The number of casualties has overwhelmed rescuers and hospitals. Catastrophically, the Assad regime has chosen to re-employ one of its most heinous tactics and has bombed at least 28 hospitals and clinics. Doctors Without Borders said 15 of the 20 hospitals it supports have been destroyed or damaged, reducing access to emergency services just when they were most needed.  Doctors have run out of resources to treat patients. Doctors are being forced to make the most difficult choices and sometimes, tragically, leave critically wounded patients to die. A doctor in Eastern Ghouta said, ``We have a horrible situation here. We're being targeted with all kinds of weapons nonstop. We lack everything, water, food, medical supplies, shelter. This is a disaster. Everyone is waiting to die.''  I spoke to a deeply respected friend from Chicago the other day who knows this crisis all too well, Mohammed Sahloul, who leads the heroic Syrian American Medical He and his brave colleagues regularly travel to Syria to help provide medical treatment to victims of the war. He told me horrific accounts of the latest bombing and disappointment at the world's seeming inaction amid such heinous cruelty.  U.Secretary General Antonio Guterres called Eastern Ghouta a ``hell on Earth.'' United Nation's human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein called the onslaught in Eastern Ghouta a ``monstrous campaign of annihilation.'' He added, ``When you are prepared to kill your own people so easily, lying is easy too. Claims by the government of Syria that it is taking every measure to protect its civilian population are frankly ridiculous.''  Most troublingly, Assad's ruthless regime continues using chemical weapons to attack its own civilians despite Syria agreeing to eliminate its chemical weapons in 2013. We are in 2018 now and have seen the repeated use of chemicals to attack innocent people on the streets of  Among his various and numerous atrocities, Bashar al-Assad has made routine the use of internationally banned chemical weapons. He has deployed them against his own people nearly 200 times over 7 years. He has used them against very young children and the elderly, people who are clearly not fighters on the battlefield. He has targeted civilians repeatedly with sarin gas, a weapon notably developed by another abominable regime: the  In 2013, Russia worked with a global coalition, including the United States, to ostensibly destroy Syria's stockpile of chemical weapons, but the world watched in horror as Assad barbarically unleashed sarin gas on civilians in the town of Khan Shaykhun again in April 2017. Maybe you, too, saw the very disturbing reporting a week ago on ``60 Minutes.''  While the United States responded to that incident, Russia has allowed Assad to conduct many other chemical attacks. In fact, in Eastern Ghouta, Assad has continued to attack civilians--among them at least 21 children--with chemical weapons. Just yesterday, doctors there said that at least 29 patients were showing effects consistent with exposure to chlorine munitions.  Instead of trying to stop this savage behavior, Russia stands by its client-state. Russia continues to obfuscate and deny these horrific attacks, despite much evidence substantiating the use of chemical weapons.  In fact, Russia has seemingly condoned Assad's cruel use of chemical weapons on innocent civilians. The United Nations was investigating Assad's chemical attacks until late last year when Russia repeatedly blocked continuing the investigation. The U.investigation seemed to be getting too close to the truth for Russia's comfort, so it used its vote to prevent the facts from being laid bare.  Unfortunately, Russia's negative influence doesn't end there. For 3 days, Russia blocked a ceasefire from taking hold in Eastern For 3 days, Russia delayed much-needed food, medicine, and emergency aid to reach the distressed civilian population. For 3 days, the entirety of the U.Security Council, save Russia, agreed an immediate ceasefire was necessary.  Even though the Security Council finally agreed to a 30-day ceasefire in Syria, Assad flouted international order as his warplanes continued to carry out airstrikes targeting civilians in Eastern He also launched a massive ground assault against Eastern  Hundreds of people have been killed since the ceasefire was supposed to have begun. The Assad regime has prevented humanitarian relief from reaching those who are hurt or sick, and no civilians have been able to leave because of the constant bombardment.  The man who runs the regional command in charge of U.troops in Syria, General Joseph Votel, has said that Russia plays ``the role of both arsonist and fireman--fueling tensions and then trying to resolve them in their favor.'' Instead of reasoning with its vassal-[[Page S1576]]state and enforcing the ceasefire, Russia egregiously has prevented the ceasefire from taking hold.  Once again, Russia is abetting Assad's defiance and destruction for its own perverse purposes. At the very least, it is abdicating its role as a permanent member of the Security  What can be done about this devastating situation? Regrettably, there are no easy answers.  But a President who previously argued that ``heinous actions by the Bashar al-Assad regime are a consequence of the last administration's weakness and irresolution'' has to demonstrate some resolve. I call on President Trump to put genuine pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin to rein in Assad and end Russian obfuscation in the U.Security Council as the carnage and number of likely war crimes mount.  Any discussion with Putin must also address deeply troubling--and seemingly ignored--reports that Russian mercenaries controlled by Yevgeny Prigozhin attacked U.Special Operations Forces in Syria, with approval of the highest levels of the Prigozhin is the same Russian oligarch who was recently indicted on charges of running a troll farm targeting American voters.  Donald Trump has also called on ``all civilized nations'' to help end the ``slaughter and bloodshed in Syria.'' I have to imagine that the United States is included in his exhortation. Unhappily, he has also recommended a 30-percent cut in our already minuscule foreign assistance and diplomacy budget. The United States must do more to meet the humanitarian needs of Syrians suffering the ravages of a dreadful war.  Incredibly, at a time when a long-term diplomatic and political solution will be needed in Syria, this administration has marginalized our top diplomatic expertise at the Department of This is wildly self-defeating.  We have taken a back seat to Russia and Iran in Syria long enough. We can see every day the devastating results: more violence and the further fracturing of a country and a region that have suffered at the hands of tyrants too long.  Despite the important achievement made by our military in destroying ISIS in Syria, Syria will remain a monumental security, humanitarian, and governance challenge for the United States and its allies, including Israel, for years to come. Russia and Iran are vying for the spoils of the civil war, with civilians paying the highest price. We don't want to leave U.forces in Syria indefinitely, but doing nothing to bring a lasting peace to Syria is the worst option.  As such, President Trump, I call on your administration to come up with a real Syria strategy to bring an end to a war--and the senseless suffering--that has gone on for too long.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-08-pt1-PgS1575.txt,326,"ECONOMIC GROWTH, REGULATORY RELIEF, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT",2018.0,8.0,March
1032,topic-id,4355,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague from I listened carefully to his words about gun safety, and I agree with so much of what he said. He talked about bringing his bill to the floor. I think his bill is a good bill. His bill tries to provide more information into the NICS system. We definitely need to do that. He also said he was open to amendments on the floor. I am as well. I think there are other aspects of gun safety that we may even find common ground on as well. But I might remind him that the decision about the business on the floor of the Senate is in the hands of his side of the aisle.  It is your decision to decide, through your majority leader, what we consider on the floor of the An effort to do this by unanimous consent is certainly understandable in light of the events of the last few weeks, but if Senator McConnell were to announce that as soon as we finish this banking bill, we are going to move to the Fix NICS bill and have it open to amendment, I think he would find support from both sides of the aisle to do that. I hope he will, because things are changing in America, as they should. Gun violence and the terrible tragedies that occurred in Texas and in Florida and in so many States have really raised consciousness of this issue.  I am a grandfather and proud to be. I have two 6-year-old twins who are first graders in Brooklyn, They are the cutest kids in the world, and I am very objective about that.  About 2 weeks ago, my little granddaughter came home from the first grade and said to her mom: Mom, they told us at school that if there is a shooter outside the school, stay away from the windows, and if a shooter comes in the classroom, get on the floor.  First grade. Is there any sane person in America who thinks that should be a normal talk in the first grade classroom? Is there any person, constitutional scholar or not, who believes the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States was designed to allow this to happen? I can't imagine.  Ninety-seven percent of the American people believe in universal, comprehensive background checks to keep guns out of the hands of those who would misuse them, including convicted felons and mentally unstable people--97 percent. The overwhelming majority of gun owners feel exactly the same way. So why in God's Name have we not taken that up since the tragedy in Florida and the tragedy in Texas? There is no explanation for it other than fear--fear of the National Rifle Association and the gun lobby. That is the only explanation.  I salute the legislators in the State of Florida who this last week defied the NRA and defied the gun lobby and passed their own measure for gun safety. I don't agree with parts of it. Giving cafeteria workers in schools the right to carry arms around the school--I don't think that is a wise thing at all. I understand that there is opposition to that from teachers' organizations and even Republican leaders in But they did stand up when it came to questions about how old you have to be to buy a firearm, a long gun, and other questions that I think are just common sense.  So I would say to my friend from Texas, the majority whip, what you said is something I can support. Bring your bill to the floor, open to amendment. Let us have our day in the Senate where we actually act as legislators, where people will come to the[[Page S1535]]Galleries and not see an empty Chamber but instead will find Members of the Senate, 100 strong, Democrats and Republicans, at their desks, debating measures that make a difference in the life of That is why we are sent here.  I had a friend of mine years ago when I served in the House--he was a Congressman from Muskogee, His name was Mike He was a dear, close friend of mine. Mike lost his primary in Oklahoma because he was fearless. He used to come to the floor when we had votes, and he would see Members of his own caucus kind of wincing, afraid to vote for something they knew was right for fear of the political consequences. He used to get right in their faces. Mike would say: If you don't want to fight fires, don't be a firefighter. If you don't want to stand here and debate controversial issues and vote on them, don't run for  Mike was right. He was right then, and he is right now.  Let's bring gun safety to the floor of the Let's open it to amendments. Let's have a fulsome, bipartisan debate. We understand that nothing is going to pass without bipartisan support. We should do everything in our power to exercise the power and the right we are given as U.Senators to fix the problems facing American families. This is a problem. It is a problem when a first grader in Brooklyn, NY, has to be warned that if somebody walks into the classroom with a gun, she is supposed to get down on the floor.                                  DACA  This is the week, of course, of President Trump's deadline on DACA students--Dreamers--those young people who came to the United States as infants and toddlers and young people, grew up in this country, pledged allegiance to that flag just as we did this morning, and believed that they were part of America until, at some point in their teenage years, their parents pulled them aside and said: I have to tell you something. You are not legal here. You are undocumented here. You can be deported tomorrow, and we would be deported with you.  They continued their lives with the resilience that a lot of young people show. Some of them did amazing things, even with the knowledge that they weren't ``legal in America.'' They achieved extraordinary things in education and in serving their communities. They did it against great odds because they don't qualify for Federal assistance for higher education. If you go to college and you are one of these undocumented Dreamers, you don't get Federal student loans. You don't get Pell grants. You have to go out and work. You have to save up enough money to go to school. That is the only way. They did it, and all they have asked for in return, all they have ever asked for, is a chance to earn their way into legal status in Brought here as kids, they want a chance to prove to America that they love this country and they can make it a better country. That is all they have asked for.  For 17 years, I have come to the floor of this Senate--I know you have to be patient as a Senator, but this is getting a little crazy--for 17 years, I have come to the floor of the Senate and asked my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, will you give them a chance? Will you just give them a chance? Let them show you that they can bring something of value to this country. Let them prove to you that they are no danger to this country in any way whatsoever and, in fact--just the opposite--will make us stronger. Give them a chance.  We haven't been able to do it, and President Trump has made it worse. On September 5, he eliminated the DACA protection program. He said that as of March 5, which was Monday of this week, they will lose their protection. The only thing that protects them at this moment is court decisions, which could change in a week or a month. But if those court decisions don't come their way, those young people who have lived here their entire lives, who believe they are Americans and want to be part of America, will be subject to deportation. That is the reality.  The Senate took up this measure a few weeks ago. We gave to the President six different bipartisan solutions to this problem--Democrats and Republicans agreed on six different ways to solve it--and the President rejected every one. He rejected the bill that came before the Only 8 Republicans--only 8 out of the 51 Republicans--would stand up and vote with Democrats to solve this problem. I wish it were more. We only needed a few more.  Now we are in a position where this Senate again, like the issue of gun safety, is not taking up the issue of DACA and the It isn't as though we are too busy around here, is it, when you look at this empty Chamber and these empty desks? We could do a lot of things here if we were determined to use the power and opportunity that have been given to us by the American voters.  Mr.President, the one pending issue that is before us, I would like to discuss this morning.  Next week, it will be the 10th anniversary of the collapse of the company known as Bear As we approach that anniversary, it is remarkable to me that Congress is now debating, 10 years later, an effort to undo the financial reforms we put in place after what was tantamount to a recession or depression hit That was the worst financial crisis of our lifetime 10 years ago. Many of us never want to see it repeated.  I am supportive of meaningful regulatory relief for smaller banks, community banks, and credit unions, but I cannot support legislation that rolls back key Wall Street reforms at the request of the same banks that started the crisis.  We know what happened the last time financial regulations were eased: an economic collapse that rippled not just through the United States but around the world. That financial crisis of 10 years ago left our country spiraling into deep recession. It left almost 9 million Americans out of work and our unemployment rate above 10 percent. Families across America lost $19 trillion in household wealth, retirement, and savings. Hard-fought savings that they put aside for their kids' education and their retirement evaporated on a daily basis in the midst of that recession.  In my home State of Illinois, we weren't spared. During the height of the financial crisis, almost 800,000 people in my State experienced mortgage delinquencies and 70,000 more went through personal bankruptcy. I remember going to these meetings where gymnasiums would be filled with people trying to find some way to save their homes because the mortgages they had signed up for had blown up in their faces. This was evident in my hometown of East Louis, in the city of Chicago, in Aurora, and many other communities. Of course, the cost of this financial crisis fell, as it always does, on the shoulders of everyday families.  In the wake of those terrible losses and the sacrifices that had to be made, we in Congress said: We are not going to let this happen again. We won't let these banks take control again. We won't let greed overcome common sense when it comes to banking policy.  President Obama signed into law commonsense financial reforms and put an end to some of the worst, inexcusable practices by banks that brought our economy to its knees. These new Wall Street reforms were intended to address the dangerous problem of too big to fail so that American taxpayers would never again be on the hook for the consequences of recklessness and greed on Wall  Systemically important banks whose demise would pose serious risk to our financial system were subjected to higher capital buffers and increased leverage requirements. In other words, if the Federal Government was going to put an insurance program in place to guarantee that it would protect the savers at the bank, we were going to require the banks to do responsible things--don't put taxpayers on the hook for your stupidity and your greed.  Banks were required to report their lending data to ensure that borrowers had the ability to repay the loans they took out and to avoid abusive mortgage practices. Do you remember what happened? People would walk into a bank, and they would be lured into a mortgage they could barely afford to pay, some of them unaware of the fact that there was a balloon provision in that mortgage where the interest rate in a few years was going to dramatically increase and make their monthly[[Page S1536]]payments financially impossible for them.  Many of them said: Well, if the value of my real estate goes up dramatically, then I will just refinance the mortgage. It did not go up dramatically, it went down, and that is when people faced mortgage foreclosure.  So we said: Let's rewrite the rules. Let's not let the banks lead people into a financial obligation that is so risky and so dangerous that we never want to see it again.  The new rules and regulations provided certainty to banks and consumers. And what happened next? Our economy did very well. With this new generation of regulation on banks--it didn't stifle economic growth at all. In part due to these sensible reforms enacted in Dodd-Frank under the Obama administration, our economy now has an unemployment rate of 4.1 percent, not 10 percent. Banks are lending, and bank profits are at record peaks. They are making money hand over fist. In 2016, banks in America made their highest profits ever. This was after the regulations we enacted--the ones they have been complaining about ever since.  How about American businesses? They are thriving. Our gross domestic product grew by 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017. In fact, since the passage of this Wall Street reform, our economy has grown at twice the rate of other advanced economies, while our stock market has--until just a few weeks ago--hit record after record. You can't argue that we are regulating banks so much that it is hurting the economy when you read these numbers. Nearly all measures in the labor market have fallen below their prerecession averages. This is the result of a sensible, forceful response by Congress to illegitimate and dangerous practices by the banking industry.  We simply cannot afford to return to that thrilling time of yesteryear when banks were not carefully regulated and carefully watched so they didn't go overboard. Instead, as we approach the 10th anniversary of the worst financial crisis since 1929, we should be working to strengthen our financial system, protect families and businesses and the hard-earned money they have saved, and continue to grow our economy.  There is a room just a few steps away from this Senate Chamber on this floor of the Senate where I have been present twice at a historic moment.  The first one, with great sadness, was 9/11. I was meeting in that room as we finally tried to understand what was happening to America with the attacks on the World Trade Center, the plane crashing in Pennsylvania, and the plane crashing into the Pentagon, with black smoke billowing across the It was that room.  It was that same room where we were called together by the head of the Federal Reserve, Mr.Bernanke, and the head of the Treasury Department, Mr.There were probably 20 or 30 Members of the Senate and House in that room when they announced to us that we were within 24 hours of seeing the economy of the United States start to collapse. You never forget those moments. They told us that the banking issues that we have discussed here this morning had led us to the point where we had to step in as a government to save the banking industry in America in order to save the economy of America and perhaps the world.  Those are sobering words, and I remember them well. They inspired us. They drove us to the point where we came up with new financial reform, serious reform, so that there would never be another repeat of that terrible day. We are on the floor of the Senate now arguing about changing those standards of reform.  If we are going into this issue to debate it, there is one part of it that I want to raise. It is one of the seven amendments that have been put forward by the Democratic side of the aisle. I think it is critically important. It deals with an issue that every single Member of the Senate understands if they have spent 15 minutes back home. It is the issue of America's student loan crisis.  For many Americans today, there is no bigger drag on their families than student loan debt. More than 44 million Americans cumulatively owe more than $1.5 trillion in student loan debt. That is greater than the total amount of credit card debt in  Unlike most of us who could borrow a reasonable amount to finance our college education, this generation of college graduates starts off with an average debt of $27,000 on day one after graduation. Many have much, much more, especially if they were duped by the notorious for-profit college industry in  I hear from young people who have had to forgo home ownership, starting a family, and buying a car because of student debt. I also hear from those who have gone back to school and stay in school because they can't imagine starting to pay back their debt. They dig the hole deeper every semester.  Too often, this debt involves their parents and grandparents. It was reported a couple years ago that a grandmother--who was kind and signed on as a cosigner of her granddaughter's student loan debt--after the granddaughter defaulted, was being chased by the Federal Government, which threatened to attach her Social Security benefits so they could recoup the student loan that her granddaughter signed up for with her cosignature. That is why we are bringing an amendment to the floor, and it should be part of this debate on this bill.  If we are going to talk about reform for banks, let's talk about a reform American families really care about--student loan reform.  One of the things included in this amendment is a borrower bill of rights. Once a student graduates, their loans go into repayment with private financial institutions or, in the case of Federal student loans, servicers contracted by the Department of These servicers are supposed to help the borrowers navigate the repayment process by making sure they are on the right repayment plan, processing payments correctly, and keeping borrowers informed. Well, how are they doing? Between July 2011 and August 2017, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau handled almost 51,000 complaints related to private and Federal student loans. The majority of the complaints, both private and Federal, addressed difficulties in interacting with lenders or servicers. This is unacceptable. Lenders and servicers should be making repayment easier, not more difficult.  To improve Federal and private student loan servicing, our amendment includes the Student Loan Borrower Bill of It requires notifications and protections for borrowers when a loan is sold or transferred to another company or when the interest rate or other key terms of the loan change. It establishes a standard for applying payments so that payments are applied in a way that most benefits the borrower. It protects borrowers from unreasonable late fees. It requires servicers to provide borrowers online access to information about their loans, such as payment history and loan terms, and requires key information to be disclosed to borrowers by servicers.  The student loan borrowers' bill of rights also prevents servicers from using predispute mandatory arbitration clauses to prevent borrowers from holding them accountable in court.  While Federal student loan borrowers often face challenges, the situation is worse for borrowers who have private student loans, not government loans. There is now an estimated $165 billion in outstanding private student loans. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reported that in 2012 at least 850,000 private student loans, worth $8 billion, were in default.  Private student loans often have uncapped variable interest rates, which can spike to 20 percent and more, and hefty fees, and these loans often lack the protections that come with Federal student loans. Unfortunately, many student borrowers, and even their family members, don't understand the difference between a Federal loan and a private loan, and they end up taking out costly private loans when they are still eligible for Federal loans that are much more reasonable with lower interest rates.  Almost half of private loan borrowers in 2011 and 2012 did not max out on their more reasonable Federal loans and ended up taking out private loans that were worse. That is why I introduced the Know Before You Owe Private Education Loan Act, included in this amendment, requiring borrowers to be notified of the difference and their eligibility.  Finally, the amendment requires private student lenders to offer student[[Page S1537]]loan rehabilitation consistent with Federal student loans. It gives private student loan borrowers who default a fresh start.  My amendment also addresses the key issue of bankruptcy. Did you know that if you borrowed money to buy a second home, buy a car, or buy a boat and then lost your job and couldn't pay off those loans and went into bankruptcy court saying: I don't have any money left, and I can't pay off these loans, the court could discharge those loans for your vacation home, your car, your boat, in bankruptcy, and say: We wipe the slate clean; you filed for bankruptcy, you qualify, and the slate is wiped clean. However, if one of your loans is not for a second home, a car, or a boat but is a student loan, then, the student loan is not dischargeable from bankruptcy. Originally, this was done in the 1970s because there were some students exploiting the system--borrowing money and then declaring bankruptcy after graduation. Then, in 2005 Congress extended nondischargeability not just to Federal Government loans but to private loans, which even extended it to those loans that were given by these notorious for-profit colleges and universities.  So before 2005, private student loans were treated in bankruptcy proceedings like credit card debt and other types of private unsecured debt. They could be discharged as part of a bankruptcy plan to help a student debtor get back on his or her feet. But in 2005, when Congress passed a sweeping bankruptcy reform bill, a provision was slipped in that gave private student lenders a uniquely privileged status. Only a few types of private unsecured debt are nondischargeable in bankruptcy: child support, back taxes, alimony, criminal fines. Now private student loans are part of that list.  Since 2005, lenders have been incentivized to push expensive private student loans on students, many of whom will not be able to repay the loans. This is an enormous problem.  I cannot explain why private student loans are given special treatment in the bankruptcy code. Neither can the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, who told the Senate recently that he was ``at a loss'' to explain why we don't allow student debt to be discharged in bankruptcy. He said that the growing amount of nondischargeable student debt ``absolutely could hold back growth.''  We need to address this looming student debt crisis. My amendment would help by restoring dischargeability for private student loans in bankruptcy.  The amendment also clarifies the undue hardship exception that Congress wrote into the bankruptcy code. We said: There is one provision. If you are facing undue hardship, then, perhaps you can discharge even a student loan.  Almost never does a court find undue hardship. Congress did not define the term, and most courts have interpreted the term to have such a high bar that most students don't even try to pursue the exception because of the difficulty and expense of proving undue hardship in court.  We tried to address that. This amendment would provide clarity around undue hardship by identifying situations where there should be a rebuttable presumption that a student loan debtor has an undue hardship. We tried to address it in terms of those who clearly are facing undue hardship and need a helping hand. What are the categories of those facing bankruptcy who cannot discharge current student loans who would be able to discharge them under our amendment? It will be those who have been determined by the Veterans' Administration to have a service-connected disability. Should we give disabled veterans in America a helping hand like this? I think so. How about the family caregiver of elderly or disabled family members or veterans? How about those receiving Social Security disability whose only income is Social Security? How about those who spent years at a low income? Do you think they might be facing an undue hardship and can't pay back a student loan? I think so, and this amendment would give them the opportunity to make their case.  There are other provisions, as well, but I see colleagues on the floor who want to speak as well. I have spoken for a while. I am going to stand down in just a moment.  If we can take up the issue of making it easier for banks to do business in America, can we spare a few minutes to debate whether we can make it easier for student borrowers to survive when the student debts they face are stopping them from moving forward in their lives? These are massive debts that stop them from getting married, buying a home or a car, or starting a family? That is the reality for many families across  I hope my colleagues will join me. A lot of us give some great speeches about student loans. It would be terrific if we could allow on the floor of the Senate those speeches and a vote on that critical issue.  I yield the floor.

1244,topic-id,1475,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague from Connecticut as well as our colleague from Rhode Island for calling us together on the Senate floor today to discuss a timely and important topic.  We know that Vladimir Putin and Russia attacked America's democracy in 2016, and it is clear Vladimir Putin will try again. CIA Director Pompeo recently said he had ``every expectation'' that Russia would try to influence our 2018 election. We have been warned.  We can expect Russia to continue to use the tactics they have used before and to come up with new ones. We can expect them to hack and leak sensitive information. We can expect these Russians to use social media and propaganda to spread false information. We see it almost every week. We can expect them to try to hack into State election systems and more.  I was home over the weekend in Springfield, IL--of course, the State capital--and ran into a fellow who works for the State Board of We talked for a few minutes about the experience we had in our State in the last election cycle when the Russians hacked into the computer network of the Illinois State Board of We were the only State, of those that were hacked, to come forward and identify the culprit. It was We also came forward and notified hundreds of thousands of our voters that their identity--at least in terms of the State election agency is concerned--had been compromised by the We were open about it.  I asked the individual what was being done for the next election cycle. He said we have patched the problem that gave the Russians entry into the system in 2016, and we spent over $100,000 as a State to put in new security, new cyber protections. We are taking it seriously in Illinois because we know what the Russians tried to do to us. We don't believe they changed a vote or changed a ballot, but we are not sure they will not try in the future.  That is the reality of what we face in Illinois, and that is the reality of what America faces.  Just last week, NSA and U.Cyber Command head ADM Mike Rogers bluntly acknowledged what most of us already know; that President Trump is doing nothing--nothing--to protect Illinois or any other State against Russia's ongoing and future attacks on our election process. In fact, President Trump reportedly refuses to even talk about the issue.  Admiral Rogers told the Armed Services Committee that Vladimir Putin has paid ``little price'' for his previous and ongoing attacks and, therefore, hasn't been stopped. Incredibly, the admiral said President Trump has not granted him any new authorities to strike at Russian cyber operations.  Can anyone here imagine what President Ronald Reagan would have said at the stunning abdication of responsibility in addressing this Russian threat to America?  In the face of this fundamental threat of Russian attack on our democracy, we should have spent the last year coming together, on a bipartisan basis, establishing a sound national defense when it comes to the exercise of our democracy. We should be working--Republicans and Democrats together--to hold anyone accountable who participated in this Russian effort. We should be strengthening our laws against foreign election interference--a responsibility of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has never even taken up that issue--and we should punish and deter Russia and other nations from ever attacking our Democratic process again.  Instead, we have seen the Trump administration consistently refuse to hold the Russians accountable for their election interference or impose meaningful sanctions. President Trump has even gone out of his way to invite top Russian officials to the Oval Office and to call Russia's election interference a ``hoax.'' Despite the fact that all of our intelligence agencies say he is wrong, President Trump calls Russia election interference a hoax.  So what are Republicans in Congress doing about this? With a few exceptions like Senator John McCain, they have mostly tried to change the subject. In fact, instead of trying to get a full accounting of what Russia did to us, Republicans have focused far more on scrutinizing and criticizing anyone who suggests that the Russians interfered.  We need to take a step back and remember what this is all about; specifically, that a foreign adversary of the United States interfered in America's election. They continue to use weaponized cyber campaigns against us and our allies, and most in the majority party of Congress and the President seem not to care at all.  How have we let it get to this point? Have we forgotten our obligation to our Constitution and to this country? For those who watched the devastating two-part episode of the PBS documentary ``Frontline'' last year entitled ``Putin's Revenge,'' there was a deeply telling moment.[[Page S1371]]  Months before the 2016 election, our Nation's top intelligence officials came and told key congressional leaders about Russia's efforts. These intelligence officials were deeply concerned about what Russia was trying to do to the 2016 election. President Obama had wanted a bipartisan message condemning Putin for his efforts so as to avoid any hint of partisanship as we approached the election and so we could put a common face on this common view of unity on this effort.  What was the response of the Republican Party leadership after hearing this bombshell revelation by our intelligence agencies, this threat from Vladimir Putin, which actually goes to the heart of our democracy--the election process? The response of the Republican leader was: No thanks. We don't want to get involved. And they didn't.  Is there anybody in the Senate--anybody who took the oath to protect the Nation against enemies, foreign and domestic--who thinks that any of us, regardless of political party, should get help from a foreign adversary to be elected?  Yet here we are, with aggressive efforts to discredit investigations into this threat, with a White House that ignores Russian sanctions, with the majority party blocking legislation that offers aid to States that request it to secure our election systems, with the failure of this Congress or this White House to do anything to protect against the next such threat, and all the while, Russia continues to conduct disinformation campaigns right under our noses.  On February 14, the tragedy in Parkland, FL, invited comments of those who wanted more gun safety and those who opposed it. When we traced the source of many of the comments, we found out they were Russians--Russians preaching to the United States on both sides of the issue, trying to rile us up at this moment of great human tragedy. That is now commonplace.  We need to wake up. Russian cyber campaigns were pushing for the release of the discredited Nunes memo from the House of They have tried to undermine the FBI's credibility. They are at work every single day trying to undermine our democracy. Russian cyber campaigns have attacked even Republican Senators who have been critical of President  So I say to my Republican friends that not one of us is immune from these threats, and it is long overdue that we put Nation before party in this extremely important matter. The next time it might be China or North Korea taking different sides or pushing a different agenda when it comes to the American political process, but, of course, it doesn't matter whom a foreign adversary is trying to help. An attack on any American political party or Democratic institution by any Nation is an attack on all of us--at least it should be.  This can't be tolerated. We don't want to make America great by letting foreign powers undermine it.  So I ask my Republican friends; in fact, I invite them: Join us to get to the bottom of this. Let's pass legislation together that helps request these States secure their election systems. Let's pass legislation together that forces the administrations--this one and future administrations--to protect our national infrastructure against these cyber threats. Let's work together on a bipartisan basis to ensure that Russia and others are genuinely deterred from such actions. Let's use sanctions when necessary, and other measures, and let's work together to denounce the Russian disinformation campaign regardless of who it might help on any given day.  We have a lot of work to do, and we are only months away from this November election. In just 6 months or so, there will be early voting in this election. Are the Russians going to get to vote? Maybe not directly, but indirectly? Will they be able to invade America's political machinery, election machinery? Will they make a difference in this next election campaign? Shame on us if we can't answer those questions, and shame on us if we do nothing to stop them.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

1274,topic-id,624,"Mr.President, last week, I met in my office with four students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, as well as one recent graduate. They are among the many students and graduates from Parkland, FL, who have been speaking out across the country, asking for commonsense gun safety reforms. They are having a real impact. They are changing the debate over guns in  Last week several of the Nation's largest gun retailers, including Dick's Sporting Goods and Walmart announced that they had listened to the Parkland students, and heard them. Dick's Sporting Goods announced it will no longer sell assault rifles or high capacity magazines at any of its stores. Their CEO also announced that the company would stop selling firearms to anyone under age 21. Walmart which had already stopped selling assault rifles, made the same decision to stop selling guns to people under 21, as did Kroger and L. Making 21 the minimum age for buying any firearm is an idea that makes sense. It is already the law that a person must be 21 to buy a handgun. Why should the law be different for an assault rifle? In fact, President Trump initially came out in support of the idea of making 21 the age limit for all gun purchases, but then the NRA's lobbyists went to work on the President with a private lunch and an Oval Office visit.  We will see who the President and Republicans ultimately end up listening to on commonsense proposals like these: the Parkland students or the gun sales lobby.  It is incredible to see students and businesses across the country taking a leadership role, in addressing gun violence. They have decided it is time to act, and they are acting. We have seen the Stoneman Douglas students convince companies to make meaningful changes when it comes to gun sales practices, and they have convinced many more companies to end their relationships with the That is a major development.  Unfortunately, the gun sales lobby has not been a constructive voice in this debate over the epidemic of gun violence. Their rhetoric has been increasingly paranoid and hysterical. It is clear that their priority is to preserve their ability to make gun sales. That is the gun lobby's agenda, but it doesn't need to be our agenda.  I want to commend the students and businesses that are showing such leadership in working to make our communities safer. Now the question is, Will the Republicans who control Congress show any leadership as well?[[Page S1575]]  If we let the gun sales lobby control this debate, we will never take the steps we need to keep our schools and neighborhoods safe from gun violence. Remember, the NRA doesn't like any proposal that might hurt gun sales. They don't want to close loopholes in our laws, instead, they would rather roll back gun laws already on the books. That is not the agenda America needs.  I stand with the 97 percent of Americans who support universal background checks for gun sales. I want to close the loopholes in our laws that make it easy for dangerous people to get their hands on guns.  I also stand with the significant majorities of Americans who want to take military-style assault Weapons, high-capacity magazines, and bump stocks off of our streets. These are weapons of war, and they have no place in our neighborhoods.  We cannot become numb to the shootings that happen in our communities, our churches, our movie theaters, our concerts, and our schools. All of us, especially lawmakers, have to step up and take actions that will reduce the epidemic of gun violence and save lives.  I hope my Republican colleagues will finally step up and help get this done.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-08-pt1-PgS1574-2.txt,326,"ECONOMIC GROWTH, REGULATORY RELIEF, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT--",2018.0,8.0,March
1320,topic-id,3200,"Mr.President, on September 5 of last year, President Trump's Attorney General made an announcement. It was an announcement that affected the lives of about 800,000 people living in The announcement was that the President was going to abolish the DACA  DACA was a program created by President Obama by Executive order. Under that Executive order, if you were brought to the United States as an infant, a toddler, a child, if you grew up in this country, were educated in this country, and had no criminal record of any consequence, President Obama said that you have a chance to apply to stay in this country on a temporary, renewable basis--2 years at a time--and that you won't be deported and you can take a job.  Eight hundred thousand young people came forward under President Obama's Executive order, under this DACA order. What have they done with their lives? Many of them went to school and had to work at the same time because, being undocumented, they didn't qualify for any Federal student assistance. A lot of them took jobs all across the country--about 20,000 of them as teachers in schools, and 900 of them volunteered for the U.military, taking the same oath as everyone else, saying that they are willing to risk their lives for  The success stories of these DACA recipients are boundless. I have told a number on the floor in the course of discussing this issue over the years.[[Page S1411]]Today, I will tell another one. I am so proud of what they have done. They are amazing young people. Can you imagine growing up in America with all the challenges of youth and all the demands from your parents and peers and superiors but also knowing something that you can't say publicly: that at any moment, you could be deported from this country because you don't have the necessary legal status? That is the story of these DACA young people, the  President Trump, if you will remember, talked about immigration a lot in his last campaign. Some of the things he said were very harsh. He talked about building this big, beautiful wall, from sea to shining sea, across the Mexican border, and, of course, told us the Mexicans would pay for it. Then he referred to those in Mexico who came to the United States as Mexican rapists and criminals. It was pretty harsh language. But interestingly, toward the end of the campaign and after he was elected, he started saying conciliatory, good things about these DACA He told me personally, when I first met him on the day he was inaugurated: We will take care of those kids,  Well, on September 5 of last year, he announced that the program protecting those young people would expire as of Monday of this week, 2 days ago. As of that date, he said, if Congress hasn't replaced the DACA Program with something new, something legal, something statutory, there would be no protection for these DACA recipients as their protected status expired. For 800,000 in limbo, uncertainty is their future.  Well, the President challenged Congress, and a number of us took him up on the challenge. Six of us--three Democrats and three Republicans--Senators sat down for months. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina was part of that group, a Republican; Jeff Flake of Arizona was part of that group, a Republican; and Cory Gardner of Colorado, a On our side, Michael Bennet of Colorado, a Democrat; Bob Menendez of New Jersey, a We worked out a bipartisan agreement among us that not one of us would have written. It was a compromise in trying to meet the President's challenge of replacing DACA with something that could be the law of the land and work.  I reflect on that effort and believe it was a good one. It was certainly in good faith, and it was bipartisan. When we presented it to President Trump on January 11 at 12 noon--I remember the time very specifically--he rejected it. He not only rejected that bipartisan solution to the crisis he had created, he rejected five other bipartisan proposals to try to resolve the crisis he had created in eliminating the DACA  So here we are, just 2 days after his March 5 deadline, and where do we stand? Well, the situation has been complicated by three Federal courts that have been asked to review President Trump's decision abolishing Two of those courts have issued injunctions and said to the Trump administration: Stop what you are doing. You have to prove to us that you have the legal authority to end this program the way you ended it.  There is an injunction stopping the Trump administration from doing what the President said he would do. The President's administration didn't think much of those courts and decided to file an extraordinary appeal to the U.Supreme Court, which is across the street, to knock down this injunction and to go forward with closing down Last week, the Supreme Court rejected the Solicitor General's petition.  So here we stand. The President has abolished the DACA The protection for 800,000 young people from being deported, the protection that allowed them to work, is officially--President Trump's point of view--abolished. It has not been replaced, the deadline has been reached, and it is being argued in court.  So how much protection does that buy for the 800,000? We don't know. We know it is a court-based protection, an injunction that could last for weeks or months or even longer, but that uncertainty is what is hanging over this whole debate.  So this morning I called the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen, and I asked her: Explain to me what your Department is doing because of these court injunctions and President Trump's decision to abolish this program.  She gave me a partial explanation. In fairness to her, she promised to get back to me and even promised to come up here to Capitol Hill next week and try to explain in more detail how the Department of Homeland Security is handling this.  For example, if you were protected by DACA--a young person--and if the President's abolition of DACA did not allow you to renew your DACA application when it expired, what is your status? Can you be deported?  Secretary Nielsen told me point blank: No, we will not deport those who have pending DACA applications.  I then asked the next question: Do you have the authority to allow these same people to continue legally working, as they did under DACA?  She didn't know the answer, and in fairness to her, she said she would look into it and get back to me. I look forward to that happening.  It is a sad situation that this Congress can't pass a law to deal with this kind of emergency. Ask the American people what they think about Dreamers, what they think about young people who were brought to the United States as children, infants, and babies, and who are asking for a chance to be legal in America, to become citizens. Ask Americans what they think. Overwhelmingly, they say: Of course. Why would you punish these children who grew up in this country? They didn't break a law or commit a crime. They didn't make a decision; it was a decision made by others. They should have a chance.  Overwhelmingly, the American people say that, 85 percent or more, including more than 60 percent of people who say they voted for President Can you find an issue with that kind of public support? For those who follow the news, there is another one called universal background checks for guns, which has an even higher level of support. But going back to the DACA issue, 85 percent of the American people believe Congress should pass a law to give these young people a chance--not punish them, not deport them. Give them a chance. Give them a chance to earn their way to legal status. Despite that, this Senate has failed to pass a measure to do that.  Two weeks ago, we made it to the floor. We had four different versions of the bill. I won't go into detail other than to tell you that the most popular version of the bill got 54 votes. You would think that in a Chamber of 100 Senators, that would be enough, but not under our rules--you need 60 votes.  The President had a plan, incidentally. President Trump brought his immigration plan to the floor of the Senate the same week we debated this. Now, understand, there are 51 Republican Senators and 49 Democrats in this On the day of the vote, one Senator, Senator McCain, was missing, so 50 to 49. How many votes did President Trump get for his immigration policy presented on the floor of the Republican-controlled Senate? Thirty-nine. Sixty Senators voted against it, including a substantial number of So the President's approach to this has been rejected by even his own party.  What has the House of Representatives, the other Chamber, done about this? Absolutely nothing.  Sadly, that is a commentary on many major issues facing our country. The Congress has not even taken up a serious debate, let alone found a solution, and here we sit. It is easy for us to sit here in the Senate Chamber, confident of our own citizenship status, but for 800,000, the uncertainty makes a wreck of their lives. I have met many of them. I have talked to them. They are outstanding people. They have succeeded when others failed. They have been determined and resilient when others gave up. They are running out of time.  President Trump created this crisis for DACA on September 5. He has been unable to agree to any of six different bipartisan measures to solve it--not one--and today the fate and future of these young people rest in the hands of the courts.  It is easy to speak of these young people in gross numbers--800,000, 1.8 million--but over the years, I have decided it is better to get to know them[[Page S1412]]personally. As they have had the courage to come forward and identify themselves, I have come to the floor to tell their stories. This is the 110th time I am bringing a story to the floor.  This man is Alejandro Alejandro was brought to the United States at the age of 4 from Chile and grew up in San He was an extraordinary high school student--honor roll, AP scholar with distinction, and a member of the National Honor He was involved in a lot of activities--high school cross-country and lacrosse, a member of the choir--and volunteered as a worship leader at his church.  He was accepted at Whitman College in the State of Washington, and when he was there, he was a member of the campus Christian fellowship group. He volunteered with the local Humane Society and was the philanthropy chair of his fraternity. He was a student government representative and a mentor to other students.  After graduation, he was accepted into Teach For We know that program, don't we? That is where some of our best and brightest college graduates say: I will give you 2 years of my life and work in a school that needs me as a teacher. Send me to a tough area to work. Thousands have done it. Alejandro--not a citizen of the United States--said: I will do it. I will do it for my country.  Today, he is a sixth grade math teacher at a middle school in Denver, He volunteers as a mentor after school for students who need help with math.  What is going to happen to this man? What is going to happen to him if Congress fails to replace DACA? What is going to happen if he is deported? And it could happen. There are 20,000 just like him, teachers across America who are DACA-protected and have no protection now, no protection in the law. Their only protection is a court order, which could be changed in a moment.  If he leaves, of course, the students will pay a price, and certainly America will pay a price. Will we be better off as a nation? Of course not. This young man grew up in He was brought here at the age of 4, went to his classrooms in San Diego and pledged allegiance to the flag every day. This is his country. It is the only country he has ever known. Why would we want to throw him out of this country after he has gone through all of these things in life and achieved an amazing record of success? To me, it would be a horrible waste.  There is a larger issue at stake here than just The issue is immigration in Are we a nation of immigrants? I think so. But 2 weeks ago, at the immigration Federal agency, they decided to strike those words from their mission statement, that America was a nation of immigrants. They can strike all the words they want, but they can't strike the facts. The facts tell us that with the exception of Native Americans, who preceded us, we are all immigrants--some voluntary, some forced, but we are all immigrants in this country. We come from every corner of the We are as diverse as any nation could be. That is our history, that is our strength, and that is our legacy. That diversity makes us an extraordinary nation in the world.  Those people who came here from far-reaching shores came here for a lot of reasons. My grandmother was one of them. She brought my mom. My mom was an immigrant to this country. I don't know all the reasons that my grandmother came here, but I know there was one reason she came. She had three little kids, and she carried a bag and had with her a Catholic prayer book from the country of It was written in The Russians were in control of Lithuania at the time, and they had prohibited prayer books written in My grandmother, whom I never knew, was one tough lady. She was willing to pick up this prayer book--this contraband in Lithuania--and bring it to the United States of I don't know if she ever took a constitutional law course, but she knew there was freedom in this country. Nobody was going to stop her from praying from her prayer book when she got to the United I am sure economics had more to do with her coming, but that was part of the reason my family made it to this country. It is something I have never forgotten, and I have told the story many times.  All these people who have come to this country--every single one of us brings a story, a family story. Now we are being told it is a mistake--it is a mistake to continue legal immigration to  The President's proposal on immigration would cut legal immigration to this country almost in half. Currently, our Nation of 320, 330 million people brings in approximately 1.1 million legal immigrants a year--1 million legal immigrants; 320 million It is not an overwhelming number in comparison. On average more than sixty percent of the 1.1 million people are members of families of those already here.  Do you just ask to come in, and we let you come to America if you have a family member here? Of course not. You wait and you wait. For example, in the Philippines, you may wait 20 years for a member of the family to be reunited with someone who is already an American citizen--20 years waiting in line. The President's proposal--the one that has come to the floor of the Senate that got 39 votes--said we ought to cut the number of legal immigrants almost in half, tell those people to wait longer or stay where they are.  In most cultures, in the American culture, the family unit is our strength--flag, family, How many times have we heard those speeches from politicians? Yet these families who are trying to be reunited and to be strong are being told: You are not wanted. That is a mistake. The last time we did that was in 1924 on the floor of the U.We decided--the Senate then--there were certain people we didn't need in Asians were excluded. People from Africa and Eastern Europe and other regions were severely restricted. That could have included my mother's family. They restricted We had enough Italians--that is what Congress said. They restricted Jewish people.  That shameful chapter in American immigration history prevailed for over 40 years, until we passed a new immigration law. Now this administration wants to take us back to that debate. This administration wants to change the face of immigration in The President has been explicit about that in terms of what he would like to see America look like in the future--not as diverse, excluding people from certain places. I think that is a mistake.  If there is one thing that has made us strong, it is the fact that this diversity, when it comes together under that flag, can conquer everyone and everything on Why would we walk away from that legacy? Why would we walk away from Alejandro? Why would we walk away from 800,000 protected by DACA? Why? Is that the legacy we want to leave, that we have excluded these talented, high-achieving, energetic, fearless young people? Alejandro's story is certainly not unique. There are 20,000 teachers like him who are DACA recipients and DACA-protected.  Teach For America, the program that pays these young college graduates a limited amount of money to go to challenging schools--190 of them were protected by They are officially not citizens of the United States, but they are willing to teach kids in the toughest schools in They teach in 11 different  There is a question now about what happens next, and I don't know. Right now, the President created this crisis, and only the President can solve this crisis. There are Republican Members of the House and Senate who will not vote for anything unless it has the Trump stamp of approval on it, and I don't know what that can be. Six different times we have gone to him, and six times he has rejected bipartisan approaches. We need the President to help us work toward a solution. It is up to the Republican leaders in Congress--they control the House and the Senate--to take yes for an answer and accept one of these bipartisan approaches, to save these young people, and to resolve this crisis that faces us.  Congress needs to do its job. We should make the Dream Act the law of the land, or we will be responsible for hundreds of thousands of talented[[Page S1413]]young immigrants leaving our workforce and put them at risk of immediate deportation. It would be a chapter in American immigration history even sadder than 1924.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

1396,topic-id,1284,"Mr.President, I want to thank my colleagues, Senator Sanders, Senator Murphy, and Senator Lee, for this bipartisan effort.  Why are we here today? Why are we discussing wars so far away? We are here because of this book. This is the Constitution of the United The Constitution very expressly tells us what we are supposed to be doing here. In article I, section 8, it lays out the things that we, the men and women who serve in Congress, are responsible for. Among the things that Congress shall have the power to do is to ``declare war.''  Why did the Founding Fathers make certain that it was clear that Congress would be involved in that decision on the declaration of war? When they created Congress, the idea was that the people of this country, far and wide, would at least have a voice in the decision, through the people they elected, and we would be held accountable for our decisions to declare war or to not declare it because we are up for election. So Congress has this responsibility, and over the years, many times, Congress has not exercised its responsibility in a responsible way.  I have a question. I bet that if I brought in every U.Senator and asked them the following question, very few would be able to answer it: How many countries is the United States military currently involved in[[Page S1667]]fighting? How many countries are we in today, fighting? Would you guess two? Iraq, Afghanistan--all right, for sure, there. Five? Ten? Twenty?  Brown University's Costs of War Project recently published data saying that the United States fought terror through direct fighting, training, or military support to other forces or through drone strikes in 76 countries between October 2015 and 2017. Is that the right number today? I am not sure. None of us know.  We are often surprised to learn we are sending our military and fighting in another country. When something awful occurs--Americans are killed, for example--sometimes Members of Congress hear it for the first time: Oh, we are in what country fighting?  I take this pretty seriously, and I have over the years when it comes to the authorization of using force, because it isn't just a matter of projecting American power; it is life and death. These are decisions that will be made by Congress or by the President--sometimes both--and the net result of it, even under the best of circumstances, is that Americans will perish. Funerals will be held in Illinois and in Utah and in Vermont and in Connecticut and in That is the reality of the decisions we reach.  I can remember the debate right after 9/11 on the floor. It was one of the most important of my career. It was a question about whether we would authorize the President of the United States--President Bush at the time--to use military force to respond to 9/11. If my colleagues remember the debate, there were two real options on the floor. One was to use military force against those responsible for the attack on the United States and to send that force into The other was to go after the so-called weapons of mass destruction in They were two parallel debates, but two debates that I saw very differently.  I was skeptical from the start about this Iraqi invasion. Nobody ever connected the dots between Saddam Hussein and 9/11. We were talking about the threat that he was to the rest of the world. Yet we voted here on the floor of the U.Senate in 2002 to authorize the use of military force to go into Sadly, we are still there today. Sadly, Iraq is in shambles, politically and physically, and the war continues.  I voted no. I remember that night. It was in October of 2002. I remember that night because the vote was taken very late, and there were two or three of us who stayed on the floor here, including Kent Conrad, as well as Paul Wellstone of Paul Wellstone was up for reelection. We wondered if that vote would affect him in any way, and I remember going up to him and saying: Paul, I hope your vote against the war in Iraq doesn't cost you the election.  Wellstone said to me: It is all right if it does. People know where I stand. They expect nothing less.  He didn't live to see the election. If my colleagues will remember, he died in a plane crash with his wife and staffers just a few days after that vote.  But that is the gravity of this decision. That is the importance of this decision. And that is why I want to thank my colleagues for bringing us together--just a few of us but enough of us, maybe--in the Senate to remind people of our constitutional responsibility.  The vote on Afghanistan was one I voted for--the invasion of The message was clear: If you attack the United States, we will come right back after you, al-Qaida, and we did.  I recently asked the Secretary of Defense--when I voted that way in 2002, I did not imagine that 15 or 16 years later, that war would continue. So I asked him: How does this war ever end in Afghanistan? He didn't know the answer. He didn't come up with one. All he could say to me was that if we left, it would be worse.  Well, you can say that about a lot of other countries in the world. But what we are talking about today is what we are going to do in terms of this horrid situation in I was in my office looking down on this debate via C-SPAN, and I saw the photos that have been displayed here--the utter human and physical devastation that is taking place.  Senator Sanders is asking a simple but deeply important question here today, and Senator Lee and Senator Murphy join him. Here is the question: Who authorized the U.military action to help Saudi Arabia fight the Houthis in Yemen? I didn't. I don't remember that there was ever a vote. So how are we doing this? By what authority is our government doing this?  This is not about the merits of the fight or in any way a vindication of the Houthis' troubling role in the horrific Yemeni civil war; it is about whether Congress follows its constitutional responsibilities. It is about whether the American people have a voice in this decision--the same people who will send their sons and daughters to bravely serve in our military.  I am happy to be a cosponsor of this resolution that halts any such U.support without any congressional authorization. I call on this Congress to deal with revisiting the 2001 and 2002 authorizations of force that I believe have been stretched by multiple administrations beyond any credible limit.  There are real threats to the safety and security of America out there--al-Qaida and its successors and others. But we in Congress have the responsibility to authorize those conflicts and regularly update them as necessary.  Congress and the Senate have been absent without leave when it comes to article I, section 8, and our authority and responsibility to declare war. We have other looming threats, including North Korea and Iran, but any U.war against those countries or others, short of protecting against an imminent attack as allowed for in the War Powers Resolution, requires the vote of Congress, regardless of who the President may be.  When it comes to the declaration of war, we simply cannot see this as an annoyance. We must do our part. We must follow the Constitution, even when it is difficult.  I yield the floor.

1402,topic-id,1267,"Mr.President, for the past 6 years, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island has delivered weekly addresses to the Senate Chamber on climate change, telling us that it is time to wake up. That is the sign he posts on the floor each time he comes to discuss the disastrous effects of global warming. Today will mark his 200th speech on the Senate floor on this topic.  The urgency of the topic is real. Climate change threatens our national security and our local communities. Climate change drives global conflict and has far-reaching national security implications.  A report by Oxfam states that there is growing evidence that climate change is making droughts more frequent and more severe.  Drought has contributed to the crisis in Syria, migration from West Africa, and rapid urbanization in Just last week, ``PBS NewsHour'' reported that in the last year alone, more than 1 million Somalis have been forced from their homes because of drought.  Herders and farmers used to live among one another, but increasingly severe drought has led to a scarcity of land and water. Some animal herders now carry weapons and fight over fertile land. Farmers who have fled to the city claim herders burned down their homes and turned their farmland into grassland. The fighting and scarcity of land has pushed both farmers and herders to the cities, and most of them end up in ramshackle camps, burdened by poverty--a tinderbox.  Last March, 110 people died from starvation and drought-related illness in 48 hours, prompting President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo to declare the drought a national disaster. Still, 1.2 million children under the age of 5 are projected to be malnourished in 2018.  Somalia is not the only country where the effects of climate change have created and exacerbated regional conflicts. In a few days, Syria will mark the seventh year of civil war. Research published by the National Academy of Sciences reports that climate change has contributed to the crisis in Extreme drought in Syria between 2006 and 2009 was most likely due to climate change, and that drought was a factor in the uprisings in 2011, when more than 1 million displaced farmers joined pro-democracy protests.  Just last year, Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times columnist Tom Friedman wrote about massive migration out of parts of West Africa, through the Sahara Desert, to Libya, where people were hoping to eventually cross the Mediterranean Sea into The migration is driven in part by drought made more extreme by climate change, which has created widespread humanitarian crises.  As climate instability drives more extreme and frequent droughts and the scarcity of fertile land, water, and food, it will trigger major conflicts over resources, as we have seen in Yemen and As one of the largest contributors of greenhouse gas emissions, the United States has a moral responsibility to act on this growing crisis.  Here in our country, my constituents in Illinois are already experiencing the adverse effects of climate change. Climate models suggest that if current global warming trends continue, Illinois will have a climate similar to that of the Texas gulf coast by the year 2100. You can't grow a lot of corn in that climate. For Illinois farmers, these changes to the environment have a direct effect on their livelihood--and for all of us, a direct effect on our food supply.  Wetter springs and more frequent flooding will leave farmers struggling to plant their corn and soybeans. Increasingly hot summers and more frequent droughts will stunt the growth and hurt crop yields. This means prices will increase, making it harder for families to put food on the table.  In recent years, Illinois has seen historic storms, floods, and droughts that have caused millions of dollars in damage.  Last week, scientists at the Illinois State Water Survey reported that this February was the wettest on record, beating the previous record precipitation by over half an inch. An average of 5 inches of rain fell statewide. Streator, IL, had over 11 inches of rain, and Aurora had the largest snowfall, with a recorded 26 inches of snow. In the last week of February, rainstorms and melted snow caused flooding across Illinois, with more than 20 counties throughout the State placed under a flood warning. As the water level of rivers continued to rise, several communities had to evacuate for their safety. Multiple communities were evacuated, and in some areas, residents had to be rescued by boat. Flooded roadways claimed the life of an Illinois resident after her car rolled into a rain-filled ditch.  Climate change is likely to increase the frequency and severity of flooding in Illinois, as well, and my constituents are concerned about their ability to recover from repeated flood events.[[Page S1670]]  How much is flood damage costing us in Illinois? Last July, 3,200 residences were impacted by flooding, including 244 with major damage. This damage costs millions but often doesn't rise to the level where anyone qualifies for Federal aid. From 2007 to 2014, flooding in urban areas has caused $2.3 billion in damages.  Moving forward, repeated flood events will have a high price tag. In the last decade, extreme weather events and fire have cost the Federal Government over $350 billion, according to These costs will rise as the climate changes.  The evidence is clear. We need to get serious about addressing the cause and effect of climate change. Ignoring them threatens our national security and our safety. I believe our generation has a moral obligation to leave the world in better shape than we found it. Let's not run away from our responsibility to our children and grandchildren. Let's work toward solving the challenges of climate change.  This is a hard issue to explain from a political point of view. The only major political party in the world today that denies climate change is the Republican Party of the United States of  It is hard to imagine that a great party that once was actively engaged in a positive way in this debate is now absent without leave.  It is hard to explain that the party of Richard Nixon, who created the Environmental Protection Agency, now is in complete denial when it comes to climate change and global warming.  It is hard to understand that they are missing the obvious indicators of evidence from every corner of the world about the impact of global warming.  It is almost impossible to understand how they can ignore the impact this will have on the lives of our children and grandchildren. Is it too much to ask our generation to make a little sacrifice to spare them the devastation that will come from climate change? Is it too much to ask us to be a little more sensitive in our use of energy so that our kids and grandkids can enjoy a good life in their years on Earth? That usually is a responsibility most generations accept, but we are being told that it is just too much to ask--to ask current Americans to come forward and do something that is thoughtful, meaningful, to reduce energy consumption and reduce emission and pollution. I think that is a horrible situation. I think it is one we shouldn't be proud of at all.  I thank my friend Sheldon Whitehouse for coming to the floor regularly and reminding us of what is happening in this world today and how we each have a responsibility to future generations to alleviate the suffering, the pain, and the damage that has been caused by this global warming.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

The Congress finds the following:       (1) Business bankruptcies have increased sharply in recent      years and remain at high levels. These bankruptcies include      several of the largest business bankruptcy filings in      history. As the use of bankruptcy has expanded, job      preservation and retirement security are placed at greater      risk.       (2) Laws enacted to improve recoveries for employees and      retirees and limit their losses in bankruptcy cases have not      kept pace with the increasing and broader use of bankruptcy      by businesses in all sectors of the economy. However, while      protections for employees and retirees in bankruptcy cases      have eroded, management compensation plans devised for those      in charge of troubled businesses have become more prevalent      and are escaping adequate scrutiny.       (3) Changes in the law regarding these matters are urgently      needed as bankruptcy is used to address increasingly more      complex and diverse conditions affecting troubled businesses      and industries.        TITLE I--IMPROVING RECOVERIES FOR EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES     101. INCREASED WAGE       Section 507(a) of title 11, United States Code, is      amended--       (1) in paragraph (4)--       (A) by striking ``$10,000'' and inserting ``$20,000'';       (B) by striking ``within 180 days''; and       (C) by striking ``or the date of the cessation of the      debtor's business, whichever occurs first,'';       (2) in paragraph (5)--       (A) in subparagraph (A)--       (i) by striking ``within 180 days''; and       (ii) by striking ``or the date of the cessation of the      debtor's business, whichever occurs first''; and       (B) by striking subparagraph (B) and inserting the      following:       ``(B) for each such plan, to the extent of the number of      employees covered by each such plan, multiplied by      $20,000.''.     102. CLAIM FOR STOCK VALUE LOSSES IN DEFINED                    CONTRIBUTION       Section 101(5) of title 11, United States Code, is      amended--       (1) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``or'' at the end;       (2) in subparagraph (B), by striking the period at the end      and inserting ``; or''; and       (3) by adding at the end the following:       ``(C) right or interest in equity securities of the debtor,      or an affiliate of the debtor, if--       ``(i) the equity securities are held in a defined      contribution plan (within the meaning of section 3(34) of the      Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.     1002(34))) for the benefit of an individual who is not an      insider, a senior executive officer, or any of the 20 next      most highly compensated employees of the debtor (if 1 or more      are not insiders);       ``(ii) the equity securities were attributable to either      employer contributions by the debtor or an affiliate of the      debtor, or elective deferrals (within the meaning of section      402(g) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986), and any      earnings thereon; and       ``(iii) an employer or plan sponsor who has commenced a      case under this title has committed fraud with respect to      such plan or has otherwise breached a duty to the participant      that has proximately caused the loss of value.''.     103. PRIORITY FOR SEVERANCE       Section 503(b) of title 11, United States Code, is      amended--       (1) in paragraph (8)(B), by striking ``and'' at the end;       (2) in paragraph (9), by striking the period and inserting      a semicolon; and       (3) by adding at the end the following:       ``(10) severance pay owed to employees of the debtor (other      than to an insider, other senior management, or a consultant      retained to provide services to the debtor), under a plan,      program, or policy generally applicable to employees of the      debtor (but not under an individual contract of employment),      or owed pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, for      layoff or termination on or after the date of the filing of      the petition, which pay shall be deemed earned in full upon      such layoff or termination of employment; and''.     104. FINANCIAL RETURNS FOR EMPLOYEES AND       Section 1129(a) of title 11, United States Code is      amended--       (1) by striking paragraph (13) and inserting the following:       ``(13) With respect to retiree benefits, as that term is      defined in section 1114(a), the plan--       ``(A) provides for the continuation after the effective      date of the plan of payment of all retiree benefits at the      level established pursuant to subsection (e)(1)(B) or (g) of      section 1114 at any time before the date of confirmation of      the plan, for the duration of the period for which the debtor      has obligated itself to provide such benefits, or if no      modifications are made before confirmation of the plan, the      continuation of all such retiree benefits maintained or      established in whole or in part by the debtor before the date      of the filing of the petition; and       ``(B) provides for recovery of claims arising from the      modification of retiree benefits or for other financial      returns, as negotiated by the debtor and the authorized      representative (to the extent that such returns are paid      under, rather than outside of, a plan).''; and       (2) by adding at the end the following:       ``(17) The plan provides for recovery of damages payable      for the rejection of a collective bargaining agreement, or      for other financial returns as negotiated by the debtor and      the authorized representative under section 1113 (to the      extent that such returns are paid under, rather than outside      of, a plan).''.     105.

TITLE II--REDUCING EMPLOYEES' AND RETIREES' LOSSES     201. REJECTION OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING       Section 1113 of title 11, United States Code, is amended by      striking subsections (a) through (f) and inserting the      following:       ``(a) The debtor in possession, or the trustee if one has      been appointed under this chapter, other than a trustee in a      case covered by subchapter IV of this chapter and by title I      of the Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.151 et seq.), may reject      a collective bargaining agreement only in accordance with      this section.

The trustee shall timely pay all      monetary obligations arising under the terms of the      collective bargaining agreement. Any such payment required to      be made before a plan confirmed under section 1129 is      effective has the status of an allowed administrative expense      under section 503.       ``(c)(1) If the trustee seeks modification of a collective      bargaining agreement, the trustee shall provide notice to the      labor organization representing the employees covered by the      collective bargaining agreement that modifications are being      proposed under this section, and shall promptly provide an      initial proposal for modifications to the collective      bargaining agreement. Thereafter, the trustee shall confer in      good faith with the labor organization, at reasonable times      and for a reasonable period in light of the complexity of the      case, in attempting to reach mutually acceptable      modifications of the collective bargaining agreement.       ``(2) The initial proposal and subsequent proposals by the      trustee for modification of a collective bargaining agreement      shall be based upon a business plan for the reorganization of      the debtor, and shall reflect the most complete and reliable      information available. The trustee shall provide to the[[Page S1458]]     labor organization all information that is relevant for      negotiations. The court may enter a protective order to      prevent the disclosure of information if disclosure could      compromise the position of the debtor with respect to the      competitors in the industry of the debtor, subject to the      needs of the labor organization to evaluate the proposals of      the trustee and any application for rejection of the      collective bargaining agreement or for interim relief      pursuant to this section.       ``(3) In consideration of Federal policy encouraging the      practice and process of collective bargaining and in      recognition of the bargained-for expectations of the      employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement,      modifications proposed by the trustee--       ``(A) shall be proposed only as part of a program of      workforce and nonworkforce cost savings devised for the      reorganization of the debtor, including savings in management      personnel costs;       ``(B) shall be limited to modifications designed to achieve      a specified aggregate financial contribution for the      employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement      (taking into consideration any labor cost savings negotiated      within the 12-month period before the filing of the      petition), and shall be not more than the minimum savings      essential to permit the debtor to exit bankruptcy, such that      confirmation of a plan of reorganization is not likely to be      followed by the liquidation, or the need for further      financial reorganization, of the debtor (or any successor to      the debtor) in the short term; and       ``(C) shall not be disproportionate or overly burden the      employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement,      either in the amount of the cost savings sought from such      employees or the nature of the modifications.       ``(d)(1) If, after a period of negotiations, the trustee      and the labor organization have not reached an agreement over      mutually satisfactory modifications, and further negotiations      are not likely to produce mutually satisfactory      modifications, the trustee may file a motion seeking      rejection of the collective bargaining agreement after notice      and a hearing. Absent agreement of the parties, no such      hearing shall be held before the expiration of the 21-day      period beginning on the date on which notice of the hearing      is provided to the labor organization representing the      employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement.      Only the debtor and the labor organization may appear and be      heard at such hearing.

Any hearing under this      subsection shall be scheduled in accordance with the needs of      the trustee. The implementation of such interim changes shall      not render the application for rejection moot.       ``(f)(1) Rejection of a collective bargaining agreement      constitutes a breach of the collective bargaining agreement,      and shall be effective no earlier than the entry of an order      granting such relief.       ``(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), solely for purposes of      determining and allowing a claim arising from the rejection      of a collective bargaining agreement, rejection shall be      treated as rejection of an executory contract under section      365(g) and shall be allowed or disallowed in accordance with      section 502(g)(1). No claim for rejection damages shall be      limited by section 502(b)(7). Economic self-help by a labor      organization shall be permitted upon a court order granting a      motion to reject a collective bargaining agreement under      subsection (d) or pursuant to subsection (e), and no      provision of this title or of any other provision of Federal      or State law may be construed to the contrary.       ``(g) The trustee shall provide for the reasonable fees and      costs incurred by a labor organization under this section,      upon request and after notice and a hearing.       ``(h) A collective bargaining agreement that is assumed      shall be assumed in accordance with section 365.''.     202.

1980,topic-id,2156,"Mr.President, on September 5 of last year, President Trump announced the repeal of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, known as As a result of that decision by President Trump, hundreds of thousands of immigrants who came to the United States as children, known as Dreamers, face losing their work permits and their right to stay in America without deportation. They are threatened with being returned to countries that many of them barely remember, if at all.  These Dreamers were brought here as children--infants, toddlers, young kids--by their parents to America, and they grew up here. They went to school in America, to our public schools and other schools that were available to them. They stood up in their classrooms every morning and pledged allegiance to the flag. They grew up believing that this was their home.  At some point in their lives their parents pulled them aside and told them the bitter truth--that they were not legally in America, they were undocumented, and they were vulnerable. At any minute, a knock on the door or a stop on the highway could result in not only their deportation but the deportation of every member of their family. Growing up is tough enough for an adolescent. I can't imagine growing up with this shadow over me, wondering whether at any moment a misstep or being in the wrong place might mean that I would be sent from this country and that my parents would be sent with me, but they grew up with that reality and with that danger.  They did some extraordinary things. They not only prospered in America and finished their education, they went on with great ambition, believing the day would come when they would get a chance to be part of this country.  Seventeen years ago, I introduced the Dream The purpose of that bill was to give those young people a chance--a chance to earn their way to legal status, earn their way to citizenship. If they have a serious criminal record, they are gone and we want nothing to do with them. They had squandered any opportunity they had to be part of America's future. But if they were doing the right thing, leading a good life, working hard, finishing school, many of us believed they deserved a chance. In fact, at this point, 85 percent of Americans believe they deserve a chance, and that includes 60 percent of the people who voted for President  We have never passed the Dream Act and made it the law, but when I asked my former Senate colleague, President Obama, to see if there was something he could do by Executive order, he created DACA gave these young people a 2-year renewable protection. They had to pay a $500 fee, submit themselves to a criminal background check, and if they passed it, they would end up with a temporary, renewable right to stay in About 800,000 came forward and did it.  There were many more who were eligible but scared--scared that turning over their family's information and their personal information to this government or any government could turn out badly. Can you blame them? They have lived their whole lives in fear that a highway stop or somebody being arrested next to them could mean they would have to leave the only country they had ever known. But 800,000 stepped up and said: We will do it. I encouraged them. I went to so many meetings in Chicago, around the State of Illinois, and around the country telling them that this DACA Program was for real and that the government was giving them a pledge that they would stand by them on a renewable basis because of President Obama's order.  The program was a huge success. As I mentioned, 800,000 signed up, and some even renewed. Then came the decision by President Trump to end the program. What he said was that by March 5 of this year, there would be no more Those who were protected could play out their temporary protection but no renewals.  That is where the issue stood for the longest time. Many of us decided that we needed to do something about it and to accept the President's challenge and create a law--a law that would provide protection for these young people. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina; Senator Jeff Flake, a Republican from Arizona; Senator Cory Gardner, a Republican from Colorado; Senator Michael Bennet, a Democrat from Colorado; and Senator Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey--we came together and decided on a bipartisan basis to draw up a bill to try to solve this problem, be fair to these young people, and give them a chance to stay in America and earn their way to citizenship. When we proposed the bill to President Trump, he rejected it. In fact, he rejected six different bipartisan proposals to solve this problem.  So the deadline was looming and passed last week on March 5, and the program, by the President's proclamation, would have been finished were it not for two Federal courts that intervened and said: No, Mr.You may have overstepped. You may have done more than you can legally do. So we are going to protect these Dreamers, these DACA young people, until we resolve the question on your constitutional authority to make that decision.  At the current moment, more than 700,000 of these young DACA recipients are protected by a court order that required that they reopen DACA eligibility for those whose DACA protection had expired, the 2-year temporary protection. Now tens of thousands of them are coming forward and applying for DACA renewal.[[Page S1647]]  Last week I called Secretary Nielsen at the Department of Homeland Security and said: I have some questions that I am hearing as I travel around. For example, if I was protected by DACA and my protection came to an end and I am now reapplying for DACA and going to your agency, how long will it take your agency to process my application?  Secretary Nielsen could not give me an exact date, but there has been speculation that it could take 4 to 6 months. You see, there is a big backlog of cases, and it could take months before they process all those cases. That was my first question.  My second question: In that 4- to 6-month period, can these young DACA recipients be deported?  She said no. I put out an order, she said, that no one is to be deported if they made an application for DACA renewal.  I asked Secretary Nielsen: Can we have that in writing?  I will get back to you, she said.  I don't think that is too much to ask--whether these young people can be protected from deportation while they are applying for DACA renewal.  The third question: There is also a legal ability to work under Can you protect these young people's ability to have a job while you are processing their applications?  She didn't know whether she could. I have since learned that she has the authority to do that, but it is an important question, isn't it? If you happen to be one of these DACA recipients--the vast majority of them are actually working, and most of them are in school or have graduated. They have to. They don't qualify for any Federal Pell grants or government loans, so they need to work to pay off their education. That is understandable.  So it is still uncertain as to what is going to happen. Then what happens when the court lifts this injunction, and what will be the future of these young people?  President Trump said some harsh things about immigration during the course of the Presidential campaign. We all remember his comments about people of the Muslim religion, his comments about Mexican rapists, and his pledge to build a big, beautiful wall from sea to shining sea and have Mexico pay for it. Do you remember? We all heard those things. But an interesting thing happened after he was elected: He started saying more moderate, positive things about Dreamers, to the point where I actually had some hope that this particular group would have a fighting chance. As of today, there is no indication that President Trump feels the same way. Six different bipartisan proposals have been rejected. So here we stand with this uncertainty.  When the issue came before the Senate, we did our best to put together a bipartisan rollcall. We came close but not close enough. There were 4 proposals on the floor, and the one with the largest number of votes received 54 votes. There were three Democrats who disagreed with some parts of it. I think we could have probably found a way to get their support. But we only had 8 Republicans who joined us--8 out of 51--to vote for the measure to deal with this issue. So it is still an unresolved issue at this moment as to what is going to happen after the court cases.  I have come to the floor many times--in fact, over 100 times--to tell the stories of these Dreamers, and I would like to do that today before I yield to the Democratic leader.  This is Maria Torres Maria is the 111th Dreamer I have featured here on the floor of the She came here to the United States from Mexico when she was 5 years old, and she grew up in the State of Her family didn't have much money, so she worked pretty hard. She used to deliver newspapers. She delivered 100 newspapers before school each morning. She worked odd jobs--shoveled snow, cut grass. When she was in high school, she worked as a server at a restaurant every day while she was still going to school, kept up with her studies, and delivered the newspapers in the morning. You can tell Maria is not a lazy person.  Because of her family's financial struggles, despite her best efforts, her family was homeless for some time. Through it all, she was an excellent student, and despite her family difficulties, she graduated from high school with a 3.8 grade point average.  She didn't believe she would ever make it to college, but she did. She was accepted at Washington State University Tri-She is a senior now, and this spring, she will graduate with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and a minor in computer science. She is currently working as a student engineer at ATI Titanium and Specialty Alloys, a specialty parts manufacturer. Her main project is creating a system to facilitate the usage of AutoCAD drawings and manuals for engineering and maintenance. I hope none of my colleagues ask me to explain what I just said, but it sounds like pretty important work. What is her dream? She wants a master's degree in engineering. She is particularly interested in nuclear-powered mechatronics--the technology that combines electronics and mechanical engineering.  Maria wrote me a letter, and here is what it said:       DACA is a whole world of opportunities for me. If DACA were      to be taken away from me, all my hard work would not count. I      want to see the results of my hard work and I wouldn't be      able to do so without  Would America be a better place if Maria was asked to leave? Would we be a stronger nation if we took this young girl's amazing energy, her academic accomplishment, and her dream and drive and sent them back to Mexico? After all these years, after education and hard work--two jobs at a time when she was in high school--is there any doubt that this young woman is going to be a spectacular success in life?  That is what this comes down to--real human beings, DACA recipients, protected by that Executive order of President Obama's, who are now under the threat of deportation because of President Trump's decision. It is a test of who we are as a nation, whether we believe in fairness and opportunity or whether we are going to walk away from our legacy. This is a nation of immigrants.  I stand before you proudly, the son of an immigrant to this country. My mother was brought here from Lithuania when she was 2 years old, and here her son stands as a Senator from the State of That is my story, that is my family's story, and that is America's story.  It is time for us to remember Maria and the hundreds of thousands just like her who are asking for a chance to be part of our future.  Mr.President, is it possible that with all the things on your mind, you have forgotten DACA and the Dreamers?  We need President Trump to step up and lead.

1166,topic-id,485,"Mr.Speaker, the House Financial Services Committee has been working hard for consumers, local banks, credit unions, and American entrepreneurs during the 115th Today, we continue our work with H.4607, the Comprehensive Regulatory Review  Introduced by my colleague from Georgia, Representative Barry Loudermilk, this bill brings accountability and modernization to the current regulatory review process for banks, credit unions, and financial institutions across the country.  Currently, the regulatory audit conducted by our Federal financial regulators happens just once every decade, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the National Credit Union Administration are not technically a part of that review.  It has been 21 years since we evaluated possible changes to this antiquated and inefficient system. That is why we need Representative Loudermilk's Comprehensive Regulatory Review Act to ensure the regulations we have in place are working to do what they are supposed to do: protect consumers.  This legislation is made even more urgent given that unchecked and inefficient regulations are working against the very consumers our regulatory regime was designed to help. Take, for example, the fact that the United States lost nearly 12,000 of its federally insured banks between 1984 and 2016, making it harder for small business entrepreneurs and families to access the credit and capital they need to create new opportunities and grow.  These banks struggled under the weight of new regulations, either to disappear completely or to be swallowed up by the big banks that are able to absorb the heavy cost of compliance. For those banks that are able to survive, significant tradeoffs are required.  In Rockford, Minnesota, for instance, instead of adding another lender to their team, one small community bank needed to hire a full-time compliance officer simply to keep up with the regulatory onslaught from Washington.[[Page H1387]]That same bank is spending over $100,000 each year on compliance costs instead of using that money in ways that would benefit the local community.  Minnesota's credit unions have also been hit hard by unchecked and outdated regulation. One study found that credit unions in my State of Minnesota have incurred $102 million in costs directly related to the increased regulations created by the Dodd-Frank Worse still, one in every four Minnesota credit union employees spends their time solely on regulatory compliance.  Mr.Speaker, we have a duty to stand up for these struggling financial institutions and, more importantly, the consumers whose communities are hurting without them. We can do that today.  Representative Loudermilk's legislation sailed through committee in January receiving support from both sides of the aisle because Republicans and Democrats know that H.4607 takes necessary and important steps to ease the regulatory burdens which challenge community financial institutions in each and every congressional district.  I appreciate the hard work of the bill's sponsor and the chairman of the committee to bring this legislation to the floor today, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the Comprehensive Regulatory Review  ",CREC-2018-03-06-pt1-PgH1382-5.txt,2253,"ECONOMIC GROWTH, REGULATORY RELIEF, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT",2018.0,6.0,March
1548,topic-id,304,"Madam Speaker, when the House passed the Financial CHOICE Act to repeal Dodd-Frank last year, we did so because we believe in Main Street, we believe in the consumer, the American consumer.  Dodd-Frank promised to protect consumers from the big banks on Wall In reality, Dodd-Frank has punished small banks and credit unions and, ultimately, the American consumer.  The loss of community financial institutions tells the story. In my State of Minnesota, we had 513 community banks in 2000. Today, we have about 309, and continue to experience a drought in de novo charters.  Credit unions have, unfortunately, faced similar challenges. This means there are fewer places for Americans to turn when they are seeking a loan for their first home or perhaps to get a small business off the ground.  One specific provision in Dodd-Frank requires lenders to deny loans to individuals who do not meet government-prescribed standards. This, according to Washington, makes loans safer, since, of course, government knows best. But in reality, these mortgages have not been made safer. They have been made unavailable. As a result, the likelihood of getting approved for a loan and becoming a homeowner has plummeted.  Representative Barr's legislation, the Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access Act, takes steps to empower lenders in Minnesota and across the country and to better serve the needs of their customers by extending important protections to institutions and ensuring access to credit for American borrowers.  At the end of the day, the most effective way to ensure an individual has the ability to repay does not always need to be government-prescribed.  I appreciate my colleague from Kentucky's hard work to protect and reinvigorate our community financial institutions, and I urge my colleagues to support H.2226, the Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access Act, as it comes before the House for a vote.

Thad is known to hold strong opinions, but that has never stopped him from developing a close working relationship with Members of both parties. Throughout his career, he has used his experience and mastery of the issues to persuade his colleagues, but he has done so privately rather than bashing in the media.

1327,topic-id,1194,"Mr.President, when we debated the Dodd-Frank bill in 2010, I concentrated most of my effort on talking about the third portion--the third third of the bill; it is one of those several-hundred page bills again--but this was kind of hidden at the end, something called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, known as the  I opposed its creation during the debate. I opposed it because it is not a government agency under any way, shape, form, or rule that we have. There is no control whatsoever over this group. The makeup of the Bureau is quite unique in that a sole Director, rather than a bipartisan commission, is the singular decision maker of the agency, and it doesn't even require approval by Congress for who that person is or the length of their term. Furthermore, the Bureau is not subjected to the congressional appropriations process, having guaranteed money from the Federal Reserve to fund the agency's existence.  How does that work? Well, they get a percentage of the revenue of the Federal Reserve that would normally come to the Federal Government and then be allocated. They get it before it comes to the Federal Government, so they are outside the control of an appropriations process. They have guaranteed money. Not only do they have guaranteed money, they have a guaranteed inflation factor built into their money. It is feasible that with enough inflation, they could control the entire revenue from the Federal That funding source is more assured than Social And if the agency is running amuck, Congress has no ability to use the appropriations process to bring oversight to the Consumer Financial Protection That is a great name. It seems to protect it, even if that is not primarily what it seems to be doing. I am only picking on a very small portion of that with this bill.  You may be familiar with something called the transparent General Schedule for Federal employees, often referred to as the ``GS scale.'' It is the primary way that the government ensures that Federal employee salaries are appropriate and reasonable. This pay scale, however, doesn't apply to the least accountable agency in the Federal Government--you guessed it, the  At the CFPB, the Director has the sole discretion to determine employees' salaries. Government employees at the CFPB--if you want to call them government employees, because they are really outside any control by the government, either the executive branch or legislative branch, and it takes a court case to get it to the judicial branch--government employees at the CFPB receive some of the highest paychecks of all Federal workers. According to data my office obtained from the Office of Personnel Management and the CFPB itself, there were over 170 employees at the CFPB who were paid salaries in 2017 that ranged from $180,000 to $259,000. To put this in perspective, in 2017, the highest paid appointees in the White House were paid salaries of $179,000--$1,000 less than the minimum of these 170 employees at the Over 170 employees at the CFPB receive more pay than the highest paid White House staffers, and 102 employees of the CFPB make more in annual salary than any of our State A Supreme Court Justice is paid an annual salary of $251,000. Six staff members at the CFPB were paid more than that, and there is no control, so it can go higher. It is based on what the Director approves. In 2017, approximately 47 employees had a salary higher than the Vice President's.  It is true that top executives at the big banks can make a hefty penny in their industry, but the whole of the American banking industry doesn't see this type of wealth. These are our community bankers and our credit unions and institutions that support Main Street According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average bank employee salary is $63,000. And guess who makes more than these bankers. Their regulators, like the  Last year, Congressman Sean Duffy of Wisconsin and I introduced the CFPB Pay Fairness Act to rein in the CFPB's rates of pay. I am offering this bill as an amendment to the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection The amendment requires the Director of the CFPB to set the basic rate of pay in accordance with the GS scale--the same fairness scale that everybody else works under. The GS scale provides information to the public on the credentials of Federal employees, with each level requiring qualification standards, such as education and years of experience.  As it stands, the CFPB does not provide any qualification standards for its employees' pay, nor is it transparent to the American people or even the CFPB's own employees. This proved to[[Page S1417]]be an issue when in 2016 the Government Accountability Office investigated allegations of discrimination at the Thirty-three percent of the CFPB employee respondents to the GAO--Government Accountability Office--indicated they believed their pay was not commensurate with their skills, work experience, and education.  Because of the way the CFPB was created in the Dodd-Frank legislation that we are working on right now, Congress failed to impose the usual constitutional checks to rein in this behavior. Congress needs to bring accountability to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and we should start with the Bureau's lavish spending on employee salaries. This commonsense amendment would ensure that the Bureau is keeping employees' salaries in line with the regular government pay scale, which promotes transparency and equity in pay across the Federal  There is a lot more that I could say about this Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, but I want to concentrate on the fact that they are paid substantially more than anybody else in government, and we have no control over it. There is only one person who does, and that is the one who gets the job as Director--which was taken to court since even the President can't fire that person, no matter which President it is. So this is just one of the things that make it an unusual organization.  From my experience, they aren't doing what they said they would do at the time that they said it needed to be created. Instead, they are harassing different businesses until these businesses pay a fine, and that fine goes into a slush fund for them that they can give out to ones that we would never approve for any money from the Federal  They have this guaranteed revenue. In checking, I find out they are supposed to spend all of it. The Director can set the salaries and has very little firing capability to go along with that. But they are paid an inordinate amount compared to everybody else in government, including Supreme Court Justices, the Vice President, and other people who work around here. The highest paid people at the White House make $1,000 less than the lowest paid of these 170 workers.  I hope people consider this amendment to bring a degree of fairness and transparency so we know what the agency is doing. It is only in the way of salaries, but that is a good starting place.

1797,topic-id,529,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.4986, the RAY BAUM'S Act, the first FCC reauthorization in 28 years, named for our dear friend, the late Ray  This bill is the product of many long hours of hard work to achieve a bipartisan, bicameral compromise. While no bill is perfect, this legislation contains many solid policy advancements for digital communications in the 21st century.  I'm especially glad to see two bills I've championed for many years included in this package, `Dig Once' which I first introduced in 2009, and the RESPONSE Act, which I first introduced in 2010. Broadband is essential for every community in our country to function today, just as the physical roads and bridges we travel on are. For nearly a decade, I've been pushing for a `Dig Once' policy, a commonsense proposal to ensure broadband conduit is included in the buildout of roads and highways when they're being built and where there's a demonstrated need for broadband access, rather than tearing up roads later. Dig Once will enable states to make it easier for broadband providers to enter new and underserved markets by laying the broadband conduit during construction.  H.4986 also includes the RESPONSE Act that ensures that multi-line telephones commonly found in office buildings and hotels are equipped with location accuracy technologies. This is essential for responders to locate a 911 caller in a large building as quickly as possible because lives are literally on the line and every second counts. This provision will help save lives.  I'm disappointed that the FCC Collaboration Act was excluded from the final version of H.4986. This is another bipartisan, commonsense proposal that I have consistently introduced since 2009. It passed out of the Communications and Technology subcommittee, the full Energy and Commerce committee, and previously passed the full House, all with bipartisan support. All of the former Democratic and Republican FCC members have supported this policy one hundred percent. It's unfortunate that despite such broad support, this provision was stripped from the final bill despite our work in  I also want to express my concerns about some parts of the bill which consolidate the FCC's reporting on issues like price hikes, competition, and program diversity, and the scaling back of provisions on critical unlicensed spectrum. I worry that we'll regret weakening these public interest policies. Nonetheless, I support H.4986 as a set of largely positive developments for consumers, policymakers, and many other stakeholders in the communications marketplace. I want to thank Chairman Walden for his hard work on this, and urge my colleagues to vote YES on H.4986, the RAY BAUM'S Act of 2018.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

1409,topic-id,544,"Mr.President, I join my colleagues today to discuss climate change. I want to thank Senator Whitehouse for being a vocal advocate for addressing this issue.  Climate change is real. It is happening all around us, and we can't afford to ignore this fact any longer.  This past year, global temperatures were up 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit over the historical average. Millions of Americans came face-to-face with extreme weather events like deadly wildfires and powerful hurricanes, and these extreme weather events are only expected to get worse.  If no action is taken to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the world will warm 7 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100. Rising temperatures will bring increasingly more severe droughts, destructive floods, deadly wildfires, and strong coastal storms. Rising temperatures are also warming our oceans, threatening to melt both polar icecaps.  Last summer, the world watched as an iceberg the size of Delaware broke free from Antarctica's Larsen C ice shelf. Scientists are now studying how the entire shelf may collapse and projecting what that would mean for the even larger West Antarctic Ice Sheet as oceans continue to warm. That sheet--twice the size of Texas--contains enough ice to raise sea levels by more than 10 feet.  That much sea rise would submerge more than 25,000 square miles of the United States that is home to more than 12 million  Rising seas and the loss of coastal land aren't the only threats we are facing due to climate change. The effects it is having on our water supply is deeply troubling.  California is home to the largest agriculture sector in the United States.[[Page S1674]]Our growers need access to plenty of water to help feed the whole As temperatures rise, we are seeing fewer and fewer days below freezing, greatly reducing mountain snowpack which is a critical source of water in the Extreme heat is also making it harder for agriculture workers to safely work outside. In the Central Valley, average temperatures are projected to rise 6 degrees by the end of this century. It is not just people who work outdoors who are feeling the health effects of climate change. Warmer temperatures are expanding the range of disease-carrying pests such as ticks and mosquitos. Lyme disease cases have tripled in the last two decades, and tropical diseases are now appearing as far north as the Gulf  Californians know all too well the effects of climate change. We are still recovering from an historic drought and the most destructive wildfire season on record. But we may be in another drought by next year if we don't get more rain soon.

California is still honoring the Paris Agreement even though the President pulled the United States out.

1986,topic-id,2059,"Mr.President, I rise to discuss 2155. It is called the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection One would think from the title that I would be all for it, but as one who went through the drop in the economy when we were on the brink of collapse, I believe this is a very bad bill.  Let me go back to that time. Banks were teetering and over 300 would fail in the next 3 years. For perspective, only three banks had failed in the year of 2007. Unemployment was skyrocketing. We lost $19 trillion in household wealth. Americans lost nearly 9 million jobs.  In my State of California, more than 2 million people were unemployed, 3\1/2\ million mortgages were at risk, and nearly 200,000 people filed for bankruptcy.[[Page S1654]]  Now that the economy has recovered and unemployment has decreased from its high point of 10 percent during the crisis, I worry that my colleagues have forgotten the magnitude of this crisis. I simply cannot.  I remember sitting in caucuses hearing from our top financial officials about the potential for a total collapse of our economy. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner testified to the House Financial Services Committee that ``our financial system failed to do its job and came precariously close to failing altogether.'' That is not an exaggeration. For those of us who were here, who listened to the economists, who heard what was happening, we feared a total collapse. Personal conversations I had with these economists carried the most dire warnings. We should never get close to that point again.  Congress spent more than $400 billion on something labeled TARP, Troubled Asset Relief Program, to help stabilize the economy. It was very controversial at the time, but we have since recouped more than we spent on that bank program.  Congress then passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010, putting in place policies to prevent another financial crisis, including strong protections on the largest banks. Now, just 8 years later--how quickly we forget--we are considering loosening these protections.  Have we forgotten the lessons from 10 years ago and the devastating consequences for American families?  As with any bill we pass, I am open to looking at how it has been implemented and making adjustments as needed. For Dodd-Frank, I agree that community banks and credit unions shouldn't be regulated the same way as the largest banks in the country. I am open to adjusting some of these regulations for them, but this bill simply goes too far. It goes beyond targeted relief for small institutions.  The nonpartisan CBO, Congressional Budget Office, says the probability of a large bank failing or another financial crisis will go up if this bill is enacted. One provision I am particularly worried about would roll back regulations and supervision for banks with assets between $50 billion and $250 billion. These aren't just small community banks we are talking about. Instead, this would apply to some of the largest banks in our country.  Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, wrote that Countrywide, National City, and GMAC were all below $250 billion and ``required billions of dollars in official capital assistance and debt guarantees either for themselves or their acquiring institutions.''  Here is what Phil Angelides, who served as chairman of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, said about this particular provision:       The bill's provisions to lift the asset threshold for      enhanced prudential standards and supervision from $50      billion to $250 billion would substantially reduce oversight      over 25 of the nation's 38 largest banks, including      institutions of over $100 billion in assets that were deemed      ``Too Big to Fail'' in 2009.       A number of financial institutions with less than $250      billion triggered the need for bailout assistance during the      crisis and history has shown, time and time again, that the      failure of financial firms that are not among the largest      mega-banks can pose systemic threats to financial stability.  In addition to weakening these requirements, the bill can also weaken capital requirements for even the largest banks.  Sheila Bair, former Chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said this could lead up to a 30-percent capital reduction at some banks. Just think of that. She also raises a question that we should all take a moment to reflect on: Why does Congress want to start designating banking activities as low or no risk, when expert financial regulators were so wrong prior to the crisis?  Finally, this bill would amend the SAFE Act that I authored to ensure mortgage brokers and lenders meet minimum standards. This was necessary to curb the abusive lending practices we saw leading up to the financial crisis in which many consumers were taken advantage of through predatory lending.  This was a serious problem in Between March and June of 2008, 406 defendants were charged in 144 mortgage fraud-related cases, and approximately $1 billion in losses were attributed to these fraudulent acts.  The SAFE Act created a new system of registration and licensing that included background checks, education requirements, and testing to ensure that mortgage brokers and lenders could meet basic standards.  The bill before us, interestingly enough, would allow mortgage loan originators to operate without a license--without a license--for up to 120 days if they move from a bank to a nonbank or across State lines. Allowing this transition period without ensuring that lenders have passed the licensing test we required in the SAFE Act weakens the protections we put in place for consumers.  Before I conclude, I want to say that I appreciate this is a bipartisan bill. It has gone through the Banking I also understand the interest in ensuring regulations are appropriately tailored to the size and activity of financial institutions, but I am really worried that Members here have become too comfortable in our economic recovery and have forgotten where the path of deregulation ends.  I oppose this bill because it simply goes too far in deregulating some of our largest institutions and weakening the protections we put in place to prevent another financial crisis.  If we don't learn from past failures, we are doomed to repeat them.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter of Phil  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                    Sacramento, CA, March 5, 2018.     Re 2155.     Mike Crapo,     Chairman, U.Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and          Urban Affairs, Washington,     Sherrod Brown,     Ranking Member, U.Senate Committee on Banking, Housing,          and Urban Affairs, Washington,       I am writing this letter to express my strong opposition to      2155 by Senator Crapo which would weaken the financial      system safeguards and taxpayer and consumer protections put      in place in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The      provisions of the bill, particularly when coupled with the      clearly expressed deregulatory agenda of the Trump      Administration and its key financial regulators, will once      again put us on the path of exposing American taxpayers, our      financial system, and our economy to significant risk.       As Chairman of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission,      which conducted the nation's official inquiry into the causes      of the financial crisis, I am deeply troubled by the      potential passage of this legislation, considering the      magnitude of the economic and human damage caused by the      crisis and the effectiveness of post-crisis reforms in      stabilizing our financial system and economy. That the Senate      is taking up this bill on the floor at this time is      particularly astounding given that next week will mark the      10th anniversary of the collapse of Bear Stearns, one of the      seminal events in the unraveling of our financial markets      that plunged our nation into the Great       Before the financial crisis abated, the federal government      and the nation's taxpayers provided trillions of dollars of      financial assistance through two dozen separate programs,      including the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), to bail      out Wall Even with this historic and unprecedented      government response, the consequences of the crisis were      dire. Millions lost their jobs and their homes, cities and      towns across the nation were devastated, and trillions of      dollars in wealth were stripped away from hard working      families and businesses. The aspirations of millions of      Americans were crushed in the financial assault on our      nation, with all too many families and regions still      struggling today from the fall-out of the crisis.       Without any compelling public policy rationale--other than      the deceptive guise of aiding regional and community banks--     this bill now seeks to undo key bulwarks of public protection      designed to avert future crises. Indeed, its provisions would      put us on the road to re-creating conditions that the FCIC      concluded led to the 2008 crisis. While the bill purports to      be the ``Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer      Protection Act'', only the ``regulatory relief'' portion of      its title bears any relationship to reality. Like the      ``Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000'', which      ensured that over-the-counter derivatives would remain hidden      in a dark market, or the House ``Financial CHOICE Act'',      which would eviscerate the Dodd-Frank financial reforms,      2155's benign name deliberately obscures its detrimental      effects.       Below are just some of my specific concerns with the      legislation.       First, the bill's provisions to lift the asset threshold      for enhanced prudential standards and supervision from $50      billion to $250 billion would substantially reduce oversight      over 25 of the nation's 38 largest banks, including      institutions of over $100 billion in assets that were deemed      ``Too Big To Fail'' in[[Page S1655]]     2009. A number of financial institutions with less than $250      billion triggered the need for bailout assistance during the      crisis and history has shown, time and again, that the      failure of financial firms that are not among the largest      mega-banks can pose systemic threats to financial stability.      While the bill purports to allow the Federal Reserve to      ``reach back'' to institutions with more than $100 billion in      assets, those provisions would be legally difficult to      implement, given the likelihood of financial industry      litigation; undermine the very purpose of having enhanced      prudential standards in place prior to the emergence of      risks; and undercut the Federal Reserve's current broad      authority to impose such standards.       Secondly, while existing law allows the Federal Reserve to      tailor financial stability rules for banks over $50 billion      in assets, this bill would now require the Federal Reserve to      do so for the banks still subject to enhanced prudential      standards--those with assets over $250 billion. There is      legitimate concern that this change, from ``may'' to      ``shall'', will be implemented to reduce scrutiny of the 13      biggest banks in our nation.       Third, the bill will weaken stress testing of major      financial institutions by, among other things, reducing the      timeframe for testing from semi-annually for the nation's      biggest banks to ``periodically'', which could be as      infrequently as once every three years. What public purpose      could possibly be served by diminishing the understanding by      regulators of how major financial institutions would fare in      the event of adverse financial and economic conditions?       Fourth, as Secretary Mnuchin himself has indicated, the      legislation is likely to be implemented in a manner that      deregulates 10 foreign megabanks--including but not limited      to firms such as Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank--heightening      the risk that those banks could infect and debilitate our      nation's financial system.       Fifth, the bill would punch a new hole in leverage ratios,      leading to a substantial reduction in required capital at      certain large banks, a troubling reversal of the drive toward      stronger capital requirements in the wake of the crisis. The      need for enhanced capital at major financial institutions has      been one of the areas of broadest consensus emanating from      the 2008 meltdown. It should also be noted that this proposal      is wholly outside the realm of the bill's stated purpose of      aiding regional and community banks.       Finally, this bill begins to chip away at the post-crisis      reforms made to the woeful mortgage lending standards that      the FCIC found to be a primary cause of the crisis. There is      no sound policy rationale or good public purpose served by      exempting most financial institutions from reporting mortgage      lending data which they already collect; eliminating escrow      requirements for subprime loans; or giving lenders a      liability shield for adjustable rate mortgages underwritten      at low teaser rates.       Based on the above concerns, I urge the Senate to reject      2155. Thank you for your consideration.           Sincerely,                                               Phil Angelides,                                Chairman, Financial Crisis Inquiry                                           Commission (2009-2011).

298,topic-id,626,"Mr.President, I rise today to discuss H.1865, the anti-human-trafficking legislation currently being considered here on the Senate floor. Human trafficking is one of the fastest growing criminal enterprises in the world. More than 20 million people in our Nation and around the globe are affected by this modern-day form of slavery.  The criminals who carry out these heinous acts often go after the vulnerable, such as young people who have run away from home or are victims of domestic violence. Women and girls are disproportionately affected. According to the International Labour Organization, 55 percent of total victims worldwide are women and girls. Tragically, children are frequently targeted.  The perpetrators trap their victims in unconscionable and violent situations, forcing them to commit sexual acts against their will. This practice occurs in nearly every area code. It is happening closer to home than we even realize. A report published by Creighton University and the Women's Fund of Omaha found that there are 900 individuals for sale online every month in Nebraska--almost all of them female.  Our government has a responsibility to stand up and do something to protect women and children from exploitation. Fighting the horrific scourge of human trafficking is a priority for me, and it is a priority for the U. In 2015, we passed the Justice for Victims Trafficking Act, and it was signed into law. I was proud to be a cosponsor of that legislation. The bill set up a deficit-neutral fund to support trafficking victims. Through enhanced reporting and mechanisms to reduce demand, this law provides care for victims of trafficking and child pornography.  Importantly, the law also protects victims in court by treating traffickers as violent criminals. Labeling traffickers in this way means that convicts can now be detained while awaiting judicial proceedings. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act represents a strong effort by Congress to stand against human trafficking.  I am proud that, at home, Nebraskans are also rallying together and taking action to stop human trafficking. This past January, the Nebraska attorney general, Doug Peterson, launched Demand An End, a public awareness campaign to stop child sex trafficking. This campaign aims to build on the momentum from legislative bill 298, passed by the Nebraska unicameral, with significantly heightened penalties for those perpetuating and profiting from human labor and sex trafficking.  While I was a member of Nebraska's unicameral from 2005 to 2013, our State made several important legislative strides to address key policies related to human trafficking.  In 2005, the unicameral passed L.111, which established the Missing Persons Clearinghouse in The law created a centralized database with information on individuals who went missing within our  Known as Jason's Law for an Omaha young man who went missing in 2001, L.111 was an important advancement to ensure vital information sharing and to prevent the missing from becoming anonymous.  Additionally, in 2012, the unicameral passed the L.1145 to increase penalties for human trafficking and establish a task force to examine issues in Nebraska pertaining to human trafficking, including its scope, possible solutions, and how to assist trafficking survivors. Most recently, I am proud to have joined the ``Demand an End'' campaign and offer my support of AG Peterson's work on this front.  Now is the time to build on these collective efforts and be responsive at the Federal level to stop this evil.  That brings me to the legislation before us today, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, or I am grateful for the hard work of the Senator from Ohio and the Senate Commerce Committee in making it possible for us to be having this conversation today. Not only did this legislation pass committee, but it received a unanimous vote.

He guided Nebraska during a tough farm economy in the 1970s, but he always looked ahead and supported others. Governor Thone led by example, and he empowered and encouraged others. He was a mentor to a Nebraska woman named Kay Orr, who became his chief of staff and then went on to be the first woman Governor of Governor Orr, herself, has said she would not have been Governor had it not been for the opportunities Governor Thone had given her along the way.  The legacy of service and the mark Governor Thone left on Nebraska will never be forgotten. The motto that he held so dear, ``accentuate the positive,'' was a good one. It reminds us to find the good in every person and every moment. His positivity made Nebraska a better place both while he served and afterward as he worked in his community. Governor Thone served the State of Nebraska with dignity. He was an exemplary public servant and a dear friend to my father and to me.

1328,topic-id,1163,"Mr.President, I rise today in support of the bill before us, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection This bill is a product of a multiyear, bipartisan process. It is the result of stakeholder input, multiple legislative hearings, a committee markup, and a committee report.  There are a lot of great provisions in this bill, but what I would like to focus on today is what this bill will accomplish for smaller financial institutions--our community banks and our credit unions--especially in the State of I also want to touch on the important regulatory relief included for small public housing agencies that are in Nebraska and all across this country.  Over the course of the past year, I received an overwhelming amount of positive feedback from people and businesses across Nebraska about this bill, but the outpouring of support from community banks and credit unions has been particularly notable. These institutions are the pillars of our local communities. They sponsor local Little League sports teams. They provide scholarship funds. They award grants to students.  The prosperity of America's small financial institutions is directly tied to the success of the communities they serve. These institutions, from Eastern Nebraska to the Panhandle, have shared with me their support for this bill we have before us today. For example, Lee Potts from Security Bank in Laurel, NE, wrote:       The bill is a step in the right direction to remove ill-     fitting regulations on community banks. As a lender in my      community, I am not against regulations in general, as there      is a need for certain regulations. However, the regulatory      spectrum has become so burdensome that it often has affected      otherwise creditworthy borrowers in my community.  Brandon Luetkenhause from the Nebraska Credit Union League cited the positive effect this legislation will have on seniors in America's communities. He wrote:       This bipartisan, commonsense reform legislation will      protect seniors from elder abuse, make mortgage processing      easier and quicker, increase affordable rental housing in our      communities, and help my credit union provide better service      to members.  Under this legislation, well-managed, well-capitalized community banks with less than $3 billion in total assets would qualify for an 18-month exam cycle that is currently only available for banks with less than $1 billion in total assets.  Furthermore, the legislation allows banks with less than $5 billion in total assets to use short form call reports in the first and the third quarters of the year. The quarterly call report community banks currently have to file comprises 80 pages of forms and 670 pages of instructions. Only a fraction of the information that is collected is actually useful to regulators in ensuring safety and soundness of these institutions. The minimal impact is far outweighed by the expense incurred and the staff hours dedicated to collecting it.  The legislation also increases the appraisal requirement exemption for rural mortgage portfolio loans from $250,000 to $400,000. This provision of the bill reflects that in rural markets, it can be hard to find an independent appraiser. They may live hours away, and it could take weeks for them to come and appraise a property. This slows down and adds cost to the transaction, where a bank has 100 percent of the risk associated with that loan.  Simply put, provisions like these in the bill help provide relief to Main Street lenders who did nothing to cause the financial crisis and have been unfairly burdened under Dodd- For example, Alan Emshoff from Generations Bank in Exeter, NE, told me:       This bill is a solid step towards right-sizing regulations.      As one of the smallest banks in Nebraska, reducing the      regulatory burden will allow us to do what we do best, to      serve our community through the making of loans to help start      new businesses, finance agriculture, and put people in homes      more efficiently and at a lower cost to the consumer. . . .      Even with reduced regulation, we will continue to respect the      safety of our customers and provide all of our customers a      safe and sound banking environment, just as we have for the      past 80 plus years.  Steve Edgerton from Centrist Federal Credit Union in Omaha wrote me:       The increasing trend of regulation ultimately reduces the      availability of products and services to credit union      members, as well as increases the cost.  Clearly, any claims that this bill only provides relief to big banks are not true.  In addition to the great regulatory relief provisions for community banks and credit unions, I was very pleased to see provisions from my bill with Senator Tester, the Small Public Housing Agency Opportunity Act, included in this legislation. Our bill would address the overwhelming administrative burden that has been placed on the roughly 3,800 small and rural housing authorities across the country, including the approximately 100 public housing agencies in the State of The provisions included from our bill will simplify the inspection and compliance requirements facing public housing agencies with fewer than 550 units.  Specifically, it would limit HUD inspections of housing and voucher units to once every 3 years unless a small PHA is classified as troubled. The less time Directors and employees of small public housing agencies are required to spend complying with unnecessary reporting and oversight demands, the more time they can spend improving the lives of their residents.  The bill we are considering today is good policy. It is a major step in the right direction, but there is more we can do.  Since 2013, I have called for Congress to consider changing the CFPB's leadership structure. For the past three Congresses, I have introduced legislation to change the leadership structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from a single Director to a multimember, bipartisan board or commission.  Although consumers and the industry have experienced some relief under Director Mulvaney, a problem remains--the Bureau's unaccountable leadership[[Page S1418]]structure. A bipartisan board of directors would increase transparency, provide regulatory certainty, and guarantee input from multiple stakeholders with various points of view.  I do not view this as a partisan issue and neither do A poll in March of 2017 found that 58 percent of those surveyed support a bipartisan commission, including a majority of Republicans, a majority of Democrats, and a majority of Independents who were surveyed.  Given our success working together on this bill before us today, I hope some of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle will consider joining my bill so we can reform that structure of the  I would like to close by thanking Chairman Crapo and the other cosponsors of the bill for their hard work on this legislation.

Moreover, I thank the overwhelming bipartisan majority of the House, who, just last week, supported the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act, and proved emphatically that right to try is about more than politics. It is about hope.  Each year, thousands of Americans receive a life-altering diagnosis of a terminal illness. Even with the amazing work done in American medical research and development, for too many families, access to these potentially lifesaving treatments will come too late or not at all.                              {time}  1315  As their Representatives, we should each endeavor to support these individuals in their time of need, as well as support new pathways to potentially lifesaving treatment. That is what right to try is all about.  For those patients caught between traditional drug approval delays, a clinical trial process for which they do not qualify and limited time, right to try simply establishes the freedom for patients and their doctors to try therapies where the benefits far outweigh the risks. It gives them the option of trying to save their life.  Although the FDA has a program that allows terminal patients to apply for early access to a promising treatment, right to try is needed because the FDA compassionate use process doesn't help enough people. Moreover, the application process is complicated, time consuming, and expensive. Only about 1,200 people each year can make it through the application process.  In 2014, more than 12,000 people in France were using investigational[[Page H1742]]treatments through that government's equivalent program. If a country with one-fifth the population of the United States can help 900 percent more people then the FDA's plan, clearly, is not working.  In Australia, doctors are allowed to work directly with drug and device manufacturers to provide investigational treatments to terminal patients without the government's approval. They simply must report to the government at some point that the patient received the drug. No permission slip is required.  This bill requires robust informed consent between the patient, doctor, and manufacturer, while requiring notification be given to the FDA after an unapproved drug becomes available to an eligible patient and requires doctors and manufacturers to report adverse events to the  Mr.Speaker, when a life hangs in the balance, the Federal Government should not stand in the way of access to these potential treatments.

Yet it is a hard point to argue after watching the Senate squander the best opportunity we have had in a long time to pass legislation to protect young immigrants who are impacted by an uncertain future of the DACA Program and to strengthen security along the border.

I truly believe he wanted this process to provide the necessary dialogue so as to deliver an effective bipartisan solution. I am certainly not alone in my efforts to forge genuine consensus on these subjects. There are a lot of Senators on both sides of the aisle who want to fix this problem. Unfortunately, as too often happens, the siren call of politics brought too many of us back into partisan trenches and blocked any hope of real results.  There are teachers and students and members of the military who are DACA recipients. They are friends and colleagues who represent the very best ideas of They are hard workers and productive members of their families and communities. They don't have the luxury of being able to admit defeat and move on to the next topic.  Likewise, those of us from border States, like Arizona, know that law enforcement officers who are tasked with patrolling the borders and protecting our neighborhoods just can't give up and go home. We have neighbors and family members who simply cannot shrug off failure and accept the status quo when it comes to securing the border.  That is why I have introduced legislation to extend DACA protections for 3 years and to provide 3 years of increased funding for border security. I am the first to admit that this is far from a perfect solution, but it does provide a temporary fix to these crucial problems. It begins the process of improving border security, and it ensures that DACA recipients will not lose protections and be left to face potential deportation.

That is why, if this measure is blocked again today, I will be returning to the Senate floor repeatedly until we can pass some sort of solution. To put it as bluntly as possible, it is simply not something we can ignore any longer.  I would like to again thank Senator Heitkamp for joining me as a cosponsor of this bill. She has always been a valuable ally in bipartisan efforts to secure the border and to pass other immigration reform measures. We may not be able to deliver a permanent solution for these problems at this time, but we can't abdicate the responsibility of Congress to, at one point, solve them. There are many people whose lives and well-being depend on our ability to deliver meaningful results.  Therefore, Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar 300, H.1551. I further ask that the Flake substitute amendment at the desk be considered and agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.

1480,topic-id,587,"Mr.President, when these ill-conceived tariffs were announced last week, I said I would introduce legislation that would immediately nullify this very unfortunate exercise in protectionism before it could wreak havoc on our economy.  If implemented, these tariffs will do just what tariffs have always done. They will lead to job losses and will stymie economic growth. What is worse, the President's attempt at flexibility in the form of poorly defined exceptions only serves to harm the economy further by creating uncertainty. Tariffs are bad enough on their own; tariffs married with uncertainty are even worse.  Can you imagine the President saying one day, ``Well, I think that Australia is moving in ways that we think are good in this area or that, so I am going to lessen the tariffs that we impose on steel and aluminum for Australia''? The next day it is ``If it does this or that that is unrelated to these tariffs, I might lift tariffs or lessen the burden of tariffs on that country.'' Yet, a week later, if Brazil makes another move, the President might seek to reimpose or to make the burden heavier. That simply doesn't work if you are trying to achieve economic growth and if you are trying to convince countries to enter into trade partnerships with you. Particularly when you are dealing with our allies, that is no way to treat your allies.  I understand free trade is sometimes a challenge. I understand that it is a challenge on the campaign trail, certainly. It is often easier to point to a shuttered factory and blame trade or immigration or some other convenient scapegoat other than what is usually the case--modernization or mechanization or something that has meant that we have increased productivity or simply the best allocation capital in order to facilitate trade.  We have to aggressively negotiate both bilateral and multilateral trade deals if we are to catch up. If we fail to do this and continue to withdraw from the global marketplace, we are going to be left far behind. We saw this with regard to the Trans-Pacific We pulled out of those negotiations, and the other 11 countries involved simply went on their own and left us behind. That has meant, in particular, countries in Southeast Asia, which would like to be a part of our trade orbit, have had no choice but to be more reliant on That doesn't serve our interests at all.  We have to remember we represent just 20 percent of the world's economic output. We represent just 5 percent of the world's population or just less than that. If we don't trade, we don't grow. You can be pro-growth or you can be pro-tariff, but you can't be both.  Those who have reservations about these tariffs ought to support this legislation that I am introducing today to[[Page S1633]]nullify the tariffs. Those who have expressed admiration for free trade or supply-side economics ought to support this bill as well. Those who are happy with the economic growth that we have recently achieved and are interested in seeing it continue ought to support this bill. We now have a better climate for economic growth on both the regulatory side and the tax side. If we enter a trade war, we risk reversing those gains we have made.  We in Congress cannot be complicit as this administration courts economic disaster in this fashion. I urge my colleagues to join me in exercising our constitutional oversight and to invalidate these irresponsible tariffs.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-12-pt1-PgS1632.txt,1633,"ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, MARCH 8, 2018",2018.0,12.0,March

That is what we do. That is our purpose. Marines kick in the door and kill the bad guys. I know because that is what I had to do in My platoon fought door-to-door against deadly insurgents. For this mission, the Marine Corps issued me an M-16  The M-16 is a weapon designed with exquisite precision for the singular purpose of killing as many people as possible in the shortest amount of time. It is not for deer hunting. It is for killing people.  The original M-16 was relentlessly refined to take enemy lives in combat. But you might know the version available in stores called an AR-15. Republicans and their bosses at the NRA believe almost anyone should be able to carry this weapon of war. That is right. Republicans honestly believe that this killing machine has a place in our communities. They think that a weapon very similar to one I carried in Al Anbar belongs on the streets of  That is idiotic, and I will explain why.  Republicans aren't just ignoring the voices of the thousands of victims. They are also denying basic physics. Because a round from an AR-15 is larger and leaves the muzzle traveling faster, it will impact the body without about three times more energy than a bullet from a handgun.  Surgeons treating the Parkland victims described organs that looked like ``overripe melons smashed by a sledgehammer.'' They talk about exit wounds as big as oranges. They recount opening bodies of these children, hoping to stem the bleeding, and discovering that, as one doctor put it, ``there was nothing left to repair.''  And here is the thing: that is not an unexpected outcome. Delivering fatal wounds that no surgeon can fix is the whole point of these weapons. That is precisely why they were given to us in combat.  The AR-15 also has a standard magazine of 30 rounds. Those 30 rounds are necessary if you are putting down suppressive fire or engaging insurgents. They are not very useful when you are hunting deer.  Mr.Speaker, I can confidently say that if you need more than a handful of shots to put down the deer, you are probably the problem, not the weapon.  In addition, the AR-15 has a significantly faster effective rate of fire than a bolt-action hunting rifle or a handgun. That means you can shoot more people in less time. That means police officers responding to the scene of a shooting will be outgunned and outmatched. That means more children will die in the classrooms before help can arrive.  I went through literally thousands of hours of training to become a marine. It was arduous and grueling. I was taught how to clean and care for my weapon. I had to pass a rigorous marksmanship test. I was only armed after I earned the privilege and responsibility for that weapon.  In contrast, my Republican friends think anyone should be able to walk into a sporting goods store anywhere in America and walk out with an AR-15.  When children are slaughtered in their classrooms, we respond with thoughts and prayers instead of smarter policies or stronger laws. We are asked to simply accept this bloodshed as an unavoidable fact of American life.  Not anymore.  How about this? Let's reform our background check system. Let's ban assault rifles and keep weapons of war out of our communities. Then, if people are truly desperate to fire those types of weapons, they can do what I did: go to www.marines.mil and enlist.

1580,topic-id,4207,"Mr.Speaker, I see my colleagues from the great South[[Page H1422]]are here, and they should be listening very carefully as we discuss infrastructure. I might like to draw the attention of the House to this, if I might, a fellow that we know etched in marble at the FDR Memorial: ``The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much''--keep in mind the tax bill that passed here and was signed by the President in ``The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.''  These are words to legislate by, wouldn't you say?  So I ask my colleagues to please keep this in mind and not leave right in the middle of a good discussion. If we are to pay attention to what is important here, keep in mind those who have little.  It turns out that the great tax cut was probably best described by the Shortly after he signed the bill, he went down to his Mar-a-Lago club and told his friends who had gathered there, all of whom were the great beneficiaries of that tax cut: I have made you so much more wealthy.  Indeed, that is exactly what the tax cut did. It made the wealthy in America even more wealthy to the tune of several hundred billion dollars. The American corporations saw their tax rate fall from 35 to 20 percent, and the top income earners in America saw their tax rate go down by 2\1/2\ percent. It was marvelous if you have a great deal of money, because 80 percent-plus of the $1.5 trillion--perhaps more--of the benefits went to the top 10 percent: American corporations and the superwealthy.  Is there such a thing as trickle-down economics? Is there really a probability that the superwealthy are going to buy more cars and build new homes--palatial palaces--in America with all of the new money that they received? The answer is probably not in America but probably on some island somewhere where they can use the new tax breaks for foreign investment that are in this tax bill.  Oh, they were going to close the loopholes for corporations and individuals who wanted to go offshore. No, it didn't happen. Instead, new offshore tax advantages are created for American corporations.  Were inversions eliminated? Corporate inversions are not eliminated. They are, in fact, continued and increased.  How did this come to pass? It probably came to pass because there was not one substantive hearing in the Ways and Means Committee and in the Senate Finance Committee on the most important tax bill that has passed out of Congress in the last 25 years.  So now we live with this. Now we live with the situation where the Treasury Department announced a couple of weeks ago that the tax revenues for the 2018 fiscal year--that is now--are down by a couple of hundred billion dollars.  So what is going to happen? When the tax bill was moving along, all of the deficit hawks--and there used to be, I don't know, a couple hundred of them over here on my Republican colleagues' side--left town in There was not one word about the new $1.5 trillion addition to the deficit. But like most migratory birds, they are going to come back when the weather warms up in Washington, and they are going to go after the deficit with a vengeance. I will bet they are not going to propose that we go back and clean up the tax mess that was created.  My guess is what they are going to do is go after programs. I think we know what programs they are, because the Speaker of this esteemed House has very clearly laid out in previous budgets that he wrote when he was head of the Budget Committee that he is going to go after Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--the programs of the social safety net.  I had a phone call just a few moments ago from a constituent in my district, saying:       You have got to understand that more and more of your      constituents are getting elderly. They are getting      Alzheimer's, and they need care. Their husband or their wife      needs respite care. What about the programs for that?  I had the answer. It doesn't look good, because we know what the Speaker said he wanted when he was chairman of the Budget Committee, and unless he is having an epiphany, he is likely to want it again. In fact, I believe he already said they are looking at cutting Medicare and  So what does that mean for the working men and women who are taking care of their parents? It means there are tough times ahead. It means that the proposed discussion about the reduction in Medicaid is $1,400,000,000,000 over the next decade. It means that $500 billion will be cut from  So, if you are a senior, you should worry. If you are among the working men and women of America whose father or mother is now a senior, you should worry.  The most expensive illness now and in the future is Alzheimer's. So what of Alzheimer's research? It is going to get reduced.  Oh, and that corporate tax cut for Pfizer? Do you remember how happy they were to have the extra $12 billion? Are they going to spend it on Alzheimer's research? No, they are not. They stopped their Alzheimer's research. Instead, guess what they are going to do with the money that they were investing in Alzheimer's research. They are going to use it, together with their tax cut money, to buy back their stock which has the marvelous result of increasing the value of their stock because there are fewer shares out there.  It is brilliant for the managers and for the corporate officers because their pay is based on the stock price. What a marvelous way to use the tax cut: end research on the most expensive illness in America, Alzheimer's and dementia, and instead use that money to buy back stock so that you can increase your pay as the corporate president.  Now, there is a good, American, capitalistic idea. That is where we are.  So today we had a hearing on infrastructure in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, a great opportunity to understand the President's infrastructure plan. It is big and it is beautiful, he says, and it is going to provide a gazillion jobs.  We took a look at it, and we said: Where is the beef? Where is the money? $200 billion over a 10-year period, $20 billion a year, said to be new money.  And then you look at the President's budget proposal and you tee it up with the infrastructure proposal, and you say: Wait a minute. What kind of shell game are you playing here? Your budget removes over $200 billion from infrastructure, and you come over here on your infrastructure plan and you say you have $200 billion of new money.  No, you don't. You really don't have $200 billion of new money. You have $200 billion of repurposed money in programs that actually devolve the Nation's infrastructure back to the States and the counties so that we will have a disconnect between an interstate in one State and an interstate in another State that connect at the State lines, and one is repaired and the other is not.                              {time}  1645  So infrastructure and transportation is a national network. But in this case, what happens is that the States are said to be given the responsibility and the Federal Government will simply pick and choose among those programs that the administration happens to like.  I represent a rural area. Sure, it is nice to have an extra $50 billion for rural infrastructure. That would be great.  But what is the definition of rural?  It is 55,000 people.  How much territory? Is it an entire State?  Well, there is no State that is rural, then.  In a county? In a multitude of counties? In a metropolitan statistical area?  We don't know.  But I will tell you that I do have a rural area. I have got two cities, Yuba City and Marysville together, with 100,000 people. Rural is 10 miles down the road.  So where is the line around this rural area?  I am concerned, particularly because the Federal Government will maintain control of that money. It doesn't go out by formula, at least as we now look at the language.  So it is a grand, a glorious, a wonderful, spectacular infrastructure plan. Incidentally, there is a small problem for[[Page H1423]]cities and counties. Presently, if the Federal Government is involved in a levee project to prevent floods, an interstate highway or one of the federally designated highways, or an airport, they will usually come up with somewhere between 70 and 80 percent of the money. That is all well.  Well, let's see. It is 70 to 80 percent Federal and another 20 to 30 percent local money. In the President's proposal, that flips. The State and the local government come up with 70 to 80 percent and the Federal Government comes up with 20 to 30 percent. The role of the Federal Government is diminished. It becomes the minor partner, and the State or local community becomes the major partner.  I had a meeting today with Hamilton City, a community of about 1,600 people right on the Sacramento River with a levee that is maybe good for a 10-year high water, but not for any extended amount of flood beyond what normally occurs. They have been trying for 30 years to raise the money locally to match the 80 percent by the Federal They did it.  Are they going to be able, going into the future, to complete that flood project if this program goes into effect and they have got to come up with 80 percent of the money?  It won't happen.  I would dare say, all across this Nation, with the possible exception of Houston, Texas, no community is going to be able to come up with 70 to 80 percent of the money for a flood control project.  This is a role that has traditionally been the Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal But, no. In their infrastructure proposal, this administration flips it over so that now the great burden lies with the local government.  ``Oh, that is fine,'' you say. Well, I think not. All across this Nation, small communities, rural communities, and even urban communities do not have the resources.  So here we are. Here we are in a situation where we had a massive tax cut that benefits the superwealthy and American corporations. The American corporations clearly indicate--not from me; go look at the Wall Street folks that have done the analysis--clearly indicate that that tax reduction, which is now in the pockets of the corporations, is not being used for higher wages, is not being used for the plant and equipment and new jobs above the 16 percent. The rest of the money is used for acquisitions and buying back stock. So much for trickle down.  Of course, how much can the superwealthy possibly spend? How much can you possibly spend on your McMansion? How much can you possibly spend on a fleet of Mercedes?  The bottom line of it is, when it comes to infrastructure, there is no money. It is gone. It disappeared with the tax cut.  Think about what could have been done if that tax bill had actually had hearings in which the Democrats could have put forth proposals that we have introduced in bills--proposals to repatriate the offshore earnings of corporations with a lower tax and then use that money for infrastructure. We would have real dollars for an infrastructure program to the tune of maybe $50 billion to $100 billion over a period of time.  But, no. No hearings, no amendments from No, not at all.  We could have used that tax bill to create infrastructure banks so that there would be a financing mechanism for those small communities around the Nation that needed to build a road, needed to build a levee, needed to build broadband infrastructure for their community.  But no, that didn't happen either. Not one hearing. Not one Democratic amendment to that tax bill. Therefore, we go into the great infrastructure program where we really need to do some things.  What do we need to do?  Some of you may have noticed just 12, 13 months ago the man-made creation of the biggest waterfall in the world, Oroville Dam, and the breakdown of the spillway. And 200,000 of my constituents had to evacuate within hours because that spillway, the emergency spillway next to it, was being overtopped by the river and eroded at the base and a 30-foot wall of water almost descended upon those 200,000 people. The number of deaths would be unknown, but it would have been in the thousands because they couldn't get out of town fast enough.  Thankfully, the rain stopped and the reservoir receded. Had it not, had it continued and the water continued to spill over the emergency spillway here, it would have been an unmitigated disaster.  Why did this fail?  This failed for lack of repair, for lack of maintenance. It is just one example of the thousands of dams in America that could fail. We saw this potential failure in Puerto Rico with one of the major reservoirs there. Fortunately, a third hurricane didn't occur.  Or maybe you are interested in bridges. This isn't a picture of a bridge to nowhere. This happens to be one of the main bridges on Interstate 5, an interstate highway system that goes from Vancouver to Tijuana, It goes down through Oregon, Washington, and It is the major trade route on the West This is about 7 years ago. The bridge fell down.  I could put a picture up here showing another bridge that failed on the Mississippi River, in the Twin Cities area. We could put thousands of pictures up here of bridges that could fail and have failed.  This is an infrastructure structure issue. Where is the money to rebuild this?  Well, it is in the hands of the corporations who are spending it to buy back their stock and to increase the stock price so that the corporate officers can have a higher paycheck.  Oh, did I forget to mention how generous they were in bonuses?  We are talking about one-time bonuses here. We are not talking about increasing the paycheck over time. We are talking about one-time bonuses.  I do like my San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, that so generously said: ``We are going to increase the pay for the minimum wage workers.''  Good for you. You are obeying the State laws that require minimum wage increases. Good for you, obeying the law. Take credit, if you will, but it is not out of the generosity.  Where is the money for all this?  It is gone.  What if we had a chance in that tax bill to talk about a program the Democrats have been putting forth for the last year?  It is A Better Deal for America, a tax policy that actually provides benefits to the working men and women of America and the families that are on the edge of poverty. It actually provides an infrastructure program that has real money--money that can be used to build the foundation for economic growth, money that can be used for employing people in high-paying construction jobs.  By the way, it is not at all clear--in fact, there are those of us who think this may actually be in the present infrastructure plan--all of the talk about Buy American, Build It appears that language in that infrastructure plan would do away with the Buy American provisions in highway infrastructure.  We can't let that happen. A Better Deal for America would be tax policy. It would be a program that would provide the education and training for the men and women who we need in our manufacturing sector.  Every 6 months, I do a manufacturing advisory organization meeting of manufacturers. Every time over the last 8 years we have met, they have come back with the very same concern. And that concern is: We need highly skilled workers.  How do you get highly skilled workers?  You train them. You provide the job training for those who have lost their jobs, for those who want to improve themselves.  Whatever happened in our high schools to technical training, vocational training?  It is critically important. The programs that are out there need this support. The programs where American unions have apprenticeship training are a critical way of building our economy. They are highly skilled men and women that earn a good, solid living as welders, plumbers, and technicians of all kinds. That is what we want. It takes money to do those things.  So what are we going to do?  I don't know how we are going to come back from this tax cut. It is not[[Page H1424]]going to be done anytime soon. But I know this: we are going to be really, really short of money. It has been estimated that in this current budget year, the deficit will reach $1 trillion.  I know that we are just weeks away from the return of the deficit hawks on this floor who are going to say: ``Oh, my goodness, the money is gone. We are going to have to make cuts. We can't have these kinds of deficits.''  I can hear them already. I hear the voices of the past and I hear the voices of the future. I know they are going to come back. They are going to go after programs that are absolutely essential.  We have got work to do. We have got things we need to do in  The American Society of Civil Engineers points out where we need work.  We got a D for how good our aviation system is.  Bridges, C; dams, D; drinking water,  Is anybody here from Michigan?  Is anybody here from the Central Valley of California?  Shall we talk about water supplies?  I remember when I was in college, you would never go outside the United States and drink the water from the tap. Now you don't go to the United States and drink water from a tap, because there is a high probability that it is contaminated. We have seen this story. We have seen this story in Flint, We have seen this up and down the Central Valley of  So what are we spending our money on?  Not on drinking water, not on energy systems, hazardous waste, or inland waterways.  Oh, this is a good one. If you are on the Mississippi and the Ohio River and you have got your tugboat and a fleet of barges, you depend upon the Federal Government lock system so that you can travel up and down the river.                              {time}  1700  If you are out there in the maritime and you are an international shipper and you want to go into one of the harbors on the East Coast, where is the money for dredging?  Well, it disappeared with the tax cuts. It is not there.  So is your ship going to run aground?  No, you won't let that happen. What you do is you will go to some other port.  We love to talk about Cuba, so let's talk about At Mariel, they are building an international port for the purpose of taking the new ships that are able to go through the Panama Canal, bring them to Cuba, offload them, and put them on a smaller ship so they can get into American harbors. Now, there is an American success story. We don't have the money to dredge our harbors, but we have the money for a new Mercedes for the superwealthy.  Parks and recreation. Rail systems.  Rails are doing pretty good, but not The President's budget proposes to cut Amtrak--to basically defund If you want to go on the East corridor here, if you want to go from Washington to Boston, if you want to take a plane, well, we know we have an aviation problem. If you want to take the train, I guess you are going to hop a freight train, because Amtrak isn't going to be around to run. That is the President's budget proposal.  Schools, D-plus.  Solid waste.  The American Society of Civil Engineers rate America in the D range. We should be so proud of the most advanced Nation in the world. No, I think not. I certainly wouldn't take pride in our infrastructure. But it takes money.  Where did the money go?  Well, it just happens I like charts.  The Trump infrastructure scam cuts more than $168 billion from existing transportation and infrastructure programs.  I haven't talked about this one.  Do you remember I told you about the flip--80 percent Federal, 20 percent local flipped to 20 percent Federal, 80 percent local, unless you happen to be a private investor. Do you want to buy Dulles International Airport or maybe Reagan National--excuse me, I promise not to do that. Whatever the name of that airport here is. Okay, I will say The Reagan National Do you want to buy it? It is up for sale, according to the Trump administration. And, by the way, the Federal Government will come up with 80 percent of the money. Not a bad deal.  Slashes Federal investments and passes the buck back to the local governments. We just talked about that.  We haven't talked about the environmental programs, the environmental protection programs that are significantly harmed, reduced, gutted in the proposal. The Senate is going to speed up projects. Hello? Does anybody around here know that over the last two transportation programs this Congress, with Democrat and Republican support, significantly reduced the time for an infrastructure program to be done? It is not 14 years.  The laws that have been in place now for the last almost decade significantly reduced the processing time for infrastructure projects in which the Federal Government is involved in, without harming the vital environmental protections that are out there: clean water, clean air, all of those things. Anyway, they are gone.  We have a task before us. I see my Republican colleagues anxious to get up and engage me in a debate. If they want to, I could yield to them, and we could debate the wisdom of what has happened here, but that is not happening.  What is happening is there is an alternative, an alternative that we put forth from our side that, unfortunately, was not considered in the tax legislation.  We are going to be working on the infrastructure bill. I dare say that the President's infrastructure program is going nowhere in At least it shouldn't.  We are going to have to find the money as best we can. And I have an idea. Over the next 15 years, we are going to spend $1 trillion rebuilding our entire nuclear armaments. All of the delivery system, all of the bombs, all of the satellites, all rebuilt. So will Russia and so will China, and we are in the midst of a nuclear arms race--well into the second quarter of a new nuclear arms race, exceedingly expensive and exceedingly dangerous, because the delivery systems are stealthy, designed not to be observed. That is a problem because that increases the risk.  Maybe we can use some of that money to build the infrastructure to educate our kids, to provide for seniors who have Alzheimer's, to care for the caregivers that are taking care of their parents, to build an infrastructure program that really gives America a solid foundation for economic growth, one in which the research facilities are the most modern and in which the most advantageous research is conducted. Maybe we could find, amongst our choices here, money to build a highway system that is worthy of this Nation, one in which there are not potholes every 100 yards, one in which bridges don't collapse; that we can build water systems in which you can take tap water from every fountain in this Nation and drink it, without a concern about contamination of lead or something else. We could do that. We could make some choices.  We can go back and revisit the tax scam in which there are specific inducements for offshoring American jobs. Maybe we can do that.  Maybe we can look at some of the military spending and say: Why does it cost $1 billion to launch a satellite with one system and $90 million with another system to do the same thing? There are things we can do.  And, most of all, it is time for a better deal for America: a better deal for the working men and women, a better deal for the elderly, and a better deal for the children. That is what we need to do.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-06-pt1-PgH1421-6.txt,1973,SUPPORTING HMONG VETERANS WHO FOUGHT DURING THE VIETNAM WAR,2018.0,6.0,March
1872,topic-id,901,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague, the gentleman from Florida (Mr.Yoho), on this day when we honor dogs that serve honorably, just like the women and men who serve our country, for putting on this Special  Anyone who has ever had a dog understands the depths of the bonds that can develop between human beings and their four-legged friends. I can remember every single dog that we have ever owned. I can remember how each one died. I can remember being there when two died. I never had the discipline or the opportunity or honor to serve with the working dogs that defend not just our country abroad, but also here at home. But as I say, of my time in the military, I am not a hero, but I have gotten to meet some.  In researching for this opportunity to honor those four-legged heroes and those with whom they work, I had the opportunity to read about some books: ``Always Faithful,'' a book about Marine Corps working dogs by William Putney; ``The Dogs of War'' by Lisa Rogak; ``War Dogs'' by Rebecca Frankel; and ``Sergeant Rex'' by Mike Dowling, among the most highly commended; as well as ``Unconditional Honor'' primarily by Cathy Scott,[[Page H1535]]which recognizes the fact that those of you watching at home, and this Record, might not contemplate, and that is the role that dogs play, not just on the battlefield and in finding missing people, and fighting crime here at home, but also when helping our servicemen and -women recover from wounds visible and invisible when they return to this country.  Indeed, thousands of servicemembers, welcomed by a climate that is shifting as it relates to service dogs, take the definition of working dog beyond the battlefield and outside of the field of crime and punishment into bedrooms and living rooms, and they help our brothers and sisters heal from wounds that most of us, praise God, will never be able to imagine.  As I think has been noted, at any given time, there are more than over 2,000 military working dogs with roughly 700 working overseas. These specially trained dogs can cost anywhere from $5,000 to $30,000 to procure and train, and about 30 service dogs annually are killed in the line of duty.  When I was in the military, we always looked with admiration upon the individuals who had the decorations and the pins and an adornments that very few people would earn. One was HALO wings. That stands for high altitude low opening. That is when you jump out of an airplane so high that someone couldn't possibly imagine that there might be someone inserting via this mechanism. Well, indeed, we have military dogs that insert this way, as well as strapped to their handlers via helicopter, and every other imaginable circumstance.  In fact, as I look at history, the oldest documented accounts of dogs either being used as accoutrements to defend their people or accompanying their masters onto the field of battle are almost 3,000 years old, and this is about as long as we can go back into documented written history. But tonight, Mr.Speaker, I want to speak briefly about a personal friend and hero.  In early 2006, Patrick Sheridan of the Louisa County Sheriff's Office procured Magpie Electric Potential from a bloodhound kennel in New Jersey and began working very hard with what I believe was the second dog that Lieutenant Sheridan would train. In fact, Lieutenant Sheridan and his K-9 team have become so successful in working K-9 operations and scent tracking, specifically, that they have tracked individuals on multiple continents and in multiple nations. And over the course of Magpie Electric Potential's, aka Maggie's, 6-year career, she worked almost 350 calls for service.  In 2010 alone, her duties ranged from trailing breaking-and-entering suspects and suspects in violent crime cases to helping locate a missing 5-year-old child before that child succumbed to the elements.  On December 12, 2011, Maggie and Lieutenant Sheridan were not engaged in chasing down a drug dealer or finding some horrific individual and preventing them from visiting domestic violence on someone once too frequently victimized, but, instead, searching for an individual who had been reported missing and suicidal. I make this point to note that these dogs defend the people with whom they serve and the people of our communities.  On this occasion, Maggie, while trailing again on nearly her 350th working call, encountered a pit bull and ultimately was attacked and succumbed to her injuries. Her end of watch on December 12, 2011, represents one of hundreds of working dog deaths just this century.  I, too, commend former President Bush for the establishment and the use of private citizen dollars to do such of a War Dog Memorial and hope that we will see something similar done as it relates to those working dogs who defend us not in the military, but in law enforcement here at home, not only by pursuing and apprehending criminals, but also by finding missing children and those who might harm themselves.  Mr.Speaker, I would commend to those viewing and to the Members of this body, when they find a dog handler or someone who had worked as a dog handler in the past, please say ``thank you'' for the dedication, time, and loyalty that is, indeed, reciprocal and unconditional because we need never fathom how many lives have been saved.

847,topic-id,171,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to draw attention to Washington inactivity that has locked up hundreds of thousands of acres of Montana public lands.  In the 1970s, Congress designated over 1 million acres of Montana as wilderness study areas. The U.Forest Service and BLM were charged with determining whether to include them in the National Wilderness Preservation  By the early 1980s, the Forest Service and BLM had made their recommendations, but Congress did not act. Now, nearly 40 years later, Congress still hasn't acted, and those study areas are still locked up.  Mr.Speaker, last week I introduced the Unlocking Public Lands Act and the Protect Public Use of Public Lands These bills will release nearly 700,000 acres of lands found to be not suitable for wilderness designation and return them to Forest Service and BLM management.  County commissioners, State legislators, and impacted communities support this overdue action.  Congress is about 40 years late in unlocking Montana's public lands and increasing public access to them. It is time to finish the job.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-06-pt1-PgH1380-2.txt,2359,"ECONOMIC GROWTH, REGULATORY RELIEF, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT",2018.0,6.0,March

573,topic-id,3375,"Mr.Speaker, it is always an honor to address this Hallowed Hall, sometimes more hallowed than others, but today was a bit of a sad day for some of us. The Federalist reported the headline: Congress Rushes Towards Spending Vote to Prevent a  ``Congressional leaders released a $1.3 trillion government spending plan for the rest of the fiscal year and asked lawmakers to begin voting on it with only hours to read and analyze the 2,232-page text.  ``The measure is wide ranging, with funds for fencing on the U.S.-Mexico border, combating opioid addiction and building new roads, along with incentives to bolster reporting to a database for gun-buyer background checks.''  I have got to assert, Mr.Speaker, that this fix NICS bill, as it's been called, leaves in place a practice that has been going on. It grieved me greatly that Republicans would rush to embrace this thing, which allows the practice that the Obama administration started that administrative procedures by unelected, unaccountable-to-voters bureaucrats could decide people were not, in their opinion, entitled to have their Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.  We have heard accounts of people who didn't realize that they were being questioned in a way that would be used to take their guns away and their right to keep and bear arms to protect themselves, to engage in self-defense, and the VA is the most notorious. Simply asking a question like, ``Who takes care of your checkbook finances?'' and answer anything like, ``Oh, my wife takes care of that,'' then a matter of weeks later, a letter is received saying you don't have a right to have a gun.  It is amazing that the Obama administration would start such an unconstitutional practice, and it is, to me, even more grievous that Republicans would participate in a bill that says it is going to correct a problem and make America safer when, actually, what it does will not make a difference in the mass shootings that have occurred.  But in the tradition of Congress, if there is a problem, too often people in this body feel it is not important that we do something that will make a difference; it is just important that we look like we are doing something. That is really where the fix NICS bill came into play.  It really wouldn't make people safer. It will add some restrictiveness, and it allows this heinous practice of having some bureaucrat at the VA just decide that a veteran who served his or her[[Page H2038]]Nation valiantly, qualified to use a weapon, can't have a weapon.                              {time}  1445  Forget the We are the VA, and we decide you don't get one. Rather egregious.  But most egregious of all, we have about half a year to go, and we just voted $1.3 trillion to be spent between now and the end of the fiscal year, which ends midnight September 30. Quite tragic.  And we are told, over and over, by pollsters that the American public doesn't want to hear about process, how laws are made, or if some rules are violated. They don't care about those things.  But the fact is, just like America and each State has laws, and if those laws are not observed, we hasten the demise of a Democratic Republic, this little experiment in self-government.  And when it comes to the rules of the House, when we don't go through the normal regular orders, it is called, which just means following the rules for how we pass a law, then the product is not going to be nearly as good.  And that is what we have in the bill that was passed today. It is really immoral. Going back as far as we are aware in North America, parents have traditionally wanted for their child or their children more opportunity, better opportunity, a better life, than the parent had growing up and going forward.  Yet, now for the last 50 years, we have had generations engaged in being all about themselves, and that includes my generation. Not all of us, but enough that we could pass a bill a month or so ago and then pass another one today that heaps hundreds of billions of dollars of debt onto our children, our grandchildren, that they didn't run up.  This is totally different. It is so immoral. It is totally different from what generations of Americans have wanted: something better for their kids.  Yet here we are. It is as if we go into a bank and say: I need a loan. Well, what is your collateral? How are you going to pay? Oh, I am not going to pay. I can't pay. But I have got all my children, got some grandchildren someday, and they will pay.  Well, what do you need the money for? Because I can't stop spending money. I just can't control myself. So I am going to have my kids and grandkids pay someday, because all I can do is spend, and that is where we are.  There is an obligation for each generation to be accountable for their actions to future generations. And there has been so much debt run up.  Of course, when I got here 13 years ago, we had crossed over into $10 trillion in debt, $11 trillion, and all of a sudden, in 8 years, we hit $20 trillion. It was incredible.  The biggest part of that hit during the 4 years where the Democratic majority controlled the House and the Senate, and those 2 years in which the Democrat majority in the House and Senate was also linked up with President Obama, a Democrat in the White House, and the debt exploded.  But when we bring a bill to the floor like came today, didn't go through regular order, it did not go through committee process, and I can't know for sure, I heard there were two, I heard there were four people negotiating. I heard that it was staff members who were doing the negotiation. And for heaven's sake, if we are going to have staff members negotiating numbers that involve $1 trillion that our children and grandchildren will have to pay, let's at least get better staff members to do the negotiation for the sake of our kids. It is really tragic what has been going on.  I was just reading an article a moment ago with a statement from Minority Leader Pelosi, in which she indicated they had won the negotiation, they got lots more of what they wanted than did those in the majority and than did the President himself.  Unfortunately, though the President is an amazing negotiator, he graciously allowed the House leaders and the Democratic leaders to do the negotiating. And I would encourage the President, I know he wants better deals than this atrocity, but we need his negotiating skills involved to get a better product.  This article from Chad Pergram says: ``With $1.2 trillion omnibus bill topping 2,200 pages, Congress needs CliffsNotes.''  I have another from Jacob Sullum: ``Fix NICS bill would help block gun sales to peaceful people.'' And Jacob Sullum is right about that.  This from August 11, 2016, they are pointing out that the background checks, which were proposed in part of this bill that passed in the House today, would not be effective. The headline says: ``Background Checks: Ineffective, unconstitutional, and dangerous.''  It says: ``Background checks were sold to gun owners as a bill of goods in the 1990s. But consider how ineffective, and dangerous, they have become to our Second Amendment rights:  ``Number 1, roughly 95 percent of NICS denials are `false positives,' which means most of the people who are being denied are not the people that want to hold up the neighborhood grocery store.  ``Number 2, for the last year on record, only 13 prohibited persons were convicted for trying to illegally purchase a gun--when more than 10 million guns were sold.''  Pretty amazing. Only 13. And this was back in the Obama administration. Of course, we know they weren't enforcing the law. They had the weakest gun violation enforcement of any administration in the last 50 years, all the while demanding tougher laws, gun laws and gun restrictions, when they were doing the worst job of just enforcing the laws we had.  So out of 10 million guns that had background checks and were approved for sale, only 13 were convicted of trying to illegally purchase a gun.  The article continues: ``And the inspector general's report in 2016 found that the Justice Department''--and again, this is during the Obama administration--``only refers an average of 32 prosecutions per year under the Brady Law.''  ``That is not surprising, since good people can be denied their Second Amendment rights for outstanding traffic tickets, that result in a bench warrant . . . for having the same name as a bad guy . . . or for having engaged in a bar fight 50 years ago.  ``Number 3, because of the NICS system, there are now more than 250,000 military veterans who cannot purchase firearms from a gun dealer--and the Obama administration tried to disqualify tens of thousands of otherwise law-abiding seniors in similar fashion.''  I want to inject here. Just because a senior citizen has his or her adult child take care of their checkbook, it does not mean that that senior citizen does not know when their home is being broken into and they need to protect themselves.  Number 4 in this article says: ``And what if you're blocked from buying a gun because you're illegitimately denied by the NICS check? Well, according to USA Today, the Obama administration illegally diverted every single one of its FBI appeal examiners to other duties, making it impossible for the agency to overturn people's denials and creating a huge backlog.  ``Number 5, every time a gun dealer contacts the NICS system and a background check is conducted, there is the potential that gun buyers' names will be retained--despite prohibitions to the contrary. This data retention and the potential for gun owner registration is a constant concern for gun owners, given the expansive backup system at the Not only that, the General Accounting Office found in 2016 that the ATF had illegally retained the names of thousands of gun owners.  ``Number 6, forcing law-abiding citizens to get `permission' to exercise a constitutionally protected right can result in harmful delays--and even death. Consider Carol Bowne of New Jersey who tried to get a gun for protection . . . was forced to wait several weeks during the screening process . . . and was ultimately stabbed to death by the man she wanted to defend herself against.  ``Gun control is denying the rights of law-abiding Americans, while not making us any safer.''  And that is the thing. We hear these constant proposals for more background checks. A proposal that is being pushed, we have got to have background checks when someone gives or sells a gun to another individual when that person selling or giving the gun is not a firearms dealer, they are not in the business, which means a father to a[[Page H2039]]son, or a mother to a daughter. This push to get background checks when, as my friend John Lott's research has shown not one mass shooting in the last 100 years has resulted from a gun that was given or purchased in a lawful transfer person to person. So that kind of idea wouldn't help save any lives.  If we are going to do something, at least do something that saves lives, makes a difference.  But we know that, in Rwanda, there was a horrendous period in which 800,000 human beings were slaughtered with machetes. We know that the worst attack with the most horrendous murders in our U.history, on our soil, happened on September 11, 2001, and the weapon that was used was a box cutter.  We know that the Boston Marathon bombing, in which people were killed and maimed, a pressure cooker was used.  We know that in Austin, Texas, a sick criminal mind killed two people and wounded a number of others.  There is a lot of talk about ending gun violence without a thought about ending violence.  Oklahoma City, that was ammonium nitrate, that was fertilizer, used as a bomb.  I keep coming back to the quote of President John Adams in 1798, when he said so prophetically and analytically: ``Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.''                              {time}  1500  That is really where we are. Do we want to end gun violence or do we want to end violence? Some of us would like to end violence. 800,000 human beings that are killed with machetes are just as dead as 800,000 killed with a bomb or a gun. Actually, they most likely suffered a great deal more than if they were killed with a gun.  A gun is like the law itself. It can be used to protect. During my 4 years in the Army, we were trained to use a weapon for protection of the United States and our We took an oath to do that. We were never in combat in my 4 years, but that is what we were trained for. It was not an assault weapon. It was a protective weapon to protect our country.  So when we hear all this talk that maybe it is time to again ban assault weapons, any weapon is an assault weapon. Any weapon is also a defensive weapon. It is all about the hands of those who are holding the weapon.  We also know for a fact that the years in which so-called assault weapons were banned, it made absolutely no difference. We also know that in cities where there is the most strenuous gun laws, you often find the most violent number of gun attacks.  The Wall Street Journal had an article some time back talking about the mentality of those who use a gun and kill and engage in a mass shooting. They said that almost invariably these are control freaks. Their idea, their thought is ``I have got to be in control,'' so they want to go to a place where no one else will have a gun. They intentionally want to be somewhere where nobody else has a gun. That is their mentality. They want to be in control.  It is not uncommon to have happen what happened in Austin, when the bomber there was about to be captured, he took his own life because of the fear they are going to lose control, so they take that one last act of control and kill themselves.  So will we save more lives if we let law-abiding people have guns and do what the Obama administration refused to do more than any other administration in modern history, and that is prosecute people who violate the law in trying to obtain a gun illegally? I submit to you that the latter is the best way to go. We are better off allowing law-abiding citizens to have the guns just as the Constitution intended.  Coming back again to John Adams' quote, we have suffered through a time in American history where people on the far left politically have been saying, in essence, there is no real right or wrong. What may be wrong for you may be right for somebody else, so it is all relative. There is no absolute right and wrong.  C.Lewis pointed out that it is like music. Although some people will come closer to singing the proper note, just because many can't doesn't mean that note does not exist. The law does exist, and some will come closer to following the law more easily.  The law exists, and it must be enforced. That is one of the things that has made the United States so successful, to become as it was, the greatest country in the history of the world--I would humbly submit, even greater than Solomon's Israel, because Americans had more freedoms, more opportunities, and more assets.  This is the first time that I can find in history, anywhere, anytime, that the number one health problem for a nation's poor was obesity. That just doesn't happen through history, but it is happening here in the United  If you go back to the founding, you had people, most of whom were Christians, but all of whom wanted to have a country where Christians were not persecuted for their Christian beliefs. Now we have had the Christian religion so slandered and defamed that, even by government entities, it has been called a hate group. Evangelical Christians--which just means these are Christians who so love and honor God and believe they are going to Heaven when they die that they want others to have the opportunity to go to Heaven to be in paradise with Yet in this perverse time, we have people belittling Christianity and Christian beliefs like has never happened in the history of this country.  I think a majority of Americans believe we have been blessed beyond measure because a majority of Americans did have an abiding faith in God Almighty, and you had a majority that believed that Jesus was not a liar, that He was not a lunatic, but that He was the Lord just as He said:       I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one goes to the      Father but by  So a believer in Christianity believes if you don't believe in Jesus Christ, you can't go to  So either Jesus meant what He said and He was the Son of God, or He was a lunatic, because that is a crazy statement if it is not true, or He is just a liar, like David  Yet now the perversion has come and the attack has come that this religion, the one religion that is completely and truly based on love, that God so loved the world He sent His Son, and His Son so loved the world He laid down His life so that anyone who believed in Him could be in paradise in the next life, that is being called a hate religion, and Christians are being persecuted.  For the first time in American history, America doesn't seem to care about Christians being slaughtered and a type of genocide going on in the Middle East of The prior administration made very, very clear that their priority was not the Christians who were being slaughtered by the thousands in the Middle East; it was Muslim refugees. And that is why there was such a tiny, tiny percentage of Christian refugees who were allowed into the United States when compared to the percentage of Christians living in the Middle East where the refugees were coming from.  It is a sobering time, and it only makes sense that, when we reach a time when Christianity is maligned, defamed, and persecuted, that it is a time the Bible talks about: Right is wrong; wrong is right. Those that try to hold to the right as God gives them to see the right, that, gee, those folks are said to be crazy, and if not crazy, hatemongers.  They are not hatemongers. But when we get into that period of time, it made sense. Priorities are completely askew, and the generation in charge thinks of themselves and does not think about what is going to happen to that generation's children.  When one thinks about it, and with the scientific advancements we have, we know that a heart is beating inside that little child in the mother's loving womb. It is a real person with a beating heart. Janet Porter and others have talked about, with regard to the Heartbeat bill: What happens if you see someone appearing to be unconscious, lying down? You run over and check: Is there a heartbeat? If there is a heartbeat, then you call the ambulance and you do everything you can to save that life.

1824,topic-id,314,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate the chairman's good work on this legislation.  In my district and in many rural communities around the country, wood burning stoves and heaters are a popular heat source, and an affordable one as well; and it is a renewable fuel. And I will tell you what: the person who utilizes a wood stove to heat their home is not a special interest.  The EPA's New Source Performance Standards for products like wood and pellet stoves and wood furnaces have raised significant concerns. This regulation sets forth an unrealistic and unachievable timeline for manufacturers of these products to come into compliance with the standards in time.  I have heard from manufacturers and retailers, like England's Stove Works in Amherst County in my district, that it is not that they don't want to comply with the rule, they just simply need more time. For just one wood stove, it can take up to 6 months to complete the EPA certification process.  In the meantime, the availability of wood stoves--the affordability of this heating source for my constituents and other people in mostly rural areas, but other communities as well around the country, is going to go up.  The BRICK Act, before the House today, includes provisions from a bill that I introduced along with Representative Collin Peterson, the Relief from New Source Performance Standards This provision is a simple one. It simply extends the time wood stove manufacturers have to comply with Federal regulations by 3 years.  Affordable heat is important to my constituents, and Federal regulations must take into account the real world needs and time constraints of the industries that make these products and must now develop new technologies.  I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this bill today to give this industry more time and ensure consumers can choose wood heat sources to help keep their families warm.

640,topic-id,1662,"Mr.President, I will be very brief. The first thing I want to do is to thank Senators Alexander and Collins for trying to work very hard to solve a problem that we can fix. There are a lot of things about healthcare that I don't see us fixing between now and tomorrow. This is not one of them. Healthcare is very complex. It is one-fifth of the economy. I think there is a better way to do healthcare than Most Republicans want to replace it. Most Democrats want to repair it.  We are not talking about that. We are talking about an island of agreement that will matter between now and October--what Senator Alexander and Murray came up with. You had bipartisan support. There are two provisions that allow flexibility in terms of the 1332 regulations and to continue payments to make sure that person who makes too much for a subsidy but not enough to be self-sufficient when it comes to healthcare gets a little bit of help. That is the plumber and the other people that Senator Alexander described.  President Obama took care of these people through Executive action. That has been found to be unconstitutional by our courts. Legislatively, we are trying to continue this program to help somebody whose premiums are going[[Page S1907]]through the roof but who are not eligible for the statutory subsidies and create a new level of help that will keep their premiums from skyrocketing and actually decrease their premiums in October by 40 percent.  There are a lot of things we can agree on, and there are a lot of things we can accomplish when it comes to healthcare, but this is not one of them. I can only imagine how these two Senators feel.  Senator Collins, working with Senator Nelson from Florida, added a third provision to the Alexander-Murray concept that makes eminent sense. I doubt if there is one Governor in the country who would oppose what Senator Collins is trying to do--to allow States to petition for Federal funding to help the States deal with the sickest people in that State by coming up with innovative, high-risk pools and allowing States to experiment with what works best for the sickest people in their State by accessing Federal funding. You can't spend it on roads and bridges, but you can use it for the high-risk population, the people who drive the most cost. I doubt if there is any Governor in the country who would say that this is a bad idea.  Senator Nelson thinks it is a good idea. Our most conservative Members in the House think it is a good idea. We have taken Alexander-Murray and added a third component that I think is an excellent idea. When you combine the three things, you can lower the cost by 40 percent for that self-insured person who makes over $45,000 and lower their premiums by 40 percent by  It matters a lot to the people described, and there are millions of these people who will not get a 40-percent reduction. They are going to get a 10-percent or a 20-percent increase, and already they are paying about 25 to 30 percent of their income just for healthcare. It is mind-boggling that we are where we are.  I will just add this and turn it over to Senator How did we get here? I think the desire to control the House and take back the Senate is overwhelmingly good policy. Somebody on the other side believes that if we can block this proposal--the Collins-Nelson-proposal, the Alexander-Murray proposal--if we can keep that from becoming law, these premium increases that are surely to come will fall upon the Republican Party and will give us yet another tool to take back the House and regain the majority in the The reason I say that is because I have come to believe that there is no other explanation, and that is sad. That to me is a real dropping of the Democratic Party in terms of the role they play around here.  We work together where we can. Sometimes we are wrong; sometimes they are right. Sometimes it is the other way around. But this is the one occasion where we seem to have been right up until now.  Why is it not in the omnibus bill? Because of Democratic objections. Last Saturday, we spent an hour on the phone with the President of the United States--Senator Collins, Senator Alexander, myself, and Congressman Walden--talking about this proposal, about how it would lower premiums, how it is good policy, and how this is the right way to continue to help the people in question. At the end of the hour discussion, the President said: Count me in. I want to help. I agree to the concept. What would you like me to do?  It never crossed our minds to call a Our concern was the We needed the President to call Speaker Senator McConnell was enthusiastic for this. We honestly believed that the problem would be in the House, with our Freedom Caucus friends. We asked the President to call the Speaker of the House, and Kevin McCarthy, and he did. The Speaker told him: We are for it.  I thought: home run.  Between last Saturday and now, what happened is that Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader in the House, and Senate Democrats have objected to this proposal, and the rationale is abortion. The language that is in law is exactly the same language that would apply to this legislation. The Stupak language applying to the Affordable Care Act, dealing with Federal funds and abortion, is still the law of the land. But under the omnibus approach, we are going to run the subsidies through the Labor-HHS bill, where Hyde protection would apply--no more, no less than any other Federal dollar dealing with healthcare.  Senator Alexander has done a very good service to the body. In the bill that we will vote on soon, there are over 100 applications of the Hyde language to healthcare spending at the Federal level. Apparently, these dollars don't make the cut. Why? They know that if we don't get this relief in March, in October premiums are going to go up, and they are literally making up a phony excuse based on Hyde protections. The reason I know it is phony is that, if they really believe what they are saying about Hyde language, they wouldn't vote for this bill at all because every other Federal dollar runs through the same system we are proposing this go through. If you really cared about the abortion issue the way you claim, you could not support this bill or any other piece of legislation that has been around since 1976.  Clearly, the Hyde problem is not much of a problem when it comes to every other Federal healthcare dollar. It is only a problem here. The only reason it is a problem here is that you don't want us, as Republicans, working with you to fix a problem that needs to be fixed because you are thinking of October in terms of your political future. You are not thinking of October in terms of people.  Here is what I hope happens to you. I hope you lose votes. We have our problems on our side. We will probably pay a price come November about some of the things we have done wrong. All I can say to my Democratic colleagues is this: The reason you are stopping this provision from becoming law is that you think it gives you a political advantage in November because of premium increases in This is exactly why the American people hate politics so much.  I want to be on record in March as being a Member of the Senate who works with the other side when I can, surrounded by people on my side of the aisle who are historically seen as centrists when it comes to trying to solve problems. There is nobody on this floor who has a reputation of being an ideologue. Senator Collins is a pro-choice Republican, and she is OK with sending these dollars through Hyde protections because they have been around so long. Lisa Murkowski is a pro-choice She was with us yesterday, saying that she is dumbfounded about this argument about abortion.  So play the tape later on. When the premiums go up 10 to 20 percent for hard-working people and there is a debate about why that happened, I want somebody to play this tape, because we have 24 hours to stop that.  Every expert who has looked at this says the following: If you do Alexander-Murray-Collins-Nelson, you will prevent a premium increase of 10 to 20 percent, and you will lower premiums in the next couple of years by up to 40 percent. I don't know what the day is. It is some day in March, but I have lost track of what day it is. Yet I am here to say, when that debate comes about in October, I want you to play this tape. We had a chance today to fix this problem, and the only reason we are not going to do it is due to our Democratic colleagues' decision to play politics with this issue rather than to solve the problem.  The President of the United States is for this. The majority leader of the U.Senate is for this. The Speaker of the House is for this. Every Republican leader is for this. The Senators on the floor who work with Democrats are for this. We are urging our colleagues, before it is too late, to change their minds and get this into an omnibus in a fashion so as to lower premiums, not to sit on the sidelines and watch them go up. So, when the debate happens in October, play this tape.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from South  ",CREC-2018-03-22-pt1-PgS1892-2.txt,2234,QUORUM CALL,2018.0,22.0,March

302,topic-id,637,"Mr.President, I rise today to express my strong support for[[Page S1861]]the online sex trafficking legislation that is before us today. Immediately passing and sending this measure to the President's desk will help ensure that children and youth are less vulnerable to human traffickers and others who would profit from this terrible crime.  This bill originally was introduced in this Chamber by Senator Portman, and I salute him for his leadership on the issue of online sex trafficking.  Last year, I joined dozens of my Senate colleagues as a cosponsor of this measure after working with the Commerce Committee on the title 18 language in this legislation.  Senator Portman, who chairs the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, introduced the earliest version of this legislation after his subcommittee produced a bipartisan report exploring the link between Backpage and online sex trafficking. Entitled ``Backpage.com's Knowing Facilitation of Online Sex Trafficking,'' that report was the result of nearly 2 years of investigation by the subcommittee's investigative staff. I encourage my colleagues to review the Senate report, which is posted on the subcommittee's website.  It makes a very strong case for updating the Communications Decency Act and title 18 of the U.Code to protect children as the bill before us proposes.  I, too, have made ending human trafficking a top priority as chairman of the Senate Judiciary One of the first major bills our committee produced in the 114th Congress, under my leadership, was the Justice for Victims of Trafficking It established a new fund, comprised of assessments imposed on convicted offenders, to provide resources to serve victims of human trafficking. It also equipped prosecutors with new tools to fight the heinous crime of human trafficking. Senator Cornyn introduced that bill, and I was a cosponsor.  Last year, I sponsored legislation to extend the key programs authorized under the Trafficking Victims Protection Our committee cleared this bill and a related measure that Senator Cornyn introduced known as ``Abolish Human Trafficking Act'' in 2017. The Senate passed both bills without a single dissenting vote last  These two bills would extend the authorization for a number of the victim-centered programs that Congress established years ago as part of the original Trafficking Victims Protection They also include provisions to promote greater education and awareness of human trafficking in the United  For example, the Senate-passed Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2017, which I introduced, calls for training of judges, school personnel, and Federal investigators so that they can better identify and respond to human trafficking victims. It would authorize the U.Secret Service to offer investigative and forensic assistance to other law enforcement agencies. It would establish an Office of Victim Assistance within the U.Department of Homeland Security and ensure that the office is staffed by trained victim assistance personnel. Lastly, the measure promotes coordination among and data collection by the Federal agencies that are tasked with helping human trafficking victims and bringing the perpetrators to justice.  The Abolish Human Trafficking Act, which I joined Senator Cornyn in introducing, ensures that victims will receive restitution, authorizes funding of investigations, and enhances penalties imposed for trafficking offenses, including sexual exploitation or abuse, sex trafficking of children, and repeat convictions for transportation for illicit sexual activity.  We currently are working with the other Chamber on a package that would include these two bills, a related measure introduced by Senator Corker, and the House-passed version of legislation to renew and extend the Trafficking Victims Protection Sending this package of four bills and Senator Portman's online sex trafficking bill to President Trump for his signature sends a very strong message to human traffickers that we will not tolerate the scourge of human trafficking in the United  I close by calling on my colleague to support the immediate passage of H.1865 without any weakening amendments.

To be clear, I have no concerns regarding Mr.Klitenic's capabilities or qualifications, and ultimately no intent of withholding my support for him as soon as this matter is resolved.  On November 29, 2017, I sent a letter to ODNI Director Daniel Coats and to Acting IC IG Wayne Stone noting disturbing allegations my office received that the IC IG was moving to terminate the Executive Director as part of an effort to significantly weaken the IC IG's role in ensuring consistent and effective whistleblower protections throughout the intelligence community. I requested that the offices seek to preserve all information contained in the Executive Director's office, much of which concerned highly sensitive protected disclosures made by individuals within the intelligence community, as well as allegations of wrongdoing against senior officials within the IC I also sought all documents related to the IC IG's efforts to place the Executive Director on administrative leave and pursue personnel action against him. At that time, I informed the Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that I would object to any unanimous consent request to confirm Mr.Klitenic until I received an answer to my letter. To date, I have received no response.  Since that time, the IC IG has indeed moved to terminate the Executive Director, and I have continued to receive reports that this process has been marked by significant irregularities, conflicts of interest, and ongoing efforts to ``stack the decks'' in hiring prior to the arrival of a new permanent, Senate-confirmed head of that office, who rightfully should have the authority to make such decisions. Moreover I have reason to believe these latest efforts may be a direct response to displeasure within the IC IG with Congress's exercise of its constitutional responsibility to provide fully informed advice and consent with respect to the President's nomination of a permanent If true, such behavior is totally unacceptable. It is an affront not only to this institution but to the President's prerogative to choose nominees, with the advice and consent of the Senate, to lead the agencies under his authority. On the contrary, I would note that there is no independent authority anywhere in the Constitution granted to freewheeling bureaucrats.  Based on these ongoing concerns, Senator Ron Wyden joined me in sending a letter on March 6, 2018 to Director Coats following up on my original letter and seeking a stay of any personnel action against the Executive Director until Congress has an opportunity to review this action and fully understand exactly how the IC IG is, or is not, appropriately administering the IC whistleblowing program.

The Grand Duchy of Lithuania controlled a large amount of territory from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea during medieval times. It later joined with Poland as the Polish-Lithuanian Then, with the partitions of Poland starting in the 18th century, it came under the control of the Russian empire.  In the wake of World War I and the Bolshevik Revolution, on February 16, 1918, representatives of the Lithuanian nation signed the Act of Independence of Lithuania ``reestablishing an independent state, based on democratic principles.'' Lithuania today holds true to those principles. This makes it a natural and close ally of the United States and other freedom-loving nations. In fact, the Lithuanian Government has become a particularly outspoken defender of democratic principles in the face of attacks on those principles by its large neighbor,  I would also like to recognize the Republic of Estonia, which marked 100 years of statehood on February 24. Like the United States, Estonia counts its statehood starting with its declaration of independence. Also like the United States, Estonia had to fight a war against an empire with a much larger army to secure its independence. Actually, Estonia had to fight both the German empire and Bolshevik  Germany gave up when it lost World War I, and Soviet Russia was pushed back by the new Estonian army, ultimately signing the Treaty of Tartu that recognized the independence of Estonia in perpetuity. More recently, the Estonian army has fought side by side with the United States in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Estonia is one of the few NATO allies that meets its commitment to spend 2 percent of GDP on defense.  I should add that Latvians will celebrate their 100th anniversary of statehood in November, so there will be time to congratulate them in due course, but I should mention that there are many connections between Latvia and  Iowa was partnered with Latvia in a civic education exchange program a number of years ago; a prominent Iowan, Chuck Larson, served as Ambassador to Latvia from 2008 to 2009; and we have a Latvian-American community in  Some people may have a vague notion that the Baltics are breakaway Soviet republics, but that is not accurate if you know your history. On the eve of World War II, the Soviets and the Nazis signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which contained a secret protocol agreeing to divide up several sovereign countries between them. The Nazis were to get western Poland, and the Soviets claimed the Baltic countries and Finland, eastern Poland, and the part of Romania that is now the Republic of Then both totalitarian governments proceeded to take those territories by force, although the Finns only lost part of the Karelia region after repelling the Soviet invasion in the Winter  The Soviets organized rigged elections and claimed that the Baltic countries voluntarily joined the Soviet However, the United States never recognized the annexation of these countries, and we continued to maintain diplomatic relations with the three Baltic countries throughout the Cold  The Lithuanian Embassy is still in its original location, and during the Soviet occupation, the Estonian representative to the United States became the longest serving member of the Washington diplomatic corps.  In 1989, on the 50th anniversary of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, citizens of the three Baltic countries formed a human chain connecting the capital cities protesting the continued occupation and highlighting the history of[[Page S1450]]how it came about, which was officially denied by the Soviet regime.  Vladimir Putin's regime continues to deny that the Baltic countries were illegally occupied and to insist that they ceased to be independent states when they were annexed in 1940.  In 2015, a member of the ruling party in Russia even initiated an inquiry with the Russian Prosecutor General as to the legality of the decision allowing the independence of the Baltic states from the Soviet Union in 1991. That decision was declared illegal. Since the entire 50-year occupation of the Baltic countries was illegal, the legality of a decision by a defunct evil empire is hardly relevant. What is relevant is that the current regime in Russia is continuing the Soviet legacy of rewriting history to fit its agenda. That is a form of political warfare.  Many Americans are now waking up to the fact that the Putin regime is bent on undermining Western democracies.  Well, the Baltic countries have been warning about that for years while leaders of our government were cozying up to Putin and playing around with reset buttons.  Estonia was the subject of a massive propaganda campaign combined with a cyber attack back in 2007 when it moved a Soviet war memorial to a less conspicuous location.  Estonia's experience of weathering a cyber attack and its strong IT sector have made it a cybersecurity expert, and it now hosts the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of  What Russia is doing now is out of the same KGB playbook it used throughout the Cold For instance, the Soviets planted articles in newspapers in the 1980s claiming that the United States created They then got other papers to pick it up and echoed the story via its own news agencies. This is exactly what Russia is still doing, only with more modern technology.  We have a lot to learn from all three Baltic countries, where the governments, the media, and the citizens are more sophisticated about identifying and exposing propaganda campaigns. The best response to propaganda is education and exposure--in other words, truth.  The citizens of the three Baltic countries fought back against Soviet distortion of history with historical truth and were able to reclaim their independence.  So today I want to recognize historical truth on the Senate floor and congratulate Lithuania and Estonia on their recent statehood centennials. I look forward to celebrating the upcoming centennial of Latvia in  These bastions of Western civilization and Western values in a tough neighborhood are valuable partners in advancing our shared goals of securing democracy and the blessings of liberty for our people.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-07-pt1-PgS1449.txt,457,TARGETED REWARDS FOR THE GLOBAL EDUCATION OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING--,2018.0,7.0,March

We have people who are terminal, whose life expectancy is measured in months, not in decades, and how do you make things worse?  I said last week, and I repeat it today, that if I--if, and I am not, thank God--but if I were faced with one of these heart-rendering situations, I would take any risk, including injecting monkey urine, if that meant I could spend a few more days, months, or years with my children.                              {time}  1330  I think many people are in that same boat, and the American people deserve a right to try. When we were doing our hearings on this, we had an Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health hearing where Lieutenant Commander Matthew Bellina, who graduated from Virginia Tech in my district and served in the United States Navy, testified before us. He said, in the conclusion of his comments: ``I know that it is probably too late for me, and I have made my peace with that. I need to know before I die that, if my children find themselves in this unenviable position, this Nation that I proudly served will respect their liberties and their right to make their own decisions about their medical treatments.''  He suffered from ALS, as I said. I have had three friends during my lifetime die of that: Ray Robrecht, my predecessor a couple terms back in the Virginia House of Delegates; Julie Mullins, whose family I have known for decades; and Mike Ahern, who was connected with the United States Senate through his sister. All of these folks were people who lived in Salem County or Roanoke County, and they all died from They were all brave people. They should have had the right to try to see if they could make an improvement for others.  Even more poignant are my family friends who lost both a grandparent and their mother to Huntington's chorea. I was their family lawyer. I did their will. I would like to believe, and I know they would have liked the option, that their mother would have chosen the right to try, knowing that, even if it failed, it might help another generation because, as you know, Huntington's chorea is a genetically transmitted disease.[[Page H1744]]  So I do not understand why people are afraid of letting people try who have no other hope, whose life is going to be cut short, without taking that Hail Mary pass.

832,topic-id,732,"Mr.Speaker, yesterday, I talked about immigrants Donald Trump doesn't really care for, like the Dreamers who were raised in the United States and are now vulnerable to deportation. Then there are the refugees from war and religious persecution. He doesn't really care for them either.  Let's see, there are the people from El Salvador, Haiti, or Africa--the people from shithole countries. Trump would rather deport than protect them. And he doesn't want them coming here legally either.  No, as we all know by now, Trump prefers immigrants from snowhole countries like Yep, you take a look at the Winter Olympics leaderboard of the countries that won medals and that is a pretty good list of who Trump wants to have here. Norway, check. Canada, great. Netherlands, okay. And we better add Russia to that, too.  President Trump has been blocking any kind of immigrant legislation because he will only agree to protect Dreamers from deportation if he can eliminate whole categories of legal immigration. And not just any immigration, but specifically the programs that are filled with people who want to come to the United States legally from Asia, Africa, and Latin  He is especially opposed to diversity in our immigration system, and among the programs he insists we eliminate is the one most often used by immigrants from  So Trump's immigration approach is pretty simple: If you are White, you are all right. If you are Brown, you are a little lower down. And if you are Black, just go back.  The other group of people Trump is particularly angry about are family members of U.citizens--yes--and those who are on the path to becoming U.citizens. He insists that we need to take away the rights of U.citizens to petition for their family members. Nope, Trump thinks U.citizens cannot be trusted to petition for their own family members, which is kind of strange because he doesn't have to look very far to find an immigrant American citizen who petitioned--legally--for Melania's parents to come to the United  According to The Washington Post:  ``The parents of First Lady Melania Trump have become legal permanent residents of the United States and are close to obtaining their citizenship, according to people familiar with their status. . . .  ``Immigration experts said''--they--``very likely relied on a family reunification process that President Trump has derided as `chain migration' and proposed ending in such cases.''  Remember, the in-laws are from Slovenia, and that country won two medals at the Winter Olympics, so I guess they are okay. It is okay, apparently.  Now, let us remember that the First Lady of the United States is here in this country because she applied for, and received, an ``extraordinary ability visa,'' which is often called the Einstein visa because we give it to Nobel Prize winners. But I guess we also give the Einstein visa to musicians and artists and runway models.  The First Lady's extraordinary abilities are many, I am sure. Now, I want you to recall that one of the issues in Jared Kushner's security clearance was that he owes so much money to foreigners, that some people might be able to leverage that debt into an application for another visa program just for millionaires and fat cats. Yes, in America, if you have $1 million, or you look like $1 million, you can get a visa. But if you look like a parking attendant or a busboy or a field hand or the king of Wakanda, in the eyes of our President, you are just not welcome in the United States of  Look, let me break it down from my perspective. This is not the country we aspire to be. My mother came from Puerto Rico with a fifth grade education, and Puerto Rico has never won a gold medal at the Winter But guess what?

1919,topic-id,807,"Mr.Speaker, yesterday was the deadline for the U.Congress to secure the futures of hundreds of thousands of Our constituents, who grew up in the United States, have been here at least 10 years, but do not have permanent legal immigration status and, therefore, are deportable, vulnerable, and exploitable.  And guess what? The cynics were right, and Congress has taken no action. There have been a few attempts, but the reality is that Congress has not passed a bill, and the opportunities for us to pass a bill are dwindling.  How did we get here? How is it that we always end up here when it comes to immigration?  Well, it has been a failure of both parties to act, to compromise, and to legislate. But let's be honest, the President doesn't want these immigrants in this country, and Republicans in Congress only want to do what the President wants them to do because they fear his tweets and the effect it might have on their voters in  The President said he loved Remember? He wanted to preserve DACA and treat them ``with heart.'' He said he wanted to give a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, and he told a group of lawmakers on national television that he would take the political heat and sign whatever bipartisan approach they were able to come up with, but he was lying, again.  Just like his conversations with lawmakers on guns after the massacre in Florida--also with the television cameras rolling--what the President says in public, what he does behind closed doors, what he tweets, and what he thinks from moment to moment do not seem to be connected in any logical way.  And when the cameras are turned off, the radical rightwing whispers their orders in the President's ear, and he falls right in line--whether it is with gun manufacturers or the anti-immigration nativists.  And when you cannot trust the President to have a stable opinion for more than 2, maybe 3, hours, it makes it hard for Republicans to figure out what will please him and make him happy from moment to moment.  Bipartisan proposals that could have passed the House and the Senate were brought to him and he rejected them, saying that he wanted to eliminate various types of legal immigration avenues used by people, especially people of color and people from the developing world. Without these massive cuts to legal immigration, the President just wasn't interested.  And we offered him money for his silly, mindless, stupid, dimwitted, racist wall, but he rejected that, too.  In the end, this is not about Dreamers, it is not about the wall, it is not about border security. Do you know what it is about? It is about a deeply held core belief of the President, and many of his advisers, that there are just too many people of color coming legally to the United There are too many family members of immigrants, unless those immigrants are members of Trump's own family.  It is clear that the President doesn't want immigrants who look like the diverse and colorful fabric of the world. And he doesn't want Dreamers who were raised in the U.alongside of our own children, who reflect the diversity of  Now, to be fair, some of my Democratic colleagues are just as happy about the injunctions in the Federal courts that are keeping the Trump deportation machine from fully engaging and going after Lawmakers--both Democrats and Republicans--don't need much encouragement sometimes to just kick the can down the road.  But let's not kid ourselves. Relying on the courts to save Dreamers is a cop-out, and a lot of people are left out if they do not already have And for the ones who can renew their status, we may be back here in a few days or weeks trying to prevent the deportation of Dreamers and lots of other immigrants if the courts change course, which they may.  So I will not let my colleagues in either party rest.[[Page H1376]]  For now, every person who has DACA should renew their DACA as quickly as possible for whatever time they have left. I say run, don't walk, to renew.  I have been here long enough to know that even when faced with an issue on which 80 percent of the American people agree--whether it is sensible gun control or preventing the deportation of children raised in America--it is the 20 percent of the American people who Republicans are listening to, and playing to, and tweeting to, and playing nice-nice with the White House to appease.

1811,topic-id,268,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to encourage Members to support this commonsense bill, H.1917, the Blocking Regulatory Interference from Closing Kilns Act, H.1917, also known as the BRICK Act, which includes provisions that will provide a compromise approach to delaying a regulation on manufacturers of wood heaters.  Wood heaters are frequently used by households in rural EPA's rushed 2020 deadline would raise the price of a new wood heater on those least able to afford it. It would also restrict consumer choice, as many currently available models may not be able to meet the 2020 deadline. H.1917 will not remove any regulations. It would simply extend the deadline to 2023.  Frank Moore of Hardy Manufacturing, located in my district, testified before the Environment Subcommittee in September that he and other manufacturers are working to meet the 2020 step 2 standards, but that a lack of technology is making compliance nearly impossible. In that hearing, Mr.Moore said: `` . . . we provide jobs for about 50 people with payrolls exceeding $2 million,'' and that ``even if a product can meet the step 2 requirements, I believe it would not be consumer friendly, durable, or affordable.''  Again, extension of this effective date doesn't remove any regulations. Extension simply provides more time for manufacturers to come into compliance with much stricter requirements. It is best for the consumers; it is best for the businesses; and it will not undo the regulations that are requested.  I hope that Members will agree that this bipartisan legislation is a compromise solution that helps small businesses and our constituents. I encourage Members to support H.1917.

80,topic-id,1078,"Mr.President, on behalf of myself and Senator Gillibrand, we rise to request that, for the 4th year in a row, the U.Government officially recognize the last week in March as the Week on the Status of Black During the week of March 26, 2018, as part of Women's History Month and in honor of the UN International Decade for People of African Descent, several leading social justice organizations will be holding events across the country to honor Black women's momentous contributions to our country and to shed light on the struggles Black women continue to face in American society.  Black women have long gone above and beyond the call of duty in their contributions to American civic society, particularly when it comes to voter turnout and political participation. They have routinely stepped up as leaders and bulwarks in their communities, sacrificing their own health and time for the betterment of others. Even in the face of grave oppression dating back to our Nation's origins, Black women have continued to stand strong and contribute to the well-being of families, communities, the economy, and our country as a whole. A recognition of the Week on the Status of Black Women would send a critical message that the government wishes to elevate Black women's role in history and contemporary society and recognizes the unique struggles they continue to experience today.[[Page S1942]]  Black women have played a critical role in this Nation's history and evolution, often with little thanks or recognition. Harriet Tubman escaped slavery and bravely returned to the enslaved South over a dozen times to herald her people to freedom on the Underground She served in the Union army as a spy, a medic, and the first woman ever to lead an armed expedition; yet despite this immense service to our country, we are still debating her recognition on our currency. A century later, Rosa Parks resisted the continued oppression and marginalization of her people. Before she was the face and organizational leader of the Montgomery Bus Boycott, she led campaigns against the sexual harassment and assault of Black women. The Week on the Status of Black Women offers us a chance to honor and uplift the sacrifices of Black women such as Harriet Tubman and Rosa Parks, who gave us so much and received so little in return.  It gives us an opportunity to add new names to celebrate to this list, for contributions that build the future as much as they ground the past. This week of recognition honors so many of whom we are proud, an infinite list at which we can only hint. It includes those hidden figures who did the math to get us to the stars--Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson, and Christine Darden--and the interstellar figures who have actually been there, like Mae Jemmison, the first African-American woman astronaut to travel in space; those consciousness raisers who provoked thought and progress in a country that needed to catch up with them, like Pauli Murray, who graduated first in her class from Howard Law and offered up the visionary arguments that won Brown v. Board of Education, and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, who has issued an international invitation to embrace feminism; those courageous testifiers who spoke out with such foresight, from Anita Hill's willingness to speak her own truth to power, to Tarana Burke, whose compassionate decision to say ``Me Too'' inspired and named a movement that is changing the world; those athletes and artists who inspire us with their unprecedented feats and the lyricism of their movement, from American Ballet Theater's principal dancer Misty Copeland to America's swiftest young icon on ice, Maame Biney; and those who hold and disseminate knowledge, expanding our horizons and our minds, like Monica Drake, who last year became the first African-American woman on the New York Times' print masthead, and Carla Hayden, a visionary librarian who is the first woman and first African American to lead the Library of Congress, the largest library in the world.  We celebrate that this momentous week gives us an opportunity to both enrich the historical record, and to enliven our future possibilities. We know that raising the stories of Black women in every walk of life teaches little girls to see themselves in all their full and powerful potential.  As we anticipate the future, we must also stand to recognize that, while Black women have dedicated themselves to bettering our country, they continue to face countless barriers to full inclusion and equality in American society. Black women are disproportionately subject to compromising health conditions, such as poor-quality environments in impoverished neighborhoods, food deserts, and a lack of access to basic healthcare--conditions that make them more susceptible to life-threatening diseases such as HIV and heart disease and which often make highly treatable illnesses, like breast cancer, lethal. Single Black women's median wealth is just $100, while single White women have a median wealth of $41,000; and White households have a median wealth of 13 times more than Black households. Even more alarming, around half of single Black women have zero or negative wealth, meaning their debt equals or exceeds their assets. On average, Black women workers are paid only 67 cents on the dollar relative to White non-Hispanic men, even after controlling for education, years of experience, and location.  Further, while Black women, especially trans Black women, are exceptionally vulnerable to violence, both at the hands of the state and at the hands of intimate partners, often they are not listened to or believed when they speak out. On all these fronts, we can and must do better, and we will.  In conjunction with the congressional declaration, a coalition of organizations advocating for the well-being of women and communities of color will partner to elevate the stories, histories, and realities of Black women's lives through a series of events entitled ``Her Dream Deferred''. These events will address a number of issues facing Black women today, including maternal mortality, sexual assault and harassment, political participation, and police violence through artistic expression and academic fora.  Exploring these issues and acknowledging the centrality of Black women to our history and social fabric, along with recognizing the uniquely gendered and racialized inequities they face, is critical as we seek to extend equal rights to all We hope and request that this year will be a continuation of years past in celebration and recognition of Black women through the Week on the Status of Black  Thank you.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-22-pt1-PgS1941-3.txt,2026,SOCIAL MEDIA USE IN CLEARANCE INVESTIGATIONS ACT OF 2017,2018.0,22.0,March

To address my friend who correctly cited that we were bringing this up: It is not so much to change the topic of the day. We don't have that prerogative. But we do have embedded in this rule the prerogative to bring a previous question, and that can be on any subject that we choose. What we choose to do is to prioritize things that we consider to be important. It would not have blocked this particular measure.  But the fact is, enough is enough. The President says he wants to fix this problem. The Speaker says he wants to fix this problem. We on this side of the aisle clearly want to fix this problem. So let's do it now.  Mr.Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule, on the previous question, and on the underlying bills.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

26,topic-id,1954,"Mr.President, the prospect of retirement has imbued me with a sense of urgency as I have never felt it before. With just a few months left in office, I have an ambitious agenda that I am committed to getting across the finish line, and with the passage of this year's spending bill, I am grateful to be several steps closer to that goal.  In my first Senate address after announcing that this term would be my last, I made clear my intentions for my final year in office. I promised to be on the Senate floor, early and often, pushing the most critical reforms of this Congress, and I have been. I promised a flurry of legislative activity from my office, and you have seen it.  Anyone who wants to count me out doesn't know that I have a dedicated staff determined to drive this old workhorse into the ground, and with the passage of this year's omnibus, our efforts are beginning to bear fruit. True to my promise in January to go big and to go bold, I have been hard at work over the last few weeks to include in this year's spending package a number of legislative priorities that will make a meaningful difference for millions of  I wish to thank the majority leader, the majority whip, the Speaker of the House, and their respective staffs for going extra lengths to help me attach several of these signature initiatives to the bill we will soon pass. Whether it is historic legislation to prevent school violence and improve our background check system or bipartisan measures to empower law enforcement and strengthen our rural communities, this omnibus encompasses a number of policy victories that will greatly benefit both Utah and the  Let me begin with the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act, or CLOUD This critically important legislation will create a workable framework for law enforcement to obtain data stored overseas while at the same time protecting providers from conflicts of law and encouraging other countries to strengthen domestic privacy standards. This bill is a win for law enforcement, for the tech community, and for the Trump administration as well.  Passage of the CLOUD Act is the culmination of more than 4-years of hard work. My first foray on this issue was the Law Enforcement Access to Data Stored Abroad Act, or the LEADS Act, which I introduced in September 2014. I continued my work last Congress with the International Communications Privacy Act, or Then, earlier this year, I introduced the CLOUD Act with my good friends Senator Coons, Senator Graham, and Senator  Among other things, the CLOUD Act authorizes the United States to enter into bilateral agreements with other governments to set clear standards for requests for digital evidence. Under these bilateral agreements, the United States agrees to lift its blocking statute on disclosure to foreign law enforcement if the other country similarly agrees to lift any such bar it has on disclosure to U.law enforcement. Moreover, the CLOUD Act requires that any order issued by a foreign government on a U.provider be subject to judicial or other administrative review before the provider can be forced to turn over data.  I am hopeful that the U.S.-U.bilateral agreement framework outlined in the CLOUD Act will serve as a model for future agreements between the United States and other countries. Expeditiously implementing similar agreements with the European Union and our other allies is critical to protecting consumers around the world and facilitating legitimate law enforcement investigations.  The CLOUD Act gives law enforcement the tools they need to keep us safe. So, too, does the STOP School Violence We started working with families from Sandy Hook on this bipartisan bill several months ago. They had some great ideas for making our schools safer including school threat assessment teams; anonymous reporting systems; and training for students, teachers, and law enforcement to prevent future violence. We engaged with stakeholders from the security industry about school security infrastructure improvements. These and other evidence-based strategies and programs to improve school safety formed the foundation of the STOP School Violence  We were refining the bill and shoring up bipartisan support when tragedy struck at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High This certainly increased the urgency of the legislation, and I[[Page S1924]]welcomed the help and advice of the families from Parkland as well.  I can't even imagine how I would react if something like that happened to one of my children, so it has been incredible to see these families from Sandy Hook and Parkland channel that grief and anger into unifying action. In particular, I would like to thank Ryan Petty, Patrick Petty, Kyle Kashuv, and so many other outstanding individuals who shared with us their unique perspective on the issue of school violence. Without them, this bill would not have become a reality.  Despite everything people like Kyle and the Pettys' went through, they came in with the attitude of wanting to find common ground and bring people together. These families from Parkland came in wanting to make a difference, saying this time had to be different, and very soon, they can say that they helped pass a historic bill that will save hundreds, if not thousands, of lives.  In the spirit of keeping young people safe, I am glad we were also able to get my Child Protection Improvements Act included in the omnibus. The objective of this bipartisan bill is simple: to better protect the most vulnerable in our society, namely, children, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities.  The Child Protection Improvements Act amends the National Child Protection Act of 1993 to make permanent a pilot program originally created by the Adam Walsh This program ensures that organizations that serve children, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities have access to FBI fingerprint background checks for their employees, volunteers, and coaches. My hope is that this bill, which is broadly supported by youth-serving organizations and law enforcement groups, will save many lives and better protect those who cannot protect themselves. Giving permanency to this background check program is an important step in keeping children and the defenseless safe from violent criminals and sexual predators who might otherwise slip through the cracks.  Also among our Nation's most vulnerable are those struggling with addiction to opioids. Opioid abuse in our Nation has reached epidemic levels, leaving in its wake a trail of tragedy and shattered life. Few are immune to the devastating effects of addiction. For many, dependency begins with a painkiller prescription in the aftermath of a surgery or serious injury. Against their own will, patients develop an addiction to pain medication that leaves them craving more. Over time, feeding this addiction becomes increasingly difficult, pushing many to look for a harder fix. Some even turn to heroin, spurring a rapid descent into despondency from which few return.  To combat this harrowing epidemic, the omnibus more than triples the Federal resources devoted to the opioid crisis, allocating billions of dollars to opioid prevention, treatment, and enforcement. Moreover, the omnibus increases NIH funding to research new advances in healthcare and medicine, as well as alternative pain management options. My home State of Utah is a leader in this field, and this bill will give researchers the resources they need to continue to break new ground. In short, this legislation is a symbol of hope for millions across the country whose lives have been ravaged by the opioid epidemic.  In addition to helping Americans whose lives have been upended by addiction, I am also committed to helping Westerners who are struggling in our rural communities. That is why I worked long and hard to include in this year's omnibus a 2-year extension of the Secure Rural Schools program, or  The SRS program is absolutely critical to rural, forest counties in Utah and across the As the timber industry has declined in our country, rural counties with high presence of National Forest System lands face significant hardships in maintaining schools and essential infrastructure. Fortunately, with the extension of SRS, hard-working county leaders will be able to improve road maintenance, fund law enforcement, and keep our schools and libraries open.  The SRS program, as well as programs such as PILT, are a boon to families across the State of Of equal importance are our defense programs. Utah has some of the most patriotic people in the country, not to mention thousands of veterans and Active-Duty servicemembers. That is why I have always done everything in my power to support the warfighter, so I am pleased that this bill includes a much-needed 2.4 percent pay raise for our troops, the largest in 8 years. What is more, the legislation we are set to vote on today has the largest increase in defense funding in over 15 years, with a $61 billion increase over last year's levels. This is especially good news for my hard-working constituents at military installations throughout the state.  What I have mentioned thus far is by no means an exhaustive list of the legislative victories included in this year's omnibus, but also worth mentioning are initiatives to build research capacity at the National Institutes of Health; make childcare more affordable for America's hard-working families, expand TIGER grants to facilitate transportation projects across the country, strengthen the Economic Development Administration to bolster rural communities, and support evidence-based education programs for our Nation's youth. On each of these initiatives, I worked closely with stakeholders and everyday Utahns to ensure that their perspectives would be heard and their needs would be met.  I am pleased with the work we have been able to do on this bill. Like any compromise, it is far from perfect, but it's undeniably good, and I can confidently say that the bills included in this legislative package will have a lasting effect on the lives of thousands of Utahns and thousands more across the country.  Now, some have criticized the process of passing this legislation, criticizing the fact that lawmakers have not been able to read the omnibus from beginning to end. I take serious issue with this criticism. True, the omnibus is large, but every bill included therein has been thoroughly vetted over the course of several months and, in some cases, several years, so the assertion that we are passing a bill, the contents of which are unknown, is completely disingenuous. We know exactly what is in this omnibus because it is the culmination of all our hard work this This is a common vehicle for passing vetted legislation, and anyone who tells you otherwise is playing political games.  Let me just conclude by saying that, with the time I have left here in the Senate, I plan to leave everything on the field. For me, 2018 is not a victory lap but a sprint to the finish, and I plan to finish strong.  Mr.President, I submit this statement on behalf of myself and Ranking Member The provisions of the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.1625, showing the text of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, before the Senate for debate today includes technical corrections to legislation enacted prior to 2017.

I and Ranking Member Ron Wyden have asked the staff of the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation to make available to the public a technical explanation of this legislation.  The technical explanation expresses the congressional understanding and legislative intent behind this important legislation. It is available on the Joint Committee's website at www.jct.gov.

He was born in Pontotoc to a mother who was a school teacher and a father who was a principal. After graduating as valedictorian at his high school, Thad attended Ole Miss, where he earned both his bachelor's and juris doctor degrees. After serving in the Navy, he practiced private law in Mississippi for several years, but it wasn't long before he entered politics.  After serving in the House of Representatives, Thad first came to the Senate in 1978, just 2 years after my own election. The truth is, I hardly know this place without him, and I can hardly imagine what things will be like when Thad is no longer sitting here.  It is difficult to describe the special bond you share with someone who has been your close friend and partner here on the floor and colleague for more than four decades. Thad and I have been here through some of the most formative events in modern history, including the fall of the Soviet Union, the rise of American hegemony, the creation of the internet, and the coming of the digital age. As Members of this body, we have had the privilege not only to witness history but also to help shape it.  Whether as chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, the Agriculture Committee, or the Appropriations Committee, Senator Cochran has spearheaded some of the most significant policy initiatives of the last several decades. With an equal mix of healthy persistence and pure southern charm, he quickly earned his reputation as the ``quiet persuader.'' I know I speak for all of my colleagues when I say he will be sorely missed.  Thad Cochran is so much more than the senior Senator from He is so much more than the legislation he has passed and the titles he has held and the awards he has received. Thad Cochran is a fixture of American politics, a man synonymous with the Senate, who embodies in every way all that is right and good about this body--a commitment to comity, character, and respect.  I think my colleague Senator Leahy put it best when he said that Senator Cochran represents the old school. He personifies a generation of lawmakers brought up on the principles of bipartisan and compromise, and I believe that these very virtues have been the keys to his success as a legislator.  Even in recent years, as our politics grew ever more divisive, Thad reminded us that in the era of endless gridlock and perpetual polarization, there is no alternative to civility and healthy debate. Thad is always someone you could trust to put the good of others above self, someone you could count on to reach across the aisle even when the political risks were great. In so doing, Thad gave all of us a template for effective legislating, and he followed the model for decades for the betterment of Mississippi and the  I consider myself lucky to know Thad and even luckier to call him friend. It is true that this body will not be the same without him, but I hope we can honor his service by recommitting ourselves to the virtues of civility and respect every day.  Today, I want to thank my colleague from Mississippi for his example and his many years of friendship. I wish him and his family the very best.  Thad, I want you to know that not only will we miss you, we will not get along as well without you. I think the world of you. It has been a pleasure for me to sit right by you on the floor for all of these years, and it has been a pleasure to learn from you. God bless you, and just know that a lot of us are pulling for you in every way.  I yield the floor.

292,topic-id,1499,"Madam President, I am so proud to stand here with my five colleagues, but I also have to acknowledge the one who is not here; that is, Senator John McCain, who has been an absolute champion, along with his wife, on attacking this problem. Five years ago when I met Cindy McCain, one of the first things she said was, what can we do about this?  Working within the Homeland Security Committee, where so much of this work got done--both in the Homeland Security Committee and the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations--I can't say enough about the commitment of that committee but more importantly the commitment of the leadership of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, both Senator Portman and Senator McCaskill, who worked in tandem, who engaged their very capable staff, who did the investigations that led to the exposure of the issues and led to a bipartisan commitment to develop and pass this bill.  I do want to say that I know that John and Cindy are with us today in spirit. I know that Cindy is probably watching because she is very, very excited that finally we are going to get this done. This is such an important tool. This is such an important piece of stopping human trafficking, which has been her lifelong objective and passion. Today, we stand not just with our colleagues who are here on the floor but also with our great friend, Senator John McCain, and his beautiful, active, and wonderful wife, Cindy  The other reason I am very proud is that this is why I came to the Senate--to work across the aisle to address major issues and challenges, to make a difference in the lives of some of the most vulnerable human beings in our country.  We are here today on the cusp of passing a bill that will provide victims a real opportunity to seek justice and recover damages from websites that profited from their pain of being sold for sex, while also providing new tools to prosecutors, including my former colleagues, the State attorneys general, to go after these sites and their owners.  Again, I thank Senator Portman and Senator Blumenthal for their tireless work in trying to fashion the right mix of understanding the importance of the Communications Decency Act to the development of this tool we call the internet but also making sure this is not used as a tool for incredibly bad actors who would prey on the most vulnerable among us.  Driving this bill and forging a compromise was not easy. This was not easy. No one should think that this came together easily or that we didn't have many moments where we did our own soul-searching, those of us who are committed to the First Amendment and those of us who are committed to free access of means to express our opinions and do our business.  What I will tell you is that this is a big thing. This isn't a little thing. This is a big thing--not only because we are doing it in a bipartisan way but also because we are speaking on behalf of the most vulnerable human beings in this country.  I can't imagine a more heinous act than the sale of human beings on the internet for sex. It is happening in all of our communities. It is happening in our States each and every day.  When I began my journey to the U.Senate, I engaged and started visiting with my old friends in North Dakota law enforcement. As I have said many times, I am a former attorney general from the great State of North Dakota and have great friends in law enforcement. Their message was simple. They were seeing a lot more drugs. Obviously, North Dakota was experiencing an oil boom, and that was creating some social upheaval, additional crime, additional concern about crime. They then told me something I didn't expect: We are seeing this incredible rate and increase in prostitution. I thought about that. I thought, well, what does that mean, and how do we investigate it?  So many people would argue that this is a victimless crime and not a priority, and we started looking behind this. My colleagues in law enforcement in North Dakota started doing stings. They did something that peace officers all across the country do: They sat[[Page S1853]]down with the women they were arresting, and they started listening to their stories. The stories were heartbreaking--stories of being preyed on as young girls, either in their home or as they were running away, the stories of how they got in the life. Many of my colleagues in law enforcement began to say: These women are not criminals; they are victims.  We began to look at what led to this huge explosion, and we started examining all the websites, all the places where, with the tweak of a word or with the opportunity to be anonymous--in the old days, you would have to stand out perhaps on the street corner, but now you can be anonymous, and that gave those perpetrators, those evil human beings, yet another avenue.  That is when we started looking at backpage.com and other sites like it that sell human beings for sex. That occurs in every corner of our country--in the small and big States and in the small and big counties and in oil counties and out east in farming communities. So no one should believe that they are immune or somehow limited because it is going to happen there but not here. One thing we have learned is that it is happening everywhere.  Today, we are saying: No more. The Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act would crack down on these horrific crimes online and provide justice for victims. Today, it is going to pass the Senate with broad bipartisan support and head to the President's desk to be signed into law.  In many instances, websites help traffickers skirt law enforcement through online advertising and continue to do so without penalty by claiming their First Amendment rights.  I remember when we in the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations subpoenaed and had a chance to question the witnesses from backpage.com, and they started talking about their First Amendment rights. I pointed out to them that nothing this body can do can affect someone's First Amendment rights. They were not alleging or saying they were protected by the First They knew that wouldn't fly. They said they were protected by the terms of the Communications Decency  Like Senator Blumenthal, I never believed that the Communications Decency Act protected them from prosecution or protected them from civil penalty if they were complicit and, in fact, abetted these crimes. I never believed that, but there were judges in America who did. We met and saw a lot of those judges and read a lot of those opinions and said: We cannot let a law of the U.Congress--a law on the books in our country--allow perpetrators who sell children for sex to absolutely avoid any civil or criminal penalty. We cannot allow that to happen--not a law of this country.  We don't have the ability to restrict or modify the First Amendment in this body, but we do have the ability to amend a law that is being used inappropriately to protect the most hideous criminals in No law should put anyone above liability if they are actively involved and complicit in selling children for sex.  As we stand here today, we know we are doing something that we hope will happen more often in the We are standing for those victims, those parents, those children, those women who are still in the struggle of human trafficking, those children who are still in the struggle of human trafficking. We are standing with them today to say: No more. People who will illegally profit from selling children for sex are going to be held accountable. So the message needs to go from this body, it needs to go from the signature on this bill, that that protection you have been alleging--inappropriately hiding behind the Communications Decency Act--ends, and it ends with the passage of this bill.  I couldn't be prouder of the work my colleagues Senator McCaskill and Senator Portman did on the Permanent Subcommittee on You exposed the facts that led to the argument that led to the passage of this bill. I am proud to stand with you. I am proud to work to make sure that this bill is appropriately implemented. I look forward to the first prosecution of someone who sells children for sex on the internet, profiting from the web page they created.  With that, Senator Portman, thank you so much for your excellent work. Senator McCaskill, thank you for your excellent work. I stand proud with you today and know that we are making a difference today.  Today, the U.Senate will make a difference for the most vulnerable human beings in our country.  I yield the floor.

1214,topic-id,1513,"Thank you. I was going to say ``Mr.Chairman,'' but I guess at this point he is just Senator  Mr.President, I want to take a moment and personally thank Senator Crapo from Idaho for his incredible leadership. Frequently we are asked: What is wrong in the U.Senate? Why can't you seem to get anything done, even though there is common purpose; that is, to protect the American public, defend the American public, and help the American public be prosperous?  Frequently my response is that many times it is a lack of leadership. It is a lack of willingness to sit down, listen, and prepare a product that can get results. That hasn't been our problem with Senator He has been there personally every step along the way, not delegating to staff but working with us one on one--sometimes, maybe, four on one. He may feel a little bit ganged up on, but I think it was fair odds for him, I might say. I also know that this would not be here without the leadership of Senator Crapo and the Banking Committee, a committee that historically has a reputation for being notoriously bipartisan. I want to extend my great appreciation for his work and for his willingness to listen and to work with all of us.  What are we celebrating today? We haven't quite gotten it over the finish line, but certainly the vote we just had a couple of hours ago, which was broad bipartisan support on a cloture vote, is not something we see very often in this body. I think what we have to say is that this bill is a piece of almost old-fashioned legislating. It is a prime example of how Senators can work together to effectively achieve a result and do it in a bipartisan way.  Despite the Washington gridlock of partisanship, a group of us on Banking wrote and introduced this bipartisan bill through a good-faith negotiation, which lasted literally years. I have been working on this since coming to the U.Senate and being assigned to the Banking In fact, I have been working on these reforms since 2013.  The bill didn't come together overnight. It was carefully crafted. It was done not just with these regulators in discussion but also the Obama-era regulators as well. We know that we have an opportunity to do something that no one thought was possible--take a piece of legislation that didn't come through in rule XIV, didn't come through in reconciliation. It came through in the traditional way, through a Banking Committee process where we sat--and I will again applaud the No amendment was told it was out of order. No amendment wasn't given an opportunity to be heard or voted on. In fact, we sat for 7 hours and voted on amendments and listened to debate on this bill. Those people who think it came quickly are wrong. This did not come quickly. It came over a long period of time, through extensive discussions.  I want to talk about why I care so much about this bill. When I was going around the State in 2012, talking to folks who had opinions about the Federal Government, one of the things I frequently heard from my small credit unions and my independent community bankers and my bankers--in North Dakota, independent community bankers frequently tend to be members of the North Dakota Bankers They said one thing to me that really resonated, and that was: How is it that Dodd-Frank, which was supposed to deal with the largest lenders in this country, the largest institutions in this country--how is it that you have this Dodd-Frank bill that was supposed to stop too big to fail, and it has become too small to succeed? The compliance burdens are overwhelming. The confusion that we have about this--we wonder why all of this is on us when we weren't part of the problem. We are getting punished for being a financial institution and for no good reason, other than we are in a class that includes much bigger actors.  One of the things I would tell you is that this bill is critical to rural When you look at the challenges that rural America faces, access to capital has to be on top of the list. Plus, I[[Page S1354]]think all of those who have been to a Class B basketball tournament or a Class B basketball game can look at the program, turn it over, and what they will see is sponsorship from their local lending institution; they will see a part of the community. Whether it is helping host fundraisers, whether it is being involved in cancer drives, that Main Street institution of the community bank is there every step of the way. We are seeing more and more those institutions being challenged by things such as overregulation.  I want to talk a little bit about my hometown bank, the first bank in which I had a checking account and a savings account. It is a little bit of a funny story. The statute of limitations has probably run, but back in the day, in every small town, there was illegal gambling. I know, people might be shocked.  My dad put my name in a raffle they were having. That night at the stag party, I won the raffle. It was $30, which years ago was a lot of money. The first thing my dad did was take me to Lincoln State Bank to open a savings account. I put that $30 into a savings account. That institution was there, and from there, we had our first checking account. From there, I knew that my dad had a relationship with his banker that would help him through some tough times when he needed a little bit of extra cash and help him through times when he needed a car loan.  When we lose those local lenders, when we lose the ability of those local lenders to do business, that means the opportunity for relationship banking is gone. What do I mean by that? I have told this story many times in committee. You are the small town banker. A guy comes in, and maybe he has a shoebox full of receipts. He doesn't have a fancy cash flow statement. He doesn't have a fancy work plan. But you know that this guy has never not paid a bill. He owes nobody any money. That is part of his character--who he is. He never cheats anyone. He fixes the plumbing. He fixes the furnace, and it stays fixed. He doesn't ask for a lot in return, but maybe he needs a new piece of equipment. Maybe he needs a new car. He goes to the local lender. That may not pencil out. It may not be the best loan they are going to make, but it is who they are, and it is what they contribute to that institution.  They give that guy the loan, not based on any paperwork in that shoebox. They give that guy the loan based on who they know he is.  Then, there is the other guy in the small town who comes in. He may have a fancy cash flow statement, and he may have a wonderful statement of net worth that he can present to the bank.  Yet one thing the banker knows about him is that there may be some unpaid bills and that he may be the guy who takes out a loan but then wants to negotiate 80 cents on the dollar.  In America, we have to bring back relationship lending. You can say: Well, none of these regulations really apply to them. Why don't you talk to these folks who are in the banking world and realize that they have retracted from mortgage lending because they are fearful that they will do something wrong and will not be able to afford the fines that they may be assessed. They are fearful that they will not be able to contribute and be part of the community effort because we have overregulated the smallest institutions to the point at which they wonder if their children, who could inherit their institutions, really want to stay in business.  There will be a lot of discussion about this bill. There has been a lot of discussion already. The one thing I want to say is that we stand ready to defend any of these provisions.  Before I close and turn this over to the Senator from Georgia, I want to just say that one of the things we need to be very careful of here when we debate this bill is that we do not in any way misstate the effects of this bill, because that misstatement will become part of the public record. I am going to be very aggressive in making sure that we push back against statements that I believe are false, statements that characterize this bill in a way that was not intended and that, in fact, is not part of the legislative language.

1375,topic-id,2985,"Mr.President, I am here to discuss the merits of 2155, a bill that I have been working on since coming to the Senate in 2013. It is a bill that addresses the concerns of rural financial institutions, particularly those in our rural communities. It is a bill that was drafted to address access to capital concerns and the consolidation of small banks in areas where I live, which is in the State of North It is a bill that I am incredibly proud of. I know that there have been a lot of statements made about this bill in the last week, and I am here to set a lot of those straight.  Before I start, I wish to talk about what it is like in rural communities where I grew up. I find it interesting when I hear that this bill is about Wall Street banks and big bank bailouts. The last time I checked, Lincoln State Bank, which is my small community bank in the community where I went to high school, in Hankinson, ND, is not on the Fortune 500. It is not on the Fortune 100. It is a small community bank that has been operating and has been available to consumers in my community to help them achieve their family goals, achieve their farming goals, and achieve their needs for capital going forward.  I don't recognize the bill that is being debated here in the U.Senate because it is not the bill that has been written, and it is not the bill that is hopefully going to pass the I don't think that it is any mistake, when you look at the five primary sponsors of this bill--the five of us who wrote this bill--that most of us are from predominantly rural I think we understand the needs of those living in our States and the needs of those living in our rural communities.  When you look at an opportunity to fix regulation and to respond to concerns that people have, one of the constant arguments that I get when I go home is this: There is no longer any common sense in Washington, They don't understand where we live. They don't understand who we are. They don't understand that we live in communities and that we support and protect each other. Instead, they write one regulation that is supposed to be one-size-fits-all.  That is certainly not what this is. This is an attempt to write a bill that would give direction to the Federal regulators so that small banks could be treated as small banks and so that large banks could continue to be regulated and treated as the large, systemically significant institutions that they are.  I will give just a few statistics that I think everybody should understand.  Thirty years ago, there were approximately 14,000 banks in the United Today, there are approximately 5,000. Since the passage of Dodd-Frank, the United States has lost about 14 percent of its smallest banks. Meanwhile, the small banks' share of U.domestic deposits and banking assets has decreased, and the five largest U.banks, which don't benefit from our bill, appear to have absorbed much of this market share.  What I have said consistently is that Dodd-Frank was supposed to have stopped too big to fail, but the net result has been too small to succeed. The big banks have gotten bigger since the passage of Dodd-Frank, and the small banks have disappeared. They have retreated from their traditional role of relationship lending, first out of fear for regulation in that they might be doing something wrong and then out of fear of the cost of regulation if they are going to work towards compliance.  I will make one simple point. This bill was not written by Wall Street bankers, and it was not written by Wall Street lobbyists. If it had been, it would have been a completely different bill in that it would actually provide relief to Wall Street banks and Wall Street bankers, but it does exactly the opposite. It will give relief to those institutions, whether they be regional banks or small community banks, that can be effective competition for the largest institutions in this country.  It is absolutely essential that we set the record straight that this bill is to get our relationship institutions--whether they be credit unions or banks or our regional institutions that are not doing anything more sophisticated than the work that is being done in our small community banks--the regulatory relief that they need to effectively compete against the biggest banks in this country and to tailor our regulations, to set our regulations, in a way that reflects the common sense of American citizens.  I will take a minute because I think a lot of things that have been said about this bill have been incredibly reckless. These inaccurate claims, if left unchallenged and undiscussed, will create the legislative history of this bill, which could, in fact, then be used by many of the same institutions that we believe are not affected by this bill to argue that they are entitled to some sort of protection. We can't let that happen.  First, let me start by saying this is not a giveaway to Wall It is not a giveaway to the largest institutions. Our bipartisan bill makes targeted, commonsense fixes so as to provide tangible relief to community banks and credit unions so that they can lend to borrowers in rural America and support rural communities. It leaves in place rules and regulations that hold Wall Street accountable. In fact, the big banks aren't necessarily happy with this bill because it doesn't benefit them much.  When we asked the current regulators, such as Fed Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell--he basically said that he believes the bill gives the regulators the tools they need to continue to protect and prevent against financial collapse.  Let me say how the bill doesn't help the largest institutions.  It will not make any significant changes to the regulations that face the largest Wall Street banks. They[[Page S1658]]will continue to be reined in from causing havoc to the financial system like they did during the financial crisis. It will not make any structural changes to the Consumer Financial Protection It will be allowed to continue to protect consumers. It will do nothing to weaken or repeal the Volcker rule. The only institutions that will be given any relief from the Volcker rule will be those banks that have under $10 billion in assets. That is not JPMorgan; that is not Citibank; that is not Goldman Sachs; that is not the largest of institutions. Those institutions of $10 billion or less are the only institutions that will get relief from the Volcker rule. It also does not change the way the Federal Reserve regulates foreign banks.  Second, this bill will not lead to another mortgage lending crisis.  Let's just go back and examine what happened in 2008. We had a significant number of liar loans--subprime lending--which drove the mortgage market. That was troublesome and problematic in and of itself, but the real problem came when those mortgages were securitized and sold into the secondary market. That is where the trouble began. It was trouble enough that they were putting institutions in jeopardy, but they were passing along that risk to the public through these securitized products--derivatives. Guess what. When the whole thing collapsed, we looked behind, and we saw these risky mortgage loans. We saw what actually created some of the problems on the front end before it was securitized.  Nothing in this bill changes qualified mortgage standards. Nothing in this bill removes the protections that Dodd-Frank has provided to the secondary market. The only thing this bill does as it relates to mortgages is to say to those small institutions, which are the small community banks that I am familiar with, that they can make mortgages without worrying about the qualified mortgage standards. They can go ahead and do that. The one thing they can't do is sell those mortgages into the secondary market. They have to keep those mortgages on the books.  When you have a requirement that they keep them on the books, do you really, honestly believe that these institutions are going to take unnecessary risks? The answer is no. Guess what. They didn't take unnecessary risks before 2008. They did not cause this problem, but they are incurring the bulk of the expenses to fix this problem.  To suggest that we are, in fact, risking the financial security of this country--of our institutions--because we gave a small, discrete break on mortgages to the smallest of institutions, which have to keep these mortgages in portfolio, is absurd. If you don't believe me, let's look at what Congressman Barney Frank, one of the architects of Dodd-Frank, said yesterday. He said, ``Nothing in this bill in any way weakens the prohibition about making shaky loans to people with weak credit and then packaging them into a security.''  Our bill restores the balance for small community banks in the mortgage business without opening the door to excesses and predatory lending standards that led to the financial crisis. To suggest otherwise is disingenuous and simply not true. We have to push back against this idea that somehow we are rolling back the clock. In fact, in this same interview, Congressman Barney Frank said that about 95 percent of Dodd-Frank, as it is written, will remain intact after this bill passes--95 percent. You would not believe that to listen to the dialogue and the diatribe we have heard on the floor.  The third misstatement is that we will somehow scrap the rules for the largest Wall Street banks and allow regional banks with up to $250 billion in assets to follow the same rules and regulations as the tiny community banks.  Again, this is not true. Far from scrapping the rules, our bill simply provides that the Federal Reserve has the ability to tailor one piece of Dodd-Frank, and that is the section 165 regulations. For certain regional lenders, that means that if they do not pose systemic risk, they will not be subject to the requirements of section 165. Yet, if the Fed determines that they could, as in the case, as you have heard, of Countrywide--if there is another Countrywide out there and the Fed discovers another Countrywide--it can, in fact, include that institution in section 165.  So let's not exaggerate the impact of this bill. Let's talk about how we have moved the assumption from $50 billion or $100 billion to $250 billion in terms of what is systemically risky, knowing that the Fed can always go back and include smaller institutions if they, in fact, see the challenges.  The other thing that we need to point out about the Dodd-Frank regulations and consistent regulations in moving forward is that our bill still requires very rigorous stress testing for these regional institutions. Regional institutions would have to have the ability to meet those stress tests.  At his confirmation hearing, Chairman Powell called the framework of this bill a sensible one, and he affirmed that he would like to continue meaningful and frequent stress tests on banks between $100 billion and $250 billion, as provided for in this bill, while he confirmed that it is not necessary to stress test the smaller banks. I think that this position is supported, again, by Janet Yellen, who said, ``I do think it's appropriate to tailor regulations to the system footprint of the financial organization'' and called our bipartisan Senate bill ``a move in a direction that we think would be good.''  Moreover, our bill does not change the risk-based capital and leverage regime for these regional institutions under the Basel III reforms. Relatedly, our bill does not change the fact that the comprehensive capital analysis and review--what we call CCAR--applies to these regional banks. Of course, the Fed has said it will continue to implement enhanced prudential standards.  In addition to stress tests that are required under this bill for some banks over $100 billion, we have all of these other requirements and the requirement that they continue to meet qualified mortgage standards. They can sell these mortgages into the secondary market if they meet those standards.  It is critically important that we be very clear about what this bill does and does not do for our midsized or regional institutions.  The fourth and probably the most hurtful of the claims that have been made is that those of us who care deeply about preventing and eliminating discrimination in lending have somehow opened the door to allow for discrimination in lending by changing the HMDA standards. That is an outrageous claim and particularly hurtful for the Members of this body who have spent their lives fighting discrimination. I want to talk about the facts.  Our bill continues to require that all lenders, no matter the size, collect the traditional HMDA data, which includes information on race, gender, and ethnicity. Contrary to what some have said, our bill only relaxes the new, additional data requirements for some of the smallest lenders in the country--those that make less than 500 loans a year. This data only makes up 3.5 percent of all of the data collected under Think about that. We are claiming that people are discriminating and allowing for discrimination because we are relaxing the standards for the smallest institutions, and it only amounts to 3.5 percent of the total data collected--3.5 percent. This is an outrageous statement, and it is needs to be corrected on the record.  You might ask, why even change the 3.5? For those small institutions, the 44 pages of data that they are required to collect--it may, in fact, be that they no longer are interested in doing those kinds of mortgages.  So it is very important that we correct the record. In fact, I asked Chairman Powell during a recent Banking Committee hearing to clarify whether he believed the change in 2155 would result in or lead to additional discrimination in lending. He said that he did not believe that it in any way would affect their ability to enforce the fair lending laws in this country.  Fifth, some have inaccurately alleged that the change from ``may'' to ``shall'' in the tailoring is a dangerous provision that empowers big banks to secure more favorable treatment from the government. I think that claim does not stand up to scrutiny.  First, it is common sense that we should tailor Federal regulations so they are implemented in a practical and effective way. Second, in our bill, we retain the broad rule of construction under section 165, which provides[[Page S1659]]the Federal Reserve with wide latitude to tailor prudential standards to any company or category of companies based on any risk the Fed deems appropriate--pretty broad authority on the part of the Federal Third, in the event of a lawsuit, the Fed would be given strong deference by the courts to interpret what might apply to section 165.  Sixth, our bill would not open up targeted reforms to the supplementary leverage ratio beyond the three custody banks. Under the plain reading of this bill, the three custody banks are the only three institutions that are predominantly engaged in the custody business. Of course, the regulators retain the discretion to make appropriate adjustments to  To be clear, there is broad agreement among regulators that the unique business model of custody banks warrants tailored treatment of the SLR provision. That is why a substantially similar bill passed the House Financial Services Committee--no lighthearted people there on the minority side--by a vote of 60 to 0.  Finally, our bill will not gut oversight of foreign megabanks operating in the United States such as Barclays and Deutsche These three institutions, all of which have over $250 billion in assets, will be subject to section 165 of Dodd-That means foreign banks will still be subject to foreign bank stress test requirements, liquidity stress testing, and strict Basel III capital requirements.  Our bill does not change the Fed's requirement that large foreign banks establish an intermediate holding company in the United States, which subjects foreign banks' U.operations to requirements similar to those imposed on U.banks.  Chairman Powell at the March Senate Banking Committee hearing was asked about this, and he said he did not believe this bill would exempt foreign banks from tough oversight under Dodd-Additionally, the substitute amendment for this bill has affirmed that large foreign banks do not escape Dodd-Frank supervision.  I think it is really important that we debate the actual merits of this bill and not the ``boogeyman'' merits--the statements that this bill will somehow lead to a catastrophic downfall of our financial system. As I said, even Barney Frank disagrees with that evaluation of this bill.  It is important we set the record straight on what this bill does and does not do and that we make sure that when a court is reviewing this provision--if, in fact, there is ever litigation--that the court has a record to go to on the floor of the Senate and in the committee which corrects misstatements and refocuses the bill on what the actual intended outcome is and how the bill was actually written.  So with that, I will yield the floor, but I will say I intend to submit a document for the Record in the next discussion, which, hopefully, will provide a written document outlining the myth versus the facts of this bill so we can have an actual record that the courts can look to that documents the intent and the purpose of this legislation beyond the hyperbole and overstatement that we have heard.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

1373,topic-id,821,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to express my strong support for the legislation we are debating, which will restore economic opportunity, create jobs, help businesses grow, and help every Nevadan as they work to achieve the American dream.  As a member of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, I can tell you that this legislation is years in the making, and I wish to thank the chairman of the committee, Senator Crapo, and my fellow colleagues who are on the committee for their efforts to get us where we are today.  For years the economy had been growing slowly after the great recession. It was like a truck with a bad transmission. It was moving, but it wasn't going anywhere fast. Today everything has changed. The American economy has been primed, the engine has been started, and through the work of the Senate and President Trump, the gas pedal has been hit, and our economy is finally going full speed ahead.  Just a few month ago, we passed historic tax cuts for Nevada families and for Nevada businesses. A typical Nevada family of four will roughly get a $2,200 tax cut. We lowered the individual rates across the board and doubled the standard deduction used by most Nevadans, allowing them to keep more of their paycheck. This bill also included my efforts to double the child tax credit, from $1,000 to $2,000, further easing the tax burden on working families.  Overall, these tax cuts accomplish my three major goals of creating more jobs, increasing wages, and making America more competitive around the world. I am proud to have worked on these tax cuts, but Congress can do more. That is why we are here today.  The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act we are debating is the next major step that we must take to shift our economy into another gear. This bipartisan bill tailors financial regulations to protect consumers and help Nevadans have more access to financial resources and more access to economic opportunities. It will give Nevadans more choices when it comes to finding a loan to buy a house, to buy a car to get to work, to start a business, and, for that matter, to grow their business. Finally, this bill helps to ensure that local lenders can grow their services for every community in  This is the oil in the economic engine. It keeps not only cities like Las Vegas, Henderson, and Reno running but all communities in Nevada, such as Mesquite, Pahrump, Carson City,[[Page S1657]]Fallon, Elko, and This bill includes many bipartisan proposals that I fought for. I am pleased that the legislation I offered with Senator Menendez to ease workforce mobility for mortgage loan officers who wish to move to Nevada or to change jobs is included in the base text.  In committee I offered an amendment that was based off of legislation I worked on with Senator Warner that would require the regulators for credit unions to publish their annual budgets and to hold a public hearing on that budget. It would increase public transparency and ensure that Nevada credit union members have a voice in Washington,  Working with my friend Senator Tester, we were able to include language to increase congressional oversight of the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department in order to ensure that our best interests are represented at international insurance discussions on capital standards.  I was also pleased that language authored by Senators Perdue, Tester, Donnelly, and myself was incorporated to require consumer credit bureaus to provide free and timely security credit freezes to all consumers. It also requires credit bureaus to provide consumers a notice at any time of their consumer rights and for the credit bureaus to tell consumers on their websites that they have a right to request a security freeze, fraud alert, and an Active-Duty military fraud alert.  Additionally, this bill includes the Community Lender Exam Act that I co-led with Senator Donnelly, which would allow more highly rated community lenders to be examined every 18 months instead of 12 months. This will help safe and sound local lenders to direct more of their time and capital to Nevada communities and ensure the same level of regulatory supervision.  With this bill we are seeing something rare in Washington, DC--Democrats and Republicans working together to help Americans have more economic opportunities. Let me say that again. This bill will help Americans have more economic opportunities. That is why I am here in the Senate--to give every Nevadan the opportunity to live the fullest life and to achieve their goals. I look forward to voting to support this legislation, and I would encourage all of my colleagues to do the same.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

It is a bill that helps address the burden of unnecessary, duplicative, and outdated regulations that too often have imposed cost on our community financial institutions that ultimately make credit more expensive and less available to our constituents. It passed out of our committee with a very strong bipartisan vote of 38-17, and I congratulate him for his bill.  Specifically, Mr.Speaker, this bill requires that all of the prudential financial regulators that now include the CFPB and the NCUA, the National Credit Union Administration--it ensures that all of our financial regulators, not just some, but all, will participate in the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act, known as EGRPRA, a law that dates back to the Clinton era, and this ensures that our agencies review all rules that are prescribed by themselves that impact our insured financial institutions.  The purpose of this review, again, is to reduce regulation that is proven overly burdensome, duplicative, or outdated, while maintaining our safety and soundness standards. And, again, Mr.Speaker, all this is is a review. It ensures a review.  Additionally, H.4607 will require that these agencies meet every 7 years for a comprehensive regulatory evaluation, as opposed to the current 10-year standard. This is especially important. I salute the gentleman from Georgia for his leadership, because we have seen our financial sector of the economy suffer under the weight, the load, the burden of regulation, particularly because six of the seven heaviest regulatory years occurred under the last administration; so we need a more thorough review of these regulations. And requiring our Federal agencies to simply review their actions in a transparent manner on a more frequent basis, it is simple; it is fair; it is straightforward; it is wise.  Mr.Speaker, a healthy financial system that provides equal opportunity to all Americans to achieve financial independence can only exist if we have smart regulation. And the explosive growth of regulation, following the enactment of Dodd-Frank, has made it significantly harder for our community banks and credit unions to serve their customers and members.  And, in fact, the complexity and cost of this regulatory burden has forced many of them out of business or has forced them to cut back services to their customers and members, and it is one of the reasons why, on average, we continue to lose one community bank or credit union a day, or every other day, in This should not be happening.  Ultimately, Mr.Speaker, it is not the banks and credit unions we are so concerned about. It is their customers. It is customers like Missouri mom, Michele, who explained to us how frustrating it has been for her 20-year-old daughter, with a full-time job, to get a loan to buy her first car. And, again, her daughter has a first-time job. And as Michele explained to us: ``It's a catch-22. You need credit to get credit, but no one will give you the credit to begin with. I would like to see our young adults be able to build the credit they need so they can have a decent future.''  Mr.Speaker, it is for people like Michele and her daughter that we need this regulatory review. It is why we need the bill from the gentleman from These are the people we are trying to help.  Like Anne in Wisconsin, who was trying to get a loan to remodel her attached garage when her son was born, and she said: ``My husband and I have very high credit scores, and we have equity in our home, but because my husband has a seasonal job and finds other employment in the winter, the many banks we contacted rejected our loan request. They base that on our annual income only on the job he was currently in and said it was part of the new regulation.''[[Page H1384]]  Well, of course it is, Mr.That is why they need to be reviewed. It is people like Anne in Wisconsin we need to help.  Or Dan, a Navy veteran from Illinois, who actually had to close down--close down the small auto finance company he started with his wife 25 years ago, and he had to close it down because of new Federal regulation. He explains: ``Large companies can afford a separate legal department to deal with these issues and the myriad of new regulations. A small business like ours cannot. We had to make a decision. It was just not worth the risk to continue operations in this antibusiness environment.''  So, Mr.Speaker, it is people like Michele, it is people like Anne, it is people like Dan who deserve the opportunity to have credit for their homes, their autos, their small businesses, and so we must ensure that all of our Federal regulators--all of our Federal financial regulators take a thorough comprehensive review of their regulatory burden so that we can continue to support the people who need credit.  H.4607, again, has garnered strong bipartisan support. It is practical; it is common sense; and I urge all of my colleagues to adopt it.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

If you want to change any rule, you have to go through the formal rulemaking process to repropose a rule, to get public comment. So, again, in and of itself, it changes no rules. I almost want to ask my friend on the other side of the aisle: What is she scared of? What is so wrong with simply looking at the rules that have been promulgated to see if they are actually working? Are they helping our constituents? Are they making economic opportunity more available for all?  What is so odd is, the original EGRPRA legislation that dates back to the Clinton era was overwhelmingly supported on both sides of the aisle.  So what the gentleman from Georgia is doing in H.4607 is simply saying all financial regulators, including the National Credit Union Administration and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which really didn't even exist in the Clinton era, ought to do the same thing. They are saying, instead of doing it every 10 years, let's do it every 7 years. Just take a look and report. That is all it is.  It is a self-reporting requirement, which I think, Mr.Speaker, is why this has already been supported overwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis in the House Financial Services  So with all of the various scare tactics and horror stories that we have heard from the other side of the aisle on a mere reporting requirement, again, I ask, Mr.Speaker: What are they scared of?  What we are ultimately trying to do here is make sure that the regulatory burden is not such that it harms the very people I spoke about earlier in my opening comments: that it doesn't hurt Dan, a Navy veteran from Illinois who, because of the regulatory burden, was forced to shut down his small business; that it doesn't hurt Anne in Wisconsin, who is just trying to get a loan to remodel her garage; that it doesn't hurt Michele and her daughter in Her daughter was just simply seeking a car loan to buy her first car.  These are the people whom we are trying to help.  And by the way, all banks--small, medium, and large--are lending to businesses and to consumers, and we want them to do that in a robust but responsible way.  So, from time to time, let's look at the regulations and ensure that they are still helping us achieve equal financial opportunity for all so that our constituents can achieve their share of the American Dream, that they can achieve financial independence.  This received strong, bipartisan support, Madam Speaker, in the House Financial Services It ought to receive strong, bipartisan support on the House floor.

2,topic-id,1369,"Madam President, I rise today in remembrance of Senator Daniel Kahikina Senator Akaka, who served in the Senate for 23 years and sat at this desk, passed away on Friday morning, with his wife of nearly 70 years, Millie, and his extended family at his side.  Since his passing, people across Hawaii have shared their memories of and tributes to Senator Each of their stories has a common thread--Senator Akaka's dedication to living with ``aloha.'' Senator Akaka embodied the ``aloha'' spirit. From meeting nearly every Hawaii family who came to his office for a Capitol tour to serving as a tireless advocate for veterans, the Native Hawaiian community, and Hawaii families, Senator Akaka's care, empathy, and compassion were evident to everyone who knew him.  When I was elected to the Senate, I requested Senator Akaka's desk to be my desk. I did this because it represented continuity as Senator Akaka's successor, and the desk is a symbol to me of his years of service and the ``aloha'' he had for this body and the people of  The last time I saw Senator Akaka was at last year's American Logistics Association Hawaii conference. This gathering brings together Hawaii businesses from across the State to market their products for sale to military commissaries. Over 20 years ago, Senator Akaka worked with small businesses and the military commissary network to create this conference because he understood how much receiving a commissary contract would mean to Hawaii's businesses, especially Hawaii's small businesses.  The conference started with one small table with a few products and grew to an entire ballroom full of local products and entrepreneurs. Last year, the conference was named for Senator  That is who Senator Akaka was. He brought people together to solve problems and create opportunities. His legislative style wasn't flashy or over the top. He put his head down and got to work, and he built relationships with colleagues to get things done.  Senator Akaka's work on behalf of our Nation's veterans also reflected his persistent, effective style. After serving in World War II, Senator Akaka went to college under the GI bill and became an educator. As chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, he was a strong advocate for expanding the GI bill for a new generation of veterans. He authored the post-9/11 GI bill, which was signed into law in 2011.  Senator Akaka also championed the cause of the Filipino veterans of World War II in These veterans fought for the United States but were denied the benefits and citizenship they were promised. Senator Akaka introduced legislation that would restore these veterans' benefits and, with his leadership, this bill passed the  Later he and Senator Inouye successfully included language in the 2009 stimulus bill that provided onetime payments for these Filipino veterans through the newly created Filipino Veterans Equity Compensation  Senator Akaka also introduced bipartisan legislation to allow these veterans to reunite with their children and families in the United While this bill did not pass, President Obama established through executive order the Filipino World War II Veterans Parole Program in 2016 to allow the children of these veterans to reunite with their parents in the United Some of these veterans have been waiting for decades to reunite with their children.  Although Senator Akaka had retired, his insistence on bipartisanship helped to build broad support for President Obama's decision to issue this Executive order.  Senator Akaka was also instrumental in building support to award the Filipino Veterans of World War II the Congressional Gold Medal that passed in 2016, after years of continued effort.  Senator Akaka was also a champion for America's Native people and served as chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs As the first Native Hawaiian to serve in the U.Senate, Senator Akaka fought to expand funding for Native Hawaiian healthcare, education, and housing programs.  In 1993, President Clinton signed into law Senator Akaka's apology resolution, which acknowledged the Federal Government's role in the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom in 1893. The resolution's unanimous passage marked the 100th anniversary of the overthrow and was a watershed moment for Native It served as the first official admission by the United States of the role it played in the overthrow of the Hawaiian  Senator Akaka later worked on the Hawaiian Home Lands Recovery This law required the United States to make the Hawaiian homelands whole by ensuring a repayment of lost use of lands originally set aside by Congress but which were nevertheless transferred to or otherwise acquired by the Federal  The apology resolution and the Lands Recovery Act provided the foundation for Senator Akaka's namesake legislation--the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act, often referred to as the Akaka bill, to establish a process to secure Federal recognition for Native Hawaiians to achieve parity with the Alaska Natives and American  When I served in the House of Representatives, I introduced the House companion to the Akaka bill and testified about the importance of passing this legislation in both the U.House and the U.Senator Akaka reintroduced the Akaka bill for more than 10 years, but it did not pass before he retired.[[Page S1997]]  A former longtime Akaka staff member reflected on the Senator's commitment to the Native Hawaiian community. She said:       Senator Akaka worked tirelessly to address the longstanding      issues resulting from the overthrow of the Kingdom of      He felt strongly that there needed to be a process to bring      all parties to the table because without such a process these      issues remained festering sources of emotional pain that      would stand in the way of Hawaii being able to move forward      as a state and for Native Hawaiians to move forward as      indigenous peoples.  Building on his work, in 2016, the Department of the Interior adopted rules creating a process that could reestablish a government-to-government relationship between the United States and Native While the Native Hawaiian community has differences on the issue of Federal recognition, everyone can agree that Senator Akaka pushed for the passage of the Akaka bill because he wanted equity and justice for Native Hawaiian people.  Senator Akaka's advocacy for our country's Native people could best be summarized in his own words during his farewell address to the Senate, where he said:       The United States is a great country. One of the things      that makes us so great is that though we have made mistakes,      we change, we correct them, we right past wrongs. It is our      responsibility as a nation to do right by America's native      people, those who exercised sovereignty on lands that later      became part of the United While we can never change      the past, we have the power to change the future.  Many people also may not know that Senator Akaka was just as committed to protecting Hawaii's land and water resources as he was to improving the lives of Hawaii's people. In 1992, Senator Akaka successfully passed his Tropical Forest Recovery Act into law, which served as a basis for Federal conservation efforts that protect Hawaii's plants and forests.  As with so many of his initiatives, the Senator was much ahead of his time. This act provided a vision and blueprint for tomorrow's conservation ethic, one that stressed the integration of ecology, livelihoods, and culture; in short, an ethic that emphasized sacred relationship between people and place, community and sustainably managed resources.  Senator Akaka also leaves behind a demonstrated commitment to bipartisanship. He was widely known for his faithful attendance at the Senate Prayer Breakfast every week. Colleagues who attend that breakfast regularly asked me about how he and Millie were doing.  During his farewell speech, Senator Akaka said:       In Congress and in our nation, we are truly all together,      in the same canoe. If we paddle together in unison, we can      travel great distances. If the two sides of the canoe paddle      in opposite directions, we will only go in circles.

1422,topic-id,1087,"Mr.President, when we discuss climate change, we often speak about the future--a future in which rising temperatures and seas displace millions from their homes around the globe, devastate agriculture, and damage critical infrastructure. This future is not far off.  Climate change will impact every State in our country and every country in the world. In island and coastal communities like Hawaii, the impact will be particularly severe.  Climate scientists across the world agree that without decisive action, seas will likely rise by at least 3.2 feet by the end of the century. To put this in context, a child born today will likely experience these effects in their lifetime.  I will focus my remarks today on the foreseeable impact on  The State of Hawaii investigated and issued a chilling report about what a 3.2-foot sea level rise would mean for our The report concluded that 3.2 feet of sea level rise would inundate more than 25,000 acres of land across Over 6,500 hotels, malls, small businesses, apartments, and homes would be compromised or destroyed, and 20,000 residents would be displaced in the process.[[Page S1682]]  The economic cost of this damage--$19 billion. If anything, this is a conservative estimate of the total economic cost of climate change in The State report, for example, doesn't estimate the total cost of damage to Hawaii's critical infrastructure.  Climate change and sea level rise would damage sewer lines in urban Honolulu and other low-lying areas across the These phenomena would also lead to chronic flooding across 38 miles of major roads, such as the Kuhio Highway on Kauai, Kamehameha Highway on Oahu, and Honoapiilani Highway on  The State's report certainly outlines the serious challenges that climate change will pose for the future, but we are already living with its effects.  Each summer and winter, the specific placement of the sun and moon combined with the rotation of the Earth produce extraordinarily high tides. We call them king tides. Most years, scientists can predict when these tides will happen and how bad they will be. Last year's king tides, however, were the worst on record. Scientists believe that these historic king tides provide a glimpse of the increasing severity and frequency of the coastal flooding driven by climate change. Hawaii also experienced an exceptionally rare king tide on New Year's Day, and a larger than normal north swell caused major coastal erosion on Oahu's north shore.  Coastal erosion is a critical issue for Hawaii, where our beaches draw millions of visitors from around the world every year. According to research from the University of Hawaii Sea Grant College Program, 70 percent of the beaches in Hawaii are eroding, and 13 miles of public beach have eroded completely. In other words, they are gone.  During last year's king tides, Sea Grant mobilized citizen scientists to document their impact on the From Sea Grant's research we learned that record-high water levels caused localized flooding and erosion across every island in the Waikiki Beach was particularly impacted last year when the king tides overwashed the shoreline during peak tourist season. Climate change will make events like this more frequent and severe, adversely impacting our environment and our economy.  Waikiki Beach on Oahu alone generates $2.2 billion for Hawaii's economy every year, and it could be completely submerged by the end of the century. There is a clear urgency to act, and we need our President and the Federal Government to acknowledge the threat and to lead.  We need more funding for programs like Sea Grant that help State and local governments develop plans and policies to help our beaches, our coasts, and our economy adapt to climate change. But at a time when we should be increasing funding for Sea Grant colleges, the Trump administration is zeroing out this funding. We were able to protect funding for Sea Grant last year, and I will continue to fight during this year's budget and appropriations cycle to make sure it receives the money it needs to do its important work.  We also need our Federal agencies to invest in research that will help us better understand climate change's long-term impact on our States and communities. But Donald Trump has appointed--and his Republican allies in the Senate have confirmed--regressive, dangerous, and extreme nominees who are undermining critical climate change research.  Last May, the Department of Interior under the leadership of Ryan Zinke, put out a news release about a report on climate change-related sea level rise, coauthored by two Hawaii scientists without ever mentioning in their release the words ``climate change.''  Earlier today, I asked Secretary Zinke at a hearing to comment on this incident and to clarify whether it is the Department's policy to censor announcements about climate change research produced by his Secretary Zinke acknowledged that the content of the press release is his prerogative but that he would not censor the contents of documents and reports themselves. However, by not referencing the term ``climate change'' in a press release on a report about how climate change drives sea level rise, he is toeing the President's line that climate change is a hoax. The problem is that press releases from agencies like the Interior Department serve as indicators of the Federal Government's priorities. By eliminating references to climate change in these releases, the Department is sending a clear signal that climate change is not a priority.  In the absence of Federal action, States like Hawaii are stepping up and taking the lead. Hawaii was the first State in the country to enact legislation to implement the Paris climate agreement after President Trump announced that he would withdraw the United States from this agreement without much reason.  Standing up to the challenge of climate change also means developing our renewable resources of energy and moving away from dependence on fossil fuels. Hawaii has set the forward-thinking goal of generating 100-percent renewable electricity by 2045. Through decisive action, Hawaii is already generating 27-percent renewable electricity while cutting oil imports by 41 percent since 2006. As the most oil-dependent State in the country, this is significant progress.  Over 97 percent of climate scientists agree that the climate is changing due to human activity, and the vast majority of the American public also acknowledges this. Our Nation's military recognizes the threat that climate change poses to our national security and the urgent need to confront it.  Mr.President, I agree with my colleague from Rhode Island that it is time to wake up.  I yield the floor.

576,topic-id,856,"Mr.Speaker, I am saddened and angered that the high school in my district, Great Mills High School, in Mary's County, was the site of the most recent school shooting, of which there have been 17 just since the beginning of this year.  Two students were injured, and the gunman, also a student, was killed. And an entire community of parents, students, teachers, and faculty has been shaken by this violence.  If it had not been for the courage and quick action of the school resource officer, Blaine Gaskill, and local law enforcement, the casualties might have been far, far greater.  Blaine Gaskill is a hero, as are the teachers, students, and other school personnel.  Tim Cameron, the sheriff of Mary's County, and the sheriff's office, of which Blaine Gaskill was a member, responded exactly as they had practiced: efficient, effective, and caring.  Kathy O'Brien, who heads up a place called Walden in our county and in southern Maryland, was on site within an hour, dealing with the crisis and the mental health challenges it caused.  Principal Jake Heibel made sure the school responded effectively. The superintendent of schools, James Smith, had made sure that the school would act in a way that was appropriate.  We thank all of them.  But, Mr.Speaker, our Nation is suffering from a crisis of gun violence. It has affected schools, places of worship, entertainment venues, city streets, and other places where a lot of people congregate.  No other industrialized society or nation faces such a crisis, and that is because, in America, our laws allow almost anybody to access dangerous firearms, almost no questions asked.  Furthermore, we allow the sale of assault rifles of the kind used by soldiers in the battlefield, designed to kill a lot of people quickly.  In this instance, it was a handgun, a I do not know the capacity of the magazine that was used, but it was not an assault rifle.  This Republican-led Congress, Mr.Speaker, has chosen to follow the lead of the NRA and do nothing of substance.  We did pass a bill the other day that gave schools some help, some grant money, to ensure the safety of their schools. That was appropriate to do. But they could do that now on their own. We will help, that is good, but it does not address the real problem. Perhaps that was the point.  And America's students, however, Mr.Speaker, won't have it. I had the opportunity last Wednesday to stand with thousands of students who walked out of their schools, walked into democracy, and marched to the Capitol to call for action against gun violence.  These young people, Mr.Speaker, displayed the best of America, using their voices and their actions, to promote a just cause and a worthy effort to make our Union more perfect.  The other Members and I who joined these young Americans could see that they do not take this and other national challenges lightly. Indeed, they had much to say about the future they want for our country and for the role they want to play to shape it.[[Page H1735]]  One of the students, Mr.Speaker, from Maryland, Matt Post, spoke extraordinarily eloquently.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record his remarks.       My name is Matt I'm a twelfth-grader, the Student      Member of the Board for Montgomery County, and, I think, as      students we need to make a few things clear.       To start, we will not sit in classrooms with armed      teachers. We refuse to learn in fear. We reject turning our      schools into prisons.       We will accept nothing less than stricter gun control. If      it's what it takes, we are going to shame our national      policymakers into protecting us, not just in schools but in      churches, movie theaters, on the streets, and for the      communities of color who are disproportionately devastated by      the sickness of gun violence.       The lawmakers who fail to support us, those who look for      every answer to our nation's gun problem but the guns      themselves, are complicit in every single death that comes      after. To every politician sitting in the Capitol behind us,      you get to decide who lives.       And so, this is not a partisan issue for us. There's      nothing cosmetic about life or death. This is about our basic      morality as a country.       When the commander-in-chief's solution to this gun epidemic      is more guns, you know we have a moral problem in the White            When national policymakers value the blood money of the NRA      over the lives of children, you know we have a moral problem      in the Halls in       And when this is doomed to happen again--when, in the      coming weeks and months, more of my peers will be slaughtered      in their own classrooms, when their deaths will be dismissed      as collateral--you know we have a moral problem in this      country.       So let's make one last thing clear: their right to own an      assault rifle does not outweigh our right to live.       The adults have failed us. This is in our hands now. And if      any elected official gets in our way, we will vote them out      and replace them ourselves.       `Enough is Enough!'

Mr.Speaker, let me close by echoing the words of our distinguished minority whip and by saying that we need a better process, and I hope my colleagues will vote against the rule.  I just want to say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, one of the reasons why I think there is so much polarization in this Chamber, why it is hard to kind of get things done, is because of the process. I think process matters. When people don't have the opportunity to read the bills, when people are routinely denied the opportunity to bring to the floor their ideas for debate and vote, it results in increased tensions and increased polarization; and, quite frankly, it undermines the integrity of this institution.  This is supposed to be the people's We all represent the same number of constituents, yet routinely the voices of the people are denied to be heard on this House floor.  So I would urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule, vote ``no'' on the previous question so we can bring the Dream Act to the floor, we can help the Dreamers, we can help those DACA recipients who everybody says publicly that they want to help, yet, when it comes to actually helping them, all we get is obstruction from the Republican leadership here. Let's bring that to the floor. This is our 26th time trying to do it. Let's do something that will make a real difference, that will help these people.  They deserve our help. They deserve our support. They are valued members of our community. They are American in every way except they weren't born here.

We ought to stop playing politics with the  I know the President is holding them hostage and wants a ransom that gets bigger and bigger, and bigger, and bigger.

Vote against the previous question so we can bring up relief for the  Finally, I just, again, plead with the Republican leadership of this House, we need to have a better process here.

1930,topic-id,2274,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the majority leader for that information.  Mr.Speaker, throughout the last year, we have continually run up against deadlines on how we were going to keep the government of the United States operating properly.  The omnibus is currently being discussed. The negotiations for the omnibus were made possible by the fact that a significant number of Democrats voted for it, while a significant number of Republicans voted against it. It was a bipartisan statement proceeding.  That omnibus needs to be passed by March 23. We are not scheduled to be here, Mr.Speaker, on March 23. That does not mean that we might not go over, but it means that it needs to pass the House and the Senate and be sent to the President prior to or on March 22.  Negotiations are, unfortunately, not proceeding as effectively as I would hope they would. I am hopeful that there will be a clean bill from either[[Page H1490]]side without any riders that would lead either side to oppose that bill.  Mr.Speaker, let me talk about an issue. First of all, let me say that the leader has announced a number of bills for consideration next week. I venture to say that an extraordinarily infinitesimal amount of the American people have any ideas what those bills do or are urging those bills to be passed. I do not mean that they are without substance. I mean that they are not the issues on the mind of the American people. This is the people's  Mr.Speaker, the Speaker appeared on television at a townhall on CNN some 14 months ago. He made a promise at a CNN townhall to a Dreamer that asked him a question.  House Speaker Paul Ryan strongly suggested to that young woman that ``revocation on protection for the Dreamers brought here as children will not be carried out.''  Notwithstanding that, the President of the United States put that Dreamer and hundreds of thousands of other Dreamers--indeed, close to 2 million Dreamers--at risk by withdrawing their protections, which Speaker Ryan indicated would not happen: ``Will not be carried out.''  That was some 6 months ago, Mr.Not the CNN; that was 14 months ago.  I have talked to the Speaker, I have brought it up continuously on this floor, and I have been told by the Republican leadership: Don't worry, we have got until March 5 to do something.  I was told that in October, I was told that in November, I was told that in December, I was told that in January, and I was told that in February: Don't worry, we have got until March 5.  March 5 came and went. No action.  That Dreamer to whom the Speaker spoke is still at risk, still worried, and still twisting in the wind. Eighty-six percent of the American public, Mr.Speaker, say that that young woman should not be kicked out of the country that she knows: brought here as a child, went to elementary school, middle school, high school; some to college, some practicing medicine, some practicing law, some being social workers, many being teachers.  I was told: Don't worry. They were told: Don't worry, March 5 is a long way away.  It has come and gone.  And we are told this week that we will consider H.1116, the TAILOR I am not sure that any of my constituents have talked to me about the TAILOR  H.4263, the Regulation A+ Improvement Act, I doubt that a single one of my constituents has talked to me about that act.  They are fillers, Mr.They are fillers while we fiddle, while Rome burns.  I have asked, Leader Pelosi has asked, frankly, and leaders of the Catholic Church and other denominations have asked to put the Dreamer bill on the floor in the people's  The Speaker of this House, when he became the Speaker, said: We will not duck the tough issues. We will take them head-on. Don't worry, we have got until March 5.  March 5 is behind us, and we consider these bills, which I think are filler bills, and controversial bills at that.  We have asked, Mr.Speaker, that the majority party put on the floor three bills on an issue of vital importance to the American people, that every American knows about, that the people's House ought to have the right to speak on, and express the views of the American people and establish policy they support--86 percent of them.  So I will, again, ask the majority leader, Mr.Speaker, to put the Dream Act on the floor; to put Mr.Goodlatte's bill on the floor; to put the bipartisan bill, sponsored by Mr.Hurd from Texas and Mr.Aguilar from California; put them on the floor.                              {time}  1100  Take the issues. I know they are tough. The Speaker said he wants to take the issues head-on, Mr.Speaker, not duck. Show some political courage. And not only that, respect this institution and every Member in it who wants to express their opinion on this legislation of critical importance to at least 1.8 million Americans, vital to their future, to their life.  And 86 percent of Americans believe they ought to be protected, just as Speaker Ryan pledged they would be 14 months ago when he said revocation of protection for the Dreamers brought here as children will not be carried out. Mr.Speaker, that bill ought to be brought to the floor to carry out that representation and that assurance.  I have been patient. I have talked. I have worked. I have come to meetings. I met with the President of the United States, Mr.Speaker, with my colleague and friend, the majority leader, and Mr.Durbin and others, 25 of us sitting around the Cabinet table, Mr.Speaker, when the President said we will take care of DACA, and he said: You send me a bill; I will sign it, and I will take the heat.  He was not telling the truth, Mr.Speaker, because we had a bill, called the commonsense crowd, about 25 United States Senators brought a bill to the floor. It took care of a couple of the things the President wanted to take care of, but it wasn't good enough for him, notwithstanding the fact he said: You send me a bill. You decide, i.e., the Congress, the coequal branch of government that now stands suppliant in the face of saying we will pass something only if the President will sign it.  That is not what the framers meant, Mr.We are a coequal branch, not a subservient branch of the government of the United  Mr.Speaker, if we brought those three bills to the floor that I just referred to--the Dream Act, cosponsored by Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican, and Lucille Roybal-Allard, a Democrat; and the Goodlatte bill, sponsored by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee; and a bipartisan bill sponsored by many Republicans and many Democrats, Mr.Hurd, a Republican from Texas, and Mr.Aguilar, a Democrat from California--if we brought those bills to the floor, the problem is they know the Hurd-Aguilar bill would pass, which would reflect the views of 86 percent of the American people.  No, Mr.Speaker, notwithstanding the fact that the American people are overwhelmingly for that, we are going to be considering H.1116, H.4545, H.4263, ignoring that 1.8 million people, ignoring that promise that the Speaker made to that young woman that she would be protected.  The Speaker has told me over and over again: Oh, I want to do this. I want to do that. I am going to have some task force. I am going to do this, that, and the other.  March 5 has come and gone. Nothing has happened.  I used to be the majority leader. I could bring a bill to the floor. If I said something was going to happen, I tried to make sure it happened.  If I sound angry, it is because I am angry. If I sound frustrated, it is because I am frustrated. The people's House ought to be given the opportunity to express the will of the American people on this issue.  There is another issue, and we do have a bill, the so-called Rutherford bill that we are bringing to the floor on suspension. We are probably all going to vote for the Rutherford bill.  But we are going to ignore a bill, as we have been ignoring for years under Republican leadership, a bill that is supported even more than the DACA, Dreamer bills, and that is comprehensive background checks, which clearly will save lives, which will close the loopholes, which will make sure that those with criminal records don't get guns, will make sure that those with mental health issues don't get guns, will make sure that terrorists who can't fly on airplanes can't get guns.  Mr.Speaker, we have been urging and pleading for that bill to be brought to the floor over and over and over again. The National Rifle Association is not for that bill. I can't understand why. Rather, we bring a bill to the floor that will help schools--I think that is positive--do what they can do right now.  Should we help them? Of course. But we ought not to pretend that we are doing something to make our children safer in their schools, to make concertgoers safer at their concerts, to make churchgoers safer in their church, to make people who go to a nightclub safer in that nightclub, to make people who go to shopping centers safer in those shopping centers. We ought not to pretend the Rutherford bill is going to do that.[[Page H1491]]  Will comprehensive background checks do it all? It will not. There are other things I think ought to be done. But at a minimum, the American people think that we ought to make sure that everybody who purchases a weapon has a background check to make sure that they are not a criminal, somebody with a substantial mental health problem that makes them unsafe to own a gun, spousal abusers.  Mr.Speaker, the bills we are going to consider next week I am sure have some merit from some perception, from somebody's perception, but the two bills that I have just discussed are on the minds of the American people, and millions are at risk if we do not pass legislation dealing with that issue.  I do not criticize the Rutherford bill, but it will not solve the problem, and everybody knows it will not solve the problem; nor, frankly, will universal background checks in and of itself solve the problem, but experts say it will save thousands of lives over time. It would have saved lives in Charleston, South Carolina, the nine people killed in Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston, South  Mr.Speaker, I like to work in a bipartisan way, but that requires respecting one another. My Republican friends wrote a book in which they were very critical of the way we ran the House because it wasn't open and transparent. I would ask them to reread that book. I have read it.  My friend is smiling.  In that book, they really wanted to change the way this House runs, make it open and transparent, take the tough issues head-on. That is what the Speaker said.  Mr.Speaker, they are not taking the tough issues head-on. They are hiding from the They are hiding from some of their hardline people who want to kick people out of America, who want to take that lamp that the Statue of Liberty holds high and bring it down.  Yes, I am disappointed. Yes, I am angry. Yes, I am frustrated. I came to this body to express my opinion on the important issues confronting my country and to try to make it better.  Mr.Speaker, I would plead with the majority leader to perhaps delay those four bills. Rutherford's could be on suspension. It won't take much time. Delay those three bills that a miniscule amount of Americans, there may be 100, there may be 200 Americans who would be concerned those bills aren't brought forward, and put on the floor the three bills I referred to--the Dream Act, the Goodlatte bill, and the Hurd-Aguilar bill--and let the people's House express its opinion. That is not an unfair request.  And let the background check, universal background check bill come to the floor, and let the House vote. I know that there are some Republicans who don't want to vote on that bill because the public is so overwhelmingly for it and they may upset the That is what this business is about, Mr.Speaker, expressing openly and clearly what we think the policies of our country ought to be to make our public better, to make our country safer.  Mr.Speaker, I would end on those two issues, and I yield to my friend, the majority leader.  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.Biggs). Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I have great respect for the gentleman, and there were a lot of questions inside there, I believe.  Out of my respect for the gentleman, I am quite concerned that if he is fact-checked, he is going to get quite a few Pinocchios, so let me walk through, first, how he started the debate.  The gentleman started and the first question was concerning government funding to March 23. He then felt that work was not being done, and he used the phrase--and I may get it a little incorrect, but he said we only were able to pass a budget agreement because of the majority of the Democrats, and not the majority on the Republican side, passing it.

1931,topic-id,1933,"Mr.Speaker, reclaiming my time to just make a correction.  I said a significant number of Democrats voted for it and a significant number of Republicans voted against it.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  So I think it would just be helpful on the record to actually state what the vote was.  There were 167 Republicans who voted for that budget agreement, 67 who did not. There were 73 Democrats who voted for it, but the majority of Democrats, 119, voted against it, which Mr.Hoyer was in that group, as well, voting against it. So I would make one point, and that is 71 percent of Republicans voted for this budget agreement.  And just to make the facts correct, Mr.Hoyer's concern about the appropriations process, this House passed all 12 appropriations bills, and we did it on time and we sent it over to the In the meantime, the Democrats shut the government down before we could ever get there. So I think history should actually play to facts.  Yes, I am concerned about the March 23 deadline, but I am pushing hard. I would actually like to take those bills up next week. And as Mr.Hoyer knows, being a member of the Appropriations Committee as he was in the past, when you get to this point where we already have the numbers set, it is really what is called a four corners, the four leaders.  Now, the committees are all working through it. They are actually making great progress. There are a few things left to actually close out. I would like to get it done a week ahead of time, and I hope Mr.Hoyer's side would as well.  So let's walk through some others.  First of all, I was a small-business owner. The idea is having a bill on this floor that creates more jobs, that brings more access to capital. Mr.Speaker, I heard from the other side, the leader, she thought crumbs was the idea of Americans getting $1,000 in a bonus. That is about equal to what I am hearing, and I am offended by it. It is not insignificant that someone wants to create a job and have access to capital. The gentleman is wrong about that.  Then the gentleman talks about our Our Speaker has worked a great deal, and, yes, he has kept his word.  Mr.Hoyer was in that meeting with me when we were in the White Before we left that bipartisan, bicameral meeting with the administration, we agreed to work on this issue in four areas, and we have had numerous meetings in my office about that as well.                              {time}  1115  I don't know, maybe you forget to state that we are a rule of law In doing so, that is why we are in this position we are today, because there was a past executive branch that thought they were a legislative branch and they did something that everyone would agree they do not have the power to do. So the current President said to move it to the legislative branch like it should be because there are court cases coming. In doing so, that is what we are working on.  The courts have now come back, giving further time. The Supreme Court has now given a timeline that wants to make sure the Ninth Circuit before there--so this gives us time to solve the problem.  I am more concerned about solving a problem than just passing a bill for some political favor. I do not want to be back at this place in another 2 years and having kids sitting here who are questioning where they are going to go.  I know you raised some issue about individuals. Not one person is in jeopardy that is registered within You have been in meetings where you heard that from the Secretary of Homeland Security, where you heard that from the Chief of Staff to the President as well.  The President even went further than talking about DACA to even making the point solving, but he also had three other pillars. As you know, we need a secure border. You also know the current law does not treat everybody equally who comes here illegally, so you are going to perpetuate the problem if you maintain the current law.  Thirdly, the idea that we want to make sure the nuclear family is closer together sooner--you have got a 30-year wait when someone wants to come in and petition a brother and sister.  Why don't we help them be able to bring their children and their spouses in together?[[Page H1492]]  That is one of the proposals as well.  Then the whole concept of merit. Those are all common sense. I think they could be bipartisan. And the sooner we solve that problem, we will solve it for a long term.  So on this side of the aisle we want to get this job done long before the courts even have to act. I think that would be the proper thing to do. So, yes, that is what we have been working upon.  Now, another issue you brought up was about guns, and you talked about this I first want to give you a few little facts. I appreciate that you always mention my book. That is why I smile. We don't get any royalties from it, but the veterans do, so please mention it as much as you like.  If I take--and let me just give you the numbers. Quorum does this. Some bright kids out of Harvard created a company and it is all about data.  There are more bills out of committee, 643 in this Congress; and there are more bills out of this House, 558, than any Congress in the last 25 years. And in that meantime, we also passed tax reform that hasn't been done in three decades.  I know some people on your side of the aisle refer to it as crumbs or Armageddon, but I will tell you, to those families out there that got extra money, that are actually fixing their car or actually paying their hospital bills, or those 1.2 million people who just work at one company that now have a longer maternity leave, they don't think it is crumbs, and they don't think having a bill on the floor that let more people take a risk and create a small business is insignificant.  Now let me talk to you about what we did because we believe background checks are important as well. Let me give you a little background. The background check is only as good as the database of what you have.  The National Instant Criminal Background Check System, referred to as the NICS database, is currently administered by the If the NICS check indicates a person as being in a prohibited category, the FBI will signal a deny on the firearm transfer. However, the NICS database is incomplete and outdated.  For example, on November 5, 2017, a mass shooting occurred at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Devin Patrick Kelley murdered 26 and injured 20 others. Kelly was prohibited by law from purchasing or processing firearms or ammunition due to a domestic violence conviction in a court martial while in the United States Air However, the Air Force failed to record the conviction in the FBI NICS database.  That is why this House, this Congress, this majority acted. We put the Fix NICS bill in December--it is sitting in the Senate--which would strengthen our background check system and make it more accurate. It would require Federal agencies to certify twice per year that they are uploading criminal record information to NICS, requiring agencies to establish an implementation plan to ensure maximum coordination and reporting of records. Now you are on record to voting against that.  We have another bill on the floor from a former sheriff from Jacksonville, He is looking at school violence. Let me walk you through that one.  As I mentioned, Congress will vote next week on the STOP School Violence This bill is proudly supported by Sandy Hook Promise, who note that it will ensure that millions more schools will be trained in prevention and lives will be saved.  Now, this isn't the only thing we are doing. Just this week, we are having oversight. We took the Oversight and Government Reform Committee in this Congress and the Judiciary Committee in this Congress this week, and brought the FBI in, and they will come back again; because there is not one person in America who wants to see what happened in Florida to happen again.  But let's walk through this situation, because I think it is important that we examine it because we want to solve these problems. There were multiple red flags that were raised to the FBI about the behavior of Nikolas  The very first red flag: On September 25, 2017, a YouTube channel host took a snapshot of a comment under his video that said: ``I am going to be a professional school shooter.'' He sent that comment to the West Virginia FBI tip center, where all tips are supposed to go, which deemed it a credible threat and opened an investigation.  FBI agents searched for files on Nikolas Cruz, but they were unable to identify the individual and did not even reach out to YouTube in an attempt to recover records on Cruz, so on October 11, 2017, the FBI formally closed the inquiry. That was one red flag, but that is not where it ended.  A second red flag: On January 5, 2018, a second tip came via a phone call to the FBI from a concerned family member. They described in detail problems with Cruz he was showing with regard to social media, cruelty to animals, school trouble, and dealing with a recent death in the family.  When the FBI searched the database again for Nikolas Cruz, the previous tip popped up. However, despite the call from a family member, from a previous red flag, from a YouTube comment from the individual himself that he wanted to be a professional school shooter, they closed the investigation. The shooting happened on February 14, 5 months after the first tip.  This House has not stopped to act. This House acted in The background checks have to be fixed. That is why we passed it and put it into the That is why we are taking up more action now for the schools and adding that to what we already took up in this Those aren't insignificant.  I believe there is a path forward. Just as we did all appropriations bills, just as we have been through numerous meetings when it comes to DACA, there is not one child in jeopardy today. The only jeopardy that we will have is if we don't get together and solve the problem.  We have narrowed it to four areas. You and I know what has been said in those meetings. You and I know where it is. We can find compromise. We can solve this problem. But let's make a pledge to the American public that we don't do a bill for the sake of something politically. We create law that solves something so we are not back here in a future Congress taking up the exact same issue putting other people in jeopardy. That is my promise, and that is what I will continue to work for.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks to the  ",CREC-2018-03-08-pt1-PgH1489.txt,566,HONORING DR.

Mr.Speaker, I didn't hear a word about a bill that has the majority's support on the floor of the House of Representatives that I spoke about, and that is Hurd-Mr.Goodlatte, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee said if Goodlatte was put on the floor, it will lose 50, 60, 70 Mr.Goodlatte said that, and that was passed out of the Judiciary It hasn't been brought to the floor because it would fail.  Hurd-Aguilar, which has not been considered by the committee, but which has the majority of votes on this floor, that bill has not been brought up; just as the bill that passed the United States Senate 5 years ago, to deal with so many of the problems that immigration confronts us with, including security at the border, 5 years, has not been brought up. March 5, nothing happened. Come and gone.  The majority leader spent a lot of time, Mr.Speaker, talking about things that are important but were not on the subject because he doesn't want to deal with the subject. Apparently the Republicans don't want to deal with the subject and they won't put it on the floor. They are obstructing the will of the American people and they are putting thousands and thousands and thousands of people at risk.  The majority leader, with all due respect, is wrong. All of the DACA recipients are not protected, and many of them are not signing up again because they are afraid their government will come after them. They feel they were flim-flammed.  I disagree with the majority leader, Mr.Many of us believe what the President did is absolutely legal. It is consistent with what Ronald Reagan did, with what George H.Bush did, with what Bill Clinton did, and what George Bush did.                              {time}  1130  Every President, since I have been serving here, has modified immigration consistent with their executive authority. There was nothing mentioned about the quote of the Speaker that was clearly directed at this young woman to say that revocation of protections for the Dreamers brought here as children will not be carried out.  Nobody can sign up for DACA protection now under the court order--nobody. You can re-up, but you can't sign up--1.8 million. The President of the United States, Mr.Speaker, sent a message down here, or maybe he tweeted it, they would agree to 1.8 million and a pathway to citizenship, parenthesis, if you agree with this, if you agree with that, if you agree with the other.  That is not what was said at the White House, Mr.I agree with the majority leader. He brought up some other points, said we need to agree to discuss those. I agreed to discuss them. I didn't agree to agree to them, nor did anybody else in that room. And the President of the United States, 25 Members of the House and Senate sitting around the Cabinet table, said: Are we agreed that we are going to solve the DACA issue first?  Not a single Member demurred. Not a single Member said no--not a single one, Mr.Speaker, yet we can't get that bill to the floor. And the majority leader says: Oh, well, we are bringing up a bill that will create jobs.  I am for doing that. And, frankly, if we do that the week after or the week after that--frankly, I don't know the bills well enough to be speaking about them with much depth of information as to how they were voted on in committee, but my inkling is that the majority Democrats--I don't know what is in there, in these bills--may well have voted against them. Most of those bills coming out of committee are pretty partisan.  We didn't discuss the three bills that I brought up. The majority leader didn't mention them. They have bipartisan support on two; and one, the chairman of the committee admits, does not have the votes on this floor. He would get no Democratic votes, and he would lose a substantial number of Republican votes, and the majority leader knows that, Mr. And we talk about I want to fix I don't want concealed carry to be part of that. And I regret that the majority leader would not agree to let's fix NICS and put the Rutherford bill through. That would pass the Senate, but he has got a bill over there he knows won't pass the Senate but maybe it makes a good talking point.  Mr.Speaker, I don't know what we have to do. We have been waiting a long time, not just the 6 months since September, waiting for March 5 to come and go. We have been waiting for a long time to have bills on the floor with an open amendment process so we can, in fact, do the people's will on immigration and on protecting our students and our families and our citizens from the irresponsible use of guns.  We are not against the responsible use of guns. We believe the Second Amendment protects people on owning handguns and hunting guns; but the Supreme Court, in the Heller decision, said there are things that the community could do. There are things that the government can do to protect its people and to make sure that gun use, within the framework of the Second Amendment, is responsible.  I don't know what we have to do, Mr.I don't think anybody doubts that the Hurd-Aguilar bill has the majority votes in this I would urge people to, if they believe in this issue, sign a discharge petition. They refused to bring the Export-Import Bank bill to the floor for 1\1/2\ or 2 years. Some of the leadership weren't for it. As a matter of fact, the two highest weren't for it. But 127 Republicans to 117 Republicans, they were for it, and over 300 votes were for it, and they would not bring it to the floor short of a discharge petition.  That is not transparency; that is not openness; that is not taking the tough issues head on. That is obfuscating. That is undermining democracy in the people's If the gentleman wants to respond, I will yield to him. If not, I will yield back the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I actually have the same question. I don't know what we have to do.  You know, we come here quite often to have these colloquies. They are supposed to just be for what is happening the next week, but we talk about more issues. For a long time, I heard: What about the Children's Health Insurance Program? You know what, this House brought it up early. We tried to work through committee. The Speaker knows how many times I went on the other side.  They wouldn't even let their committee work on it. So what did we do? We took the ideas that the Democrats had, we put it in the bill; we passed it bipartisan; they still said no. They didn't say no once, they said it numerous times to the Children's Health Insurance And I sat here wondering: What more do we have to do?[[Page H1494]]  Disaster relief. I know, Mr.Speaker, the heart of the minority whip. We went together to Puerto We went together to the Virgin We went to What more do we have to do? Then we brought it to the floor, and he still said no. But you know what? We still got it done.  Government funding. He started this whole discussion about government funding. He misspoke and said it was because of the Democrats that we were able to make this plan. He said a majority of them; and it was not a majority, it was a minority.

But that is not the point, Mr.The point is not what we have done in the past--particularly what we have done. And we all are for That is not the point. The point is we have two critical pieces of legislation this House must address and that the overwhelming majority of the American people think we ought to address and think we ought to pass and are for. And I don't mean 51 percent or 52 percent of them. I mean 86 percent of the people or more. It is not a close question.  And rather than talking about, well, we did this, we passed 5,950 bills, I am not talking about those bills. I am talking about bills we haven't brought to the floor, Mr.Speaker, that we haven't allowed the House to consider; that we have hundreds of thousands of kids, young people who we respect and who are teachers, are doctors, are workers in our factories making a difference, working in restaurants and hotels.  I was with the Chamber of Commerce in Maryland just the other day, and three different CEOs came up to me and said: We have got DACA people working for us and doing an excellent job, and they are worried that they are going to be kicked out of the only country they know.  But we talk about NICS, and we talk about this, that, and the other. Bring those bills to the floor. That is what we are asking for. We want that respect. We want that respect for this institution.  Mr.Speaker, I am going to yield to the majority leader again. It is those two bills that we believe would pass with significant majorities in this House--the three bills, and we can choose between them. We have offered the queen of the hill, with the explanation for those who may be watching and not bored stiff. One of those three bills that I have mentioned, one a Republican bill, the other two bipartisan bills, Ros-Lehtinen-Roybal-Allard bill and the Hurd-Aguilar bill, both of those bills are bipartisan. Certainly one of those will get a significant majority of this House, and I am not denigrating the bills.  I may or may not be for them that are on the schedule, but there are no issues that the country feels are more important right now than background checks, and there is no issue more timely than fixing--as the Speaker pledged to do 14 months ago, putting at risk that young woman and hundreds of thousands of other individuals in our country similarly situated. That is what we ought to be doing.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to my friend.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I know you reclaimed your time the time before, but let me finish what I was saying.  With all due respect, what do we have to do? Yes, we have Fix NICS sitting over in the And, yes, we are going to add to it for school violence. We know that it does not have to be partisan, but the background check system is broken. Let's not make it partisan. Let's get it done.  When it comes to the challenge for DACA, we are just down to four items. Border security. Not one person in here would probably argue against that. And I know my friend across the aisle, Mr.Speaker, I know his heart. He is a good man. He was, as he stated earlier, majority leader. They had the majority here. They had 60 votes over in the They had a lot of Members in the Senate, and they had the Same problem at that time, too. They did not fix it.  I don't want to be in that same place in the future. My commitment is to fixing this problem. So let's sit down. Let's talk about border security, but let's make sure our borders are actually secure.  When I look back--and people talk about that Gang of Eight bill--you put more money in there for border security than was even being requested today. But people still, on the other side, say no, Mr. But the other point, too, is, if somebody comes from Mexico or Canada and illegally comes across the border, why are they sent back to their country but everybody else is not? Let's secure the border correctly. Then, when it comes to really protecting the nuclear family, why don't we make it a little faster that you could have your children and your spouse with you? And do you know what that would do? I think that would make everybody a little stronger.  When it comes to the idea of coming to America, should it just be the luck of a lottery, or should it be merit? I think merit is a fairer process for everybody's opportunity.  Now, I don't think anybody out there that is listening or can hear this later would say those are partisan ideas. But when we sat in the White House and we discussed it and we said let's narrow it to those four items, I know the way our government is designed.                              {time}  1145  It is not designed that one person gets all their way. It is based upon compromise.  This city, our capital, was because of a compromise. The creator of the banking system, Alexander Hamilton, made this our capital. George Washington, our first President, never served here. He was sworn in on Wall Street and served his second term in  As my good friend knows, Mr.Speaker, when a bill comes out of committee, it gets worked on, then it is brought to the floor. That is exactly what is happening with Mr.Goodlatte today, so we can bring something to the floor and pass it, that everybody, hopefully, can vote for.  This Congress has acted on so many items, but so many times this year it has felt like the election has never ended. I know the heart of many of the Members on the other side. They wanted to vote for disaster relief. They were so frustrated that they shut the government down.[[Page H1495]]  Do you know what? We have all learned from that lesson before. It is not productive.  I also watched people when they talked about health facilities. They wanted that funding, but they couldn't vote for it.  Then they said the whole problem was, when we brought all 12 appropriation bills to the floor, that they couldn't vote for them because they needed a budget agreement. They needed more money. So, yes, it took a long time to work that out because you want to hold that with other issues as well.  Finally, after the shutdown, that was able to be broken apart. But when we finally got that budget agreement that really is negotiated by both sides, even the individual on the other side of the aisle, Mr.Speaker, came to the floor and said she was going to vote ``no,'' but she negotiated and wanted to tell how she got victories inside the bill.  That is not compromise. You can't sit in a room and say, ``Okay, I will give here and you give there,'' and based upon the formation of our government, with the Senate as well, we come to an agreement.  Mr.Speaker, I don't know what goes on in people's minds and why they wanted to be there. I will make this promise to the American public: I will stay in the room, I will take the ups and downs, but at the end of the day, I want to solve a problem. I don't want a political bill.  I will tell you this, Mr.I have been in the room many times with this He said on this very floor, he went beyond For those in the American public must understand. It is a much higher number. And for him to find that compromise, he just asked for three other things. That doesn't mean we are going to get them all, but that does mean we could find compromise in those three.  Mr.Speaker, the one sad part, if we had this debate with the American public, they would find compromise with those three items. They would probably find it very fast. They would want their borders secure; they would want the nuclear family closer together sooner; and they would probably want to see some merit.  So I know there are times here that we get heated, but the majority of bills that pass this floor are bipartisan.  As I stated earlier, more than 200 of those more than 400 bills that are sitting in the Senate passed by voice, all the Democrats and all the  We are going to differ on some items, and that is right. I want you to keep your principles. But there is a window, and there is an opportunity. And I know, as the days get closer, the election will be sooner, but let us make a promise to one another.

1726,topic-id,776,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Colorado because I have all of the same questions and all of the same concerns, and so it is very appropriate that we are coming together to ask what are they afraid of, what are they hiding, because there are a lot of red flags.  Last night, Mr.Perlmutter, I was at the Washington Press Club event, which is a fun event to celebrate the free press. The best joke of the night--and there is a lot of humorous material. The best joke of the night was when someone said, for a guy that claims he doesn't drink, President Trump sure loves a lot of White That brought the house down.  Unfortunately, though, it is not really funny because, when you have got a President who won't impose the sanctions that we authorize him to impose, who won't direct his State Department to spend the funds to protect our election system that we authorize and appropriate, when you have all of these other problems, it is not clear that he is able to do his job without fear or favor, and that is a big problem for our democracy and for the interests of our country.  If Congress were doing its job right now, we would be asking the hard questions to bring forward the transparency that the people need, to give this country the assurance that their government officials, including their President, can perform their job without fear or favor. But, unfortunately, this body is not doing a very good job of asking those hard questions, so that is, in part, why we are here trying to raise some of these issues.  One of the very important questions that I think we have to ask involves the ties between the NRA, yes, the National Rifle Association, and this Trump Russia scandal. Specifically, we need to know whether Russia worked through the NRA to illegally move funds in support of the Trump campaign.  Here is what we do know. We know that McClatchy and others have reported that the FBI is actually investigating whether Aleksandr Torshin, deputy governor of Russia's central bank and NRA's main liaison in Russia, used the NRA to funnel millions of dollars to support Donald Trump's candidacy in 2016.  We know that in 2016 Donald Trump, Jr., had dinner with Torshin, who is a close ally of Vladimir Putin--also someone accused of money laundering--and they had that dinner at the NRA convention.  We know that the NRA spent tens of millions of dollars on the 2016 elections, including $30 million to support Donald That is three times what the NRA spent to support Mitt Romney when he was the Republican nominee just 4 years prior.  So we need to think about and ask this question: Where did all that money come from? We have asked the The NRA won't tell us.  Now, we know that in testimony to the House Intelligence Committee, there are indications that Russians made a very concerted effort to work through the NRA, and that is why Senator Ron Wyden has asked the Treasury Department--again, because the NRA won't answer these questions, but he has asked the Treasury Department for more information about suspicious Russian funding of the  So just to recap a few of these things that we need to be asking about: We know how close President Trump is to the We know how close the Russian banker Alex Torshin is to the We know how close the NRA is becoming, closer and closer, to  In fact, I have a piece here that explains how, in 2015, a series of top NRA officials--including one of their top donors, past presidents, a delegation that included Donald Trump's high-profile surrogate, Sheriff David Clarke--all went on a so-called fact-finding mission involving gun rights in  Now, there aren't a lot of gun rights in Russia has very restrictive gun laws, and there is no serious effort in the country of Russia to change that. But, nevertheless, apparently this group felt they needed to go to Russia for this fact-finding trip to cozy up with some of these same folks that we are talking about. So that is one of the things we know and we need to ask questions about.  We know that the NRA spent this huge cache of money on the 2016 campaign to support Donald Trump, and we know that we have more questions that need to be answered. So we need to follow this money, and we need to find out, again, as you have asked here on the floor: What are they hiding? What are they afraid of?

I would also like to point out that this identical language has been included in the bipartisan regulatory relief bill that the Senate is expected to take up maybe sometime this week.

For example, this is important if Federal banking regulators are going to be prudent stewards of Federal deposit insurance. However, this does not mean that the Federal banking regulators need regular reports about every single data point on every single financial institution.  Unfortunately, the reporting burden has grown significantly over the years, which means banks have to spend more time with compliance issues rather than working with families and businesses to meet their financial needs.  When I introduced similar legislation last Congress, one community banker in Illinois, Greg Ohlendorf, with First Community Bank and Trust, shared with me: ``The quarterly call report has increased to some 80 pages supported by almost 700 pages of instructions, and it represents a growing burden on community banks.''  According to a survey that the Independent Community Bankers of America conducted of its members in 2014, over 60 percent of the annual cost to prepare the call report goes to personnel salaries. This survey shows that this is not a highly automated process for those institutions and that oftentimes senior executives such as the chief financial officer are responsible for this regulatory burden.  We also heard testimony in the Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee hearing from Robert Fisher, president and CEO of Tioga State Bank, on behalf of the ICBA, who stated: ``When I first started in banking in the mid-1980s, the report was 18 pages long. No change in our basic business model since that time warrants the sharp growth in our quarterly reporting obligation.''  The length of the call report has simply gotten out of hand. Washington needs to get out of the way so that community banks can focus on meeting the needs of their communities. The role of smaller financial institutions is especially important in more rural areas, such as in my district, where larger banks tend to not have as many branches.  The Community Bank Reporting Relief Act would require Federal banking regulators to permit for a short-form call report every other quarter for banks with less than $5 billion in assets and that satisfy other criteria determined by bank regulators.  Federal banking regulators have not demonstrated there are statistically significant variations in this data quarter to quarter, and we heard testimony consistent with this from Tioga State Bank in the House Financial Services This means the banking regulators are simply collecting too much information too frequently. The Federal banking regulators would be required to take input from our neighborhood banks under consideration when making these changes. This cannot be simply check-the-box exercises, but real reform is necessary.  However, nothing in this legislation would prevent regulators from having access to the information that they need to adequately understand the health of the banking system. Regulators will still receive the most important information every quarter.  The Independent Community Bankers of America has suggested this short form call report include three schedules: schedules RI, an income statement; schedule RIA, changes in bank equity capital; and Schedule RC, the balance sheet.  Furthermore, in the event there is any reason for concern about the health of the bank, regulators would maintain their authority to make ad hoc information requests.  This legislation is supported by the American Bankers Association, the Independent Community Bankers of America, and the neighborhood banks in all of our districts who are looking for commonsense regulatory relief.  I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this legislation. We must cut regulation for community banks.

1092,topic-id,523,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Congressman Mitchell for yielding.  Illinois is a high-tax We have seen Illinois State taxes continue to go up, so it is a welcome relief that Congress has brought Federal tax relief to the people of Illinois, and especially I am grateful for the residents of the 14th Congressional District, the suburbs of Chicago, who are seeing great relief and especially the benefits that come to small businesses, truly the energy and the engine behind Illinois' economy.  They are going to receive immediate benefits from a reduced tax burden and more flexible accounting rules. I am also pleased that the final version of the legislation included this portion of my bill, which was to lower taxes on Illinois' largest employers, which is small businesses, and it is called the Bring Small Businesses Back Tax Reform  Further, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced corporate tax rates to 21 percent and includes provisions to deter U.companies from moving their headquarters and investments abroad and encouraging them to bring income and jobs back home again. Again, this is welcome news for Illinois residents.  Numerous companies who employ residents of the 14th Congressional District have announced new investments and new hiring and giving more money to their employees, wages, bonuses, trainings, and more. Just a sampling of these are: AbbVie, American Community Bank, First Midwest Bank, EMKAY, Boeing, U.Bank, Wells Fargo, Wintrust Financial, Home Depot, Walmart, CVS, and  American manufacturers are hiring more workers. In my district, a Geneva manufacturer has already brought on two new employees to manage the equipment the company invested in under the new expensing rules. A Will County food distributor plans to hire two new employees in 2018, with the money the company saved through tax reform, and the list goes on and on.  Mr.Speaker, it is time Americans were given the truth about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Eighty percent of U.households will see a tax cut in 2018, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, but only 17 percent of Americans actually think they will.  In fact, the bill lowers individual rates for low-and middle-income Americans across the board and doubles the standard deduction for both individuals and families. If you are one of the 70 percent of Americans who currently take the standard deduction, getting an immediate rate cut and a doubling of the earnings you can keep tax free will make a big difference to you and to your family.  This bill does not cut Medicare, Medicaid, or Social Security, period. This bill does not get rid of the medical expense deduction or the charitable deduction. Those are protected and expanded. The bill did not take away healthcare from Eighty percent of the people who pay for the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate tax are families making less than $50,000 a year. This bill gets rid of the individual mandate penalty so struggling families aren't burdened by yet another tax.  It is clear: the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is already delivering positive results to Illinois individuals, families, and small businesses; and to Americans everywhere. It is good news, and more good news is coming.  ",CREC-2018-03-06-pt1-PgH1424.txt,2015,SOCIAL MEDIA USE IN CLEARANCE INVESTIGATIONS ACT OF 2017,2018.0,6.0,March
1551,topic-id,479,"Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Barr for yielding.  Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of H.2226, the Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access Act, and I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation.  This is something that Chairman Barr has worked on for at least two Congresses now, and I feel that we are finally in a place where we can get some commonsense changes to the CFPB's qualified mortgage rules that provide relief to community banks and credit unions.  I was very pleased to see this legislation get a unanimous vote in the Committee on Financial Services earlier this year. I am also very happy to see that the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs is taking note of this issue and has advanced similar legislation.  The Dodd-Frank Act required the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to come up with a series of new rules regarding mortgage lending. One of these rules was the so-called qualified mortgage rule, which provides a safe harbor to loans if they meet certain criteria prescribed by the This effectively means that the market treats any loans that are not qualified mortgages as being much riskier.  The Bureau's rule is especially challenging for community banks and credit unions. These lenders do not tend to be as automated as larger financial institutions. They also tend to put more time into underwriting mortgages to reflect the unique circumstances of the customers in their communities.  However, the CFPB's qualified mortgage rule took away much of this flexibility from these lenders by doing things like instituting a 43 percent debt-to-income ratio. This might be a good indicator of repayment risk for a lot of mortgages, but a one-size-fits-all is almost never a good approach.  The CFPB's rule also did not acknowledge the fact that small lenders do not tend to sell these loans into the secondary market. They keep 100 percent of the risk on their portfolio. This means these lenders have a very strong incentive to issue loans that they believe will be repaid.  If loans held on portfolio can be treated as qualified mortgages, then these banks and credit unions will have a stronger incentive to manage any risk associated with these mortgages.  The Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access Act would treat loans held on portfolio by community banks and credit unions as qualified mortgages if they meet some other criteria, such as not having a negative amortization or interest-only features.  This change to the CFPB's qualified mortgage rule will go a long way towards simplifying how our community financial institutions can help families achieve the dream of home ownership.  I have been hearing about this legislation from community banks and credit unions in Illinois, and I am confident it will help my constituents.  Madam Speaker, I want to encourage all of my colleagues to support this important legislation.

31,topic-id,2795,"Mr.President, this is going to be kind of a strange statement to make. I have great regret that I am going to have to vote for this bill when it comes up--and I am talking about the spending bill--and I don't like it.  I went through a lot of years as being--in fact, since I have been here, I have been ranked with the three most conservative Members every year--more times than anybody else has. I am looking at this right now, and I was listening to some of my colleagues who are concerned about the spending, and no one is more concerned than I am about the spending. We have a problem, though, that a lot of people don't understand.  I have been on the Senate Armed Services Committee for 24 years in the Senate, and I was on the same committee in the House before that, and I have never seen anything like this. We went through things back in the Carter administration where we had a hollow force, and then Ronald Reagan came along in 1980, and we rebuilt our military. Everybody knows that. They knew what was happening. A hollow force is not good. A hollow force means we can't really fight a war. Certainly we can't do two contingencies simultaneously, as has been our policy for a long period of time. And that is what we got into back then. Now, this hasn't happened since 1980.  I chair one of the subcommittees, and we had the vices in--this was at the end of the Obama administration--and the four vices of the services all said the same thing: We are in a position now where we have a hollow force like we had back in the late seventies.  The public doesn't know this, and our press doesn't talk very much about this. They talk about all the problems that ring the bells and sell the newspapers and all of that, but they don't want to talk about the military. This is the reality of what we are faced with right now.  General Dunford is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of He said that we are losing our qualitative and quantitative edge in That means we have two great forces out there--one Russia and one China--and they are passing us up. Right now, both China and Russia, with the artillery pieces they have on tanks, can fire eight rounds a minute. Do you know how many rounds we can fire with ours? Four rounds a minute.  We got ourselves into a position where we had our ground brigades of the U.Army--this was at the end of the last administration--of our ground brigades, only 30 percent of them could be deployed.  I don't like to sound like I am being partisan when I talk about Barack I respect him in one area, and that is, he was admittedly a very proud[[Page S1927]]liberal, and proud liberals don't care that much about a defense system. They think that if all countries will stand in a circle and hold hands and unilaterally disarm, all threats will go away. So we went through that, and people didn't seem to care.  There is this myth out there that somehow we are stronger than everybody else, that the equipment we have is better than anybody else's. During that same timeframe, our air brigades--only 30 percent of those were working. The marines who use the F-18s--62 percent of the F-18s couldn't fly. One of the things that happen when the military goes down--the first thing that goes down is maintenance, and then, of course, you have modernization, and that is where we got way down behind.  Don't take my word for it. Right now, we have 27 Members on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and they understand this. They know where we are on this, but a lot of the other people don't. They have their interests. If they had a strong interest, they would probably be on the committee, and they are not.  Secretary Mattis said:       Our competitive edge has eroded in every domain of      warfare--air, land, sea, space, cyberspace--and is      continually eroding. America has no pre-ordained right to      victory in the battlefield.  That is Secretary Mattis, who is the Secretary of  Army General Allyn said:       We've had most of our modernization programs on life      support for the last several years. Currently, our      modernization is 50 percent of what it was in 2009.  This is a good quote, too. This is from Navy Admiral So this is not just me saying this; this is where I got the information about the Hornet fleet. The Hornet is the F-18. He said:       For our entire Hornet fleet . . . we have 62 percent that      are not flyable. More than half. We're double where we should      be in non-flyable aircraft.  General Walters said:       I can tell you today we cannot [fight two conflicts]      simultaneously.  That is supposed to be our policy, that at a minimum--ever since World War II--we would be able to and have the capability of fighting on two fronts simultaneously. We can't do it.  General Wilson:       We're at about 50 percent readiness today, across the Air      We [were] . . . the smallest Air Force ever in 2016,      when we bottomed out at 310,000.  I could go on and spend a lot of time talking about this, but I can't find anyone in the military who disagrees. That should be a foregone conclusion if our own military--they are the ones who are responsible for protecting my 20 kids and grandkids from enemies.  I just got back from the South China We have a lot of really good allies there. We have the Philippines, South Korea, Guam, Japan, and They have been our top allies, but do you know what is happening in the South China Sea? China is out there doing something totally illegal. They say that they are reclaiming land. They are not reclaiming it because they don't have it to start with. They are creating land that is out there in the seaways that we need to defend America and to keep our commerce going, and they are building islands. Right now they are up to over 3,000 acres of islands. This is China we are talking about. What are they doing over there? They have runways. They have rockets. They have military equipment. There is nothing there except military equipment. It is almost as if they are preparing for world war  So where are our allies? We talked to our allies. They are embarrassed because they are not sure whose side they are going to be on. In fact, it is almost as if they put this in on purpose, where you would have the Secretary of Defense or the Minister of Defense, in whichever of these countries I mentioned, on one side saying ``Well, you know, the threat is not all that great,'' and the other one is saying ``Yes, you have to do something because the world is coming to end.'' Well, they are on both sides of this issue.  It is fascinating. It is almost as if they got together, and they are doing it by design. Has this ever happened since World War II in our country? No, it hasn't. That is where we are right now.  We have problems that are facing our military; they are very real. This is something that has to be fixed. This bill corrects a lot of these things. We have defense now up to $700 billion. I am going from memory here, but I think the last request that came from President Obama was $548 billion. This is $700 billion. We are rebuilding. We are trying to address the threats from both Russia and  By the way, I want to mention that there is one other threat in that same area where we were, in North I am sure everyone knows who Kim Jong Un is. He is the head guy of North Something happened on November 28. On November 28, he fired a rocket that had a range that could reach the United States of It could certainly reach where we are today. Some people say that can't be true. All they can say is--they fall into two areas of disagreement. They say: Yes, he has the range to reach us, but he couldn't carry a payload. We have no idea what payload was on this rocket that he sent. Let's assume there is no payload at all. It would be a matter of days before they make that up. Then they said that he couldn't reenter. Reentry is always a problem because to reenter you have to come in and have some level of accuracy. So you can't reenter there without accuracy.  Well, what difference does it make if they have a weapon that could take out a city the size of Louis? It doesn't really matter where it lands, so that is a hollow argument. The power is right there.  I have to compliment our I hesitate doing it this way because a lot of people don't understand. Remember when Kim Jong Un made the statement in which he said: Ah-ha, on November 28 I showed that I could reach the United States of America, and therefore I have a button I can press, and I could take out an American city--or words to that effect.  Instead of the policy of appeasement that we had for 8 years prior to this President coming in, this President said: Yes, and I have a button. It is bigger than yours. Ours works, yours doesn't, and we will blow you off the face of this That doesn't sound diplomatic does it? It is not. That is what is good about this He is not afraid to stand up and be strong. The policy of appeasement hasn't worked. It has never worked.  So what happened? Hours after he made that statement to Kim Jong Un, Un called South Korea and said: You know, we have changed our mind. We are going to send people to the Winter  Wow, that is a major change. I can remember saying that in one of our own committee hearings, and even our own Intelligence Committee said: Well, he didn't really mean it. It was just a matter of days after that when he called and said: We want to negotiate, sit down and talk to President Trump, and we will even put things on the table, like denuclearizing. This is going to happen.  That is another threat. What I am trying to get across is that those threats are there. In my opinion, that is something that is actually working.  In this bill, we have $700 billion. We have $61 billion over the enacted levels of fiscal year 2017. We have a 2.4-percent pay raise for our kids out there. We have $11.5 billion for missile defense.  One of the areas where I was most critical of the last budget that was put together by President Obama was missile defense. If there is ever any time in the history of this country where we have to have missile defense, this is it. They are out there right now. They have the capability; they have missiles that will reach us. We need missile defense.  We have ground-based interceptors. I was just in Alaska the other day. They now have 44 ground-based interceptors up there. What is really interesting about that is we had 44, and then the last President came in, and he knocked that down to 32, I think it was. Then, as soon as this President came in and looked at it, he went back to 44. Now we are looking at 20 more.  Is that going to give us the redundancy to protect my 20 kids and grandkids from somebody coming in? Well, it is a lot better than it was, and we are getting all kinds of new equipment in order to try to knock down--the big mistake we made in this country was when we were planning to put ground-based interceptors in Poland, in[[Page S1928]]the Czech Republic, and a radar there that would protect the eastern half of the United States and Western That was already started when Obama came into office. In his first year, he pulled that program down.  One of the persons whom I have always liked over there is Vaclav He was the When I was over there, I could remember so well saying: We have to have your cooperation, the Czech Republic, to protect  He said: Are you sure? If I do this and I outrage Russia, they are going to be angry and take every step against us they can. You will not pull the rug out from under us?  I said: Absolutely, we are not going to pull the rug out from under you.  That is the first thing Obama did when he got into office. That is a problem we shouldn't have.  The threat is there. We are trying to meet the threat. This bill meets that threat. It gets us back to the amount of money that should have been left in missile defense. It is in there right now.  We have another $11.5 billion for missile defense, and it is a 44-percent increase from 2017. The O&M budget right now is increased. The total budget is going to be $238 billion. That is to offset the losses today that the O&M budget has created.  This budget that we are going to be voting on is a big budget. Those of us who are going to be voting for it are getting criticized. I will say this: The liberals all like it. They like to spend money. Conservatives don't. I don't like to do it.  That is all in this bill--57,100 troops over Obama's 2017 cut. We were not going to have--anyway, this is why we absolutely have to do this.  I look and I see that it would be nice if we had the comfort of believing that America is still the strongest out there, that we have everything we need, but we don't.  So let's look at what we are going to be doing. The Army, from a high point of 566,000 soldiers during the surge in 2007--Obama reduced it to just over 460,000. Thirty-three percent of the brigade combat teams didn't work. The aviation combat teams didn't work. We are on the road to recovery on this because we did a supplemental. We all remember that. But it is this budget that is going to bring us back, and we will end up having our military in the position that the American people think it is in right now.  I was on a TV show just a few minutes ago, and they said: Well, you know, with all this debt that is coming with this, and you are talking about the military--isn't that a good tradeoff?  I said: You can't trade off something when you see the threat that is out there, which is unprecedented in the history of this country, and you have 20 kids and grandkids to protect. No, that is not a good tradeoff.  I am hoping that those individuals who are conservatives--and I can't imagine that anyone on the Senate Armed Services Committee who deals with these issues on a daily basis would not want to get in there and make America strong again. We can do it, but if you don't vote for this, it is not going to be done. That is the great fear that I have.  I hope the conservatives out there--I know for a lot of us, ratings always happen. You cast a vote, and they say: Ah, that is spending a lot of money. We are going to rate against you. Again, it is a tradeoff. It is defending That is the one thing we should be doing.  I would give anything if we could just pull that element--all that we are doing for the military--out of this budget and do it individually. Let me stand up here and read the riot act about what is happening in this country, the debt that is accumulating, but, unfortunately, I don't have that option today.  We have one vote where we can do it. That is going to be the vote that we do, hopefully, tonight. I am not sure when it is going to be. I just ask my colleagues to understand the threat facing our country--in my opinion, the greatest threat we have ever had.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

5,topic-id,2245,"Mr.President, on the 23rd day of March, 2018, just a little over 2 weeks ago, Zell Bryan Miller of the State of Georgia--former Member of this body, former Governor of the State of Georgia, former State senator in the State of Georgia, former chairman of the Democratic Party in the State of Georgia--who contributed immensely to his State, passed away at his beloved home in Young Harris, GA, in Towns  I am here to pay tribute to Zell and his life and his contributions to our country, both for a purposeful reason, as far as a fellow Member, but also for a very personal reason for me, because he is an individual I met through politics, became one of my best friends through politics, and probably had more influence personally on my life than anybody else I know in public service.  As I said, Zell died in Young Harris, GA, the home of Young Harris Zell Miller was, first of all, a teacher and a writer. He wrote over 10 books. He taught. He was educated at the University of He taught at Young Harris He always taught throughout his career. Even as Governor and Lieutenant Governor, he was an instructor and a teacher. He was professorial, but he was tough as nails. There was only one way to do it and that was the Zell way, he used to say, and he knew how to get it done.  He was for four terms the Lieutenant Governor of He then ran for Governor in 1990. I happened to be his opponent in 1990, and I will get to that in just a minute. He won that election. It was pretty close. It has gotten a lot closer since then. Pretty soon, when I have grandchildren, I am going to tell them all I won. So far, that is not the case. But he won, and he was elected twice to be Governor of  As Governor of Georgia, he embraced education as a major issue. As I said, he was a teacher and was all about teaching. He did something that nobody had ever done and in numbers that were very impressive. He created what is known as the HOPE Scholarship, funded by the Georgia A lot of lotteries have been passed and a lot of liquor referendums have been passed by promising people that the money was going to go to education, but it never really did. In Georgia, the way it was done is that it came out of the debates that he and I had in our race for We finally passed a constitutional amendment to allow legal gambling in Georgia and then passed the HOPE Scholarship, which was where the money went. We tied up all the money made from the lottery separately for three things: college scholarships for eligible Georgia students, 4-year-old voluntary prekindergarten for Georgia pre-Ks to the age of 4, and technology and innovation and wiring and infrastructure in our public schools.  The election was in 1990. He was elected in 1990 as the Governor of He served two terms, but by the end of the decade, the lottery had passed. Since its passage, 1.8 million Georgia children have gotten their college education--1.8 million--and 1.6 million Georgia 4-year-olds have gone to prekindergarten voluntarily. Georgia's public schools are wired. They are on the internet. We deliver content through distance learning. It is at the leading edge of technology in public education of any State in the country.  Now, politicians can take credit for a lot of things, but I don't know of anybody who can take credit for 1.8 million college degrees, 1.4 million prekindergarten programs, wiring schools for the information technology of the 21st century, and doing it all based on a personal effort and commitment to see to it that the more we are educated, the better the State will be.  I said that Zell was an author. He was an author and a marine. He served in the Marine Corps from 1953 to 1956. He wrote a number of books about the Marine He wrote a number of articles about the Marine He wrote one book called ``Corps Values.'' The values he learned in the Marine Corps he used throughout his life in education, as Governor, as a father, and as a family man.  Zell's wife is Shirley Shirley is a wonderful lady, and I got to be with her a little bit 2 weeks ago during the services. Zell and Shirley are Georgia's forever first family, not just because they were Governor and first lady together and Lieutenant Governor and first lady together but also because Shirley was a partner with She wasn't just his wife. Shirley worked tirelessly for Zell and for the State of Georgia, and to this day, she works tirelessly for our During Zell's more difficult years--over the last few years having the difficulties he had healthwise--Shirley was there to be with Zell every single day.  Zell Miller came to the Congress of the United States in a very unique way. Paul Coverdell, who had the seat that I hold today, died. Paul was a He was in his second term as a Roy Barnes was the Governor of Georgia, a Democrat, and when Paul Coverdell died, Roy Barnes called Zell up, who was then the immediate past Governor, and said: Zell, I need you to go to Washington and serve for me because the body is getting pretty close politically up there. We need to make sure a Democrat is in that place to replace  I wasn't involved in the conversation because I was hoping they were going to call me up, which I will get to in a minute. They didn't, but they did later. But they hadn't done it at that time. Roy said to Paul: You just have to do it for me, Governor You have to make sure that Georgia stays  Zell went on public television and said: I want to accept this appointment to the U.Senate to fill this seat, but I am going to vote like Paul  He knew how important Paul's service had been in the He knew the conservative movement had taken the State and was moving in that direction. Zell was a man of conscience and principle who recognized the importance of the U.Senate seat, but, more importantly, he recognized the wishes of the voters. He told Roy Barnes, he told me, and he told everybody in the State: I am going to take it, but I will vote like Paul  When that 4 years was up of finishing that term of Paul Coverdell, Zell Miller decided not to run again. I was in the U.House at that time, and he ran a press conference here in Washington to say: I will not seek reelection. That was in 2003.  I got on the phone, called my wife, and said: I am going to go see If he is not going to run, I am going to run for that seat. That would be a good way to end my career and make a contribution to my  I called Zell, and I said: Governor, can I come to see you this weekend in Young  He said: Yes, come on.  So I got in my pickup truck, which is a good way to drive in North Georgia, where a pickup truck is a standard operating vehicle. It was kind of a snowflake morning in North Georgia and the North Georgia mountains in Young I sat down with Zell at the fireplace, with Woodrow and Gus, the two dogs, talking about politics. Finally, I got around to the subject of saying: Well, Zell, the reason I am here is that you announced that you are not going to run for reelection. I want to know if you have any issue with my running to replace you.  He said: Put your shoes on, son. You can win that seat. Let me know what I can do to help you.  I have never forgotten the encouragement, never forgotten what he said, and never forgotten the challenge I felt I had to thank the guy who had beaten me for Governor in 1990--to make a[[Page S1999]]statement like that when I was going to seek to replace him in the U.Senate 24 years later. It made a lot of difference to me in my life.  Zell was a unique individual, and there has never been one like him. He was a Democrat the day he was born, and he was a Democrat the day he died.  A lot of people remember he wrote a book, ``A National Party No More,'' which made a lot of Democrats mad. He spoke at the Democratic National Convention and made a lot of Republicans mad, and then he spoke at the Republican National Convention--the only elected person in history to deliver the keynote address at both national conventions, Republican and Democratic--not in the same year but in the same decade.  Zell said what he thought, he thought what he said was right, and he delivered on everything he ever said, and if he ever was wrong, he apologized. In his latter years, he appointed many of his former opponents to offices of importance in our  For me, this is the first time I can publicly say thank you to Zell I know he is looking down, and I hope he is listening to what I am about to say.  When he beat me in 1990 and when I ran to replace Sam Nunn when Sam stepped down in 1996 and lost that seat as well, I thought I was through with public service. I had made my best effort and done as well as I could serving in the legislature but couldn't make it to that higher place.  After I had run for Sam Nunn's seat, about 2 months after the race was over, Zell called me up, in August 1996, and said: Johnny, I have a problem. I have a Republican State school superintendent and a Democratic legislature, and they are fighting like hell, and I can't solve the problem. But if I name you as school board chairman, then you can come over here and balance this out, get the politics out of it, and help to solve the problem.  Governor, I appreciate that, but I know what happens on a school board: You have 11 members on the board. I am chairman, and there are 10 other people who vote. You can't change 10 people's minds unless you know who those 10 people are.  He said: You tell me who else to appoint. I will fire the others and appoint the new people. Come over to the mansion.  So I went over to the mansion, and we sat there with his operator at the telephone desk and for 2 hours called people I knew I could trust and believed in to help me with public education. I asked them to serve with me on the State board of education, take it over, clean up the mess which had taken place and which Zell acknowledged thoroughly.  I accepted, he made the appointment, and over 2 years, we had a remarkable time period. In large measure because I thought my political career was over, I didn't think about what I was doing as much politically as I thought practically for kids. Zell wanted very much to see public education as the apex of his career, and so he wanted to make sure in that second term, it was. I accepted. He worked hard. We joined together, and we--to this day--had a great period of time for public education in our State in terms of improvement, cashing in on the HOPE scholarship, and doing all the things that we did later on.  I could go on and on, but I will just say this: I have worked with a lot of people, and I have known a lot of people. I have never known a better one than Zell I have never known anyone more true to their word, more solid to be counted on, who accepted their oath of office and every responsibility that went with it, who would say they were sorry when they needed to say they were sorry and would fight like hell when they needed to fight like hell and would never take no for an answer if they wanted you to do the right thing for the State of  For me on this night in Washington, DC, having gone to the funeral of my dear friend Zell Miller, having shared with his family and many others who loved him as I have over the years during those 2 days in Atlanta, let me close by saying that one of Georgia's greatest citizens and probably our greatest Governor, Georgia's first family in perpetuity, Zell and Shirley Miller, will be missed greatly by our State and will be missed greatly by me.

619,topic-id,968,"Mr.President, it is an honor for me to come to the floor of the Senate and talk for a minute about my friend Thad I know everybody has probably said everything that needs to be said; just everybody hasn't said it yet. Kind of in the vein of what Senator Blunt said, everybody says the same thing about Senator Cochran: He is gracious, smart, gentle, effective, and a great colleague.  I want to tell my colleagues about Thad When I came to the Senate 14 years ago, I had served in every legislative body I could be elected to where I live. I served in the Georgia House, the Georgia Senate, the U.House, the U.Senate--all representative legislative bodies. In each one of them, I got some advice.  My first year in the Georgia House, 41 years ago, I got some very good advice. A good friend of mine said: Johnny, I will tell you what you do. The first year you are here, don't say a word. Just watch everybody talk. Watch what everybody else does. Look at people you would like to be like, and for the remainder of your career, be like that person, because in the end, this business is about relationships and effectiveness, not about bluster and bragging.  I did pick out a guy; his name was Carl Carl Harrison has since passed away, but he was one of the best friends I have ever had in life. I watched him in the Georgia Legislature, and I patterned myself after Carl Harrison, and the success I had was because I followed a great leader like him.  When I got to the U.Senate, I knew I needed leadership. I knew I needed to find a book or something to tell me how to be a good I remembered I said: You know, I am going to sit in this body. I have 6 years in this term. Surely I can take a few months for the first year and kind of figure things out.  So I started watching. I could see the characteristics and the quality of each and every individual in the Senate, and everybody offers unique gifts that they have given to this body. I kept watching Thad He was respected. He always had time for you. He never let you know he had been here a lot longer than you ever thought about being here, maybe even longer than you had been born. He listened to you, and if you asked him a question, he gave you an answer.  So I called my wife and I said: Sweetheart, when we come back to Washington next week, I want to take Thad Cochran to dinner because I have decided he is the guy I would like to be most like.  I am not making this up; this is exactly what happened.  So we went to Ocean Thad, I don't know if you remember that night. It was pretty crowded. Thad is not a loud guy, but when Thad walks in a room, it gets a little bit quieter because everybody knows wisdom has arrived. My wife and I enjoyed that dinner that night, and we became great friends.  We had a number of issues on which we engaged each other over the course of the years, and on all of them, I think we were on the same side--except catfish. I think I got it wrong on catfish, and I apologize for that, but I tried to redeem myself.  The highest compliment I can pay is to say that I wanted to be just like Thad So in the 13 years since that dinner at Ocean Air and in everything I have done and tried to do in the Senate, I have tried to be like Thad  Mark Twain once wrote: When confronted with a difficult decision, do what is right. You will surprise a few, but you will amaze the rest.  When we have tough decisions to make, when somebody has to cut to the[[Page S1898]]chase and point you in the right direction to get the job done, it is Thad Cochran whom you want in your foxhole. He is the perfect example for me of a noble life and a noble leader.  I have a favorite poem. It is in a book called ``Leaves of Gold'' from the Methodist I think that poem applies to Thad Cochran better than any words I can say. The poem goes like this:     I'd rather see a good person     Than hear about one any day.     I'd rather have a good person walk with me     Than merely show the way.     For my eyes are better pupils     And more willing than my ear.     And fine counsel is confusing     But example is always clear.     And the best of all the people     Are the ones that live their creeds.     For to see the good in action     Is what everybody needs.     While I'll be very glad to do it     If you'll let me see it done;     But I can watch your hands in action,     But your tongue too fast may run.     But the lectures you deliver     May be very wise and very true;     But I'd rather get my lecture     By observing what you do.     For I may misunderstand you     And the high advice you give;     But there's no misunderstanding     The way you act and the way you live.  Thad, you have blessed us all by the way you act, the way you live, and by the example you set. May God bless you and your family. I wish you the best. And may you always come back, because if you ever need me, I will be right here for you because you have always been there for me. God bless you.  I yield the floor.

Mr.Emory Schwall is an outstanding Georgia attorney who has practiced law in our State for 68 years. In 1950, at the age of 21, he was admitted to the Georgia Bar after attending the Emory School of Law and graduating from the Woodrow Wilson Law School in  Emory Schwall has served as special assistant attorney general for the State of Georgia representing the insurance commissioner. He is a certified estate planner and mediator, a member of Atlanta Estate Planning Council, the Atlanta Bar Association, the Georgia Bar Association, and the American Bar He also is a member of the Emory Law School  As impressive as Emory Schwall's professional legal career has been, his impact on one of Georgia's finest not-for-profit hospitals is probably one of the areas of work of which he is most proud. The Shepherd Center in Atlanta specializes in medical treatment, research, and rehabilitation for people with spinal cord injury, brain injury, multiple sclerosis, spine and chronic pain, and other neuromuscular conditions. Founded in 1975, the Shepherd Center is ranked by U.News & World Report as among the top 10 rehabilitation hospitals in the Nation, and it has grown from a six-bed rehabilitation unit to a world-renowned, 152-bed hospital that treats more than 8,500 patients each year.  Emory Schwall has been active with the Shepherd Center since its inception, helping it obtain grants and bequests, and he has led capital campaigns and other initiatives that have helped its growth. He served on the original board of directors for the Shepherd Center He has also served as vice president and as a director of Shepherd Center, Inc., from 1987 until 2017.  Emory Schwall has also served his church Trinity Presbyterian Church since 1956, not only as a parishioner, but also as a deacon, an elder, and as chair of its finance committee.  An appreciation for the preservation of history led him, as president of the Atlanta Medical Heritage, to donate the Academy of Medicine building, a designated historical landmark in Atlanta, to the Georgia Tech Foundation to ensure funds for the restoration and preservation of the building.  Further, Atlanta's Piedmont Hospital has benefitted from Emory Schwall's generosity and service, including serving as an active member of the Friends of Piedmont Hospital charitable arm.  Emory Schwall also is active with national charitable and civic organizations such as the American Heart Association and the Arthritis  His dedication to service earned him the ``Greater Good Award'' from the Georgia Planned Giving Council in 2009. This annual award is presented to an individual whose career is currently focused on advising individuals, attorneys, financial planners, insurance counselors, trust officers, accountants, and other financial advisers for obtaining charitable contributions, and a ``Greater Good Award'' recipient must have served to increase the quantity and quality of planned gifts to charities in  Emory Schwall is truly a great Georgian, and I am fortunate to call him my friend. He, along with his wife, the late Peggy McCready Schwall, shared a love of service to others. Their three sons and four grandsons are proud to have such wonderful examples to follow, and as we celebrate his 90th birthday, I hope Emory enjoys many more years in our State and with his family.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-07-pt1-PgS1450.txt,1608,"ECONOMIC GROWTH, REGULATORY RELIEF, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT--MOTION",2018.0,7.0,March

1052,topic-id,1579,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Congressman Raskin for his leadership on the Progressive Caucus and for his leadership on the Judiciary Nobody understands the Constitution better than a constitutional law professor.  I appreciate you bringing the reality of the situation to us. Nobody is talking about trying to take guns away from everybody. We are talking about making sure that we have safety with anybody who owns a gun and that we have the ability to check any of the dangerous contexts for which guns can be used. We have a responsibility, really, to protect our country, to protect our young people, and to do something for all of the families that have been affected by gun violence.  In addition to all of the things that he mentioned, we need to consider gun violence as a public health crisis. That is what it is. And when we look around at the millions of people who are dying from gun violence, you think about this, and you think about the way in which we treated vehicle fatalities as a public health crisis and we instituted laws around seatbelts, and the way we thought about smoking as a public health crisis and we instituted laws around smoking. But, in order to do that, we had to first do research into those areas and figure out what were the best ways for us to move forward as a country in preventing those kinds of fatalities that are preventable.  Unfortunately, what happened in this country is that Congressman Dickey, some time ago, passed an amendment called the Dickey amendment. While it didn't explicitly prohibit research into gun violence, it all but did that.  There have now been many, many calls to repeal the Dickey amendment. Interestingly, Congressman Dickey passed away last year, last Before he died, in 2012, he actually came out on the record and said that he wished he hadn't been so reactionary, that he wished he hadn't passed that amendment, because he realized that it did lead to a chilling effect on research into gun safety. The way that it did that is, when they passed the amendment, it essentially said that no Federal funds should be used for advocacy, but, at the same time, the amount of funds that were used for research were cut by exactly that amount.  So this is not about advocacy; this is about how do we protect our country, how do we treat this as what it is: a public health crisis.  Mr.Speaker, I am here to say that I am really proud of my home State of Just yesterday, we became the latest State to ban bump stocks. And we also had a senate committee pass a bill to mandate that people purchasing rifles go through the same background checks required for pistol purchases and that we increase the legal age to buy rifles to 21.  So, in less than a month, my home State has finally advanced meaningful proposals to prevent gun violence. I wish I could say that we were doing that here in I truly believe that there are Members on both sides of the aisle who would like to pass sensible gun safety regulations and legislation.  Unfortunately, I feel like we are being held hostage not by the reasons that we all came to Congress to get sensible things done that protect our constituencies, but by lobbying interests in the National Rifle Association; and every time there is a small movement towards progress, somehow they come in and, essentially, squash those efforts.  In October of last year, Congress stood by after 58 people were killed and over 500 injured at a music festival in Las One of my constituent's, Zach Elmore, sister was shot. Luckily, she was one of the lucky ones who survived the shooting.  I read a letter on the floor that Zach had read to me--it was an incredibly moving letter--about his deep anger and frustration at Congress for not protecting his sister and millions like her, those who were not as lucky as she was.  In November, Congress failed to act, after 26 people were killed and 20 injured at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas; and then a few weeks ago, on Valentine's Day, as we all know, 14 students and 3 teachers were killed, and 15 injured, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in  Already, in 2018 alone, there have been 2,581 deaths because of gun violence, including those precious lives that were lost at Parkland; 105 of those deaths were children ages 11 and under.  Let me just say that one more time: 105 of the 2,581 deaths, this year alone, were children ages 11 and under.  As Members of Congress, we need to make sure our kids are safe.  I am so grateful to the energy and the commitment and the passion and the smarts and the organizing strength of the Parkland students, because, as you say, they were not first graders who couldn't organize for themselves. They are students who are soon going to be voters. And they understand that they can't vote right now, but they also understand that they do have a voice, their parents' vote, and they can make sure that people across the country understand that we have a responsibility to them, to our children, to the people across the country who are afraid of sending their kids to school.  That should be our number one priority is keeping our kids safe. Our kids should be able to walk into schools knowing that they can fully focus on learning. Our parents shouldn't have to wonder whether their kids will come home from school.  My heart goes out to the families that lost someone in the Parkland shooting and all of the shootings across the country. I am proud to stand alongside incredible young people who wasted no time to demand action and justice for their friends and teachers. They are determined, they are brave, they are unafraid, and they are depending on us to pass meaningful legislation to end gun violence.  One of the interesting things that I heard them say when I met with them is: We are not looking for the whole package. We just want to see steps along the way that show us that it is possible for us, on a bipartisan basis, to make some progress on this critical issue, to make sure that no child, no parent, no community, ever again, has to experience the unspeakable tragedy of another school shooting.  I am tired of seeing men, women, and children die because the gun lobby puts profit over people. That is not, as Mr.Raskin so eloquently said, what our Founders intended by the right to bear arms. Support for stricter measures to prevent gun violence is at an all-time[[Page H1471]]high, on a bipartisan basis. Eighty-seven percent of gun owners and 74 percent of NRA members support commonsense solutions like criminal background checks.  I have a plea for gun owners across the country. My husband used to be a hunter. We had guns at home. And I understand the need for people to have guns for recreational purposes, to ensure their own safety. But this is not about that. It is not about taking guns away from people, who legitimately exercise responsible behavior. It is about making sure that we have the protections in place so that no more children, no more people die.                              {time}  1715  So here is my plea for gun owners: urge the NRA to represent your views, show them that you mean business, maybe even consider terminating your NRA membership if the organization continues to advocate against these kinds of sensible gun reforms.  Here in Congress, I hope that we act now. I really truly believe--and I have talked to some of my Republican colleagues who also want to do something about this. They don't want to be hamstrung. They want to move legislation forward, but not by attaching legislation that actually loosens gun restrictions into legislation that helps us.  We need just one or two pieces of commonsense gun reform legislation so that we can show these young people that we are responding to their pleas: no more shootings in schools, no more shootings in places of worship, no more shootings in our streets, no more mass shootings, period.  Let's show these students and students at schools across the country that we are not afraid to protect them. Let's show them that we can choose our country over the gun lobby. Let's stand with our kids. Let's pass commonsense gun violence prevention legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I join Mr.Raskin in hoping that in the Judiciary Committee, which is the committee of record for this issue, that we can at least have some hearings on this.  What is so problematic about having a hearing on public health research into gun violence? What is so problematic about having a hearing on multiple pieces of legislation that have bipartisan support? Isn't that what we are supposed to do? I know that is why I came here.  I am a first term Member, and I know our speaker is as well, and I believe that we have much more in common than we do that divides us.  We don't have to necessarily tackle every piece of this, but let's make some substantial progress forward together, and let's show our students that we will protect them.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman again for his leadership.  ",CREC-2018-03-07-pt1-PgH1469.txt,2332,PORTFOLIO LENDING AND MORTGAGE ACCESS ACT,2018.0,7.0,March

All we are asking is, what this bill would do is allow terminal patients who have no other options--they have exhausted all treatment options, they do not qualify for a clinical trial, they are near death or, according to the House bill, subject to severely premature death. It just gives those individuals the right to choose for themselves, not have a faceless bureaucrat at the FDA make that decision.  We passed this unanimously from the good efforts of my colleague, the Senator from Indiana, who will speak shortly, but also Senators Alexander and We spent many hours in discussion crafting a bill that passed unanimously.

This is what Matt Bellina said in testimony:       Please let them know that I have had ALS too long to meet      the exclusion criteria for any promising trials. No drug      company will offer me treatments under the current expanded      access guidelines. Two reputable companies have already      indicated that they would try to treat me under the rules of      this bill. A vote against this is essentially a vote to kill      me. It is a vote to make my wife a widow and leave my boys      fatherless. I can't stop anyone from voting that way, but      please ask them to have respect to look my family in the eye      when they cast their vote.  Frank Mongiello is another victim of I just met with him a few hours ago. I first met with him when he could speak--he can no longer speak--but he spoke at our press conference, and here is his quote. He paraphrased Abraham Lincoln and he said:       President Lincoln said, ``If I am killed, I die only once;      but if I dread it, I die over and over again.''  Frank went on to say:       I have an 80-percent chance to be dead in 2 years, and, for      me, seeing these potential drugs out on the market and not      being able to take them is like dying over and over again.  The final namesake of this bill is little Jordan We met him when he was 6 years old, and now he is 8. His mother Laura is a tireless advocate. I know the Senator from Indiana knows the McLinns well.  The FDA advisory committee on April 25 heard from, I think, 55 witnesses about a drug called eteplirsen to treat Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. The advisory committee, having heard from people like Laura and Jordan McLinn wanting access to that drug, voted no. Fortunately, the FDA--and this is pretty rare--overruled the advisory committee, and Jordan now is at least being treated. They are tireless advocates for Right to  These are the people we need to help. These are the people whom Right to Try was meant for.  I don't know why it took the House 7 months to craft a bill and finally vote on it. I can't tell you how many people during that 7 months sought treatment in other countries. I can't tell you if anyone during that time period possibly lost their life because they didn't have access to treatment. I don't know why the House felt compelled to change the bill that we carefully crafted that passed unanimously. I don't know why they simply didn't take up the Senate bill and pass it, but I do know Right to Try saves lives.  I will quote one example, Delpassand, a courageous oncologist from He was engaged in an FDA trial treating an aggressive form of endocrine cancer. It was working. So he petitioned the FDA to allow additional patients to be added to the trial. The FDA said no, but Delpassand had a Right to Try bill in It didn't have liability protection. He risked his career and all of his possessions and he signed up additional people under the Texas Right to Try laws.  In the end, he signed up 176 people. We just checked with Delpassand, and 148 of those individuals are still alive today because of his courage. That is why we need to pass a Federal Right to Try law, so individuals with that level of courage don't risk their careers, and those patients have a chance to live.  I would like to yield to the Senator from Indiana for his remarks.

303,topic-id,3610,"Mr.President, first, let me begin by expressing how honored and humbled I am to be a Member of this body and to represent the great State of  Fresh out of law school in 1979, I began my career right here, working as staff counsel to Senator Howell Heflin on the Judiciary From when I served as a staffer, there are only three Members of the Senate who continue to serve today--Senator Leahy, Senator Hatch, and Senator Two of those three, Senators Hatch and Cochran, will be retiring this year--Senator Cochran, in just over a week--and a grateful nation thanks them for their service.  For me, personally, I am honored to have come full circle with them, from a young staffer to a junior colleague, and I wish them well in their life after the  I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for welcoming me to this body, many of whom are here with me today, braving the wintery weather outside. Thank you for your friendship, your advice, and your willingness to include me and my staff in the great work you are doing.  I particularly want to thank my senior colleague from Alabama, Senator Shelby, and his staff. I appreciate their graciousness and patience in helping me as I navigate my new role as a freshman  I thank my family: my amazing wife Louise; incredible kids, Courtney, Carson, and Christopher, who so fully supported me in my quest to reach the Senate but more importantly in my life. I have grown with them and certainly because of them; of course, my sister Terrie; wonderful parents, who I am blessed to have around today; and my grandparents who are not. They instilled in me the values of family, faith, patriotism, respect for others, and a work ethic that has guided me throughout my life.  Finally, I would be remiss if I did not take this opportunity to pay special tribute to my mentor and former Senator whose seat I now hold--the late Howell Heflin of He was a remarkable man whose large, lumbering frame and southern drawl would often mask his amazing intellect. His compassion and sense of justice for his fellow man forged a path for myself and so many others who worked for him over the years.  He came to the Senate in 1979, at a time when bipartisanship was more than just a campaign slogan or a sound bite. In those days, when Senators spoke of bipartisanship, they truly meant it. They would never compromise principles but would compromise with their colleagues on the serious issues of the day in order to move this country forward.  By the time he left the Senate in 1997, Senator Heflin sensed a change in the political climate, and he was concerned about it. In a parting essay he wrote:       Our Constitution itself came about through a great series      of compromises; it was not written by ideologues who clung to      ``their way or no.'' Compromise and negotiation--the      hallmarks of moderation--aimed at achieving moderate,      centrist policies for our country, should not be viewed as      negatives.  This leads me to the reason I rise today. I want to speak about an issue that has evaded the broad bipartisan discussions and moderation that Senator Heflin spoke of. Instead, it seems to have been an issue where folks quickly take sides and often criticize those with whom they disagree.  It is time that we have a serious, pragmatic, and practical discussion--not a debate or negotiation but a dialogue on the steps that we can take to reduce the harm caused by gun violence in this country.  I know with just those words, people across this country may have already started reaching for their phones to start tweeting or posting without another word and without knowing where I might stand on this issue. That just seems to be the way it is in America these days, which is so unfortunate, because once you take a side, it is hard to come off.  In the wake of yet another mass shooting and the rising voices of young people across the country, it is our responsibility and our duty to have a serious discussion about guns and gun[[Page S1862]]safety, but that conversation has to be twofold. We must acknowledge the deadly consequences that can follow when a gun is in the wrong hands but also recognize and respect the freedom to own and enjoy guns by law-abiding citizens, as guaranteed by the Second Amendment of the Those two concepts are not mutually exclusive.  Before I jump into the actions I believe we can take today, I want to go back and explain a little bit about where I come from.  Growing up in Alabama, I learned to shoot from my father and grandfather. I was not much of a hunter in my youth, but whether it was cans or bottles on a tree log or the occasional skeet, we simply enjoyed shooting and always had a few guns in the house. The distinction between a hunter and someone who just enjoys guns and shooting is significant.  To this day, I still have my father's old .22 rifle, my grandfather's pistol that he gave me, and a couple of rifles and shotguns I got as presents as a kid, but my interest in hunting began to grow when my youngest son Christopher was born, 20 years ago this past At an early age, he was fascinated with guns and hunting, so with my wife's blessing, I took up the sport so he could learn gun safety and conservation from me. Today I think I am more passionate about it than he is.  I consider myself an avid hunter--deer, turkey, quail, whatever the season might be in With the campaign last year and transition into this office, this past deer season was somewhat of a bust for me, but with the start of turkey season, I am anxious to get back into the woods.  Frankly, I also enjoy guns. I enjoy shooting them. I like how they are made, the power, and their history. I own many of them, all stored in a locked gun safe that, quite frankly, is larger than what my wife initially approved of a number of years ago. Collecting them and shooting them at the range or hunting is a bond I share with my son Christopher and with many of my friends.  So while I know that guns and gun control are difficult issues in this country, I can tell you they are complicated for me, too, but as a U.Senator today, a Member of the legislative branch of government, I have many obligations, and I believe the first obligation of government is to protect its citizens.  We spend unimaginable amounts of money fighting our enemies abroad and terrorists who would attack us at home. Yet, on many levels, we fail our children and grandchildren every morning when we pack their backpacks and send them into harm's way or when they pick up what they think is a toy or a really cool weapon that they have seen on television or in the movies and it turns out to be a killing machine that they should have never had access to and don't know how to handle.  We fail the abused women, men, and children of our society when we let our family and relationship problems lead to a murder.  We fail parishioners in church, employees at work, and concert and theater goers when they are caught off guard by a hail of bullets from a disturbed individual.  We fail those who are simply in the wrong place at the wrong time when street violence breaks out and a stray bullet takes an innocent life.  We fail veterans and others in society suffering from depression and post-traumatic stress and other mental disorders who decide that life is simply not worth living.  We fail people of every walk of life, of every age, and in every corner of this country, every day.  Gun deaths continue to rise. In 2016, over 38,000 people died in this country because of gunfire. Almost 15,000 of those deaths were homicides. Almost 23,000 were suicides--epidemic-type numbers--and nearly 500 were accidental.  We have failed in Alabama, too. In the last few weeks, we lost a police officer in Mobile who was shot and killed when responding to a domestic dispute. We lost a 1-year-old boy who was accidentally shot in the back by his 2-year-old brother with their parents' gun. We lost a beautiful, young 17-year-old girl who was about to head off to college because one of her classmates brought a gun to school and he was showing it off when it was accidentally fired.  We lost a dedicated nurse at UAB Highlands Hospital when a disgruntled former employee showed up at the hospital and opened fire.  Just yesterday, as I was finalizing these remarks, I learned that a former client of mine was shot and killed by his girlfriend's brother as he was picking up his 3-month-old baby from a visit.  The list could go on. Similar tragedies take place every week in every one of our  These stories don't grab national headlines, but they are examples of the gun violence that has become commonplace in our communities.  In 2016, Alabama had the second highest rate of gun deaths in the That means that 1,046 Alabamans were killed by gun violence that year. Worse yet, our gun deaths increased by a staggering 34 percent between 2005 and 2016.  As a former prosecutor, I worked closely with law enforcement. I have seen firsthand what weapons in the wrong hands can do to families, communities, and society. When I was a U.attorney, we had a program called Isolating the Criminal Element, and we tried to crack down on illegal weapons in our communities.  As most of you know, my career has been defined by prosecuting the killers of children. It was September 15, 1963, when a bomb placed outside the ladies' lounge window of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham exploded, killing four beautiful young girls. I wish I could turn back time and do something that would have prevented it altogether. Had I or anyone else, at that moment, it might very well be one of those young girls giving this speech today and not me.  I stand in that moment now, and so do you, and so does our country.  I believe we have finally reached a tipping point regarding gun violence now--not because of the shooting in Parkland, FL, but thanks to the millions of young voices across this country, led by students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High  Much like the students who took to the streets of Birmingham in 1963, who were attacked by firehoses and police dogs, who awoke the conscience of America to civil rights, these young men and women are awakening the conscience of America regarding gun violence. I am pleased that one of those young men, Alfonso Calderon, of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, is with me here as my guest in the Gallery today.  We could spend days in this Chamber debating the meaning of the Second We could let our Nation further divide itself while more lives are lost. We can fret about what people are saying about us on social media or whether we might lose campaign contributions. We can again choose the path of inaction in the face of yet another mass shooting and expect different results, or we can take another path.  Let's find what we can agree on, act on it, and begin to make our country a safer place. We can be reasonable here because we all want the same thing--a safer country, a safer world.  At its core, the Second Amendment was an effort to protect Let us do the same.  But in order to do that, we need to build more trust in this body and encourage camaraderie. More importantly, we need to fundamentally change the way we talk about difficult issues in our country and set an example for our fellow Americans to follow and to dial down the rhetoric.  Remember that ``for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction'' is not just one of Newton's laws of motion, but it is also one of political rhetoric. Extreme views promote equal but opposite extreme views.  For those who want more gun restrictions instead of focusing your energy on banning a certain weapon--which, frankly, as a practical matter, just simply cannot pass this Congress--focus instead on efforts to keep those weapons and others out of the hands of those who would do us harm. You can't simply demonize the NRA and pro-gun groups.  While I know that these groups sometimes take what many, including me, consider extreme positions, they also represent millions of law-abiding gun owners who are concerned that their[[Page S1863]]right to bear arms is  at risk. For millions of Americans, gun ownership and enjoyment is a cultural issue with deeply held beliefs. Addressing that issue is simply not like regulating stock transactions or cutting taxes.  To those who would seek to maintain the status quo, like the NRA or anyone else, please stop using scare tactics to try and convince law-abiding gun owners that the Federal Government is hell-bent on taking their guns away. That is simply not going to happen and everyone knows it.  We also need to get past the idea that more guns in society will make us all safer. The statistics and the data simply do not support that. We don't need guns in the hands of schoolteachers.  Simply having more ``good guys with guns'' is not a solution. Americans just simply do not want to return to the days of the Wild  This topic, like so many others, has become a space that is less about having a thoughtful conversation and instead has evolved into a clash of cultures. As leaders, we must reject the ``us against them'' mentality because, ultimately, we are all Americans who are united by a common bond of shared values and love of country.  There will always be forces that seek to sow division and discord. Our challenge and our mission are to prevent them from succeeding.  We can seize this moment by changing the conversation in our country. Let's start a productive dialogue and work toward a comprehensive bill that includes ideas that we should be able to agree on. There are already a half dozen proposals in this body that have bipartisan support. My friend from Connecticut, Senator Murphy, outlined them just the other day, but they bear repeating here.  Ban bump stocks and make it a crime to possess and manufacture them, as Senator Feinstein has proposed. The President and the Department of Justice should be commended for taking the first steps through regulation, but the Senate of the United States of America should go on record about this deadly accessory.  We should pass the Fix NICS legislation proposed by Senators Cornyn and The NICS system is only as good as the data that goes into it. Their bill would block bonus pay for political appointees who fail to upload records to the NCIS system and reward States that follow the uploading plan. It would create a ``domestic abuse and violence prevention program'' to give States the ability to share information to prevent someone convicted of a domestic violence crime from purchasing a gun. Fix NICS is a good start toward overhauling our background check system and, as Senator Murphy said the other day, it is a good base bill on which to build.  But, frankly, we have to do more on background checks. We have to require background checks on all gun sales, whether it is at a gun show or over the internet or between individuals. It can be as simple as going to a licensed dealer or a local police station to have a background check run on a prospective purchaser or a transferee. It may be inconvenient, but it will save lives.  With universal background checks, however, I would also suggest a couple of companion measures. For instance, in my view, it is entirely appropriate for a family member to sell or give a gun to another close family member, as they should be presumed to know whether their relative is prohibited from having a gun.  We can consider other exceptions for those who can produce a valid concealed carry permit or between law enforcement officers. But in carving out those exceptions, we should also increase both civil and criminal penalties for anyone who knowingly transfers a gun to a prohibited person and provide the necessary funds to the Department of Justice to prosecute those individuals when appropriate.  We can also take steps to deter prohibited individuals from even trying to purchase a gun. Senator Toomey's NICS Denial Notification Act would allow reporting to State and local authorities when someone has tried to purchase a gun and has been denied, and it would require DOJ to report to Congress on such prosecutions. To his credit, Attorney General Sessions has announced that the DOJ will vigorously prosecute those who make false statements in connection with their background checks. We should ensure that he has the resources to do so.  We should close the so-called Charleston loophole, as proposed by Senator This loophole allows a purchaser to receive a firearm after 3 days, regardless of whether their background check has been completed or not. We can create certain exceptions for concealed carry permit holders and others, but no one should be allowed to take possession of a firearm until they have cleared a background check.  Current law prohibits a firearms dealer from selling a pistol to anyone under the age of 21. That has been the law for many years, without any real challenge. The same logic behind this prohibition should apply to the sales of pistols and semiautomatic weapons to those under the age of 21.  Senator Klobuchar has filed a badly needed piece of legislation to expand the definition of domestic violence to include dating partners and eliminate the ``boyfriend'' loophole that allows certain dangerous individuals to access guns and evade laws meant to protect domestic violence victims.  We can implement at least a 3-day waiting period for the purchase of any pistol or semiautomatic weapon, and we can increase penalties for those who steal firearms. States that have implemented waiting periods have seen significant decreases in suicides.  We can also repeal the Dickey amendment and open the door for new research on gun violence prevention. No one--no one--is happy when innocent people die because of a gunshot, and law-abiding gun owners should not be afraid of studies on how to reduce the number of gun deaths in this country.  We can do more to stop mental health issues from turning dangerous by allowing law enforcement or family members to seek a court order when an individual poses an extreme danger to themselves or others and prevent them from getting access to firearms. Senators Feinstein, Blumenthal, and Graham have all proposed versions of the extreme risk laws.  For too long, gridlock and partisanship have stood in the way of compromise. But I didn't come here to do nothing, and I don't think any of you did, either.  Today we face a difficult problem but not an insurmountable one. To find solutions, we must demand courage of ourselves and one another.  As history has shown, we face greater consequences with inaction--certainly greater consequences with inaction on gun violence.  So I have asked all of us to consider this question: What is our collective legacy as representatives of the American people and the Members of this hallowed institution? I believe it is to leave this body and our country better than we found it. We can only do that if we rise together to confront the unknown.  I have given talks all over the country about the prosecutions of the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing, and I am always reminded of a passage from the poem ``The Cure at Troy,'' which was written by the Irish poet Seamus Haney as a tribute to Nelson My friend Vice President Biden often quotes this passage, where Haney wrote:       History says, don't hope on this side of the grave. But      then, once in a lifetime the longed-for tidal wave of justice      can rise up, and hope and history rhyme.  With the convictions of two former Klansmen for the murder of those four young girls, the longed-for tidal wave of justice rose up, and hope and history rhymed in Birmingham,  For me, and I hope for you, when I walk the halls of the Senate Office Buildings and I come through those double doors onto the Senate floor, I realize that every day we, as a collective body, have that same opportunity. Whether it is for Dreamers or voting rights or victims of sex trafficking or, in this case, our children who are demanding action on gun violence, we have the opportunity to build that tidal wave of justice and have hope and history align. But we have to have the courage to seize the moment.  I don't have all the answers on how to do it, but I am willing to work with each and every one of you to find them because that is why we were sent here--to find those answers, so that the tidal wave of justice will rise up.[[Page S1864]]Please, let us work together to make it happen sooner rather than later.

We are going to take care of your wounds, so stay      calm okay, Lex?'' My eyes dart around the room searching for      my partner, but he's not there and no one can interpret my      thoughts.       Later, I'm released from the hospital and well enough to      travel so they transfer me from Iraq to a U.Marine Corp      base in Albany, I really miss my partner, I      know something has happened to him because he would never      have left me alone for so long.       Yes, my name is I'm a seven year old German shepherd      Military Working Dog, service number My master and      loyal partner is Corporal Dustin Jerome Lee, 20 year old U.     Marine Corps canine handler from Quitman, I'm      well disciplined to my master's commands and expertly trained      to sniff out bombs and explosives. Where's my master, Dusty,      my partner? No one can understand me but Where's      Dusty?       Iraq was to be my last combat tour before retirement. Dusty      talked to me all the time about going home and adopting me. I      sure do miss him. He is the best friend I've ever had. I love      that crazy Marine from Mississippi!       No one can measure the love and unconditional loyalty I      have for I'd sacrifice my own life for him and he      knows it. I just wish I could have stopped that RPG or pushed      Dusty away from that powerful blast. It all happened in a      blink of an eye and I didn't see it coming until it was too      late. Now I sit alone in my kennel-run waiting for the day      Dusty shows up.       The U.Marines are treating me very well. I get enough      food and water and exercise each day. And the veterinarian      comes by to examine my wounds on a regular basis. I just      can't sleep well at night. I wake up to every little noise      and I think about Where can that Marine be?       The nights are long. The days turn into weeks. Still no      Dusty! My wounds are healing and my hair is growing back. The      pain is still in my back but I can walk okay. I have a piece      of shrapnel near my spine that the veterinarians avoid      removing for fear of worse complications. I have spent twelve      weeks in rehabilitation after my surgery and declared      physically unable to perform in a combat zone.       One of the dog handlers gave me a real good bath and      grooming. I felt so refreshed because I was on my way to meet      Dusty's family. Maybe Dusty will be there waiting for me.      When I arrived I sensed something was not quite right. Dusty      wasn't there and everyone was sad, but very happy to greet      me. I then realized that I was attending Dusty's funeral.      Everyone showed up to pay their respects.       Dusty is a real American hero and he was buried with full      military honors. I was so proud to have been his last best      friend and[[Page H1534]]     partner. At one particular moment of total silence during the      ceremony, I sniffed a slight scent in the air that was very      familiar. It smelled like I figured he sent me a      signal that he knew I was there! I wagged my tail and moaned      a sigh of grief that he would only hear and understand. I      just about lost my tail in that horrible explosion and the      veterinarian fixed it so it still wags okay.       I was greeted by the Lee family with joy in their hearts.      The picture is of Dustin's mom, Rachel, and me in church. It      felt so warm and comfortable to be with my partner's loving      family. I wanted to stay but I was escorted away after the      funeral and back to Albany, What is going to happen      to me now?       Wait a minute! I was due for retirement, right? Why did the      military take me to see Dusty's family and not leave me      there? I belong with them in Mississippi not here in       The Lee family adopting me would not be too much to ask      considering they will never again see their son, grandson,      brother, nephew and friend. Adopting me will keep a big part      of Dusty's life alive for them and for me. I will enable      Dusty's family to experience what he already knew about me. I      loved and protected him everywhere we went and even on the      battlefield in It's time the U.Marine Corps allowed      Dustin's family to adopt me. I'm not a young pup anymore, you      know! I'm a senior of retirement age. I want to spend last      years of my life with the Lee family. It's where I now      belong!       It's been eight long months since we buried my partner,      Dustin, and all attempts by the Lee family to adopt me have      failed. The Marines have placed me back on duty training new      recruits. My back bothers me some but I'm an expert on the      job. It's the recruits that have a lot to learn about keeping      their eyes on me and understanding my body language. Dustin      and I bonded as a team and our minds were always in sync.       There has been a turn of events in my adoption. U.     Congressman Walter Jones of North Carolina heard my story      and immediately contacted the U.Marine Corps Commandant at      the Pentagon in Washington D.requesting my urgent release.       The Marines really showed off their compassion for the Lee      family and me too! They even dispatched a veterinarian to      give me a complete final medical examination. I feel a sense      of excitement I haven't felt in a very long time. I even have      a prance in my step!       That's a Christmas picture of me and Dusty in Iraq,      December 2006. That's me smiling with the Lee family and some      of Dusty's Marine pals at the funeral in Quitman,      Mississippi, April 2007.       The top Marine brass and the veterinarian signed the      official papers saying I'm A-OK to be adopted. I got an      honorable discharge from the U.Marine Corps on December      21, 2007, the anniversary day of Dustin's death. I will be      home with the Lee family for       That's a picture of me greeting the Lee family at my      retirement ceremony at the U.Marine Corps base, Albany,      Georgia, December 21, 2007.

I'm the first Marine Corps combat veteran working dog to ever      be retired to the family of a fallen       Dusty? I'm sure you had a lot to do with all this from      heaven. And I can hardly wait to visit your room and lie down      on your bed and sniff your boots and clothes. Living with      your family will be like having you around again, Dusty!

1426,topic-id,698,"Mr.Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleague, Representative Jackie Walorski, as co-chairs of the Polish  This year, we commemorate the 100th anniversary of Poland's reemergence as a European nation in 1918. As grateful Polish Americans, we join together on a bipartisan basis to acknowledge this historic achievement of freedom's advance.  The reality is history has been brutal to In the late 1700s, Poland was erased from the map of Europe for 123 years by three adjacent predatory empires because it passed a constitution inspired by ours, which included a separation of powers.  Poland became the first nation in Europe to abolish serfdom by the Polaniec Manifesto on May 7, 1794. Then, in 1918, following World War I, with the support of President Woodrow Wilson, Poland was restored to the map of Europe and resumed its torturous climb to freedom.                              {time}  1030  But then, in 1939, World War II began. As Poland was invaded, first by Nazi Germany, and then 3 weeks later by Communist Russia, Poland suffered an unimaginable loss of 20 percent of its population that perished during World War II, the most of any nation in that war.  Of the 14 million civilians killed by Nazi Germany and Communist Russia, over 6 million were killed in Poland; 3 million Jews and 3 million Christians, as well as Roma and Sinti, the disabled, homosexuals, and other innocents.  Poland never surrendered. There never was a collaborationist Polish Establishing a free government in exile, Polish armies fought on every front in Europe, including alongside American soldiers at  Despite the Nazi and Soviet campaign to wipe out Poland's most educated and accomplished and, indeed, Poland's history, Poland resisted at home with the largest underground resistance movement in Poland never surrendered, nor did it ever surrender to Nazi nor Communist, murderous ideology.  At Katyn, Communist Russia, with bullets to the back of their heads, killed over 12,000 Polish leaders from its military, civil society, their educational community, and their religious leadership.  1945 brought allied liberation to a war-torn Europe, but not to Poland, which fell under the Soviet yoke, repressed, and blocked from its own identity, indeed, even denied a true representation of its wartime history of heroism, tragedy, and terror.  But in 1989, after 43 years of increasing resistance to occupation inside Poland, its fierce love of liberty spilled over into successful resistance and massive electoral victory won by Solidarnosc, the labor movement that yielded ultimate liberty for This was the first wave of major popular and anti-Communist opposition across the Soviet bloc that resulted in the Berlin Wall's collapse in 1989, the wall that divided liberty from tyranny and, ultimately, communism's demise.  Poland has accomplished much in the generation of freedom that followed. She has achieved a steady economic growth in each year since its return to freedom, the most robust of any nation in Yet, the millions of souls who perished in Poland across every faith, confession, and ethnic origin, most remain unknown to history. Our globe is still weighed down with the collective sense of unresolved grief and the lack of historical truth that humanity must address.  For the millions who perished, this anniversary year of Poland's rebirth should be an occasion to uplift that historical truth to heal, not divide. As we speak, vicious Russian aggression aims to destabilize Europe and our precious transatlantic and NATO alliance, essential to liberty. Free nations, including Poland and her critics, should[[Page H1379]]use this moment to recommit to liberty and rule of law, setting aside language and gestures that inflame divisions across  Now is a time for unity, not division. Now is a time for restraint, not antagonism. Now is the time for reasoned dialogue, not media taunts. And let me commend the Polish-Israeli Reconciliation Commission for its reasoned progress and recent statement.  Now is the time for diplomatic excellence and military readiness, not provocative gestures, legislative or otherwise. Now is the time for robust archival restoration so the full truth of millions who perished can be known and recorded forever. Now is the time to strengthen freedom's umbrella, not weaken it.  May I extend all congratulations and blessings to Poland on its 100th anniversary of reborn nationhood.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-06-pt1-PgH1378-2.txt,616,NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018--MOTION TO,2018.0,6.0,March

969,topic-id,1324,"Mr.President, sometimes--not always--but sometimes Congress operates under the principle that anything worth doing is worth overdoing, and that, to some extent, is what happened with Dodd- It has been almost 8 years since Dodd-Frank took effect, and in that time, well over 1,700 community banks have consolidated, merged, or shut their doors forever. We are going backward. That is an average of one every 3 days.  I was reading this morning that in the last 3 years, only 13 new banks have been formed in That is not 13 per year, that is 13 total. Before Dodd-Frank, we averaged about 100 a year. Across America, banks of all sizes have closed more than 10,000 branches. Acknowledging the damage Dodd-Frank has wrought for our local economies is long overdue, and it is high time we did something about it.  In my State of Louisiana, out-of-control compliance costs have led to banks boarding up their windows. That means, at this point in time, in at least 15 communities in my State, folks do not have access to a bank or to a credit union. For Louisianians living in these banking deserts, getting a check or a savings account may be little more than a pipedream.  I am not suggesting to you that everything in Dodd-Frank was misguided. I think we had a handful of institutions that precipitated, in part, the meltdown in 2008, and Dodd-Frank regulates those institutions, but not every financial institution, particularly a community bank and a small credit union, should be lumped in with the larger financial institutions.  To return to my point, even the ordinary act of cashing a paycheck--something that goes sight unseen for most Americans--is next to impossible without paying high fees at the convenience store, a pawn shop, or a payday lender. Because of the shrinkage in the banking community in Louisiana, every day, ordinary Louisianians are being told to participate in the economy, manage their finances, save for their kids' future, and plan for their retirements when, thanks to Dodd-Frank and its overregulation of medium-sized and community banks and credit unions, too many Louisianians don't even have a bank branch in their community.  I think it is time to swing the pendulum back toward simple, sensible regulations. We have legislation that will be on the floor this week in the Senate that will do that. It is called the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection I call it the Dodd-Frank fix bill or the Dodd-Frank reform bill. It doesn't destroy Dodd-It doesn't eliminate it entirely. It just brings some common sense to the legislation. I think it is a vital step in the right direction. Dodd-Frank, to some extent, particularly for medium-sized and smaller financial institutions, was like using a sledgehammer to kill a gnat. All our reform bill does is suggest that we ought to try using a flyswatter instead of a sledgehammer.  The changes made in our bill will not mean the banks that are given relief will go unregulated--far from it. They will still be heavily regulated. They just will not be overly regulated as a result of the Dodd-Frank bill.  Everybody in America knows that community banks and credit unions, which I refer to as relationship bankers, played no role--none, zero, zilch--in the 2008 financial crisis. When former Chair of the Federal Reserve Yellen testified during her term in office before the Banking Committee, I asked her point-blank: Chairwoman Yellen, what did the community banks[[Page S1349]]do wrong to contribute to the economic meltdown in 2008, and she responded:  The businesses of these small institutions revolve around lending. I am talking about community banks and credit unions. They lend to farms, mom-and-pop businesses, and homeowners. They are not hedge fund managers. They are not playing the margins. Yet the small banks are the ones that are suffocating under the weight of Dodd-Frank's 20,000 pages of regulations. Let me say that again. Dodd-Frank is about a 900-page bill, and it has 20,000 pages of regulations.  Ultimately, our communities pay the price for the costs that have been imposed upon small- and medium-sized banks to comply with Dodd-Frank, when these banks did nothing wrong in 2008.  Studies show that when a bank branch shuts its doors, on average, the number of small business loans made in that community falls by 3 percent, and that has certainly been the case in The experts say the neighborhoods can take more than 8 years to recover. You multiply that by 10,000 branches that have closed across this country, and the figure is breathtaking. It doesn't take an economist to see that the ultimate cost of Dodd-Frank on our communities in Louisiana, in Texas, and elsewhere has been job losses and economic decline.  Fortunately, I think we can start to see a light at the end of the tunnel--at least if our Dodd-Frank reform bill passes. Dodd-Frank, as you know, said that all banks are created with equal risks and should be subject to the same regulations. From the largest bank to the smallest bank, they all create equal risk for the American financial system, and they should be subject to the same regulations. Whoever came up with that rule must have parachuted in from another planet.  I am cosponsoring the Dodd-Frank reform bill because I believe an international bank--and I think common sense tells us this--with $50 billion in assets poses a different risk to our economy than a community bank in Bossier City with 30 employees. The Dodd-Frank reform bill acknowledges that banks come in all different shapes and sizes and purposes, and it treats them accordingly.  We have had 8 years under Dodd-Frank to see what this level of government regulation means for our economy, and it is time to find some balance. Dodd-Frank's purpose was to prevent another financial crisis. Yet, in practice, banks across this country are now able to offer fewer products, fewer services, and fewer loans at much, much higher prices as a result of overregulation by Dodd-If we want to get our economy back on track for working and middle-class Americans, it has to stop.  I have been working closely with my colleague Senator Schatz on a bipartisan amendment to our Dodd-Frank reform legislation to protect consumers. Americans shouldn't have to spend months fighting to correct inaccurate information on their credit report when they didn't consent to have it collected in the first place. They shouldn't be penalized because a credit reporting agency, such as Equifax, can't keep their data safe.  Our proposal would require that the Big Three credit reporting agencies work together to create an online portal that gives consumers access to their credit reports and their credit scores. This website would allow folks to see what information has been collected about them, see who has viewed their credit report and why, and opt out of having their information packaged and sold to third parties. It would make it simple for people to dispute inaccuracies on their credit reports. In short, it would give consumers control over their financial information once again.  I respectfully urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this necessary amendment.  To conclude, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act--the Dodd-Frank reform bill that I have been talking about--will help promote stability in our financial markets. It will protect American consumers, and it will give breathing room to some of our smaller banks and to our credit unions. It will ensure that consumers and small businesses continue to have access to mortgage credit and to capital. I respectfully submit that it will help ensure that our relationship bankers--95 percent of the bankers in America, the ones on whose back this country was built--can afford to keep their doors open and continue lending to the middle-class drivers of our economy.  Thank you.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

Dana worked for San Bernardino County, California, for 26 years in the Assessor-Recorder When she went home for the day, she always made sacrifices for her three children and two grandchildren. She wanted to make sure that her kids understood the importance of loving and caring for all humans. She did this through her actions as a dedicated public servant.  Dana was an amazing cook who had just begun to travel more and spend more time with her friends. She had a contagious smile and a great sense of humor that could light up a room.

885,topic-id,764,"Mr.Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.  Mr.Speaker, this bill is the latest attempt by Republicans to undermine the Clean Air Act and give breaks to special interests, this time to power plants that burn waste coal.  The bill undermines the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, the MATS rule, one of most important protections for public health from toxic air pollutants from waste coal-burning power plants.  Simply put, the bill would mean more pollutants being put into our air and our water by waste coal power plants.  And on that point, there is really no disagreement. That is the point of the legislation, to allow more pollutants to be put into the air.  But not only would this bill give waste coal power plants permission to pump more pollution into our air, it also prohibits higher standards from being enacted, even if future technologies are invented to help control toxic pollution emissions better.  My motion would protect public health and prevent more pollutants, toxic substances like mercury, sulfur dioxide, and other hazardous particles, from being released into the air and into the water.  These harmful substances impact brain development. They cause cancer. They harm respiratory systems. They pollute our lakes, our streams, our rivers, where people get their drinking water.  As this body has heard me discuss many times, I know firsthand what happens when we fail to protect our environment and when we fail to protect our water supplies.  We know what happened in my hometown of Flint, a city of 100,000 people, including thousands of children, poisoned by lead in their drinking water because of callous decisions by government that put the balance sheet approach, the dollars and cents that would accrue in this case to an operator, ahead of the interests of health.  For 4 years, the people I represent have not had access to safe drinking water because of decisions that were made by government that allowed the water to be contaminated with high levels of lead, a dangerous neurotoxin with irreversible and damaging effects on children.  America is the wealthiest, most prosperous country in the world. It is a shame that the people of my hometown can't turn on their taps and trust the water coming out.  What happened in Flint is the result of policymakers, again, putting the balance sheet ahead of the interests of people. We can't measure every question on the ledger of a corporation. We have to think about the health of our people.  Just looking at those short-term effects can lead to really bad choices. What happened in Flint is absolutely tragic. We ought to take that lesson and make sure that we do everything we can to prevent the consequences of ignoring environmental protections, the consequences on people.  Flint is not an anomaly. Flint is a warning.  What happened there could happen to lots of people all across the country if we don't take care to ensure that we protect public health and strike a reasonable balance between the interests of the companies that are, unfortunately, unwilling to comply as other companies have, as other operators have, with existing standards. The public interest has to come first. We should be protecting our constituents from pollutants, not enacting law that explicitly allows for more pollutants to go into our air and water. It is the wrong direction for us.  As my colleague Mr.Doyle said, Democrats and Republicans can figure out solutions to these problems, but the solution is not to take a step back and pass legislation that rather than empowering organizations and communities to protect air and water says these rules are too hard for some to adhere to; and because they are unwilling to spend the resources necessary to protect public health, we just say: Well, then it is okay.  We know what happens when government takes that approach. There are human consequences--consequences that we can't ignore, consequences that are made clear by the experience of my hometown. I don't wish that on anyone in Michigan or Pennsylvania, or anyone else.  Mr.Speaker, this Congress ought to do what it can to protect people from that ever happening to them. I urge my colleagues to support this motion to recommit, stand up for kids, stand up for the people who live in those communities who breathe that air, who depend on clean water.

896,topic-id,379,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise to support H.4725, the Community Bank Reporting Relief Act, which would reduce reporting requirements through first and third quarter call reports for depository institutions with less than $5 billion in total consolidated assets.  This bill provides targeted regulatory relief to many of our smaller financial institutions, as has been the desire of both Democrats and Republicans on the committee and in this Congress for some time.  Under the Obama administration, the Federal banking agencies began taking a series of steps to reduce and streamline various bank reporting requirements. Many of these requirements had existed for decades, including the quarterly Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income for a Bank, which is commonly referred to as a call report.  These efforts by regulators have included creating a simpler call report for most community banks with less than $1 billion. Regulators have already been exploring raising the threshold to a comparable level that is proposed by this legislation. The regulators also allow for some data to be reported semiannually, as this bill would allow, or annually rather than quarterly.  I am pleased that H.4725 would give the regulators discretion to decide what information should be included in a reduced call report. It is also key that the bill would require a full call report every other quarter for banks under $5 billion, including at the end of the year, to make sure that regulators and the public have sufficient information on the health of financial institutions.  Furthermore, this bill would permit regulators to limit the regulatory relief, as appropriate. This would, for example, exclude banks with foreign offices or ones that are affiliated with much larger banks, as they do today.  This bill would appropriately maintain robust oversight of our Nation's largest banks while providing targeted relief for smaller institutions.  As I said, we don't agree on everything. Many of us on this side believe that the robust protections built into Dodd-Frank have strengthened the financial system but that there are ways that we can improve and refine those restrictions in order to support particularly smaller institutions. This is a step in that direction, and I urge my colleagues to support H.4725.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2018-03-06-pt1-PgH1393.txt,2134,"LINN, AND MATTHEW BELLINA",2018.0,6.0,March

1111,topic-id,771,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, if ever there is a time for Democrats and Republicans to come together in a bipartisan fashion, it would be around this issue, around an issue to combat the financing of transnational criminal organizations. That is what H.4768 would do. Specifically, it would require the Secretary of the Treasury to lead the effort, in consultation with other key agencies and departments, and update the strategy to fight these organizations at least every 2 years.  Additionally, the legislation requires the administration to assess the key threats, financial support networks, and methods used by criminal groups to launder the proceeds of illicit activities. In passing this legislation, we will not only build upon but also cement the importance of the interagency approach taken by the prior administration in combating the impact of global criminal enterprises.  Indeed, in 2010, the Obama administration conducted a comprehensive assessment of organized crime, the first such review that had taken place since the mid-1990s. The assessment came to the alarming conclusion that the threat of global criminal networks had become more complex, volatile, and destabilizing and that such groups were proliferating, striking new and powerful alliances, and engaging in a growing range of illicit activities such as we have never seen before.  To combat this growing threat and lessen its impact both domestically and on our foreign partners, the Obama administration, in 2011, issued a comprehensive interagency strategy that identified 56 priority actions across five strategic objectives. One of these key objectives included breaking the economic power of transnational criminal networks and protecting strategic markets and the U.financial system from penetration and abuse by transnational organized crime. This strategic objective, in particular, resonates with me, as I have always believed strongly that following the money and using our economic leverage is the best way to counter illicit activity. This is especially true in countering transnational criminal organizations, whose primary objective is economic gain.  In a number of ways, this legislation before us will ensure that the Treasury, as well as the intelligence and broader U.national security apparatus, remains focused on some of the emerging threats posed by transnational organized crime groups; including, kleptocrats, human traffickers, drug traffickers, and cybercriminals.  Additionally, the legislation explicitly requires the administration to examine how such groups exploit the use of shell companies, misuse digital currencies and other cyber technologies.  I am also pleased that, with the concurrence of the chairman and the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.Kustoff), the committee agreed to adopt an amendment offered by Ranking Member Waters that sharpens the bill's focus on the methods by which transnational organized crime groups launder illicit funds using real estate and other tangible goods, such as art and antiquities. These significant vulnerabilities have been identified as major threats to our national security and the integrity of our financial system by a broad range of bipartisan experts, including the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and the Financial Action Task  For example, just last year, FinCEN noted in a public advisory that: ``Real estate transactions and the real estate market have certain characteristics that make them vulnerable to abuse by illicit actors. . . . For these reasons and others, drug traffickers, corrupt officials, and other criminals can and have used real estate to conceal the existence and origins of their illicit funds.''  The entities and individuals that have sought to exploit real estate to conceal illicit funds includes Iranian banks subject to U.sanctions, Russian oligarchs and Russian-organized crime rings, as well as Venezuelan officials found to be engaged in narcotics trafficking.  The fact that these vulnerabilities are not merely theoretical and have been used by a wide range of criminal groups should disturb all of us. We also know that money laundering through the global art and antiquities market is another key method for washing illicit funds, and that is undoubtedly being exploited by well-organized transnational criminal groups. Indeed, we know that the looting and trafficking in cultural heritage is a source of revenue that has funded ISIS' heinous activities, and we know that the opaque characteristics of the high-end art market and its lack of basic anti-money-laundering requirements make it a target for illicit funds.  So I am pleased that the members of this committee were able to agree that real estate and art market vulnerabilities should be given due consideration when it comes to transnational organized crime. Again, this is one of those[[Page H1397]]subjects around which bipartisanship should be assumed.  Mr.Speaker, I urge all Members to join in this bipartisan effort and to support this legislation.

1546,topic-id,852,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for his persistence in offering this legislation. As he said, in committee, we had a successful markup where we were able to unanimously support this legislation. It is important legislation.  We don't agree on everything. One doesn't have to go very far. Back in committee, right now, where we have a rather contentious markup on a budget using estimates, as I said in that meeting: When we do agree, we should come together. Representative Barr and I have talked about this issue for quite some time, and I am really pleased to see it move forward.  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.2226, the Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access Act, which would allow certain mortgages that are originated and retained in portfolio by a bank with less than $10 billion in total assets to be considered as qualified mortgages.  In the lead-up to the financial crisis, there were a number of mortgage lenders that did not do their due diligence in underwriting mortgages. We saw a number of exotic products being offered to individuals and families premised on a continually rising housing market.  These included ``no doc'' loans where the lender did not document or verify a borrower's income. There were real consequences for those sorts of loans. Many of these borrowers never really had any hope of paying back those loans. As those mortgages went into default, the foreclosures helped lead to a financial crisis that devastated the U.economy, and millions of families were stripped from their single source of wealth: the equity in their home.  In the wake of that crisis, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act and required lenders to assess a consumer's ability to repay their mortgage loans.  We also provided statutory penalties for mortgage lenders that did not follow these new underwriting standards.  Congress also directed the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to enact regulations to create a safe harbor for creditors, where it would be presumed that the creditor evaluated the borrower's ability to repay.  In 2013, under the direction of former Director Cordray, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau released its ability-to-repay and qualified mortgage rule. This rule defined how lenders could take advantage of that safe harbor.  Qualified mortgages, commonly referred to as QM loans, are a special category of loans that have strong underwriting standards and certain nonpredatory loan features that help make them more likely that borrowers will be able to afford their mortgages.  So if a lender originates a QM loan, it means that the lender met certain requirements, and it is assumed that the lender followed the ability-to-repay rule as drafted by the Consumer Financial Protection This also allows the lender to be shielded from certain types of liability associated with originating bad loans.  I and my colleagues were pleased that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau tailored the rule to ensure that lenders who serve rural and underserved communities have flexibility in serving their customers.  While that was a very good first step, Congress has pushed to expand this tailoring to include even more community banks and credit unions, consistent with safe and sound operations. H.2226, as amended in the committee, provides this targeted and, I think, reasonable relief.  As Representative Barr and I have indicated, there are additional refinements to the bill that I would have still liked to have seen adopted, such as additional guardrails on the types of products offered. I am glad, however, and as Mr.Barr indicated, the leadership of the committee, the majority, agreed to crucial language offered by Mr.Capuano to improve the bill.  As amended, lenders are required to continually hold these loans in portfolio, and not only consider and document, but verify a borrower's income information.  Congress should not be in the business of allowing lenders to underwrite and offer mortgage loans that borrowers have no ability to repay.  I am supportive of this bill for that reason, but also because I believe it will help in areas of the country that have weaker housing markets. This has really been the reason that I have been interested in the issue of portfolio lending.  As many know, I represent Flint, Michigan, which not unlike a number of communities across the country have very weak and very low cost markets. You can purchase a single family home in Flint for $25,000--not $250,000--$25,000.  Under the QM rules, financial institutions sometimes, justifiably, struggle to make these small mortgages, resulting in even more stagnant markets--it is a vicious cycle--and weakening these markets permanently. If we can't get people financed into mortgages, these communities and the market will never recover.                              {time}  1345  This bill will encourage community banks and credit unions to make those smaller mortgages, to help weaker markets.  It is for that reason and many others, but particularly for that reason, that I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. It is a big step in the right direction for weak markets. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting it.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Even some of the debate in this conversation, I think we could find areas of disagreement. But when it comes to the specifics of this legislation, I think it strikes a good balance. The balance, for me, being the notion that we can deem these mortgages held by smaller institutions, as long as they are held in portfolio, as meeting the QM requirements.  In exchange for that, what we get is, in weak markets, we get a chance for folks who essentially have been locked out of home ownership to be able to get a small mortgage literally on a $25,000, $30,000, or $40,000 home and begin to build equity that will return value to that family and to that community for a long, long time.  For that reason, I support this legislation and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes'' on it.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

We came here to solve problems that Americans want us to take on, to deal with the big problems that we face, whether it is infrastructure or education or the environment or all the things that people actually worry about, financial security for families.  But we do have an obligation to uphold the oath that we took. We swore an oath to the Constitution of the United So while it is not my preference, and I know from my friends it is not our preference to have to deal with this question, we can't avoid it. We can't just look the other way, particularly when it is very clear that not just this President, but, sadly, some around him; and I think we have to acknowledge some of our Republican colleagues seem willing to try to interfere with or obfuscate what is a really important investigation.  Let's remind ourselves, Mr.Mueller, who is leading this investigation, the special counsel, was appointed by the Republican Attorney General, appointed by the President of the United States, both Bob Mueller[[Page H1474]]was appointed head of the FBI by a Republican  This is not a partisan question, certainly not a partisan witch hunt. This is a question as to whether or not we are going to let this investigation go to completion.  The President keeps saying no collusion. The truth of the matter is, so far, there has been no conclusion. There is no conclusion to be drawn yet from this investigation, other than 17 individuals have been indicted. Several have pled guilty to very serious crimes, some people who have been very close to the President of the United States, the closest you can be, literally engaged in his campaign, side by side with him every day.  So it begs the question and, really, the most important question: What are they afraid of? What do they have to worry about?  If there is nothing to find, if there is no collusion, then let's let the process complete itself. Let's let the process come to conclusion and accept the result.  So this is really a fundamental question to our democracy: Are we going to adhere to the rule of law, or are we going to allow a President to rule by fiat and, essentially, dismiss or diminish or discredit anyone who raises any question about his conduct coming into or performing his duties?                              {time}  1745  That is not the America that we know, and that is not a standard that we ought to allow: 17 people indicted, people at the top of his campaign, including a whole group of Russians who clearly were engaged in trying to affect our election.  You know, don't you remember the good ol' days? I think about some of our friends on the other side, when the biggest scandal that they could come up with was that the President of the United States wore a tan suit. The outrage. Where is the outrage now when a special counsel has been appointed and, at every moment, there is an attempt to try to discredit the work that this individual is doing?  So I ask my Republican colleagues to stand up, adhere to the oath that they swore, support this process, allow for your own good and the good of the country, allow the investigation to be completed without interference. Push back when the President tries to discredit this process. There is just too much at stake. What are they afraid of? What are they worried about?  This guy is a professional. When he was appointed, remember the chorus of praise left, right, and center for Bob Mueller and the integrity with which he has conducted himself in public life. He didn't change. He is still doing that. Let's let him do his work.  ",CREC-2018-03-07-pt1-PgH1472.txt,2134,PORTFOLIO LENDING AND MORTGAGE ACCESS ACT,2018.0,7.0,March

1414,topic-id,2075,"Mr.President, I rise today to join my colleague from Rhode Island to talk about climate change, but I first want to make a comment about my good friend and an important Member of this body, Senator Whitehouse of Rhode Island, and what he has done.  In the 1930s, a lonely voice stood on the floor of the Houses of Parliament, warning of the impending catastrophe of the rearmament of Germany in the advent of World War People didn't listen. Often, he spoke to a lonely House, but his voice was clear, his voice was prescient, and what he said was important. Of course, I refer to Winston  Today and over the past many years, Senator Whitehouse has performed that same function of warning us, of trying to wake us up to a challenge that is impending, that is catastrophic, that is significant, and that is also at least somewhat preventable.  Senator Whitehouse has talked about climate change in terms of ocean acidification, temperature changes, sea level rise, drought, famine, and the effects throughout the world. Often this Chamber is empty, but his warnings are important and should be heeded nonetheless.  The first thing I want to do is thank him and compliment him for the work that he has done over these many years and continues to do. I can see his sign--as I see it on C-SPAN and here on the floor--that says ``Wake Up,'' and wake up is what we need to do.  People often talk about climate change as if it were some abstract thing that is going on, and it is in scientific journals, and it is a kind of environmental movement that doesn't really affect real life that much; it is just sort of something that goes on out there and one of the many issues we have to deal with. But it is real. I will tell you how I know. The fishermen in Maine have told me so.  Just this past Saturday, I spent the evening with a man who has been a fisherman for 40 years in the Gulf of He said that he has never seen the kinds of changes we have seen in the last 10 years. They are catching fish that have never been seen before in the Gulf of A lobsterman told me of pulling up a seahorse in his lobster trap. Seahorses aren't supposed to live in the cold water of  This isn't an abstract question for us. Lobstering is a $1.7-billion-a-year industry for Lobstering used to be a major industry in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, and now it is largely gone.  There are multiple explanations, but one of them is that the water is warming, and our species, whether they are lobsters or trees or bears, are sensitive to small environmental changes.  We have had record lobster harvests in Maine in the last 5 to 10 years--although I have to say that in the last 2 years, they have been down. We don't know whether the declines are a blip or a trend. We deeply hope that it doesn't represent a trend, but we can't ignore what happened to the lobster population to our south.  The water is getting warmer in the Gulf of The water in the Gulf of Maine is warming at the fastest rate of any body of water on Earth, except for the Arctic Ocean, and it has already wrought changes in the nature of our natural resource-based economy.  Maine is a natural resource State, dependent largely upon fisheries, lobster, agriculture, farming, and forestry. That is who we are. Of course, another part of our economy is the millions of tourists who come to Maine each summer to visit our incredible coastline. Climate change isn't an abstract for us; it is a very real phenomenon.  I want to emphasize not only what my friend the fisherman told me this weekend, but also that I have heard from fishermen all over Maine for the last 4 or 5 years about the changes they are seeing. This guy isn't a scientist, but he is out on the water, and he knows what he is catching. He knows he is catching fish he has never caught before. He has never seen the tropical, warm water fish now being caught in the Gulf of  I think the other factor we need to talk about is a dollars-and-cents question that relates to sea level rise. We are talking about millions of dollars on the part of the U.Government to preserve the coastal infrastructure that we have in connection with our Armed  The city of Norfolk is already experiencing what are called sunny day floods. The city of Miami--the Presiding Officer's hometown--is experiencing sunny day floods. These are floods that aren't caused by great storms, by great perturbations in the atmosphere; they are caused just by a high tide. The cost of dealing with this in Miami, New Orleans, New York, or Maine is going to be enormous.  We tend to think of the ocean as a fixed commodity, as something that has always been the way it is now. It turns out that we have been fooled. We have been lulled into a sense of confidence about the level of the sea because for the past 8,000 years, it has been the same. But this is a chart that shows the depth of the Atlantic Ocean over the past 24,000 years.  It turns out that 24,000 years ago, which was the height of the glacial period, the waters off the coast of Maine were 390 feet shallower than they are today--390 feet shallower. What you see here is the melting of the glaciers and the refilling of the oceans.  From our historic point of view, the problem is that it got to a plateau about 10,000 years ago, and that is all we know. That is human history, right here. We don't remember this very much because it appeared before recorded human history.  Now, there is an interesting moment in this chart, and it is right in this period about 15,000 years ago, and it is[[Page S1676]]called the meltwater pulse 1That is what scientists call it. We see a very steep rise in the ocean level during this period. Interestingly, this rise is about 1 foot per decade. That is what happened during that time about 15,000 years ago.  Well, a year and a half ago I went to Greenland with two climate scientists, one of whom focuses almost exclusively on sea level rise. The estimates vary quite a bit, I will concede, but their estimate was that what we are facing now is 1 foot of sea level rise per decade for the rest of this century. Has it ever happened before? Is that an outrageous estimate? No, because it has happened before. It can happen again. Why? Because the last remnants of the glaciers are in Antarctica and Greenland, and between the ice sheets on those two areas is 260 feet of additional sea level rise. Greenland is melting at an unprecedented rate, and there is a huge ice shelf in Antarctica that is poised to fall into the ocean. If that happens, it will cause sea level rise, just as dropping an ice cube in a glass of water does.  The indications are overwhelming of what this issue means for the future of this country. This is not an academic question.  Here is another example of what is happening in a relatively short period of time. The volume of ice in the Arctic Ocean has fallen by two-thirds since 1979--a 40-year period. The Arctic Ocean is more clear today than it has ever been in human history. Anybody who says nothing is happening or it is just routine or the weather changes all the time isn't paying attention to the facts. Again, my concern about this is practical: the cost of seawalls, the cost of shoring up our infrastructure, just the cost to the government of protecting the naval facilities in Of course, one of the problems in the State of the Presiding Officer is, the rock is porous limestone so it is very difficult to build a seawall because the water will simply come under it. So we are talking about a very serious practical issue that is going to cost our society billions, if not trillions, of dollars.  Can we stop it? Probably not. Can we slow it? Yes, but it is going to take action today, and every day we wait, it makes the action harder and more expensive. If we wait until the waves are lapping up over the seawall in New York City or over the dikes in New Orleans or over the streets of Miami or along the coast of Maine at our marshes and low points, it will be too late. Then all we can do is defend and not prevent.  I believe we can make changes now that are not totally disruptive to our economy but will be protective of our economy and will be much cheaper now than they will be 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, or 50 years from now. What we are doing is leaving the problem to our kids, just like we are leaving the deficit to our kids, just like we are leaving broken infrastructure to our kids.  Tom Brokaw wrote a book after World War II called ``The Greatest Generation.'' That was the generation that sacrificed in World War II, and then they built the Interstate Highway System, paid for it, and paid down the debt that was accumulated during World War We are just the opposite. We are increasing our debt on all levels at a time of relative prosperity. The economy is at low unemployment. Yet we are passing trillion-dollar tax cuts that add to the deficit that these young people are going to have to pay off.  We are not attending to the problem of climate change. Who is going to have to pay to build those seawalls? Not us; our children and our grandchildren. I believe this is a moral and an ethical issue as well as a practical issue.  So I will return to where I began: to compliment my colleague from Rhode Island for raising the alarm, for pointing out what we can do, how we can do it, the consensus of scientific opinion, and the reality of what we are facing. We can do better. We don't have to avoid and ignore and waste the resources and the time we have now.  The most precious resource we have now to confront this problem is time, and every day that goes by is a day of irresponsibility. It is a day where our children and grandchildren are going to say: Where were you when this was happening? Why didn't you listen to that guy from Rhode Island who told you what was going to happen, who told you how we could do something about it? Why didn't we listen? I don't want to be a person who says I didn't listen because I was too busy or because it was inconvenient or because I was afraid it might change a little bit about how we powered our automobiles or got electricity.  I think it is a question we can face. This body can solve big problems. It has done it in the past, but recently our pattern has been, instead of solving problems, avoiding problems--putting them off until next year, next month, or decades from now when this problem is no longer a problem but a catastrophe.  So I salute and thank my colleague from Rhode Island for keeping the focus on this issue. I look forward to continuing to work with him, as we will continue to urge and plead with our colleagues to join us in reasonable steps that can be taken to ameliorate what is coming at us. This is a moment in time when we have it within our power to do something important for the future of our country and for the future of our children. I hope we can seize that moment and serve not only the American people today but the American people who will come after us and will judge us by the extent to which we confronted a problem and saved them from having to solve it themselves.

1090,topic-id,459,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. This was a great thing we did. It had been--I was 8 years old the last time the Tax Code was reformed, and I think this is something we, frankly, ought to do every decade; at the worst case, every two decades; definitely not every 30 years. So it is about time to get it done.  I wish this could have been bipartisan. I think there are a lot of fantastic things in here, and I think it is quite obvious that the economy is showing some really big benefit as a result. I think it is hard to hide that. It is hard to pretend that that is not the case, even though some of our friends try to do that, but it is quite obvious it has worked.  I just want to tell a few stories of my district, the 16th District of I was at a tax reform roundtable last month at the Illinois Valley Chamber of Commerce, and I heard from my local business community about how this bill affects them and what they would like to see moving forward. One gentleman from Walnut, Illinois, in Bureau County, was really excited about the tax cuts his small business would receive. He plans to increase hourly wages and hire 7 to 10 new employees over the next 2 years. That, my friends, is not crumbs. That is important.  The tax relief for businesses, large and small, is being shared with employees all over. Over the last few months, more than 300 companies, and counting, have announced plans to add people, add bonuses, add to retirement benefits, and give back to the U.economy.  Employees at UPS in my district, Home Depot, Bank of America, Ryder, AT&T, U-Haul, and many others with Illinois locations will receive these bonuses and benefits.  A few weeks ago, I went to the Fiat Chrysler plant in Belvidere, Illinois, and I met with employees who were excited and encouraged by the $2,000 bonus they will receive in the second quarter of this year.  According to the nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, 85 percent of Illinoisans will see a tax cut next year, and the nonpartisan Tax Foundation has estimated that the State of Illinois stands to gain tens of thousands of jobs from this reform.  This is great news. By bringing the Tax Code into the 21st century to reflect current day is real and tangible in terms of the benefits it will put into our economy.  Our future is bright, our economy is growing stronger, and, with tax relief, the American Dream is once again on the horizon for folks in my district and across the country.

I would like to thank Senator Whitehouse for bringing us together.  This evening, many of my colleagues have spoken about how Russian aggression affects Americans and our allies across the world. Some have discussed the need for sanctions to defer Russia and the fact that the administration has not yet imposed sanctions, the same sanctions that were passed by the Senate 98 to 2 and 419 to 3 in the House of Those were the additional sanctions that were directly related to the interference in the elections and what we saw take place over the last year. They sit dormant.  Others have talked about the importance of Special Counsel Mueller's investigation and the fact that it must move forward without interference from the White Nearly a dozen Senators have come to the floor to highlight the need to stand up to I am here to talk about the critical need to safeguard the most fundamental part of our democracy--the U.elections.  Today, I heard the Prime Minister of Sweden address our When standing next to the President, he was asked a question about this, and he put it simply. He said that in their country, they believe that the people, the citizens of their country, should be the ones who make the decisions about their elections, that they are the ones who should be able to vote, that they are the ones who should be able to have their own opinions not be influenced by foreign countries acting as if they are people in their country.  It is the Presiding Officer who made the statement that I have quoted so many times--that in the last election, it was one candidate and one party, and in the next election, it could be the other candidate and the other party. We do not come here in a partisan way. We come here because the clock is ticking.  Today marks an important day in the 2018 election cycle. Texas is holding the first State primary, and others begin in the coming weeks, including in Illinois was one of 21 States that the Russians attempted to hack into--Illinois, where they actually hacked into their voter data, which is the personal information about their voters. Those elections are coming. We are glad that we have a decentralized system so that they have different systems. It is easier to hack into one centralized system. It also means that they have many things to choose from, and we have 40 States that haven't updated their equipment in over 10 years. We have 10 States that don't even have backup paper ballots, and we sit here doing nothing when the solution is right in front of us.  Over the course of the last year, I have come to the floor a number of times to urge this body to take immediate action to beef up our election cybersecurity. There is no longer any doubt that our elections have been and will continue to be a target for foreign adversaries. Intelligence reports make it clear that Russia used covert cyber attacks, espionage, and harmful propaganda to attack our political system.  I mentioned the attempts on 21 State election systems. Do you know when the real election--the general election--is? It is 245 days away, with primaries beginning today. We have not imposed the sanctions--the administration hasn't--despite this body's taking firm action that we wanted to see these sanctions imposed.  We have had six security heads from this administration--not from the Obama administration; they already spoke out on this. The head of the CIA, the Director of National Intelligence, and the head of the FBI have all testified before U.Senate committees that, in fact, this is happening now. It was Director Coats, who was once a Senator here, who said that, in fact, he believes the Russians are getting bolder. These are not the words of Obama's security people. These are the words of Trump's security people.  Last week, NSA Director Rogers said this about Russia: ``They haven't paid a price at least that is sufficient to get them to change their behavior.''  Earlier this year, CIA Director Pompeo said that he has seen no signs that Russia has decreased its activity and that Russia is currently working to disrupt the upcoming 2018 elections.  It is the policy of the United States of America to defend against and respond to threats to our This is a cyber attack. It is not with bullets, and it is not with tanks. It is not with aircraft, but it is an attack. It is, simply, using the computer system. In every briefing that I have gone to, this is always listed as one of the major ways in which foreign adversaries are going to attack our Nation--they are going to use the internet. Here we have it happening right here on our very democracy, itself.  In order to protect our election system, we need to do three key things.  First, we must give State and local officials the tools and resources they need to prevent hacks and safeguard election infrastructure from foreign interference. They need those resources now, not after the election, not after the primaries. Today, more than 40 States, as I mentioned, rely on electronic voting systems that are at least 10 years old. Do you think the Russians don't know that? Do you think I am giving away some state secret here? Of course they know that.  Ten years ago, on February 6, 2008, it was Super Tuesday for the 2008 Presidential election. A lot has changed in the last 10 years but not our voting equipment. It has remained the same. That is why I am leading bipartisan legislation with Senator This is a bipartisan effort. We also appreciate our cosponsors Senators Harris, Graham, Collins, and We call this bill the Secure Elections It would provide $386 million in grant funding for States to secure their elections systems. It is paid for. We found a pay-for.  We have a similar bill that is led by Congressman Meadows in the House--the head of the Freedom Caucus--because they understand that freedom is not cheap, that to guarantee freedom, you must have a secure democracy, and $386 million is just 3 percent of the cost of one aircraft carrier.  I think most Americans would agree that, as we see more and more sophisticated types of warfare happening, to not even pay attention to helping the States fund this election equipment that has been woefully underfunded is a huge mistake.  The second thing that we need to do--by the way we can do this now. We can do this in the omnibus bill. The second thing we need to do is improve information sharing so that local election officials know when they are attacked and how to respond. It took the Federal Government nearly a year to notify these 21 States that were targeted by Russian-backed hackers. That cannot happen again.  Finally, we need a reliable backup system. I am talking about paper backup ballots--the old-fashioned way. There are 10 States that don't have them.  The integrity of our election system is the cornerstone of our democracy. Americans have fought and died for our democracy since our country was founded, and we must guarantee that democracy continues.  I thank the Presiding  I yield the floor.

1423,topic-id,932,"Mr.President, I rise today to join my friend and colleague Senator Whitehouse on the day of his 200th weekly climate change floor speech. We came in the same class. So I have been a witness to this. For years he has come to the floor every week that the Senate is in session, often to an empty Chamber, to speak on this critical issue. He has been a leader and an unwavering voice on climate change, calling for action week after week and, I think, that is why so many of us are here tonight. Two hundred speeches is truly a milestone, and you can just look at the wear and tear of his ``Time to Wake Up'' floor sign to know that this actually happened.  Not only does Senator Whitehouse come to the floor to talk about this issue and to share new data and information with all of us on the need to act now, but I have also seen him take on climate change deniers as a member when I was on both the Environment and Public Works Committee and also on the Judiciary I have experienced his dedication to moving the needle on this issue as a member of the Senate Climate Action Task Force that he has led for several years.  I have been part of the meetings where he has pulled together Senators and advocacy group leaders to strategize on how to move forward on legislation and meetings where he has brought together Senators and private sector leaders, such as Greg Page, the former CEO of Cargill, to talk about how we change the private dialogue about sustainability in supply chains. He is truly committed to finding solutions, and I am pleased to join him tonight for his 200th speech.  People talk about climate in many places in my State--from hunters and snowmobilers in Northern Minnesota to business leaders in the Twin Cities, to students at the University of  When President Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the climate change agreement this summer--the worldwide, international climate change agreement--I heard an outpouring of concern. Now, 195 countries made a pledge to come together to combat climate change. In withdrawing, the United States was one of only three countries that wouldn't be in the agreement. The other two were Syria and Then, Syria and Nicaragua signed the accord. So now the United States is the only country not to sign the accord. It is a big step backward. It is the wrong decision for our economy, and it is the wrong decision for the environment.  As military and security experts have reminded us, climate change is a threat to our national security, increasing the risks of conflict, humanitarian crisis--as we have already seen because of droughts, with subsistence[[Page S1683]]farmers in Africa coming up as refugees--and damage to crucial and critical infrastructure.  I am a former prosecutor, and I believe in evidence. Every week seems to bring fresh evidence of the damage climate change is already causing. Minnesota may be miles away from rising oceans, but the impacts are not less of a real threat in the Midwest--more severe weather, heat waves that could release our water supply, extreme rainfall that could damage critical infrastructure, and a decrease in agricultural productivity. It goes on and on. It has an impact on the Great Lakes and people respond.  We are going to keep talking about the importance of making a global commitment and an American commitment to address climate change. We should not be the last one in. We should be the first one. This is a great nation with a history of Democrats and Republicans coming together to conserve our land and care about our environment. We are going to keep pushing climate change deniers on their facts, and we are going to keep working on policies that encourage energy efficiency, renewable energy, and a decrease in greenhouse gasses.  Many of the businesses in Minnesota, such as Cargill, which I already mentioned in the lead, have taken on this cause. They know that when they have business all over the world, it matters. They know that it matters to their shareholders, it matters to their employees, and it matters to their customers.  They also know that we deal with the rest of the world, and when businesses go to meetings in other countries, they don't want to hear: Well, I guess your country is not in the climate change agreement and China is; so maybe we will buy our stuff from That is what people are hearing at business meetings.  We need to be a part of the Paris climate change agreement, and we need to lead the way in the United In the last administration, we had some commonsense policies put forth to reduce greenhouse gasses, but this administration has pulled back on them. I disagree. I think we could have made that work.  Even though we are not seeing the action we would like out of this administration, we are seeing it in cities, in States, in businesses, and universities. They have said: If this administration doesn't do it, we will.  So I wish to thank Senator Whitehouse for his leadership and let all of those listening to this series of speeches and tributes to doing something about climate change in his 200th speech tonight know that there are those in this Chamber who stand with you and believe in science and believe that we need to do something about climate change.

648,topic-id,1944,"Mr.President, I wish to talk a little bit about election security, but on a day like today, I have to at least mention where we are with the giant omnibus bill that got dropped on us last night at about 8:30--about 2,300 pages of legislative text--to try to deal with all of government spending, all of discretionary spending.  If people don't know what an omnibus is, it is where we are supposed to pass 12 individuals bills dealing with 12 different topics of our spending. An omnibus is when you take all 12 of those and just do it at once. It is supposed to be the exception to the rule, but for the last 17 years, we have done some version of an omnibus. Today's vote will be the 18th.  We have 2,300 pages with technical legislative language and less than 24 hours to be able to go through it. There is no way to be able to discover what all is in it.  There is another historic event that has happened this past week, as well, which I think connects to this omnibus. Last Friday, the Treasury Department announced that we just crossed over $21 trillion in total debt--$21 trillion.  I have had some folks who have caught me and said: Now that we have gone over $21 trillion and it looks like we could be rapidly approaching $1 trillion of deficit this year alone--which would mean that in the next 12 to 14 months, we will go from $21 trillion to $22 trillion in total debt--gosh, that looks terrible. It has to be this Republican tax plan that is causing it. Well, there will probably be some deficit spending with the Republican tax plan that went in because it will take a couple of years for the income to be able to accelerate with it, but this omnibus alone is $300 billion of additional spending--just this, $300 billion.  So we go up to over $600 billion in deficit spending this past year, and this omnibus will add another $300 billion to that. The disaster relief funding that was done this year was $140 billion on top of that, and the interest payment increase--just the increase--from last year to this year was $54 billion.  It is not just some Republican tax plan that made this change. This is a very rapid acceleration in overspending that is happening right in front of our eyes, and the omnibus is not slowing it down. It is accelerating it. We have to change how we are doing budgeting and the trajectory that we face.  There are 16 of us who have started meeting last month--8 Democrats and 8 Republicans, half from the House and half from the Senate--to evaluate how we do budgeting.  The 1974 Congressional Budget Act that we are currently operating under created this incredibly complicated system that has not worked in a decade. Every year we come up and try to do it again, and every year we end up with some omnibus package, and none of us has an amendment. None of us has an opportunity to be able to see it, read it, or go through it. It is just this: Here is the number. There it is. Vote for it or not.  We have to be able to fix that process. There is no long-term strategy. There is no regular order. There is no opportunity to be able to make changes. There is no plan.  My hope is that by the end of the year, this bipartisan group will have the opportunity to be able to present a different way of doing budgeting. That is not trying to be partisan but just to be able to put a neutral process in place in which we can actually be strategic about where we are going, because we are accidentally stumbling into more and more debt every single month, and it will happen again today.                           Election Security  Mr.President, I wish to chat with this body a little bit about election security. Just to give a quick update, as many of you know, the Department of Homeland Security has been actively engaged in trying to fix what they can on election security leading up to the 2018 time period.  I have absolutely zero doubt that the Russians tried to meddle in our elections in 2016. They started in 2014 trying to strategically plan for how they were going to try to interfere in our elections--the social media, the false news, and as many different ways as they can to be able to get out information and misinformation. They started the process early. Quite frankly, they planned and executed well. They exposed a weakness in our system.  We are an open society that is exceptionally trusting of each other, and we are not used to having a foreign entity try to reach in and try to influence us like that.  What the Russians exposed in 2016, we should be well able to push back against in 2018 and 2020 and not be caught off guard again. The Russians reached in and scammed multiple States in their election systems. They were looking at voter rolls, trying to figure out if they could get access to those. Now, they can't change votes by just looking at voter registrations, but if they could look at and download those files, they could also change those files, edit names, edit addresses, and then, suddenly, when people show up to vote, they are not really registered anymore or they are registered at a different precinct. They could create chaos on election day just by going in and editing those names. They could go into the unofficial results websites of secretaries of State and during the[[Page S1914]]day of the election actually start putting up false election results or changing algorithms and numbers, so that when numbers are added, they are actually counted wrong, just to create uncertainty in the process. So when the actual election day comes, the unofficial results come out, and they are not reliable and everyone doubts the system itself.  Again, that doesn't change votes, and it doesn't change outcomes, but it certainly destabilizes the system. We should be aware of that.  We have multiple States--there are not many, but there are around 10 to 12 States--that cannot audit their elections when Election Day comes and goes. That means that they are completely counting on the machine to be able to keep an accurate count. Now, that machine is not attached to the internet. In fact, there is no State that has their election equipment attached to the internet on the day of the election, but for almost every one of them, there is a software update right before the election. If any entity were to be able to get into any one of the third-party software companies when the update is done and just put a bit of software in there that just messes with the machine, you would literally not know if that election result was reliable or not.  Did that happen last time? Were the Russians looking to try to find different software companies and the different makes and models of those companies that make our election machines? Yes, and we should take that as a warning sign. Last time they were looking, and next time they may be looking to mess with it and change it. We should be well prepared for that.  We have a piece of legislation. It is a very straightforward piece of legislation about secure elections. Myself, Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris, Lindsey Graham, and Susan Collins, and most of us who are all engaged in this one simple issue say: How do we stabilize our elections system?  Elections are run by States and should be run by There is no reason for us to federalize elections, but the Federal Government should walk alongside States and say some simple things: We are going to have quick communication between the States and the Federal So if a foreign entity is trying to reach into your State to mess with your system, we can quickly let you know about it, and we can help you in the process of protecting your  The last time this occurred in 2016, it was months before the Department of Homeland Security was able to actually engage with those States to let them know that what was really happening was a foreign actor and to be able to help them with their security. We have to be faster on that.  We want to be able to streamline that communication. We want to encourage States, when they buy election equipment or they get election equipment, that they be able to audit their results on the day of the elections. The Federal Government should not pick their equipment. Those States should because it is a State responsibility. But we should incentivize them to actually lean in and make sure their equipment is good, because at the end of the day, in a Presidential election, we are all counting on every other State to make sure their election system is good. If it is not, it is a problem for all of us.  We want to make sure that there is not only streamlined communication and that there is not only good and auditable equipment, but that we actually give classification to individuals so that they can deal with classified information. That didn't happen last time, and so, again, it was months before there was any contact back and forth, because the Federal Government wanted to notify the States of what was happening, but no one had the clearance to be able to get the information. Let's fix that.  DHS is in the process of fixing that, but we would like to put in legislation that just remains, so that in the future, we don't lull ourselves to sleep again. Last time, it was the Next time, it could be the North Next time, it could be the Next time, it could be a domestic activist group that is just mad at somebody for something, and they have learned the vulnerabilities that the Russians pointed out.  In the days ahead, we need to secure our system for our election. It is not a partisan issue. It shouldn't be a partisan issue, but it should be something we learn the lesson on.  We are quickly learning the lessons about our vulnerabilities--cyber vulnerabilities in our pipelines, in our electric grids, in our phone systems, in internet fibers, in our election systems, in our banking systems, and in multiple other areas. We should learn this lesson and learn it well.  There are people who mean to do us harm. They are not necessarily going to attack us bodily, but they don't like our growing economy, they don't like our values, they don't like our openness, and they want to use our openness against us. We can't imagine doing that to someone else. They practice doing that to us.  We need to put up a basic guard, and we need to communicate to nations and nation-states around the world: If you come and attack us, this is going to be our response, so that they clearly know what they are facing when they come after us next time.  It happened once. It will happen again. Let's make sure that we are ready. Let's pass this bill about safe elections and get our elections secure so that we can trust the results year after year after year, as we have in the past.  I yield the floor.

Many of them have great credit scores and have a good family history of repayment back to the bank when they have taken loans, because that is the bank in town. They have been longtime customers of this bank. In many instances, the bank employees and the people in the bank have grown up together. They know each other, but they also understand seasonal income.  When you are a farmer and rancher who doesn't come in with a W-2 every single week or every month--it comes in seasonally--they understand the credit restrictions there.  A banker, named Debbie, at the Farmer State Bank of Allen wrote me this and said:       Between the Ability to Repay and Global Cash Flow analysis,      particularly for a bank of this size, these new rules take      our time away from doing what needs to be done--caring for      our customers.       We have 12 employees and we're treated the same as JPMorgan      Chase, or Goldman Sachs--both of which have an entirely      different business model of operating. They do not operate in      towns of 900 [people]. . . . That's not their business model      or their kinds of markets       One of our key employees now spends most of her time on      compliance issues. Total costs for this employee, together      with the cost of the annual compliance audit [and everything      that goes with it is], now exceeds $100,000 annually.  Again, folks in big towns may not think it is a big issue to have $100,000 in appliance costs, but the total net income of this bank for the year is right at $500,000 a year, and $100,000 of it is now spent on compliance.  How did this happen? This happened when Congress decided in 2010 to pass something called Dodd-Dodd-Frank was a bill signed into law in July of 2010 to deal with the financial crisis that happened in 2007 and 2008, which was real. The largest banks in our country took some incredible risks. It caused a financial domino effect all over the country, and it caused great risk for our international markets.  In response to that, Congress rose up with a strong Democratic majority, and President Obama ran to it and said: We need to do something.  They looped together as many different financial restrictions as they could. They created a new thing called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, with no oversight at all. They created a whole litany of new regulations and said: This will only be for the biggest banks because they were the violators.  They put it out there, and then the regulations started flowing after that. Guess what. Farmers State Bank of Allen, which was not the cause of the financial collapse in America, is now caught up, and they are struggling to survive as a bank. Because Congress decided they were going to do something, the something ended up being something that is devastating rural economies in my  Since the passage of Dodd-Frank, we have seen a 16-percent decline in the total number of Oklahoma bank charters--just in my There is a 35-percent decline in Oklahoma charter banks with less than $100 million in[[Page S1538]]total assets since Dodd-The effects of Dodd-Frank were felt pretty quickly in It was passed in 2010. By the 2013-to-2014 reporting time, more than 40 percent of the banks in Oklahoma no longer did mortgage lending at all.  Let that soak in for a minute--banks that don't do mortgages. If you are in a rural community, that is the bread and butter of normal lending in that community--going to get a mortgage. But 40 percent of the banks in Oklahoma, starting in about the 2013, 2014 reporting cycle--just 3 or 4 years after Dodd-Frank passed--had already said the compliance costs were so high and the complexity was so great that they no longer offered mortgages and mortgage lending.  There are folks who say: We will just drive to a big city and go to a big bank and get it, and they will still take care of that. Quite frankly, that is what is happening. Dodd-Frank has done an excellent job of increasing the size, power, and strength of the biggest banks in America and has targeted the smallest banks in We are watching mergers all over my State, as the smallest banks struggle under the compliance costs. It almost looks like the design of Dodd-Frank was to cause biggest banks to get bigger because the smallest banks would not be able to survive under the compliance burdens that were then created for them.  What does that look like in real life? Let me tell you about a gentleman who I bumped into early Monday morning. He was flying out of I was sitting next to the gentleman, and were striking up a conversation. He is a farmer and rancher in He owns about 200 acres in North Central He started to go through the purchase process to actually buy that acreage and couldn't get mortgage lending for it. No banks in the area would do it. Why? The Dodd-Frank requirements. Suddenly, a guy in Oklahoma trying to buy 200 acres had to find a way to scrape together $100,000 of cash to buy a ranch.  Now, 5 years ago, 10 years ago, or 15 years ago, if you wanted to get that same ranch, you would go to the bank in town. Now the bank in town has to tell you that you have to go somewhere else or find some other way to do it because the restrictions are so high that they can't do it anymore.  Local customers don't want to deal with someone else in another State or in another city. They would like to deal with their local bank, but they can't anymore. Oklahoma's community banks had nothing to do with the financial collapse in 2008. Yet they have been penalized all the way through this process.  In total, Dodd-Frank required more than 10 Federal agencies to write more than 400 new rules, imposing 27,000 new mandates on financial institutions of every size. Just process that. When you are Farmer State Bank of Allen and you have 12 employees, you now have to track 27,000 new mandates to keep up with it.  How are you doing with that?  That is what real life looks like. I have had folks say to me: This is some giveaway to the biggest banks.  What we are dealing with in this reform package is pretty straightforward. The Wall Street Journal wrote an editorial earlier this week saying that the bill ``eases administrative burdens on 5,000 community banks that make up 98% of the financial institutions but only 15% of the assets.''  Let me run that past you again. What we are dealing with deals with 98 percent of the banks, but of total banking assets in the country, it is only 15 percent of the assets. That means the top 2 percent of the banks in the country--the largest top 2 percent of the banks in the country--have 85 percent of the assets. I understand the higher regulations on those. They are significant. If they fail, they take down the global economy. For the other 98 percent of the banks in the country that have only 15 percent of the total assets in the country--these are the smallest banks in the country--why are they being dragged into this?  All we want to say is to allow local banks to be local banks again and to be able to loan to their neighbors. These are the folks with whom they go to church and are in Rotary Club, and with whom they have grown up. They know their kids, and they know their families, but they are dealing with all these arcane requirements. They are dealing with 27,000 new rules, and they just can't make it.  What does this look like in real life? Let me give you an illustration from Legacy Bank in Elk Damon, from Legacy Bank in Elk City, OK, said:       As a community banker, my job has become much more      difficult and burdensome to our customers. Legacy has always      strived to offer the best customer service a bank can offer.      I used to be a lender to all. However, with the changes that      have come about with this bill, along with the fines and      penalties that are a potential and, at times, don't use      common sense, I am now a commercial lender only.  Let that soak in for a second. At Legacy Bank in Elk City, he used to make loans to everyone, and now he is a commercial lender only. What does that look like in real life? I have folks who come to this floor and people who catch me and say: Banks are still making lots of money, and banks are doing just fine. Why is Dodd-Frank a problem?  Yes, banks are going to find a way to still do business. What has happened? The biggest banks are loaning to corporate customers, and the smallest banks that used to do small business lending and mortgages and took care of their community can't do that anymore. So the big is getting bigger and helping the biggest, and the small is not able to help the small.  I thought we were supposed to be a country that helped everyone--corporations or individual farmers and ranchers and citizens who are trying to start small businesses. Let's get back to doing that again. Let's not put 27,000 new restrictions on a small community bank and tell it that it has to abide by everything that JPMorgan Chase does and treat it as if it is the same. It is not.  There is Frazer Bank in Altus, about which my wife and I have a longstanding saying: Everywhere you go in the world, you are going to bump into somebody from Altus, Try it sometime.  A local banker wrote: This past week in Altus, we had a local small business owner who applied for a home mortgage loan. The customer had a down payment and closing costs, but one of the key issues preventing our bank from making this personal loan was the time constraint of 2 years of history. This is someone to whom we would have made a home loan prior to Dodd-Frank, but now we cannot.  So a small business owner with closing cost money and with an ability to repay is now blocked out. How serious is that?  Jim Hamby from Vision Bank in Ada wrote me and was trying to describe exactly what this looks like.  He made the statement: Overly prescriptive rules on mortgage lending are the big issue. The ability to repay and the rules governing that topic are geared for people who are W-2 wage earners, not small business people. Many small business people have already been denied credit who would have otherwise qualified for a mortgage, and that is bad policy. Any mortgage bank keeps its own books and should automatically define what is a qualified mortgage. This would help alleviate the ``ability to repay'' rule and allow us to take better care of our customers.  Don't miss what he is saying there. The rules are written for people who get a paycheck from week to week, not for the small business owner and certainly not for the farmers and ranchers.  Here is a statement from a banker in Northwest Oklahoma who asked a simple question: What about a $60 million bank in the northwest corner of Oklahoma? What about other rural markets where smaller, traditional community banks have completely abandoned lines of business and products because the cost of regulation makes it so unprofitable or because the price of regulation and risk from examiners and lawyers bring so much additional scrutiny that you can't afford it?  One thing is certain. When banks are forced to leave lines of business due to government regulation, both customers and communities suffer. Even in markets in which there are other participants in the abandoned product line, the reality is, with fewer competitors, customers pay higher rates and higher fees for a simple service.  This is not a hard issue. For the 2 percent of the largest banks that have[[Page S1539]]85 percent of the banking assets, I understand there is systemic risk there. For the other 98 percent of the banks in the country that cover 15 percent total of all of the banking assets in the country, why are they considered so systemically important that 27,000 new regulations would need to come down on their 12 employees?  This is a good moment in which to get small towns in rural America working again and to allow people to go down the street to the bankers they know and went to school with rather than to have to drive to some big city and talk to the biggest banks in America and have them try to understand more about rural  We can fix this. I am looking forward to passing this reform and allowing our banks not just to make money--they will find a way to make money; they are businesses--but to actually get back to serving the customers they want to serve again in a fair way--farmers and ranchers and small businesses.  I yield the floor.

1238,topic-id,690,"Mr.President, I reserve the right to object. There is no question that I want to see legislative solutions here, and I am actually glad to stand with my colleague from Arizona to talk about how we get a solution on this issue.  As we have seen from Congress, especially over the last 20 years, the challenge has been, if Congress does a temporary patch once, it will do it 20 times again. My concern is for the 7,500 DACA kids who are in my State of They are looking for an actual solution. They want a sense of permanence. Their status has been in limbo since 2012. The question is, Can we actually resolve this for them?  I have put forward a presentation--Senator Flake has been passionate about this as well--for those individuals to actually end up toward naturalization, not to have a temporary patch of just being in limbo status again. It would be to work them through a process to get them in a line in which they actually end up in naturalization at the end of it. At the same time, there would be border security and some other things that we think would be connected to it. I would like to see us work through this process to actually get to a resolution. A couple of Federal courts have pushed back on the administration and have bought Congress a little more time to be able to resolve this issue. I would like for us to use the better wisdom of that to actually get to a solution during this time period.  The goal is: How do we get this resolved?  I am pleased to say the President has moved a long way on this issue. The President has laid out naturalization for 1.8 million people, has dealt with border security, and has engaged in a conversation to actually get it resolved. We had a completely failed effort a couple of weeks ago with four different proposals coming up, with all four of them getting bipartisan support, but with all four of them failing. I would love to see us get on any one of them and start amending it.  The Senator from Arizona and I have already had conversations about changes that I would like to see even in some of the bills that I supported, but the way to resolve that is get on one of them. Let's actually start amending one, and at the end of it, let's let this body work its will. The frustration I have had with this body in these 3 short years that I have been here is, most of the time, we fail to even debate an issue. When it requires 60 votes to even open debate on something, we just, simply, start the process, never get 60, never debate it, never resolve it. Then this body just moves on to another topic.  I commend my colleague from Arizona for reminding this body again that we have an unanswered issue still sitting out there that needs to be resolved. I agree with him completely on that one. Let's get on it. Let's resolve it long term, and let's provide a sense of permanency to this solution, not another temporary patch that will end up being the same temporary patch we will do 3 years from now, 3 years after that, and 3 years after that.  May I remind our body that we are on our fourth continuing resolution just this year. We need to resolve this and take the moment to be able to do that.                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.2579  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator modify his request so that the Senate resume consideration of H.2579. I further ask that the pending amendments be withdrawn with the exception of the Grassley amendment 1959. Finally, I ask that the Grassley amendment be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.

35,topic-id,2073,"Mr.President, we are at an interesting time. We have had months of intense negotiations, sometimes lasting all night and throughout weekends. We have had very tough choices. We have had some very good-faith compromises. In other words, we have actually handled legislation the way we should.  We have reached a bipartisan agreement to fund the government for this fiscal year and to make renewed investments in the American people and to protect our national security.  The fiscal year 2018 Omnibus appropriations bill has $1.3 trillion in discretionary spending. That includes $700 billion for defense programs to support our men and women in uniform and $600 billion in nondefense programs that will help us invest in America and support our working families.  The bill has critical resources dedicated to combating the opioid epidemic, to rebuilding America's infrastructure, to improving healthcare facilities for our veterans, to improving access to affordable healthcare for all Americans, to ensuring the security of our elections, to supporting advances in scientific research, and to investing in rural communities across the country.  The Presiding Officer and every Senator have rural parts of their States, and the investments to be made in those rural communities should be good news for every  These investments would not have been possible without the 2018 bipartisan budget agreement that lifted the budget caps on discretionary spending--lifted the caps for defense by $80 billion and for nondefense by $63 billion--providing relief from the severe cuts in both defense and nondefense known as sequestration.  The consequences of the 2011 Budget Control Act, which mandated sequestration, have been devastating to our military and domestic priorities. This bill is a long-awaited step toward reversing those cuts and allowing us to reinvest in the American people.  I wish the President would actually read what is in the bill. He is calling these investments in our country's priorities a waste. Can you imagine--investing in the priorities of the United States of America a waste?  This morning, he tweeted that they were ``Dem''--I suppose he means Democrats--``giveaways.'' I would ask, Mr.President, is it a giveaway to provide medical care for the 7 million veterans who rely on the VA? I would ask, is it a giveaway to help the family in Rutland, VT, heat their home during a dangerously cold winter so they can afford their groceries? I would ask, is it a giveaway to finally take the opioid crisis seriously by making investments in research, treatment, and prevention?  The President slammed our efforts for budget parity, but he has since shamelessly held press conferences to tout initiatives only made possible by this agreement, including the sizeable new investments to counter the opioid epidemic. Even though it was critical[[Page S1930]]that we put money in for that, he is now saying, of course, it was his idea.  A budget is where you set your priorities. The President made clear in his budget that his priorities do not rest with the needs of hard-working, middle-class The bill rejects many of those areas where the President wanted cuts in the needs of hard-working, middle-class Instead, the bill sets a vision for the future of our country. We invest not only in the wealthiest among us but in middle-class families and those who are struggling to make their way and make their community better.  We dedicate $18.25 billion to begin rebuilding our infrastructure. The American Society of Civil Engineers gives our country's infrastructure a D-plus. A lot of countries have much higher. This was the collective grade for the roads, bridges, dams, drinking water, wastewater, public parks, and schools on which we all depend. That is not acceptable, not in this country, and this bill is an important, long-overdue step toward bringing our infrastructure into the 21st century.  The bill takes the opioid crisis seriously by investing $3.3 billion into law enforcement, healthcare, and community efforts that we know help to rid our country of this scourge. The time for sloganeering and sound bites is over. I have always preferred substance over slogans, and the time for real, effective, and meaningful investment in ending this epidemic has arrived. Marcelle and I have met with too many Vermonters as we go around our State who are impacted by opioid abuse, too many neighbors and friends who are struggling to get the help they need or to help those in need. I am glad that when I return to Vermont, I can say that we heard them, and we delivered.  This bill strongly rejects the partisan package passed by House Republicans in September, which would have recklessly slashed funding for domestic priorities by $68 billion below the bipartisan agreement introduced Most importantly, this bill rejects devastating cuts proposed by the Trump administration. These included the President's proposed cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency, which helps ensure we have clean air and drinking water. The bill rejects his cuts to job training, education, and childcare programs that so many of our Nation's working families rely on. It rejects the President's misguided proposal to slash the budget for the Department of This bill also rejects the President's misguided immigration priorities by refusing his request to hire an additional 850 ICE agents and increase the number of ICE detention beds. It also rejects his request to build a ``big, beautiful wall'' on the southern border--something that reflects last century's technology. Instead of his original $1.6 billion request for 74 miles of wall, which was later increased to a request for $18 billion to build a wall on the entire southern border, the bill funds only a fraction of that, and it includes important restrictions on how the funds can be used.  The bill provides $641 million for 33 miles of fencing in the Rio Grande Valley, $251 million to replace secondary fencing, which is already in San Diego, and $445 million for replacement of existing pedestrian fencing. It speaks to real need, not to funding a campaign slogan.  Incidentally, in the request, somehow the campaign promise that this would be paid for by Mexico, and not by American taxpayers, seems to have been forgotten.  Importantly, the bill includes language requiring the Department of Homeland Security to use proven fence designs that currently exist on the border instead of allowing the President to build a 30-foot concrete wall, which would endanger our men and women who patrol the border.  I would still like the President to tell us when and how he wants Mexico to cover these costs because, time and again, he promised the American people Mexico would a pay for it. Time and again, he gave us his word. We now know that was never a promise he could keep.  One critical thing missing from this bill, though, is a remedy for the crisis the President has created, and that crisis relates to DACA recipients. I have watched with fury as the President has, day after day, tweeted the Democrats are responsible for not addressing Late last night, he tweeted:       Democrats refused to take care of Would have been so      easy, but they just didn't care.  For nearly two decades, I have been a proud supporter of the DREAM I included it in the 2013 comprehensive immigration bill. I care. Democrats care. We voted for that bill on the floor of the Republican leadership in the House refused to take it up. Yet, after promising before Members of Congress in both parties and the American people, making a big splash on TV, the President said he would sign an agreement to address DACA, but then he walked away from a bipartisan DACA and border security compromise in  There is no fix for DACA because the President and the Republican leadership are not serious about getting one. I wish they would. This Senator is willing to sit down with any Senator--Republican or Democratic--if we can get such an agreement.  This bill does strike more than 130 poison pill riders. These riders would have restricted women's access to healthcare. They would have rolled back environmental protections. They would have put significant restrictions on consumer financial protections. Had these riders stayed in, we would not have reached a successful conclusion to this negotiation, notwithstanding the all-night sessions of negotiating, notwithstanding the weekends.  I do not agree with everything in this bill. When you have a package of this magnitude, there is always going to be matters included that we like and things on which we disagree. That is the nature of compromise, but the Senate was designed by the Founders of this country to require compromise. This bill represents tangible progress that is going to benefit all Americans, and I am proud of the compromise Republicans and Democrats reached together.  I thank my own staff. They have worked days and nights and weekends. I am able to leave at night. They are still working well past midnight. I was able to go to Vermont last weekend.

301,topic-id,379,"Mr.President, I am voting for this legislation because, on balance, I believe it will provide important legal recourse to victims of sex trafficking and will help hold accountable those websites that seek to exploit them. Protecting these victims should be our top priority.  There have been concerns raised that this legislation may have an unintended--and harmful--impact on one of the key laws underpinning the free and open That key law is section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, CDA 230, which promotes free expression and innovation by protecting online platforms from a range of laws that might otherwise hold them unfairly accountable for everything their individual users may say and do online. This law defends free speech online and has encouraged innovations ranging from the earliest online bulletin board systems to today's platforms for social media and user-generated video. Without the protections of CDA 230, the internet would be a very different place today.  Today's legislation amends CDA 230 by, among other things, prohibiting construing that law to limit Federal or State civil liability for conduct that involves ``knowingly assisting, supporting, or facilitating a violation of'' Federal child sex trafficking laws. Clearly, CDA 230 was never intended to be a shield to protect child sex traffickers, and it should not, but there is concern this legislation could potentially open up providers and websites who operate in good faith to new liability risks for what their users say or do, which could harm free expression. Also, the threat of this liability will fall especially hard on smaller platforms that have fewer resources to fight lawsuits, even ones without merit, which could harm innovation.  As a result, I do not take amendments to this core protection for free expression and innovation online lightly. I am voting in favor of today's legislation because we must balance those possible risks against the very real scourge this legislation will forcefully combat: sex trafficking, including trafficking of underage youth. Just earlier this week, Senators Collins, Heitkamp, and I reintroduced our bipartisan bill to curb youth homelessness and support young victims of trafficking, the Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention This is an issue I have long been committed to addressing.

He is the one with the hair and better looking.[[Page S1895]]  Marcelle and I have joined Thad in Mississippi to visit sprawling cotton farms and fish farms, and twice Thad joined me in Vermont to visit small family dairy farmers. I even introduced him to my mother in  Now, I have to make a confession here, and I hope this doesn't go out of this room. It was during one of those trips to Vermont--to Johnsbury, VT--in 1985 that I had extolled the beauty of Vermont in the wintertime. When we arrived, I think the southern gentleman was not ready for temperatures that dipped down to around 20 below zero. That is cold weather even by Vermont standards. This wonderful southern gentleman turned to me and he said: Pat, this is not Mississippi weather. Then, he made a few other suggestions of what I was trying to do to him, but we had a wonderful visit just the same. We stayed in what is called the Rabbit Inn, with fireplaces going. The next day at our meetings, I think Vermont was ready to elect Thad Cochran as its third Senator, because he was so impressive.  We also traveled beyond Vermont and We met with leaders around the world. As senior Members of the Senate, we could go in a bipartisan way to see what they thought about the United States and to answer their questions. We and our wives became closer in these fact-finding visits. No matter how long the trip was--and some were to the other side of the Earth--Thad, through his conversation and his friendship, made even the longest trip seem short.  In our travels, one of the things I could always count on was that Thad would always check in on the Cochran fellows in whatever country we were in. Starting in 1984, the Cochran Fellowship Program has provided training for more than 17,500 people from 125 different countries to develop agricultural systems and to strengthen trade between our countries. The program also strengthens understanding between the United States and other countries.  Thad is leaving a legacy that is tied to our Nation's agricultural development. When he was chair of the Agriculture Committee, he left his fingerprints on the farm bill, which are still there today. More recently, we championed the reauthorization of the Farm to School Program, which provides Federal resources to bring fresh and nutritious local food from local farmers to more than 40,000 schools across the country, including 83 percent of the schools in Vermont--what a legacy, as the son of a teacher and a great advocate for Mississippi farmers. Thad knows how important this program is to strengthening local farm economies and educating young kids and their families about the importance of eating locally grown and nutritionally dense food. This picture was taken as we were visiting a farm--obviously not when it was 25 below zero. It was probably a warm summer day. So that is why we only have on light sweaters.  Even though we are on the opposite ends of the political spectrum, Thad and I have crossed the aisle to work hand-in-hand for the American people--from our work in the Senate to our work for years as regents at the In every bill and program on which we have worked, he has been a Senator with integrity, decency, civility, and, most importantly, a dear and cherished friend. Thad will always keep his word, and I tell that to the Senate because that is a quality that is becoming too rare sometimes in both parties. He is old school. Many of us would say the best school.  When I became vice chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I knew I would have a steadfast partner in Senator He has earned the moniker of ``the quiet persuader.'' He was also referred to by one of the members of the Appropriations Committee once--a moniker that should be appreciated--as a workhorse, not a show horse. That is why he has been so successful--the quiet persuader. Well, the quite persuader, when Hurricane Katrina struck, used his leadership to direct nearly $100 billion to communities on the gulf coast to rebuild.  Thad will leave this Chamber having cast more than 13,000 votes and becoming the 10th longest serving Senator in the history of our country. A constant champion of Mississippi and the American people, I don't think many people truly understand how much Senator Cochran has accomplished for his State and his country.  Marcelle and I count Thad and Kay among our dearest friends. His leadership on the Appropriations Committee in the Senate will be sorely missed. Our country needs more devoted public servants like Thad Cochran, and I am sad to see my dear friend leave. But I know his legacy is a presence that will be felt in this Chamber, in Mississippi, and across the country for generations to come. I will enjoy looking at the photographs of my dear friend taken in Vermont, Mississippi, and around the world. He is one of my heroes.  I yield the floor.

1388,topic-id,1296,"Mr.President, I thank Senator Sanders for his leadership on this issue. It is an honor to be here with my friend and colleague, the Senator from Vermont, to talk about our joint resolution to force a vote on U.military involvement in a civil war that is going on in  Whether one is present in the Senate Chamber today or whether one is tuning in from home, I hope you will listen closely for the next hour or so, so we can fill you in on the unauthorized Middle East war that your U.Government is supporting.  This war in Yemen has killed tens of thousands of innocent victims--human beings, lest we forget--each with immeasurable, innate, God-given dignity. This war has created refugees, orphans, and widows. It has cost many millions of dollars. Believe it or not, at the end of the day, according to at least one U.Government report, it has, arguably, undermined our fight against terrorist threats, such as ISIS, rather than to advance those efforts.  I will expand on these uncomfortable facts in a few minutes, but, for now, let's focus on just one thing. Our military's involvement in Yemen has not been authorized by the U.Congress as is required by the U.Article I, section 8 of the Constitution is pretty clear on this point. It reads that Congress shall have the power to declare war--Congress, not the President, not the Pentagon-- This is the branch of government that is most accountable to the people at the most regular intervals. It makes sense that this power would only be granted to that branch of government. Yet, in 2015, President Obama initiated our military involvement in Yemen without having permission from Congress, without having an authorization for the use of military force, without having a declaration of war. The current administration has continued Obama's war.  Senator Sanders and I, along with Senator Murphy and our six other cosponsors, are giving Congress a chance to fix this error by debating and voting on our Nation's continued involvement in this illegal, unauthorized war in  Now, as our opponents claim, if this war is necessary, then, surely, they will be willing to come down to this floor within the Senate Chamber and defend it. Surely they will be willing to come onto the floor of the Senate and onto the floor of the House and seek authorization from Congress as the Constitution demands. Let's have an honest reckoning about this war today.  At this very moment, a tragedy is unfolding in Very sadly, it is a tragedy for which our Nation shares some blame. Here are just a few facts about this war in Yemen, which is now approaching its third year: Fifteen million human souls in Yemen lack clean water and sanitation, and 8 million are at risk of starvation. The Yemeni people have been visited by the worst cholera outbreak in recorded human history--over 1 million cases. Every 10 minutes, a child under the age of 5 dies of preventable causes. A total of 10,000 civilians have been killed in this war, and 40,000 more civilians have been wounded in this war.  I think it is important to discuss the human toll this war is inflicting. I think it is especially important to have discussions like this one at the outset so that as we go into a conflict, the stakes are clear. For thousands of human beings, the decision we make in this Chamber will make the difference between life and death. This is one of the many reasons it is so important to keep reminding ourselves that the Founding Fathers were very clear about this. They didn't leave any ambiguity in terms of identifying who has the power to make decisions like this one, who has the power to decide when we go to war. Article I, section 8, says that Congress shall have the power to declare war.  From time to time, I hear it argued that declarations of war are somehow antiquated, that they are outdated, that they are anachronisms akin to ceremonial relics like powdered wigs or a key to the city, akin to a society whose principal mode of transportation involved a horse and a buggy, but that isn't true. These principles are as true today as they were then. Nothing about those principles has become outdated.  If you read the Founding Fathers, it is very clear that they thought the power to declare war was, in fact, important. They deliberately considered the matter and withheld it from the President for a reason. They did not vest this power in the Office of the Presidency, and that was a conscious, deliberate, and I believe wise choice.  To quote Alexander Hamilton in Federalist 69, the Founding Fathers wanted their President to be ``much inferior'' in power to a Kings declare war unilaterally. They can make life-or-death military decisions--on a whim if they want to. They don't need to go and seek support from the public before doing so. In our system, Presidents, by contrast, have to garner support from the public and the legislative branch before initiating war--far from a unilateral decision. The decision to go to war in America is supposed to be based on collaboration and consensus so that our Nation will be united to the greatest degree possible when we go[[Page S1664]]through trying conflicts, at that moment when unity is what is so badly needed.  So which does the modern Executive resemble more today--a President as the Founding Fathers understood that term or a King? The answer is uncomfortably clear from the string of unauthorized military excursions that Presidents from both political parties have initiated in recent decades.  Of course, some people claim that the President has broad constitutional authority to make war as Commander in Chief of the Armed They are absolutely right. The President of the United States is, in fact, the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, but this is not the beginning and the end to the question. This does not mean the President may authorize at will military excursions around the globe for any reason or no reason at all without authorization from It does not mean that. It means nothing close to that. Only Congress can authorize a military campaign. Once Congress has done so, then the President has broad authority, vast discretion to decide how specifically to command the Armed Forces to victory.  There is one important notable exception to this big principle, and that exception arises specifically in the event of an attack on the United The Founders were wise. They anticipated that there could be threats to the homeland so serious that it might be physically impossible for Congress to respond quickly enough, so they preserved to the President the power to ``repel sudden attacks,'' in the words of James  Clearly, this strategy--we might describe it as a ``break glass in case of emergency'' kind of strategy. It is that kind of power. It is a ``break glass in times of emergency'' kind of power. It is supposed to be used only under extreme, extraordinary circumstances where Congress cannot convene in time to save the The Founders did not intend for the Commander in Chief's power to be used to justify military intervention in civil wars 8,000 miles away. That authorization can come only from this body in the form of a declaration of war or in the form of an authorization for use of military force. To date, we have not considered either one of these, much less voted on them and passed them in the case of this civil war in  So I would ask my colleague, Senator Sanders from Vermont, how long the American people can be expected to ignore our involvement in a foreign war.

1393,topic-id,944,"I am not sure what constitutes oversized, but I have it on good authority that the ordinary Senate rules don't allow for a picture this big without unanimous consent. So, therefore, I sought it.  The picture itself paints an image and leaves an impression that itself is oversized and that demonstrates the humanity of this conflict. You see a child standing in what appears to be a school in an ordinary learning environment that has been rendered unusable by the devastating impact of war.  Now, war does happen. Conflicts do arise. This is one of the reasons why it was built into not only our system of laws but our foundational governing structure in the The Founding Fathers understood that war would arise from time to time, but they carefully divided up the power, recognizing how devastating its implications could be, recognizing that bad things are a little bit less likely to happen if you don't allow too much power to be concentrated in the hands of a few.  Over time, Congress and the Presidency have had a little bit of a tug-of-war, as I referenced earlier, about where the Commander in Chief power ends and the war power begins.  In 1973 Congress reasserted its constitutional role and tried to clarify some of what had been described as a gray area by passing the War Powers The crisis that led Congress to create this important law in many ways was reminiscent of the conflict that we are discussing today.  The War Powers Act was passed in response to the Vietnam war. That war began with the insertion of just a small handful of U.military advisers in 1950, but their ranks grew and grew gradually but steadily, so that our commitment in Vietnam spiraled into a decades-long, bloodied conflict. Presidents from both parties abused their authority in order to wage this far-off war.  Finally, in 1973, Congress decided it was time to bring our boys home. So it repealed the limited legal authority for the war it had granted to then-President Johnson 7 years earlier.  In defiance of Congress, President Nixon continued the war, citing his authority as Commander in So Congress drafted the War Powers Resolution to give itself a way to remove our armed services personnel from unauthorized, unlawful, and unconstitutional war zones.  The War Powers Resolution states that the President must notify Congress within 48 hours of committing American troops to ``hostilities'' or ``imminent hostilities.'' The War Powers Resolution goes on to provide that the President must remove troops from the conflict if Congress does not authorize their presence within 60 days or a maximum of 90 days in the case of certain emergencies.  Congress's passage of the War Powers Resolution was a bold assertion of its constitutional responsibility in the face of a chronically overreaching executive branch. In fact, Congress's desire to uphold the Constitution was so strong that it actually overrode President Nixon's veto of the War Powers  Members of Congress today could certainly learn a thing or two from their predecessors' commitment to constitutional duties and to the limited power possessed by each branch of government.  Since the War Powers Resolution was passed in 1973, defenders of a royal executive have tried to go around it and[[Page S1666]]tried to circumvent it altogether by claiming that their unauthorized wars somehow do not qualify as ``hostilities.''  We heard this claim by President Obama in response to Libya, and we heard it again in response to It is the official position of the U.Department of Defense that we are not engaged in ``hostilities'' in Yemen unless our troops ``are actively engaged in exchanges of fire with opposing units of hostile forces.''  To translate, the U.Government really claims that it is not engaged in hostilities unless U.troops are on the ground being shot at by the enemy.  It stretches the imagination, and it stretches the English language beyond its breaking point to assert that our military is not engaged in hostilities in Consider for a moment what it is that the U.military is doing as part of the Saudi-led coalition effort against the neighbors of Saudi Arabia, the Yemeni neighbors.  U.military personnel are assigned to the joint combined planning cell in Saudi Arabia, where they are sharing military intelligence with the Saudis and helping to target enemies within Yemen for attack. Our forces are also refueling coalition bombers in midair on combat missions. If sending our military men and women to foreign lands to fuel a country's bombers and handpick its targets does not qualify as ``hostilities,'' then those words have lost their meaning. What does the word ``hostility'' mean if it cannot be said to encompass that?  As it happens, the War Powers Resolution was designed to stop secret and unauthorized military activities such as these. So Congress is well within its right to vote on whether these activities should continue.  That is why this joint resolution that is authored by Senator Sanders and cosponsored by Senator Murphy, myself, and six others represents a big chance--a significant chance, a constitutional moment--for Congress to do the right thing, for Congress to do its job, and for Congress to represent the American people. After all, this is their blood and their treasure that are being put on the line. That is why the Constitution and the War Powers Resolution alike contemplate actions by Congress and not solely unilateral action by the executive branch.  I ask my colleagues Senator Sanders and Senator Murphy: Isn't it arguable that by overreaching in this instance, we might in fact be making matters worse? Couldn't we be putting our country in a position of less security rather than more?  ",CREC-2018-03-13-pt1-PgS1656-2.txt,1501,"CONGRATULATING THE CITY OF ALTON, ILLINOIS",2018.0,13.0,March

The Houthis we are fighting are a regional force--one that doesn't harbor ambitions of attacking the U.homeland. While the Houthis are certainly no friend of ours, neither are they a serious threat to our country. Yet we are diverting considerable resources to fighting the Houthis, resources that would be better spent fighting more substantial threats--threats that harbor, rather openly, ambitions of bringing down the United States, of attacking the United These are threats like al-Qaida or On that point, the best evidence we have suggests that their involvement in Yemen has arguably undermined our fight against  The State Department's most recent study, its most recent ``Country Reports on Terrorism''--which, by the way, happens to be the authority on that subject for Congress and the American people--says that we have inadvertently strengthened ISIS by killing off its antagonists, the This just reinforces the farcical character that our military excursions in the Middle East have the potential to undertake. We bomb with one hand; we give humanitarian aid with the other hand. We whack a terrorist from one group, and another springs up in its place.  Defenders of our efforts in this war in Yemen often claim that the real reason we are fighting the Houthis is that they are a proxy for Iran, which is the true threat to our Nation and to the world. This would be perhaps a reasonable rationale, but there are conflicting reports about the Houthis and their ties to Iran has expansionist views; the Houthis do not. Hezbollah is an officially listed as a foreign terrorist organization; the Houthis are not. The Houthis may be a rogue non-[[Page S1668]]State actor, destabilizing their own country, but they are not a threat to America--at least not yet. By helping the Saudis bomb them, we only give the Houthis reasons to start to hate us. Our involvement in Yemen detracts from our ability to be a diplomatic resource and the peacemaker in the region.  In closing, the substance of the resolution offered by Senator Sanders and cosponsored by Senator Murphy, me, and others is simple. It puts our war against the Houthi rebels to a vote. It concerns the Houthis and only the If Members are convinced that our fight against the Houthis is worthwhile, then so be it. Congress will have done its part and the fight will go on, but if Members are not willing to pay the heavy pricetag for this war, calculated in dollars and in innocent human lives, then our resolution will bring U.operations to a close.  This resolution is an opportunity for Members of Congress to stand up and be counted on a matter of life and death. It is an opportunity to end the Executive's unconstitutional dominance over matters of war and peace and restore in its place a collaborative process whereby Congress declares war and Presidents wage war.

What my friends on the other side of the aisle don't always recognize is the impact that has on the ability of those companies to serve their customers.  Take cybersecurity as an example. Financial firms of all sizes are forced to adhere to an overlapping regulatory regime that is focused on fighting yesterday's war.  I spoke with a major bank just last week that has cybersecurity examinations from the Federal Reserve, the Comptroller of the Currency, the FDIC, the Treasury Department, and multiple State banking agencies; and that doesn't include the foreign entities that regulate the international businesses of this bank. Each agency has a slightly different exam process and requires slightly different information.  This type of regime doesn't protect companies from cybersecurity threats. The lack of coordination means this institution spends more time reacting to the regulators than it does protecting its customers.  Or look at the antiquated regime surrounding examination and enforcement of the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering laws. What was originally intended to be a reasonable process that fostered collaboration between financial institutions and law enforcement to root out bad actors and[[Page H1388]]illicit financing has become so onerous that banks are choosing to drop customers or close entire books of businesses just to avoid compliance burdens. Processes like these do very little to help consumers or the integrity of the financial system.  Every time I speak to a bank or credit union in Missouri, I ask what one rule or regulation they find to be the most burdensome or they would like to see changed. The answer is always the same: It isn't just one. It is the weight of all the rules combined that is restricting credit and the availability of financial services in our communities.  We have to make a change, Mr.Mr.Loudermilk's legislation would institute a more thoughtful approach to regulations that will not only offer regulatory relief, but also foster a more responsible and stable financial marketplace.  As the gentleman from Georgia has said in the past, this bill isn't just about regulatory relief; it is about good government. This should not be a partisan exercise. I hope every Member of this body stands for responsible government and joins me in supporting H.4607 today.  ",CREC-2018-03-06-pt1-PgH1382-5.txt,1931,"LINN, AND MATTHEW BELLINA",2018.0,6.0,April

1179,topic-id,464,"Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this matter today.  It is kind of interesting that we have before us an amendment that basically is something that deals with a financial services bill, something that deals with a financial services issue, yet we had the EPA and a whole bunch of other agencies brought into the discussion here, which has nothing to do with what we are trying to talk about here today.  The amendment talks about the President or his immediate family members. How is it possible that, unless those family members have the authority to make the request, they even should be considered?  This is sort of pulling things out of the air here that make no sense to me. This is a very simple bill that we have where all we are looking at trying to do is take the EGRPRA law that says that, every 10 years, all the rules and regulations are reviewed.  All we are doing is putting two agencies back into this group of agencies that are under review, one that was not even in existence at the time of the bill's passage back in the nineties, the CFPB; and the other one that needs to be included is the National Credit All we are doing is taking that 10-year review down to 7.  Why is this controversial? We are taking an agency that was not even included in this originally and putting it under the purview of this bill so that there can be a review of the rules and regulations.  Is there lack of transparency on the other side?  Do we no longer want to be concerned about what is going on?  Do we no longer want to know that the rules and regulations are appropriately adjudicated here by these agencies?  I think that is the wrong way to go. I think that we need to have more transparency. Reducing from 10 years down to 7 gives us an opportunity to have a more constant review of these things to make sure that the bureaucratic folks in the executive branch of the government don't run away with what should be, in my view, the authority of the                              {time}  1330  Madam Speaker, I think that the motion to recommit is way out of line here, and I don't think we need to waste any more time on it.

650,topic-id,976,"Mr.President, after 2 years of hard work and because of the determination and strength of David and Kate Grubb of Charleston, WV, Jessie's Law was finally passed by Congress and signed into law, and I thank each and every one of my colleagues for their support.  Jessie's Law is different from other pieces of legislation. Jessie's Law will actually save lives and prevent parents from experiencing the heartbreak of losing a child.  Jessie Grubb's story is known to many of you already, but for those of you who haven't heard it and for those of you who don't know it, I want to go over some of the highlights.  After years of struggling with heroin addiction, Jessie had been doing very well. She had been sober for 6 months. She was focusing on making a life for herself in Michigan and was training for a marathon. She had surgery for an infection related to her running injury and died the day after leaving the hospital. All of her hard work was ruined because of a careless mistake.  Jessie's death is particularly heartbreaking because it was 100 percent preventable. Her parents, David and Kate, traveled to Michigan for Jessie's surgery. Both Jesse and her parents told her doctors and hospital personnel that she was a recovering addict. It was reflected in her medical records in eight different places. However, it was not highlighted the same as it would be when you have any type of an allergy or if you go in and they ask--the question is usually asked--are you allergic to penicillin? Then it is very much highlighted, to the point that a mistake would not be made. This was not done.  After Jessie's surgery, the discharging doctor said he didn't know she was a recovering addict and sent her home with a prescription for 50 oxycodone pills. She should never have been given a description for opioid medication in the first place, as she had asked when she entered the hospital.  With the passage of Jessie's Law, we have taken the critical step toward saying that this will never happen again. Jessie's Law will establish new standards for healthcare providers to ensure that when a patient provides information about their opiate addiction, that information is shared with their doctors and nurses and is flagged just like we would flag a drug allergy. Having this critical information will help ensure that healthcare providers can make medically appropriate decisions about pain management for recovering opiate addicts. This simple step could have saved Jessie's life, and we owe it to her memory to make the change and keep other families from experiencing the same pain.  It has been over 2 years. You would have thought this would have been done within 2 weeks. It is such common sense. I don't think anyone realized before that they could not or did not or were not responsible for or were not by law supposed to basically make sure that every record--every transcript that she had in that hospital should have been marked and highlighted so nobody could have missed it.  Jessie's story and her family's pain are all too common in West Virginia and throughout this In 2016, 884 West Virginians lost their lives due to overdose. We have the highest loss of life per capita in the Nation--the highest in the Every hour, five people die from an opiate overdose. With continued support and tireless work from everyone, we can beat this epidemic once and for all. Jessie's legacy will save people's lives and will prevent parents and families from dealing with the pain and tragedy of losing a child.  David and Kate, Jessie's parents, have been determined from day one to make sure Jessie's death wasn't meaningless, and I am honored to say that Jessie's legacy will live on for a long, long time--long after we are gone. I talked to David and Kate today, and I can't tell you how elated they were to know that it will finally pass in a piece of legislation we will be voting on shortly. It is going to save a lot of heartache and a lot of pain and the tragedy that families suffer.  This was a beautiful young lady, as you can see. She was very intelligent, very athletic. She just happened to fall into the pits of this horrible epidemic we have.  We thought when we first heard it that it was just an oversight, but there are the HIPAA laws and all the different concerns that people have for privacy, and we weren't able to change it. The Presiding Officer, being a physician, knows how hospitals work and how the information is treasured and guarded. But this was one where we thought, my goodness, if there is an allergy, if you are allergic to penicillin--if I come into the hospital as a patient and tell you that I am a recovering addict, so please make sure that everyone in this hospital knows that I have had an addiction and that I still have addiction problems that I will have all my life, but I am recovering--Jessie was 6 months sober, and for some reason, it was not identified.  Jessie's legacy will live on and the courage her parents have had to fight this fight so that we all can share it with the rest of the country, and maybe save countless lives throughout the country and each one of our States, and all the parents who suffer through this.  The lives of David and Kate will be forever changed, but they have the beautiful memory of this beautiful young lady, 30 years of age, Jessie  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.

One evening, the conductor was unable to attend a performance, and[[Page S1376]]Everett stepped up to fill the role, a move that launched his talent and professionalism into the spotlight.  In 1945, Everett served as the music director of ``On the Town,'' a groundbreaking show for having an integrated cast. Still, despite his success, Everett faced adversity and was once advised against auditioning for a seat in the New York Many thought the South would not yet embrace him either. His response was to aim even higher and pursue an even more challenging career path as a conductor. In 1947, he founded the Cosmopolitan Symphony, which became famous for its inclusion of all ethnicities and backgrounds.  In time, Everett was invited by national and international symphonies to conduct, including the Louisville Symphony, which in 1953 made Everett the first African-American to lead a major symphony orchestra in the U.He went on to break even more barriers and rise above any challenge that came his way.

He held the position as chief conductor of the Norrkoping Symphony Orchestra in Sweden for a decade. In 1976, he conducted the New York Philharmonic for the first time. It was a concert in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr., which was particularly fitting; both men held the ideal that they could embody the change they wanted to see in the world and created opportunities for those who wanted to follow in their footsteps.  Time and time again, sheer talent and strength of character have transcended societal obstacles. It is because of individuals such as Everett Lee that countless musicians, regardless of their background or ethnicity, have pursued their dreams.  On his 100th birthday, the Mayor of Wheeling designated August 31 as ``Everett Lee Day'' so we could all celebrate his extraordinary talent and strength of character. We are truly blessed to have such an international treasure as a part of our West Virginia family. Again, it is a great honor and privilege to recognize his many accomplishments, and I wish him and his family the very best.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-06-pt1-PgS1375-3.txt,1983,"LINN, AND MATTHEW BELLINA",2018.0,6.0,March

956,topic-id,1625,"Mr.President, anyone tuning into the Senate floor this week is probably very confused right now, and that is because we are not debating how to address the scourge of gun violence plaguing this country, just 22 days after the horrific Parkland mass shooting and following a near-universal call from the American people for Congress to get serious about guns. They are debating it in the State legislature in Florida, but we just don't have time in the U.Senate to debate this overarching issue of gun safety in our country.  The American people may be confused because we are not debating the fate of the 800,000 Dreamers and the uncertainty they still face; confused because we are not debating our crumbling infrastructure which, despite repeated calls from this President, we have seen nothing resembling a credible plan from him to fix our Nation's bridges, roads, and water systems and provide broadband for rural  Democrats do have a real plan, and we should be debating that. But no. Instead, just 3 months after the passage of massive tax giveaways that handed over more than $1 trillion to the wealthiest Americans and megacorporations, we are here debating a giveaway to the world's biggest banks.  We have moved on from tax handouts to the wealthy, to taxpayer-funded bailouts for Wall Street megabanks. That is not my opinion. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released their analysis of this bailout bill and noted that the risk of a financial crisis would go up under this legislation.  Why in the world is Congress doing anything that increases the risk of a financial crisis? It has only been 10 years since the great recession, but Republicans seem to have forgotten about that. Maybe that is why this week is so confusing--because the backers of this bill are not talking about the risk to the entire financial system they are enabling. They have forgotten that and are only talking about the benefits to community banks.  Yes, there are some benefits. Those of us on the other side of this legislation are not arguing about that point. You could probably find consensus among all 100 Senators in this body that there is a legitimate, targeted relief we can and should provide for those community banks, but that is far from all this bill does. This community bank relief is being used to protect the giveaways for some of the biggest banks in this country.  Anyone listening to the supporters of this legislation would have no idea that 25 of the 38 largest banks in the United States will have critical Dodd-Frank rules rolled back for them. Anyone listening would have no idea that banks with up to $250 billion in assets are being told the current rules are too tough for them. These banks received $48 billion in taxpayer-funded bailout money. Those banks are not community banks.  Now, a decade after the financial collapse of 2008, we are saying it is probably We are pretty sure they have learned their lessons. We are pretty sure that now the big banks will put the economic security of the country ahead of their own profits.  So the bottom line: This bill, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, will increase risks to our entire economy, and the fact that the words ``consumer protection'' are mentioned last should make clear they are simply an afterthought.  When large institutions fail--whether it is Lehman Brothers, Enron, AIG--it is everyday working consumers who get hit the hardest and pay the highest price.  There is the rule on Wall Street: On the way up, the big guys clean up; on the way down, the little guys get cleaned out. We saw that during the last financial crisis, when millions of Americans lost their jobs or their homes, and we are seeing it today, with increasingly common data breaches that compromise Americans' financial and personal information.  In recent years, devastating data breaches have become the new normal. The likes of Target, JPMorgan Chase, Yahoo, eBay, T.J.Maxx, Home Depot, and Sony are among so many who have become synonymous with massive data breaches.  Of course, there is Equifax, which is both a credit reporting agency and a data broker. Equifax's sole mission is using and profiting from consumers' most personal information, and they failed to protect that information. More than 145 million Americans' Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, and, in some instances, even driver's license numbers and credit card numbers were compromised because Equifax failed to institute even the most basic security protocols. It seems that, for the American consumer, every year is the year of the data breach, and they are sick and tired of their information falling into the wrong hands.[[Page S1574]]  So as the Senate debates how to ensure financial institutions do not endanger the American economy the way they did during the financial crisis, we cannot forget our constituents' calls for new data protection rules. That is why I have filed my Data Broker Accountability and Transparency Act as an amendment to this legislation. I thank Senators Blumenthal, Sanders, and Whitehouse for joining me.  My colleagues and I--Republican and Democratic alike--were outraged when we learned about the Equifax hack and how it hurts our constituents across the country, but what have we accomplished in the U.Senate since then? Nothing, and the threat is only growing.  We have an entire industry whose whole business model is predicated on profiting on Americans' most sensitive information. They are collecting it, storing it, selling it, and, in many instances, losing it in data hacks and breaches. Consumers don't even know who these companies are. They live in the shadows of our economy. Consumers rarely have any direct contact or business relationship with a data broker. Yet they know nearly everything about you. That is not just Social Security numbers, detailed credit histories, addresses, driver's license numbers. That is information on what you read, what music you listen to, your children, and your medical history.  In today's economy, you--the American consumer--are the commodity that is bought and sold in the open market. Right now, you have no rights. Data brokers are collecting, using, sharing Americans' personal information without your knowledge, without your consent.  Right now, American consumers are completely powerless. You can't say: Stop selling my information to any of these companies. That is unacceptable.  We need transparency; we need accountability. That is why I urge my colleagues to support my Data Broker Accountability and Transparency My amendment would hold data brokers accountable.  First, my amendment allows consumers to access and correct the information that data brokers hold about them. Americans should be able to stop the spread of inaccurate information that could damage them personally and financially.  Second, my amendment provides consumers with the right to stop data brokers from using, sharing, or selling their personal information for marketing purposes.  Third, my amendment requires data brokers to implement comprehensive privacy and data security programs and to provide reasonable notice in the case of breaches. Equifax should have been required to have robust security to protect Americans' information. We must stop the next  It has now been 6 months since the public became aware of that breach, and Congress has yet to enact any major legislation in response. We are still in the data broker Wild American consumers are still powerless, and the next breach could be around the corner.  Here is the financial services bill that we are taking up. Here is a bill that is directly related to these banks that we are talking about. Here is an opportunity for us to begin to figure out a way of protecting consumers in this data breach area where their financial records, where their health records, where their families' records could be compromised.  What is the solution? We are moving through legislation that deals with the problems the bankers say they have, but we are not dealing with problems consumers say they have with these financial institutions. When do we take up that bill? When do we finally say to the largest companies: What are the protections? What are the safeguards that are going to be constructed so that people's personal information is not compromised, so the data brokers aren't able to create a world in which everyone's information is just part of their profit-making opportunity?  That is what we should be talking about. Let's have a big debate here. Let's ensure that each and every one of these issues is dealt with.  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment because we have to get to the heart of this Equifax issue. We have to actually deal with the world as it has changed. If the proponents of this bill say that the world has changed since the crash in 2008 and 2009, then the world has also changed with regard to the potential for the compromise of the information of every Let's have that debate, as well, in the same bill.  I urge that my amendment be put in order, and I urge that the Members of the Senate support it. It is time for us to give those protections to consumers, which they are crying out for. No individual consumer is crying out for this change in the banking bill, but they are crying out for protections in a system where they have no voice, no way to ensure that their own family's personal data is not compromised.

Six years ago, Senator Whitehouse began a campaign to speak every week about climate change. One need only look at the past 6 years of climate impacts to understand just how important the Senator's pledge is.  The planet has been warming for years, but in the last few years, the disturbing trends have accelerated. The last 4 years have been the hottest on record.  The effects of climate change are already obvious, from the eroding coasts[[Page S1675]]off Cape Cod to storm surge in Boston January's bomb cyclone in Massachusetts broke the flood record in Boston set by the Blizzard of 1978.  Sadly, this is our new normal. Thirteen of the top 20 biggest flood events in Boston have occurred since 2000. While Massachusetts gets overrun by the impacts of climate change, President Trump has plans to expand offshore drilling off the New England coast. This is the very definition of insanity.  Our communities and our oceans are feeling the pressure of the changing climate. But what has the Trump administration decided to do about it? Worse than nothing. It has started to withdraw us from the Paris Climate It has repealed the Clean Power It has rolled back historic fuel economy standards, loosened standards for hazardous pollutants, and declared all-out war on climate science.  Throughout the administration, there has been an alarming attack on public information about climate change. On the Environmental Protection Agency's website, more than 5,000 pages of information on climate change have disappeared, either relegated to an unsearchable maze far from public view or simply deleted. Fact sheets on public health and climate change are gone. Resources for States and cities have disappeared. Guides for students and teachers are no more. This isn't transparency; it is a transparent attack on climate science.  It is also an attack on our scientists. More than 200 scientists have left the EPA under the Trump administration. Those 200 scientists have been replaced with only seven new hires. Our top climate scientists are telling us that fear is rampant at EPA and across Federal agencies. The EPA's job is to instill fear into the hearts of corporate polluters, not its own scientists.  We need to encourage more science, not less. We need science to inform the policies we need to provide the solutions that could save our planet. That is what Senator Whitehouse has championed for these past 6 years on the floor and throughout his career in public service.  I thank Senator Whitehouse for asking me to stand with him today and for being an environmental Paul Revere, sounding the alarm on climate change. We cannot be silenced, and we will continue to work together to sound that alarm--because that is what is happening, the Earth's alarm clock has gone off and it is telling us all to wake up. There is no one who is more woke to what is happening to our planet's climate than he.  Thank you.  ",CREC-2018-03-13-pt1-PgS1656-2.txt,735,INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY,2018.0,13.0,March
346,topic-id,389,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.5247, the so-called right-to-try legislation. This bill does not give patients the right to try; rather, it gives patients the right to request, which fails to address real barriers to accessing experimental drugs such as drug costs or company restrictions.  I will reiterate that patients already have the right to try through an expedited process that approves 99 percent of requests it receives. This legislation, however, fails to recognize that, if a patient is denied access, it is usually because a drug manufacturer says no due to manufacturer concerns about safety or side effects, not because the FDA denied a request.  I know, like everyone else, I have heard from many constituents suffering from terminal illnesses such as ALS who are desperate for cures; and I believe that every single one of us in this Chamber has confronted, in some way, a family member--mother, father, spouse--who had, heartbreakingly, an illness that had no cure. We have gone through the process many times, and I think we all have felt desperate from time to time.  However, having said that, just because a person at the end has no hope, to try something that might make things worse so you cannot go on to a more peaceful resolution would be hurtful not only to the patient, but to the family.  Opening up unregulated pathways to drugs after only a phase 1 clinical trial may expose patients to severe and unpredictable side effects. This bill would prevent FDA from documenting these side effects and, worse, would prevent FDA from protecting other patients from a similar fate.  When a loved one is in pain, the last thing a family wants is to cause further suffering. We need clinical trials to ensure drugs are safe and effective and to find real cures for patients, and we need the FDA to be a part of the process as a matter of patient protection for all.  Rescinding any FDA oversight on unproven therapies that have not undergone multiple clinical trials is a slippery slope. The expedited process we have now is working, and I cannot support a bill that offers a ``right to ask'' alongside proposals that could be dangerous for all.

Spectrum is the invisible infrastructure that supports our wireless economy.  As the way we do business continues to depend on connectivity and mobility, spectrum will be a part of everything from remote health monitoring to precision agriculture, to public safety communications and connected devices.  That is why I am pleased that this package includes several of my priorities, including my Spectrum Auction Deposits Act, which I coauthored with Congressman This legislation will enable the FCC to continue to conduct auctions that will unlock the spectrum necessary to deploy next generation broadband networks. Without this fix, auctions to deliver more spectrum into the commercial marketplace may be put on hold indefinitely.  This package also includes my legislation to create a Federal spectrum challenge prize, which would accelerate the development and commercialization of innovative technologies to make spectrum use more efficient.  It could also facilitate the application of existing technologies, such as blockchain, to develop spectrum sharing mechanisms that will allow providers to access spectrum on a real-time basis.

It proposes a pathway to experimental drugs that offers absolutely no guarantee of access, while stripping patients of any legal or financial recourse, and places clinical trials at risk.                              {time}  1800  Last week, I am sure like everyone else, I heard from many constituents on behalf of their families and communities with devastating diseases, like multiple sclerosis.  When a family member is faced with a devastating diagnosis, you would do anything and try anything to improve their quality of life. I know. I have been there with family members in such heartbreaking situations. But this bill would not necessarily make it easier to get experimental treatments and it would definitely make it harder for patients in the future to get treatments. We need clinical trials to ensure drugs are safe and effective and to find real cures and treatments for these patients.  Because this bill would be dangerous for patients both today and in the future, many disease groups oppose the bill, including the National Organization for Rare Disorders, the American Cancer Society, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and more.  Rushing this bill without proper bipartisan oversight places the American people in the way of real harm. Rescinding FDA oversight on unproven therapies is a perilous proposition.

953,topic-id,2189,"Mr.President, I rise to explain my opposition to the bill that is before the Senate, the banking deregulation bill, 2155.  First, I would like to say I am appalled this is how the Senate is spending its time this week. Three weeks ago, 17 students and teachers were murdered when a teenager, armed with an AR-15 decorated with swastikas, opened fire at Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, but this week we are not banning the sale of high-capacity magazines that enable mass shooters to fire 30, 40, or even 100 rounds without stopping to reload; we are not closing the gun show loophole or stopping violent people from buying assault weapons online with the click of a mouse; we are not taking steps to report more cases of severe mental illness to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System; we are not even passing President Trump's proposal to raise the age one can buy an assault weapon to 21 years. Simply put, this week we are not doing anything to stop the next mass shooting from taking place.  So what are we doing this week?  Well, this week the Republican majority has brought to the floor legislation rolling back safeguards we passed after the financial crisis of 2008--not exactly something the American people have been clamoring for.  I want to be clear why I oppose this bill as written. It is not that I don't support measures that provide meaningful relief to small banks, credit unions, and consumers. I do. It is not that I don't believe in reexamining regulations and ways to reduce compliance costs. I do. It is not that I don't agree with efforts to better calibrate the rules of the road for small banks and credit unions while strengthening protections for consumers investors and taxpayers. I do. Indeed, I would support a bill like that, but that is not the bill we have before us today.  The bill before us today brings back risky mortgage lending practices that increase the likelihood of foreclosures. It undermines our efforts to police discriminatory lending practices, and it would allow 25 of America's 38 biggest banks to escape the safeguards we adopted after the 2008 financial crisis--a crisis that destroyed more than $12 trillion worth of American wealth, required huge bank bailouts, sent our economy into a tailspin, and saddled us with the great recession.  Ten years later, it is worth remembering what caused that crisis--mortgages designed like ticking timebombs for home buyers and for our economy at large, large financial institutions making risky bets on those risky mortgages, and regulators who turned a blind eye to these risks. Borrowers were steered into loans with low interest rates, often below 4 percent at the start, but once the promotional period ended, these teaser rates disappeared, higher interest rates kicked in, and millions of borrowers suddenly saw their mortgage payments go through the roof--even doubling, in many cases. Between 2004 and 2006, one-third of all adjustable rate mortgages were designed this way, and at a time of stagnant wages, millions of families couldn't keep up. That is why a wave of foreclosures overtook our housing market--displacing families, decimating home values, and destabilizing neighborhoods. From 2006 to 2014, more than 9.3 million families lost their homes to foreclosure, sold their homes at a significant loss, or surrendered their homes to the bank.  For communities of color, the crisis was even worse. African-American and Latino borrowers were at least twice as likely to receive a higher cost loan than White applicants, even when controlling for income and credit scores, and they were nearly 50 percent more likely to face foreclosure during the crisis.  So what did we do about it? Well, we passed laws to stop lenders from offering mortgages that were, in many ways, doomed to fail. We said that from now on banks and mortgage lenders would have to make a reasonable and good-faith determination that borrowers could pay back their loans by looking at income, employment, credit history, monthly expenses, and other metrics. We prohibited banks from using these teaser rates to determine whether a borrower could repay a loan. We did the sensible thing, and we required them to make sure that borrowers could actually afford their payments once the higher interest rates kicked in.  We also passed reforms to better catch discriminatory lending practices because we know that, in many cases, the riskiest products were offered to minority communities. We asked banks to provide data that they already collected on things like debt-to-income ratios, credit scores, loan-to-value ratios, interest rates, and loan terms. This way, we could better identify emerging risks and possible discriminatory lending practices in our communities. Were all of these reforms perfect? Of course not. Have they made our mortgage lending system safer, smarter, and fairer for credit borrowers? Does that mean we still don't face challenges? New Jerseyans know that. Our State still suffers the highest rate of foreclosure in the Nation, and many New Jersey neighborhoods still struggle with frequent foreclosures, abandoned homes, and their painful consequences.  Likewise, discrimination still persists. I was appalled by a report released in January that showed African-American and Latino families--even controlling for income, loan amount, and location--continue to be disproportionately denied conventional mortgages. These practices are nothing short of modern-day redlining. We see it in Camden, NJ, for example, where Black applicants are still more than 2\1/2\ times likelier to be denied than White applicants.  Now, 10 years after the crisis, Congress is poised to turn back the clock. Under this bill, some banks will once again be able to offer mortgages with teaser rates of 4 percent that more than double in just 2 years, without ever verifying if a borrower could afford a 9-percent interest rate, and all they have to do is keep the loans on their books.  This bill will excuse 85 percent of banks from sharing the data we need to identify discrimination and ensure all creditworthy borrowers have a fair shot at the American dream of home ownership. So if this sounds familiar, that is because it is. History is repeating itself.  Beyond making mortgage lending riskier and less fair, this bill removes guardrails we put in place for 25 of the 38 largest banks in the country. These are the banks identified as systemically important during the crisis--the banks that received $47 billion in bailouts.  Now, I appreciate my colleagues who point out this bill's benefits for community banks and credit unions--and I mean that. That is a good thing. But I fear these provisions mask giveaways that will make big banks bigger and, ultimately, hurt smaller banks struggling to compete. Under title IV, for example, this bill significantly cuts oversight of banks with assets between $50 billion and $250 billion.  Have we forgotten so quickly the lessons we learned after the crisis? Do we not remember how the government had to arrange forced mergers of Countrywide, with $200 billion in assets, and National City, with $145 billion in assets, because their near-failures worked to spread risk from Wall Street to Main Street?  Do we really want to weaken these guardrails--the stress tests and the capital planning requirements to ensure that banks can survive a crisis, the living wills that ensure they have a feasible way to unwind if things go badly, and the minimum liquid assets they must hold in the event they lose access to funding markets?  When taxpayer dollars are on the line, I don't think it is unfair to ask big banks to be safe and smart. On the contrary, it is unfair to the American people who will have to bail them out when and if they get into trouble.  Supporters of this bill are quick to point out that it preserves the Federal Reserve's authority to take action if they become concerned about a bank with less than $250 billion in assets. Well, forgive me for not having confidence in regulators with a long history of doing too little too late. That is exactly the kind of risk that taxpayers,[[Page S1570]]homeowners, and investors can't afford.  As the chairman of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission recently wrote, ``history has shown, time and again, that the failure of financial firms that are not among the largest mega-banks can pose systemic risks to financial stability.'' According to the Congressional Budget Office, these weaker protections make it even more likely that taxpayers will once again have to bail out banks.  At the end of the day, this bill injects tremendous risk into the system and undercuts our tools to have our financial cops on the beat actually work to monitor the risk. So that leaves taxpayers on the hook if risk then turns into crisis. Rather than protecting families, this bill is packed full of goodies for large banks and special interests, because consumers--the families who would suffer the most in another crisis--don't have a seat at the table.  As a member of the Banking Committee, I worked in good faith to amend this bill and make it better. I offered an amendment called Christopher's Law to better protect consumers like the Bryski family in New While mourning the tragic loss of their son Christopher, the Bryskis were stunned to learn that they would be responsible for paying an education their son could never use because they had cosigned his private student loan. I appreciate that my colleagues incorporated major components of Christopher's Law to protect families that suffer the tragic loss of a loved one into the manager's package for this bill.  When you look at the totality of the bill's provisions, the fact remains that we couldn't get an inch for consumers in exchange for the miles this bill gives to big banks. Take, for example, my amendment to enhance protections for military servicemembers who often struggle to protect their credit while they are serving our country abroad or the amendment I offered to prevent the rewards of this bill from flowing to banks that adopt punishing, Wells-Fargo-style sales cultures that put consumers at risk. These are just some of the pro-consumer, commonsense amendments that were rejected in the Banking  Ultimately, I still believe Congress could pass legislation that provides targeted relief to community banks and credit unions, but not in exchange for erasing the standards that protect working families and our economy from systemic risk. So you can bet that I will be working here on the floor to get those amendments included in full. Senator Cortez Masto and I will offer an amendment to ensure that banks report the data we need to police against discriminatory lending practices.  Likewise, I am offering an amendment to require that consumer reporting agencies like Equifax quickly disclose data breeches and require a Federal study of how these breeches impact consumers over the long haul.  Finally, I am proposing an amendment that requires mutual funds to disclose to their shareholders whether they invest in the gun industry, because it is downright offensive to be considering a banking bill this week instead of pressing corporate America to step up in the fight against gun violence that rips our country apart year after year.  These measures, if adopted, would make a bad bill a bit better, but as we quickly approach the 10-year anniversary of the government-backed bailout of Bear Stearns, I cannot, in good conscience, vote to remove the guardrails we put in place to prevent big banks from playing fast and loose with our economy in the first place.  The financial crisis and recession stripped trillions of dollars in wealth from communities all across the country. While banks were bailed out, families were left reeling with the consequences. From foreclosure to job losses to hard-hit retirement accounts and falling home values, the American people bore the brunt of the financial crisis. For years, Washington protected Wall Street from sensible regulations when we should have been protecting consumers. Unfortunately, it took the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression for us to pass the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act for us to make a fundamental choice to reject a system that took advantage of consumers and instead stand for a banking system that is more fair, transparent, and accountable to the American people.  To quote the Spanish philosopher George Santayana, ``those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.'' Only in Washington would anyone think it is a good idea to commemorate the 10-year anniversary of the financial crisis with a bill that dares big banks to get bigger and increases risks to taxpayers.  I look forward to the day when this Congress strives to do better by the working families who lost their homes, their jobs, and their life savings during the crisis. Hard-working families had to fight their way back from the recession without bailouts and are counting on us to fight for them in Washington, and that is what I intend to do.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

1245,topic-id,2079,"Mr.President, I am stunned by President Trump's willful paralysis when it comes to holding Russia accountable on threats made crystal clear by our intelligence community.  Indeed, it has been more than a year since 17 U.intelligence agencies issued their report on how the Kremlin sought to ``blend covert intelligence operations--such as cyber activity--with overt efforts by Russian Government agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries, and paid social media users, or `trolls' '' in order to undermine our 2016 elections.  Today, even the administration's own national security strategy warns that Russia will continue to challenge American power, influence, and security interests, at home and abroad. These threats are precisely why Congress imposed a mandate on President Trump to act. Yet, time and again, this President has refused to hold Russia accountable and refuses to take steps to defend our democracy and our national security. It is alarming, it is reckless, and it is absolutely unacceptable, and, to be honest, I also find it baffling. Here is why.  Pick any policy issue. Chances are, since taking office, President Trump has changed his mind about it at least once. Last week he changed his positions on gun safety so many times in 24 hours, it could make your head spin. A few weeks before that, he rejected a bipartisan deal to protect Dreamers that met the very specifications he outlined to my colleagues and me just days before. Throughout the past year, the President's remarks with respect to NATO's Article 5, the alliance's bedrock principle that guarantees mutual defense, have been wholly inconsistent.  But there is one thing that President Trump has shown rock-solid consistency on since taking office, and that is his shameful embrace of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his refusal to protect American democratic institutions.  President Trump's embrace of Putin has put a straitjacket on U.policy toward In many ways, we are more vulnerable today than we were in 2016. Think about it. Mr.Putin made a serious gamble when he decided to interfere in our election--a gamble that would normally draw the ire of any American President, regardless of their political party. But, as we know, nothing about this administration is normal, and the truth is that we are in far greater peril today because Mr.Putin knows that he has a friend in the White House--a friend who won't do anything to stop him from interfering in our democracy, nor those of our allies; a friend who won't even issue a statement condemning Putin's nuclear sabre rattling last week when he proudly showed a video simulating a nuclear attack on  It is time for the President to recognize that Mr.Putin's intentions are not up for debate. From the spread of extremist propaganda across Europe, to Russia's continued attack on Ukrainian sovereignty, to the latest revelations made public by Special Counsel Mueller's investigation, the Kremlin is orchestrating a systematic and ongoing campaign to undermine the democracies at the heart of the post-World War II international order.  Consider President Trump's response to the revelations made public by Special Counsel Mueller when he indicted 13 Russians for interfering in our democracy 3 weeks ago. The special counsel's findings left many Americans shocked by Russia's outstanding, sophisticated effort to defraud American voters, stoke division on Facebook, and sow doubt in our electoral process in 2016. Yet President Trump's only response to these stunning revelations of foreign interference--nothing. Not a word from the President beyond a victorious tweet once again proclaiming no collusion.  At every turn, President Trump has dismissed the significance of Russia's interference in our elections, and his willful paralysis on Russia is in full display through the White House's refusal to impose sanctions under CAATSA, as well as the unacceptable delays in establishing a strategy for countering the Kremlin's propaganda and disinformation.  Let's remember why Congress passed CAATSA in the first place, why the Senate voted 98 to 2 and the House of Representatives voted 419 to 3 despite overwhelming opposition from the Trump administration. We voted to[[Page S1372]]hold Russia accountable for its assault on our democracy, and we voted to increase pressure on the Kremlin to stop its illegal war against our friends in Ukraine and its aiding and abetting of war crimes in But apparently President Trump fails to see that these are real threats from a real foreign adversary--real threats that undermine the integrity of our elections and therefore the security of our country; real threats from a brutal leader who seeks the erosion of Western democracy as a strategic imperative for Russia's future.  We saw it in March of 2014, when Russia authorized the use of military force to illegally occupy Crimea, blatantly violating the sovereignty of the Ukrainian people--violence that continues in eastern Ukraine to this day. We saw it in 2016, when the Kremlin's disinformation campaign targeted American voters on We see it today, as Russia continues to spread propaganda throughout Western Meanwhile, in the Middle East, Russia continues to prop up Assad's brutal dictatorship, dropping bombs on hospitals, homes, and humanitarian aid convoys working to help the Syrian people under siege.  This President's schoolyard swagger stops cold when it comes to confronting the world's biggest bully: Vladimir It has been 7 months--7 months--since Congress passed the CAATSA sanctions law. While the administration has upheld some sanctions imposed by Obama-era Executive orders, it is appalling to see this White House refuse to implement sanctions that Congress made mandatory--mandatory. Let me say that again: provisions that were made mandatory.  So let me tell you what I have learned about CAATSA's implementation in the recent briefings I have received as the ranking member on the Foreign Relations Committee and membership on the Banking  President Trump has imposed no sanctions in response to Russia's cyber aggression, as required by section 224. President Trump has imposed no sanctions related to Russian crude oil products, as required by section 225. President Trump has imposed no sanctions on serious human rights abusers in the Russian Federation, as required by section 228. President Trump has imposed no sanctions on those facilitating the transfer of assets owned by the Russian people to oligarchs, handpicked by Putin, as required under section 233. President Trump has imposed no sanctions punishing Russia for its transfer of arms to Syria, as required under section 234. I could go on, but you get the picture.  The Trump administration has refused to implement the law despite the overwhelming, bipartisan will of Congress--a Congress that decided to put ``shall'' in that legislation versus ``may,'' which made it mandatory. The Constitution made Congress a coequal branch of government for a reason, and I take very seriously our responsibility to hold the executive branch accountable.  Given what we know about Russia's interference in European elections over the last year alone, I am especially disappointed in the White House's failure to implement sanctions under section 224. That section targets anyone knowingly undermining the cyber security of an individual or a democratic institution on behalf of the Russian I find it hard to believe this administration has yet to identify one single sanctionable offense, but in case they need some tips, here are two they can look into.  In November, Spain's Government discovered Russian state-sponsored groups using social media to spread disinformation and influence political events in Just last week, the German Government pointed to a massive cyber hack against its foreign ministry, allegedly carried out by a Russian state-sponsored group called  Meanwhile, our intelligence leaders, including many who were appointed by President Trump himself, have testified that Russia continues to interfere here in the United States and looks forward to doing so during the midterm elections.  I have cosponsored a resolution calling upon President Trump to implement these sanctions, and while we shouldn't have to pass a resolution calling on the administration to enforce the law we passed, which was mandatory, we clearly do. Fortunately, we will have the opportunity to do so next week when the Foreign Relations Committee meets to mark up legislation, and I urge the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee to take up this important resolution.  Let's remember that Congress also gave the administration additional tools to thwart Russia's disinformation campaigns--an essential priority if we want to protect the integrity of our democracy. Yet it seems that Russia's disinformation campaigns continue to sow chaos online unabated.  Every day that ticks by is one that the Russian Government continues to sharpen its tools and go on the attack. Every day that ticks by, the Russian Government has further encroached on sovereign democracies. We saw it most recently when Russian trolls amplified rightwing hysteria over Congressman Devin Nunes' memo with the Twitter hashtag #releasethememo. According to Politico, ``Russian bots and their American allies gamed social media to put a flawed intelligence document atop the political agenda.''  Just this week, the New York Times reported on an ``American strategic void'' in response to Russian threats, highlighting the administration's inability to spend even one dollar--even one dollar--of the $120 million that Congress authorized over a year ago to counter the Kremlin's information warfare.  The Defense Department last week transferred $40 million--a third of what was authorized--to the State Department's Global Engagement Center, although not a penny's worth of action has been taken. Why the ridiculous delay? Why not the full amount?  Any responsible President would be vigorously working to protect Americans from foreign interference aimed at undermining our democracy. Any responsible President would have communicated to the American people the seriousness of the threat and rallied our citizens to respond with classic American resilience and courage. Any responsible President would have worked with Congress on a robust strategy and secured funding for it, and once he got the resources, any responsible President would have moved swiftly to spend them, to empower all the relevant security agencies to mobilize a collective effort to protect the integrity of our democracy. We don't have a responsible We have a President asleep at the wheel or maybe even too scared to get into the car at all.  We cannot afford further delays that only cede more ground to Putin on the battlefield of information. Our Global Engagement Center must immediately put these funds to use blunting the effects of Russian Government disinformation. Most urgently, we need the Trump administration to finally develop a comprehensive strategy to shore up American democracy against Russian malign influence and implementing it without delay.  I will close with this. Every day that ticks by, the Russian Government burrows deeper into our society, cultivating extremists and sowing discord. Consider Alexander NPR reported that for 6 years, he traveled to the United States to deepen his friendships with the NRA, one of the most active groups in our country. Mr.Torshin cultivated its leadership, meeting with them in Moscow, and now the FBI is reportedly investigating whether he funneled money through the NRA to support Trump's campaign. It is disturbing to think the NRA is so eager to cultivate ties with Putin's inner circle. As we all know, this organization's efforts has left our country a more dangerous place, from our schools to our movie theaters, to our concerts, to our churches.  The American people overwhelmingly want Congress to uphold its solemn responsibility to keep our families safe. Yet the NRA's opposition to commonsense gun safety laws have made this Congress more dysfunctional and less responsive to the needs of our citizens. That, to me, sounds right in line with Kremlin policy.  More than anything, I hope President Trump and our Secretary of State will start treating this threat with the seriousness it deserves. They should appreciate the level of careful planning, resources, and energy the Russian Government invests into destabilizing[[Page S1373]]American democracy. It is time to protect the integrity of our elections and secure our democracy against the cyber threats of the 21st century, whether they come in the form of election machine tampering or paid propaganda on social media or targeted hacks on public officials.  In the meantime, President Trump's inaction speaks louder than his words. His willful paralysis only serves to embolden our adversaries and weaken democratic institutions at home and abroad. That simply cannot stand, and it cannot stand with the silence we hear from too many of our colleagues on this issue. We need to speak up. We need to act. We need to make sure the law we pass gets enforced. Otherwise, we neuter the very essence of this institution.  With that, I yield.

1415,topic-id,1105,"Mr.President, I come to the floor to amplify the efforts of my colleague Senator Whitehouse as he gives his 200th climate speech on the Senate floor. He really has become a modern-day Paul Revere on one of the most critical issues of our time that very well dictates the future of our planet and our way of life as we know it. I believe history will record that Senator Whitehouse riveted the attention of the Senate--or attempted, certainly, to do so--and the Nation on the real threat that is climate change. Climate change may be an inconvenient truth to some, but it is a threat to New Jersey, to the United States, and to the security and stability of our world. It is a challenge we cannot afford to ignore.  I agree with my distinguished colleague from Rhode Island that it is well past time for this Congress to wake up and demand climate action from this administration.  We often hear the Trump administration officials, and even some of our colleagues in Congress, suggest that ``we don't know enough'' about climate change to take action, when the truth is, we know too much not to take action.  We know about the greenhouse effect and how gases like carbon dioxide trap heat in our atmosphere. We know that since 2010, we have experienced the five warmest years on record and that momentary cold snaps in our weather do not detract from the indisputable reality that around the world, temperatures are steadily rising. We know that 97 percent of scientists agree that manmade climate change is real and that the burning of fossil fuels and other human activities have led to unprecedented levels--unprecedented levels--of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere and in our oceans.  We know experts at NOAA have concluded that since the Industrial Revolution, our oceans have become 30 percent more acidic--the greatest increase in 300 million years.  Likewise, we know the Arctic is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the world and that as icecaps melt, our sea levels rise, endangering the coastal communities that drive so much of America's economy.  In New Jersey, we know the real threat posed by climate change, and we know that threat is real. My constituents bore the brunt of Superstorm Sandy when it devastated the Jersey shore. We know rising sea levels and the powerful storms that accompany them jeopardize our coastal communities. From tourism to commercial fishing, to coastal property values totaling nearly $800 billion, millions of families across New Jersey depend upon a healthy coast and a safe climate. While I may be partial to the Jersey shore, the reality is, nearly 40 percent of the American people live along a coast. That is 40 percent of our country threatened by rising sea levels, stronger storm surges, and more extreme flooding.[[Page S1677]]  Of course, climate change is far from just a coastal problem. From life-threatening heat waves to crop-destroying droughts, to record-breaking wildfires, the perils of a warming planet are not up for debate. The fact is, climate change will impact every human being and every living thing on this planet if--if--we fail to take action, and the American people know it.  In October of 2017, the Associated Press found that over 61 percent of Americans want us to respond to this historic challenge--61 percent. Even President Trump's Department of Defense gets it. Earlier this year, the Pentagon reported that about 50 percent of all Department of Defense sites already--already--face risks from climate change and extreme weather events. As the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I am particularly concerned that we have done little to address climate change's role as a threat multiplier.  Whether it is disruptions to the food supply or forced migration from sea level rise or destruction wreaked by more powerful storms, climate change will likely exacerbate conflict and humanitarian crises around the world. President Trump's willful ignorance of these threats risks leaving the United States unprepared for the 21st century.  There is no question that this willful ignorance is born out of this administration's cozy relationship with the fossil fuel industry. From the Department of Energy to the Environmental Protection Agency, to the Department of the Interior, President Trump has stacked his Cabinet with individuals who seem more concerned about Big Oil profits than the safety of our people and the future of our planet.  Nearly a year ago, the President announced his plan to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord, leaving us isolated on the global stage.  Now is not the time to hand our precious waters and protected public lands over to special interests. Now is the time for Congress to incentivize the investments that will modernize our energy infrastructure, create new high-paying jobs, and grow our clean energy economy.  That is why I have introduced the COAST Anti-Drilling Act to permanently ban offshore drilling in the Atlantic and protect the coastal communities so vital to New Jersey and other That is why I introduced legislation with 22 of my colleagues to level the playing field and eliminate taxpayer-funded subsidies for the five biggest oil companies. That is why I have worked on the Senate Finance Committee to extend incentives for wind and solar and other clean energy technologies. That is why I have backed legislation that would help harness the potential for limitless clean wind power off our shores.  These initiatives represent modest, commonsense steps toward a thriving clean energy economy, but, ultimately, it is not enough. We need to think bigger and act boldly. That is why I am here on the floor today with Senator Whitehouse calling for action on climate change. It is time we take action to reduce carbon pollution, create new, high-paying jobs, and accelerate the adoption of innovative clean energy technologies. It is time this administration wake up and put the long-term economic, environmental, and security interests of the United States ahead of fossil fuel profits. It is time the United States reclaims its rightful place as the global leader on climate change.  The American people demand it, and the future of our planet depends on it. That future, to a large degree, is going to be, hopefully, achieved because of individuals willing to stand up for a cause, being principled about it, and willing to fight for it and continue like a laser beam on focusing the attention of the Senate, the Congress, and the American people. Senator Whitehouse is that person, and I salute him as he gives his 200th speech today.  I yield the floor.

1430,topic-id,993,"Mr.President, I wish to affirm the partnership between the United States and I also rise to speak to the crucial role the Guatemalan attorney general has in efforts to strengthen the rule of law and the importance of the selection of the country's next attorney general.  In addition to the important contributions that more than 1 million Guatemalan Americans make to the United States, our two countries share a wide range of economic, social, and cultural linkages. In the past 2 years, Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales has emerged as a partner on U.foreign policy priorities. He has supported U.efforts to increase diplomatic pressure against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in the face of the humanitarian, economic, and political crisis in President Morales is also working to align Guatemalan foreign policy with the U.approach to the Middle East, both at the United Nations and by recently announcing that Guatemala will move its embassy to  Since 2014, I have supported increased U.assistance for Guatemala and the other Northern Triangle countries in order to address levels of violence and poverty that drive migration in the region. I believe that continued U.engagement can be transformative for efforts to increase security, strengthen democratic governance, support civil society, improve protections for human rights, and foster economic development. However, we must recognize that these efforts would be futile without the work of Guatemala's attorney general.  While President Morales made the commendable decision to increase the budget for Guatemala's Public Ministry, which is overseen by the attorney general, I am troubled by recent actions that run counter to the Ministry's work. For the past 11 years, Guatemala has become an example in the fight against impunity. This is due, in no small part, to the work, commitment, and determination of Guatemala's attorneys general and the efforts of the United Nations International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala--known by its Spanish acronym, CICIG--an independent investigative body that works closely with the Public  Since its creation in 2006, CICIG has worked with the Public Ministry to investigate and dismantle the criminal networks that seek to influence the Guatemalan state, while also helping increase the capacity of local judicial institutions. Such efforts have contributed to reducing Guatemala's overall impunity rate for homicides from 95 percent to 72 percent. These institutions deserve our steadfast support so they can continue their progress building a safer and more prosperous Guatemala, which in turn contributes to a more stable hemisphere. The success of this model has served as a model for similar efforts in other countries.  Although there has been tangible progress, much work remains, and Guatemala will continue to benefit from a sustained commitment to good governance and accountability. I worry recent actions signal a move in the wrong direction, including the recent removal[[Page S1449]]of Interior Minister, including Francisco Rivas and the chief of Guatemala's Internal Revenue Service, Juan Solorzano Foppa--both were key partners of the Public Ministry and the I was equally concerned about attempts last year to reform the Guatemalan penal code in a way that may complicate the prosecution of cases involving illicit financing and commuted sentences for crimes such as extortion, trafficking, and sexual assault. I was truly shocked by President Morales' attempt to expel CICIG commissioner, Ivan Velasquez, from The work of Commissioner Velasquez is highly regarded and attempting to remove him simply sends the wrong message to those interested in Guatemala's fight against impunity.  These developments are deeply concerning as Guatemala is in the process of selecting its next attorney general. It is imperative that the Morales administration ensures a credible and efficient process in which all Guatemalans can have faith. It is equally necessary that the nominating commission responsible for selecting candidates conduct a transparent, merit-based process, guided by international standards. Most importantly, it is essential that President Morales select a person with the best qualifications, professionalism, and impeccable ethical standards to continue advancing an agenda that upholds the independence and impartiality of the institution. Here in the U.Senate, we will be following this process closely.  During her visit to Guatemala, Ambassador Nikki Haley reaffirmed U.support for CICIG and Commissioner Velasquez, noting that it would be in President Morales' best interest to continue support for the UN body and the commissioner. Ambassador Haley's message builds on ongoing bipartisan efforts, including continued U.engagement in Central America's Northern Triangle, steadfast support for CICIG, and ensuring accountability for human rights abuses, when necessary, through the implementation of the Global Magnitsky  Yesterday, I had the chance to meet with Commissioner Velasquez and reaffirm my support for him and CICIG as they carry out their critical work. I remain committed to ensuring that the State Department, U.Agency for International Development, and the Treasury Department use all of our foreign policy tools to help strengthen democratic governance and the rule of law as we continue our support for the Guatemalan government and  Guatemala's next attorney general must continue the courageous work of current Attorney General Thelma Aldana and former Attorney General Claudia Paz y Paz, whose efforts have been invaluable in the fight against impunity. Failure to do so would undercut the commitment of prosecutors and judges who have done their work with professionalism and adherence to the law and whose efforts have produced tangible results.  Promoting good governance and the rule of law in Guatemala is critical to building a resilient, secure, and prosperous nation for all Guatemala has taken commendable steps in establishing itself as a leader on these and other critical issues in the hemisphere. It is my sincere belief that committing to these efforts will greatly contribute to overall stability and success to the region, including the United  In closing, I urge President Morales to support the work of the Public Ministry and CICIG, so they are able to move forward with their important work without interference. I also encourage President Morales to continue his commitment to transparency and accountability, and to advancing his statement that, ``the rule of law should always prevail.''                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-07-pt1-PgS1448.txt,791,BILL'' TUCKER,2018.0,7.0,March

1330,topic-id,1629,"Mr.President, the first three words of our Constitution are, ``We the People.'' This is the mission statement of the United States of Our government was set up not to create a government by and for the powerful and the privileged but by and for the people of the United States and, as Jefferson put it, the government would reflect the will of the people. It is quite a different concept from many of the European governments that operated directly for the benefit of the best-off or the wealthy and well connected.  We have seen a corruption of the American We have seen it turned on its head, with government implemented by and for the rich and powerful, time after time over this last year.  What did we see in 2017? We saw much of the year spent destroying healthcare for 22 million to 30 million Americans and increasing the cost of healthcare for everyone else--certainly not reflecting the will of the people--and then we saw a tax bill taking $1.5 trillion from our children and our grandchildren and giving it to the richest of Americans, the largest bank heist in world history.  Well, now we have another assault on ``we the people'' government. 2155 undoes a lot of the work to create a financial system for America to thrive, for families to thrive, and restores the lack of regulation and high-leveraged bets that brought the economy down in 2007 and 2008.  When the economy came down, the wealthy and well-off did quite well. They picked up properties at pennies on the dollar, but who was hurt? The American people were hurt. The American workers were hurt. They lost their jobs. They lost their retirements. Certainly, they lost so much in terms of the financial foundation for their families. Yet here we are again. We seem to have forgotten that when you let the big banks rampage through our economy, you are setting the stage for another big mess--high-risk gambling on Wall Street, destroying Americans' financial lives, lost homes, lost jobs, and lost retirement savings.  When we passed Dodd-Frank, the principle was, never again will we let the Wall Street casino crash our economy. Well, ``never'' hasn't lasted very long.  In the bill before us, section 203 exempts financial institutions--smaller banks with assets under $10 billion--from the Volcker rule. What was the Volcker rule? The Volcker rule was a firewall that said: Take deposits to make loans but don't engage in high-risk, high-leverage bets on the future price of stocks or the future price of currencies. Those are called derivatives, those bets on those future prices. Those are appropriate in a hedge fund. If somebody wants to compile money for millionaires and billionaires and make bets on the future prices, then go ahead and gamble in your hedge fund, but don't do it in our banks.  So now we have this bill that says: Well, let's open the door to reestablishing the Wall Street casino but just not on Wall Street; let's do it on our small banks. Well, what was bad and risky for big banks is bad for small banks. Should they put their money into loans to help the rural economy thrive or should they make big bets on future prices casino-style? This bill opens up small banks to being casinos. It is the wrong way to go.  Then there is section 401 on capital requirements. It takes enormously large banks up to $250 billion in size and repeals the requirement for living wills. It repeals the requirement for annual stress tests to make sure the capital is truly being set aside and the bank is being operated in an appropriate fashion for a depository institution.  Former Deputy Treasury Secretary and Federal Reserve Governor Sarah Bloom Raskin said granting the Fed control for the stress test, rather than having them annually, is ``legislative fool's gold.'' That is the expert talking about the foolishness of eliminating stress tests.  In addition, it lowers capital standards. So often I have heard folks come to this floor saying, ``We don't need so much regulation. Let's just increase the capital standards,'' but this bill does the opposite. It impacts 25 of the 38 largest U.banks, which together hold $3.5 trillion in assets. This is clearly a situation that creates enormous risks for our economy. Who will pay the price? Working America will pay the price. Build the bubble, burst the bubble, and the boom goes down on middle-class  Then there is section 402. Section 402 is related to globally systemically important banks. They are referred to by the initials GSIBs--globally systemically important banks. Then there are custodial banks. Those banks received $5 billion in Federal bailout money during the financial crisis. They want to escape the supplemental leverage ratio that was designed to decrease the risk. Each megabank has to have enough tier 1 capital to satisfy an SLR--a supplemental leverage ratio--but custody banks want relief so they don't have to hold as much common stock--common stock, which is tier 1 capital, but shoehorned into this are Citi and CBO says the following: ``There is a 50% chance that regulators would allow two other financial institutions--JPMorgan and Citibank, with combined assets of $4.4 trillion--to adjust their SLRs under the terms in this bill.'' In other words, higher leverage ratios, lower capital, exactly the kinds of things that imperiled our economy previously, and yet that is right in the heart of this bill.  What about consumer protection? Let's turn to section 107, which grants exemption from key mortgage lending protections for the buyers of manufactured homes. Manufactured homes are put on a foundation and sold as regular homes. Then you have modular homes. This provision expands it to modular homes. It would reduce consumer protections of the part of the market that disproportionately serves low- and very low-income Americans and rural Do we really want to strip the consumer protections for lower income Americans and rural Americans when buying a home? No, we don't, which is why this provision should not be in this bill. It is why this provision is a bad idea.  One more section of the bill; that is, HMDA reporting--Home Mortgage Disclosure Act reporting.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau required expanded data reporting because it allows you to see where the rules might be being broken on predatory lending. It allows you to see where there might be an engagement in discriminatory lending. But this bill says that we are not going to get that data anymore. We are not going to get the data that would help us identify illegal redlining, for example, and that this exemption would apply to 85 percent of the reporting institutions that are covered by the Home Mortgage Disclosure  Most of this information is data that is already collected. Reporting it provides an understanding about redlining, about discrimination, about discriminatory practices. If you don't have the information, those things get[[Page S1419]]hidden. That is damaging to America's families.  That is quite a list of things that are wrong with this bill. This bill has been presented as remedies for small banks, but, as my colleagues just noticed from these items, what we see are the ripping aside of consumer protections and a whole lot that is being demanded by the big banks that want less capital and higher leverage.  Let's do a bill for smaller banks. Let's understand that more flexibility is appropriate in rural areas. Let's observe that more flexibility in the types of mortgages might be appropriate in small banks in small communities where those loans are portfolioed. Democrats came forward with a whole list of these things to help small banks, but what do we have from our Republican leadership? A bill designed for Wall A bill designed for Wall Street, for the wealthy and the well-connected. It is not designed to help ordinary  Ordinary Americans are plagued by the challenges of discrimination, and this makes it worse; or redlining, and this makes it worse; or predatory practices, and this makes it worse. They are also plagued by high-interest payday loans. What does this bill do to take on the 500-percent interest rates that every society across the globe has recognized are incredibly destructive, sucking people into a vortex of debt and destroying families? This body right here said that they are so destructive, we cannot allow these high-interest loans to be given to our servicemembers because they destroy our service families. Shouldn't we stand up for all of our families in America? If something is so predatory and so destructive to our service families that we say it is illegal, shouldn't we make those same loans illegal for everybody?  Do you see anything in this bill related to ``we the people''? Very little. The ``we the people'' bill the Democrats put forward was rejected, and what we have is this Wall Street bill for lower capital, more leverage, more predatory practices. That is just not right.  I hold a lot of townhalls. I hold 36 townhalls a year, 32 of them in very red counties. Not one person in over 300 townhalls has come up to me and said: Get rid of the regulations on Wall Street because we want them to be able to do more low-capital, high-leverage bets and put our economy at risk. Nobody in America advocates building another bubble on high-risk leverage.  So what are we doing with this bill? What we are doing is making a mistake. We should defeat this assault on the effort to have a financial system in America that is designed to serve the mission of the United States, the ``we the people'' mission of the United States of  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

1424,topic-id,2382,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague from Minnesota for laying out the case so clearly on the challenge, as I like to call it, of taking on climate chaos.  My wife Mary comes from I know they value the Land of 10,000 Every time I have said that before, I always say the ``Land of a Thousand Lakes,'' and Senator Klobuchar corrects me. I just can't quite envision 10,000 lakes.  Minnesota is a land with incredible wildlife, a land that certainly has seen the impacts of climate chaos, as has my home So thank you so much for your remarks and for being here to help celebrate our colleague and our friend, the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr.Whitehouse, who spoke tonight just a few minutes ago for his 200th time, to say: Wake up. Wake up,  We have a significant challenge, the sort of challenge that you may not notice from one day to the next. We may wake up tomorrow and not realize that the damage being done to our planet is greater than the day before or we may not be able to wake up a week from now and realize that the damage is more. Nonetheless, it is, if looked at over any significant span of time, a huge, huge force wreaking havoc on our planet, and it will just get worse with time if we do not take on this pollution of the atmosphere by carbon dioxide.  Back in 1959, an eminent scientist was asked to speak at the 100th anniversary of the petroleum industry. That scientist was Edward Edward Teller gave his speech at this 100th anniversary in 1959, but he said to the gathering of the fossil fuel industry: You do realize that you will eventually have to look for a different form of energy to invest in, first, because the amount of fossil fuels in the Earth's crust is limited and it will run out. He said: Second of all, there are some interesting facts that many of you might not be aware of--that when you burn fossil fuels, it creates carbon dioxide, and carbon dioxide might not at first seem like a pollutant because it is invisible and it is odorless, but it has this quality where visible light passes through it, but heat energy is trapped. As a result of trapping heat energy and changing the makeup of our atmosphere, we will start to do major damage to the planet. He talked about how it would affect the melting of ice on the poles, the rising of sea levels, and that humankind lived by the oceans and, therefore, this carbon dioxide would do enormous damage and it would be important to transition off of burning carbon fuels, off of burning fossil fuels. That was in 1959, which is a long time ago that we have had the information about the damage wreaking havoc by this pollutant, carbon dioxide.  Henry David Thoreau, the philosopher, challenged us and said: What is the use of a house if you don't have a tolerable planet to put it on?  Yet everywhere we see our planet crying out for us to pay attention--never as much, however, as in this last year. Here in America, there were fierce forest fires from Montana, across Idaho, into Washington, down to Oregon, and into California clear into Smoke covered much of my State for month after month this last summer, having an impact on people's health and certainly having an impact on our economy.  We could look at the storms of last year--the hurricanes of Harvey, Irma, and Maria assaulting Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Those storms were unusually damaging, and part of the reason for that is because the energy of those storms is taken from the temperature of the ocean, and the ocean has been collecting 90 percent of the increased heat on the planet from carbon dioxide pollution and, therefore, producing more powerful hurricanes.  So we saw it in the fires, and we saw it in the hurricanes, but you really can start to see it almost everywhere. You can see that the pine beetles are doing much better because the winters aren't cold enough to kill them, and the trees are doing much worse. You can see that the ticks in New England and Maine and on through Minnesota are doing much better because the winters are not cold enough to kill them. Therefore, they are killing the moose. You can see the impact of the rising ocean temperature on coral reefs around the world, which are a small part of the ocean but have a significant role in the fisheries on our planet.  In my home State in Oregon, the warmer temperatures and the acidity in the ocean caused a billion baby oysters to die in 2008. Well, that is quite an impact on our seafood industry. I can tell you that scientists were mystified because they couldn't imagine, at first, that it had to do with the water quality. They thought it must be a virus or it must be some form of bacteria, but it just turned out that the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere not only results in the warming of the ocean, but it is absorbed in the ocean and becomes carbonic acid. That greater acidity of the ocean damages the ability of baby oysters to form shells. So now we have to artificially buffer the ocean water.  We see it in spreading diseases, like malaria, as they follow the mosquitoes, and Zika, as it follows the mosquitoes into greater territory, or leishmaniasis, which is a real diabolical disease that now has come to the United States with sand flies.  My point is that everywhere you look, if you open your eyes, climate chaos is having a big impact and hurting us.  The answer is simple. We have to stop burning fossil fuels. This is where the 100-percent notion comes from, from my bill of last year--100 percent by 50, 100 by 50, or, if you prefer, mission 100. It just means we have to transition from the energy that we gain[[Page S1684]]from fossil fuels to substituting energy from clean and renewable sources--100 percent. Stop burning fossil fuels.  A few years ago, folks said: Well, that will cause great damage to our economy because renewable energy is so much more expensive than cheap fossil fuels. But we have been blessed. We have been blessed in taking on this challenge because it is no longer true that renewable energy is more expensive than fossil fuel energy.  We have had an incredible drop in the price of solar energy over a short period--from 35 cents per kilowatt hour down to 5 cents per kilowatt hour. Then Xcel Energy in Colorado put out a proposal this year. The proposal came back at 2 cents per kilowatt hour. In other words, it is cheaper to have new and clean renewable energy than to burn coal in an already depreciated fossil fuel coal electric plant. Wind has gone from 13 cents or so per kilowatt hour to 5 cents per kilowatt hour. Xcel Energy in Colorado brought in a bid at 3 cents per kilowatt hour.  As we have seen these prices drop dramatically on solar and wind, we have seen the installations of solar and wind surge. On the solar side, in 2017 we installed about 12 gigawatts of capacity--12 gigawatts, or 12,000 megawatts. That is a lot of energy. To put it differently, one-fourth of the total installed capacity of the United States of America went in just in 2017. That is a dramatic upsurge in installation. Think of a world where we can have every flat business roof and every manufacturing plant with solar rays on its surface or canopies over its parking lot because this energy is so cheap to collect, and we can collect it in places where the grid already exists. For wind, in 2016, 8 gigawatts of new capacity went in. Again, there is a tremendous upsurge in the amount of wind installed.  Now we are seeing roughly half of our utilities scale new capacity with renewable energy rather than with fossil fuel energy. The transition is underway, but we need to accelerate it. We need to move it much more quickly, and then we need to move our consumption of energy over to the electric grid. What does that mean? For example, it means heating your house with a heat pump, which uses electricity, rather than a gas furnace. It means changing the way you heat water from a gas hot water heater to an electric hot water heater. It means getting a plug-in vehicle, an electric vehicle.  Let's stop and talk a little bit about electric vehicles. While we have been seeing the production of carbon dioxide from making electricity come down in America, we are seeing the carbon dioxide from driving vehicles go up, so it is a major area we have to take on.  Five years ago, I bought a Volt, which is a plug-in hybrid. It has a range of about 35 miles of electricity, and it also has a gas backup. That car really worked exceedingly well. We drove 3 out of 4 miles on electricity, even though we used gasoline to drive all the way to South Dakota and back. What we found was that the cost per mile on electricity was only about 3 cents a mile, and the cost of running it on gasoline--with oil, maintenance, and so forth--was closer to 10 cents a mile. So it is three times cheaper to drive it on electricity. So there is a big incentive.  Unfortunately, my son had an auto accident, and we had to replace that car. Because the range has increased over 5 years, we were able to get a fully electric car, a Nissan The range had gone up in 2016 from roughly 80 miles to about 107. That extra 27 miles is enough that my wife could do her work in home hospice, potentially being assigned to a house way on the west side of the Monona County area and then way on the east side and back and forth several times a day and still make it completely on a single-charged battery.  With the proliferation of driving stations, now we are starting to see the ability to operate much more closely to the way we behaved, if you will, previously with gasoline vehicles--being able to drive hundreds of miles and then recharge. We have seen that with the Volt that just came out to replace the Bolt, which now goes over 200 miles on just its battery alone and more if you drive cautiously.  Buses are another big piece of this. I went down to Eugene, OR, a couple of weekends ago and rode on their first electric bus, the first one in the State of That bus looked just like the old diesel buses that we have had serving our metro systems across America, but it cost a lot more. It cost $200,000 more than a diesel bus.  You might say ``Well, that is way too much,'' but here is the interesting thing: It saves about $40,000 to $45,000 a year on fuel. It doesn't take a math genius to then realize that after 5 years of service, you have paid off that cost, and after that, you are saving money. We are going to see a huge transition simply on the economics.  This is the challenge before us, that we have been given the gift of affordable solar that is cheaper than fossil fuel energy, affordable wind that is cheaper than fossil fuel energy, a greatly declining cost of battery power to help supply meet demand, but at the Federal level, we are paralyzed.  Unfortunately, the Koch brothers are really the puppet masters of this body, this Chamber I am in. This wonderful Senate is supposed to be the place where we deliberate to have government of, by, and for the people, but right now we have deliberations here that are of, by, and for the Koch brothers; of, by, and for the wealthy and the well-connected. That is not the vision of We have to reclaim the vision of The people of America understand that we have this enormous challenge that we must undertake to save our beautiful, blue and green planet.  Since the Federal Government isn't operating, we see companies and cities and places of worship jumping in to fill the gap, adopting 100 percent resolutions--resolutions to transition to 100 percent cleaner renewable energy, to stop burning the fossil fuels that are damaging our planet.  Burlington, VT, is now using a mixture of biomass and hydro wind and solar so that 100 percent of electricity comes from renewable generation. Fifty-eight other cities across America have committed to making that 100 percent transition, and they are handing out an action plan--this year we can do this, and this year we can do that. Families can do the same, places of worship can do the same, and companies are doing the same all across our We see many of our Fortune 500 companies stepping forward to be real leaders in this. They want to attract employees who know that they care about our planet. They care about stopping this pollution that Edward Teller, an eminent scientist, pointed out in 1959.  When Henry David Thoreau said ``What is the use of a house if you haven't got a tolerable planet to put it on?'' he asked a question we should always ask ourselves in terms of the different threats to this beautiful orb that we call home. So let's fight to save this beautiful planet. It is the only one we have. We have no other. It is under serious threat, and we in this Chamber need to tell the Koch brothers to go and sit on their fossil fuel fortune, invest it as they want somewhere else, but to join us in the most important work they could possibly be part of in the years that they have remaining to live here in America, and that is this fight to take on climate chaos and win.

1073,topic-id,733,"Mr.Speaker, this is the second week of the tax truth squad effort to share the facts, the real facts about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and the impact it has already had on the American economy and the American people.  Mr.Speaker, I am pleased to be here with my fellow colleagues representing Michigan and These two States include diverse industries and diverse people, from farmers, to bankers, to manufacturers.  I am humbled to represent the hardworking people of the 10th Congressional District and the This is exactly what the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has done: helped our constituents work every day supporting their family and helped their local economy.  My colleague before me proceeded to speak about we should pay attention to the needs of those close to and living in poverty. Well, I wish he had stayed. I grew up in poverty.  Like many in Michigan, I grew up in a large family. I have six brothers and sisters. My dad had a good job building trucks in a line at General My mom often had a full-time job to help make ends meet. That is why I committed to supporting policies that create real economic growth and economic opportunity for families like the one in which I grew up.  I was but a young pup in 1986, the last time our Tax Code was modernized. Since then, the Tax Code grew to 74,000 pages of rules and regulations that have only confused people. You would need to be a wizard to understand what is in the Tax Code as it stood at the end of the year. That is why I promised my constituents, when I came to office, when I ran for office, I would work hard to achieve meaningful tax cuts and reforms for the American people.  I believe Americans can, and should, make independent decisions about the use of their own money, the money they work for, not the government. The government shouldn't come first. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act allowed hardworking individuals and business owners to do just that.  Across the Nation and back home, we have already seen the direct impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs More than 400 companies have already announced pay raises, bonuses, and increased 401(k) contributions and benefits, or, in the case of utility companies, lowered rates.  Direct bonus announcements have already reached over $3 billion across this Let me repeat that: $3 billion. Companies in Michigan have already committed more than $180 million in bonuses to employees.  A couple of examples: Fiat Chrysler, one of the State's largest employers, is reinvesting its tax savings to its employees in our community, in addition to giving a $2,000 bonus to 60,000 employees. And that is in addition to profit sharing as part of their contract.  Fiat Chrysler announced it will move heavy-duty Ram truck production from Mexico to Macomb County: a $1 billion investment that will create 2,500 jobs.  In my district, Michigan's 10th, Lakestone Bank & Trust, a small community bank, operating in Lake Lapeer, Clair, and Macomb Counties, gave hourly employees $1 an hour raise. I know some consider that to be crumbs. Where I grew up, $1 an hour more is real money. They gave all of their salaried employees a $1,000 bonus saying: ``We are very appreciative of all Lakestone Bank & Trust employees and certainly what they have accomplished over the years. . . . This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and we know we want to reinvest much of the savings''--in the tax bill--``back into our bank, and the first place we are going to put it is into the hands of our employees. Employees are our most important asset.''  Stories like this are not unique. From CVS to Chipotle, and AT&T to Wells Fargo, they are reinvesting tax reform savings in our hardworking employees in our communities throughout the country.  This is the second week of the tax reform truth squad--we are calling it--an initiative where Members from States across the Nation are invited to tell their stories about the benefits of tax reform. There are countless stories they are anxious to express.

Mr.Speaker, I yield to Congressman Darin LaHood, representing the 18th District of Illinois, a member to both the Joint Economic Committee and Ways and Means  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank Congressman Mitchell for yielding. I thank him and Congresswoman Mimi Walters for putting together and organizing this Special Order in order to highlight the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on families in Illinois and across the country.  Thirty-one years is way too long. That is what it took before we passed comprehensive tax reform at the end of last year. And in my 2\1/2\ years here, I couldn't be more proud to support the bill. And when I went in to looking at the legislation in the bill, I really looked at two things as we looked at comprehensive tax reform. One is, how do we help middle class and lower middle class people across this country and in my district? And secondly, how do we get the economy roaring again?  We, for almost 9 years, had a very sluggish economy and stagnant wages. How do we get the economy healthy, robust, vibrant again? We succeeded on both those counts with this bill, and I am very proud to support it.  This historic tax reform law is making a real difference for our families and our workers. But you don't have to take my word for it. Take it from the hardworking people I have spoken with across Illinois' 18th The workers I have spoken with are already seeing the results of the new withholding tables, which is no surprise.  In fact, the median family of four in my district will save $2,593--again, let me repeat that, $2,593 every year from this new law. This figure is certainly not crumbs, as some people would describe it.  When half of Americans say they are living paycheck to paycheck, this is real money for them. The benefits have already gone beyond lowering the rates, with more bonuses and pay raises being announced every single day.  One example from my district is the Five Senses Spa in Peoria, This is a small business. And for over a decade, the owner, Paola Hinton, has provided clients with relief from the stresses of their life at her spa. With the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Five Senses Spa is now providing tax relief to their employees. After calculating the savings from her business that she saw through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Paola handed out $500 bonuses to all of her employees as a ``thank you'' for their hard work. This is real money that the employees can put towards expenses, new purchases, or even saving up for things like education or a home or a new car.  But tax reform also has positive effects beyond larger paychecks. Last month, I spoke with a constituent named Chris, who is a small-business owner, and also the fire marshal for Springfield and Sangamon Chris attended a roundtable discussion I hosted in Springfield and talked about how the new depreciation rules, as a part of the tax reform law, have already incentivized building owners to upgrade their sprinkler and safety equipment, which has benefitted his small business. Safer buildings and up-to-date fire prevention are a win-win for everyone.  I was glad to hear that even our local fire marshal was seeing the real effects of commonsense tax reform and reforming our Tax Stories like these are coming from every district across this great country, and the benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act show no sign of slowing down, and that is good news for all  It should be clear by now that letting workers keep more of their hard-earned paychecks is a recipe for a healthy economy, and I am excited to see how this bill continues to improve the lives and security of all American families.

One of the important things we did was to change how the taxes are structured for a path we call pass-through to small businesses. Maybe he could explain that briefly, what was done to help small business be viable and grow in this country.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I think we acknowledge that small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy. They create the most jobs in our economy. So when we looked at comprehensive tax reform, we obviously talked to those small businesses, those independent folks, and said: What can we do to help you in terms of lowering the rates, depreciation, expensing?  We took that into account, and now you are seeing the results of that. So when you talk to small businesses on the real effect, what does that mean? What do they do with those savings?  Well, they are hiring more people, they are investing in higher wages, they are investing back into their companies, which has a downstream effect throughout this country, and those are real results; and, again, that is a positive nature, which will continue into the future, and we are awful proud of those provisions.

1098,topic-id,485,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Congressman Bergman, and we are wishing for spring in northern Michigan sooner than mid- Mr.Speaker, I want to wrap up this evening by talking a little bit about what all my colleagues spoke about: our principles.  Our principles were that people who worked hard should keep more of their money, that their families and their pocketbooks should come first and not government come first. We have achieved that with the Tax Cuts and Jobs  How did we achieve that?  We almost doubled the standard deduction. For a married couple, the standard deduction is $24,000 this tax year--$24,000, and you pay no taxes.  We lowered the individual tax rates for all tax brackets.  We simplified the Tax Code so that taxpayers can file their taxes, 90 percent of them, on a form about this size. No, you don't have to mail a postcard. You put it in an envelope. But the good news is you don't need multiple pages. You don't have to hope that you have got a wizard to help you. Ninety percent of Americans can fill out a few items on here, include the W-2, and send it on in.  We expanded, as was discussed earlier, the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000 for single filers and married couples to help parents with the cost of raising their children. We made that fully refundable up to $1,400. That is, even if your taxes are zero, you get a refund from the government for $1,400 to help you with childcare and taking care of your dependents.  For taxpayers that the standard deduction did not work as well, we kept a number of important deductions, the three most popular ones: Charitable deduction, kept that; the home interest deduction, we kept that; and State and local taxes.  What that means is, for 95, 98 percent of my tax filers in the 10th Congressional District, even if they fill out their deductions rather than do the standard deduction, they are much better off.  Since the tax reform bill passed, as I stated earlier, 400 companies, in about 70 days, have given a pay raise or a bonus or both, increased benefits, 401(k) contributions.  In the case of utilities, you heard in Michigan, almost $400 million a year in rate cuts, something we hadn't thought about, hadn't anticipated--real money saved by our consumers.  Four million people have received a special tax bonus, resulting in about $3 billion injected into the economy. In Michigan, it is $180 million already.  That is real money. It is not economic I am proud to have been part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs We will continue with the Tax Truth Squad every week through the summer to send a message to the American people that we are looking out for their paychecks and the well-being of their family.

688,topic-id,439,"Mr.Speaker, as you recall, 8 years ago this week, the Affordable Care Act became law. Since then, we have seen a historic increase in health coverage, with millions of people gaining access to better quality healthcare.  Under the ACA, we saw the nonelderly uninsured rate cut almost in half, from 18 percent to 9.4 percent. Individuals previously denied coverage due to preexisting conditions saw life-changing improvements in benefits and coverage. Seniors, who are finally able to spend less on Medicare coverage and prescription drugs, had a chance at a secure and peaceful retirement.  In my State alone, Wisconsin, 224,000 people became covered by ACA exchanges. From 2013 to 2016, the number of uninsured individuals declined by a whopping 42 percent.

1225,topic-id,1833,"Mr.President, I thank the Senator from Idaho for his kind remarks, and I join my colleagues in expressing our gratitude for his efforts to make certain we are here today. What a long time it has been to get us to this point.  This is important legislation, and we ought not suggest that because there is such bipartisan support, that this is a minor accomplishment. We come together, it seems, on the small things around here, but on the big things, it seems awfully impossible for us to bridge the gap. Therefore, to suggest that what we are doing here today is nothing important would be a total mistake,would be a fabrication of the facts.  If we are successful in passing this legislation and the House accepting it in a form that is acceptable to the Senate and having it signed by the President, this legislation will make a significant and tremendous difference in America and especially on Main Street, in farms and small businesses across the country.  A significant component of what I am about in my work in the Senate is trying to make certain that my colleagues from places that are not rural understand the rural nature of much of America and understand how we do business and how things get done.  As has been indicated by many of my colleagues, in smalltown America, nothing gets done without the support of your local financial institution. We earn a living in much of Kansas by small businesses--by farms and ranches--and in the absence of access to credit, the ability for us to continue to earn a living in smalltown America disappears.  It was a sad day when the Banking Committee--now 3 years or so ago--passed Dodd-Frank reform legislation but did so with only Republican votes. The sadness is that we were unable to find common ground and make a difference in a piece of legislation that was passed in years gone by. We were unable to make the improvements that were necessary, the changes, the alterations that could make Dodd-Frank work for rural America, that could limit its scope to Wall Street, not Main  I think when Dodd-Frank was passed and many of us voted against it, Republicans were saying: We are going to repeal Dodd-That caused many Democrats to say: We are not going to let you touch Dodd-So we have been at an impasse when Republicans and Democrats alike know that this legislation, Dodd-Frank, is causing serious harm to places across the country. But we have gone to our corners. We have argued for full repeal, and you have argued that we are not going to touch it. This is a good day in which we have decided that it is neither one of those extremes. It is the idea that we can find the solutions to problems that exist as a result of legislation that Congress approved.  This legislation is important, and it matters. It is important because it demonstrates that the Senate can function in its proper form, that we can accomplish good, commonsense things. It is also important because it will alter the landscape in the future for communities across Kansas and around the country.  In rural America, we need access to credit. It is too often that access to credit is only available from that smalltown lender--that local bank, that credit union--and they know the community and know their borrowers.  Earlier, one of my colleagues talked about relationship banking. It is the banking system that many of us grew up with, and it is the banking system that still works for us in smalltown In the absence of the reforms included in this legislation, the ability of many of my banks in Kansas to make home loans will continue to be absent.  For the years that I have been on the Banking Committee, I have questioned the examiners, the FDIC, the Comptroller of the Currency, and the State banking commissioners: What are you doing to make certain that the regulations don't put out of business the smalltown lenders who are so important to the communities that I represent?  It seems that we have gotten lipservice: We have a committee. We have a commission. We study these things. When you ask ``What rule or regulation have you eliminated?'' there is never an answer that outlines that that has happened.[[Page S1358]]  Today, we are altering the opportunity for the regulators to continue to overregulate financial institutions that are only important to the communities they serve, and if they have financial challenges, it does not create a threat to the rest of our banking system or to our country's economy and fiscal condition. Relationship banking matters.  Today we have a regulatory environment in which bankers are fearful of making a home loan to a citizen within their community. If somebody wants to buy a home or build a home, they are told by their local bank: We can't afford the cost associated with the regulations for making these loans. We can't afford the risk that if we make a technical error, the financial consequences to our bank will be so great, we will be out of the home loan business.  Who would ever expect to go to their hometown bank and discover they don't make home loans? And it is not because there is not the opportunity to make a loan that will be repaid--the bank will make money, and the borrower will get the benefit of the loan--it is because, upon a mistake, the regulations are so onerous and so expensive that the business decision is made not that this person is not creditworthy but that the risk associated with the regulations is so great that they can't make the loan.  We need more banks, more financial institutions making home loans in more communities so that more people in rural American can access the American dream. If we create a banking system in which the rules and regulations dictate that every ``t'' must be crossed and every ``i'' must be dotted, and it is like you have a computer program and plug in the numbers and make a decision whether that local banker can make a loan, rural America will no longer be here.  For much of the time I have served in Congress and tried to explain rural America to my colleagues, I have indicated that in communities that I represent, it is often true that economic development can be the difference between whether or not there is a grocery store in town. Most people in Washington, DC, don't understand the nature of that small town. Is there a hardware store? Can the newspaper continue to print newspapers and sell enough advertising and subscriptions to make ends meet? When you lose your grocery store, you begin to lose your home town.  What I have learned over time is that if only that local financial institution is making a loan, are we going to have a grocery store in our town? That local relationship lender knows their community, knows their borrowers, and knows whether they have the character to repay the loan.  I saw this happen recently, and we are experiencing this in Kansas again this month. Wildfires are consuming acres of land across rural Our grasslands are burning. A year ago this month, nearly 80 percent of Clark County, KS, was consumed in a wildfire. It is a ranching community. Ashland, the county seat, has a population of 900. That is rural. That is the biggest town in the county. As a result of those fires, thousands of head of cattle were killed in the fire or had to be euthanized. As you would think, there was a terrible economic consequence to the community. You would wonder, how do we recover? One of the things you would think about is, well, I can go to my bank and borrow money to keep my farm or my cattle operation in business. But those cattlemen no longer had any collateral. There was no collateral. You could not tell your banker: I pledge my cattle to repay the loan. If I don't repay the loan, you get my cattle. The fire consumed their opportunity to rebuild.  The Presiding Officer is a member of the Agriculture He will be asked about the safety net that is in a farm bill, and that is important to us. But the safety net that many farmers and ranchers have in Kansas is the relationship they have with their banker, who makes a decision. It is not based upon a computer program or that every ``t'' is crossed and every ``i'' is dotted. That banker makes a decision based upon the character and the relationship and the history.  Many of our banks in Kansas are owned by families. They have been in the family for generations. The same is true of our farms and ranches. That relationship allows a banker to make a loan even when there is no cattle due to the result of a natural disaster. The collateral is gone, but the banker knows the family. He knows the history and knows whether this potential borrower has character. They know that if he or she makes a promise to repay, that he or she will.  All too often, those decisions have been taken away from those relationship lenders and reside here in Washington, DC, with a myriad of regulators who are telling our bankers through their examiners, through the examination process, this is a loan you can't make or this is a loan we will write for you.  Today, we make another step in the process toward returning the ability for smalltown America--its businesses, its farmers, and its ranchers--to have a future. This is important legislation that will make a significant difference in the future of communities and the people who live in rural America and in rural  This is not about taking care of bankers. It is not about taking care of credit unions. It is about taking care of the people they serve, their borrowers, and that means a bright future for the rest of rural America, for the other people who live in the communities, because access to credit determines whether there is a grocery store in town or whether a farmer or a rancher can borrow money to keep their business going, to keep their farm or ranch going.  This is a good day, and I commend my colleagues. It is a good day for the Senate, to see us working together, Republicans and Democrats, to reach a result that will make a difference. It is a good day for It is a good day for rural It is an opportunity for us to correct when we went too far following the financial collapse of 2008.  Thank you for the opportunity to speak. I appreciate my colleagues, especially the chairman, the Senator from Idaho, for his tremendous efforts in bringing us together and getting us to this point.

As we think about the scourge that is brought upon our children through a means and a way--we like to think of the internet as a powerful tool, but to know that it can be a powerful tool that truly is devastating to our children and devastating to our families calls for action. So I am pleased to be able to join my colleagues today in urging passage of the sex trafficking bill that we have before the  I think we all know there are many, many reasons why we need to deter the use of internet resources by predators. The wisdom of this is pretty apparent on its face. This legislation is for the protection of our children--the most vulnerable among us.  I have an additional reason for urging the adoption of this legislation, and that is the protection of Native women and girls from predators. I have been talking about the trafficking of Native women and girls for as long as I have been here in the Senate--now some 15 years. At first, the evidence was perhaps anecdotal. FBI agents who were familiar with trafficking patterns would come to us, and they would say that Alaska Native women were a highly desirable commodity. Even using that terminology is just so offensive, but that is how they were viewed--as a desirable commodity for sex trafficking because they could be trafficked either as White women or as Asian women.  There is a body of evidence that when many Alaska Native women or girls left their villages to go into town or to go to the city, they would literally be stalked by predators waiting to recruit them. We certainly see a prevalence of sex trafficking in Covenant House, which is our youth homeless shelter. We have reports that one in four homeless youth in Anchorage are victims of sex trafficking, and 42 percent of them are Alaska  As I have been here in the Senate over these years, the way these women and girls have been recruited, have been trafficked, has changed. No longer do you have the predators who are lurking, hanging out on the street corners, but it is the internet. Again, it is this powerful tool that is available to do so much good that is now being used for a predatory purpose. While we don't have the internet coverage in Alaska that you have in the big cities of the lower 48, the internet is used to recruit girls for sex trafficking all over, and I certainly had that confirmed in my last visit when I met with the FBI agents in charge in  It wasn't too many weeks ago that the Senator from North Dakota, ",CREC-2018-03-21-pt1-PgS1849-8.txt,1694,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2018.0,21.0,March

1904,topic-id,1543,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague and congratulate him. I recognize him and Senator Crapo, as well, for their efforts.  I think, as we look to those energy solutions that can take our country and our planet to a place that is better, that demonstrate a truly greater environmental stewardship through the uses of clean energy, one should almost immediately look to the benefits that nuclear is able to provide for us.  In my coming from a fossil-producing State like Alaska, people often ask, if I were not someone in Congress, would I be a supporter of nuclear. I truly believe that when it comes to our energy portfolio and those that will allow us to have a balanced approach to our energy and our energy solutions and when we are talking about the affordability, the accessibility, the diversity of supply, and the security of supply, you must also include and emphasize the clean energy supply.  What the Senator from Rhode Island continues to repeat is worth repeating. Focusing on how we move ourselves to a cleaner energy environment is something we have had opportunities to visit and is something to which I am committed. So I look forward to finding those areas of balance.                        Remembering Jim Balamaci  Mr.President, I am here this afternoon for a brief few moments to pay tribute to an Alaskan whom we lost just within the past 2 weeks.  My State is a State that is well known for the strength of its nonprofit sector, and we lost one of our leaders of that sector--a very special person who was beloved by many. He was a gentleman, a friend, by the name of Jim Jim was the president and chief executive officer of Alaska's Special He unexpectedly passed away at the age of 63.  This Sunday, I will be going home and will join with thousands who will fill the Alaska Airlines Arena on the University of Alaska Anchorage campus to pay tribute to Jim and to celebrate his contributions to the Special Jim was really a giant in the Special Olympics, both at the local level and at the national level.  I think it is most fitting that the celebration of Jim's life will occur during the weekend of the Special Olympics Alaska Winter This will provide an opportunity for the many Special Olympians, the coaches, the volunteers--I am actually going to be there to help pass out awards--and for so many of us whose lives have been touched by Jim's inspiration to gather together to show our love and our admiration for, again, a truly great man.  Being born in Alaska affords one a certain quantum of bragging rights when it comes to leadership, but truth be told, when the history of Alaska post-statehood is written, it is people like Jim who came from somewhere else and chose to make Alaska their home--their lives will be remembered for making Alaska the extraordinary and very special place that it is. Jim really fit that bill.  Our NBC affiliate in Anchorage, KTUU, said: ``If there was ever an Alaskan who wore his heart on his sleeve, it was Balamaci.''  In a 2017 interview with KTUU, Jim explained what makes Alaska so special in words that show how significant a figure he will be remembered as. He said: ``We build our communities, we build our state, and we build our friendships.'' That in a nutshell really explains the DNA of post-statehood Jim absolutely got it, and I think that is one of the reasons he has earned a place in history, as well as in our hearts.  Jim was born in Bridgeport, He was active in sports. He was active in church. He entered a pretheology program at Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary in Yonkers, He was concurrently a student at Iona College in nearby New He graduated from Iona in 1976.  A year after graduation, Jim left the suburbs of New York City to pursue his Alaskan adventure, his Alaskan dream. He moved north. He settled in Kodiak--pretty remote, not on anybody's road system. He worked in commercial fisheries there. He was a carpenter and teacher, and he kind of did it all. That is when he began his career, his lifetime of volunteer service.  He began volunteering in the Special Olympics in 1979, and shortly thereafter, he moved into coaching. He was selected as president and CEO of Special Olympics in Alaska in 1996. Back in 1996, there were about 400 athletes around the Jim grew that universe of athletes of Special Alaska's Special Olympics community today includes some 2,000 athletes, and I can tell you, they are all friends of Jim's.  In a career as rich as Jim's, it might be difficult to identify just one or two experiences that were truly exceptional, but I would bet that Jim would probably say that he was most proud of the 2001 Special Olympics World Winter Games that were hosted in We had over 3,000 athletes from 80 countries who participated in the event. Eunice Kennedy Shriver, who, of course, is the founder of the Special Olympics, reportedly told Jim that it was the best World Winter Games in Special Olympics' history. That was substantial praise from the founder of the Special  Up until the last visit I had with Jim here in Washington, DC, Tim Shriver, who is also an extraordinary individual working within the Special Olympics, has been there with Jim when they come to Washington to visit with me.  Another capstone experience occurred in 2014 with the completion of the Special Olympics Alaska Athlete Training Center and I will tell you, this is a phenomenal facility. It is really a one-of-a-kind facility. It is 28,000 square feet. It has a facility center, an indoor track, and a multipurpose sports court. It has a kitchen where the athletes learn about nutrition. It was built at a cost of about $7 million. It remains one of the world's only dedicated training centers for developmentally disabled athletes. I have had occasion several times a year to be able to go out to their games. They have field hockey inside. The games they are able to participate in year-round in a place like Alaska--to have this training facility is absolutely exceptional and unparalleled.  When we think of the Special Olympians, we typically tend to think of younger athletes, but as young Special Olympians age, they still remain Special Jim saw this. We had so many conversations where he was talked about just the demographic, the aging population that we are seeing among our Special Olympians and those who are developmentally disabled. He said that we cannot not be thinking about their future as well.  Jim was truly a pioneer. He worked in developing the Aging Unified Athlete Program with Special Olympics leaders across the country to ensure that developmentally disabled athletes live long and healthy lives, focusing on lifetime learning but really making sure that at all ages, there is engagement.  Jim had an extraordinary heart, a big heart, a warm personality. He was just so loved. I cannot convey it enough. He was loved by not only those within the community of the Special Olympics but within the broader Alaskan community at large. I certainly saw that this fall when the torch run was being put on, which is a partnership with our law enforcement, along with our Special Olympians--again, a coming together of a community to provide support for one another.  Jim could motivate and charm with the best of them. You need look no further for evidence of that than to be out at a place called Goose Lake in Anchorage, AK, the third week of Jim Balamaci is a guy who could[[Page S1432]]get thousands of Alaskans--literally thousands of Alaskans--to jump into a hole in a frozen lake in December to raise money for the Special  If you have never dressed up in costume to jump into a hole--this is not something where you can wade out to get your feet wet and say: I have done the polar plunge. This is a polar plunge where you go into that hole and you are swimming in a frozen lake, and it is I was out there in Jim Balamaci reminded us that we were all there ``freezin' for a reason,'' and that reason was to help the Special Olympics and Special He was an extraordinarily special person to so many of us.  On behalf of my Senate colleagues, I send my condolences to Jim's mother She visited him often during his 40-year Alaskan adventure. We send our condolences to his sister and brother and to all those who were touched by Jim's kindness and generosity.  Alaska and our Special Olympians across the country are better because of Jim  With that, Mr.President, I thank you, and I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

1390,topic-id,1186,"Mr.President, I thank Senator Sanders and Senator Lee for allowing me to step in and say a few words before we have a short colloquy about the resolution we are bringing to the floor.  I brought this picture to the floor before, and I hesitate to keep it up for more than a few moments. It is very disturbing to look at, but this is the reality of Yemen today. This is the reality of a country in which thousands and thousands of civilians have been killed by a bombing campaign that the United States is facilitating--facilitating with intelligence sharing, facilitating with targeting assistance, facilitating with midair refueling, facilitating with the sale of munitions that end up being dropped on the homes of families like this.  This, as has been stated, is perhaps the worst cholera outbreak in modern history. Let's talk about why that happens.  Why are over 1 million people in Yemen today suffering from cholera, a disease that is entirely 100 percent preventable? The reason is that the water treatment facilities inside Yemen have been bombed, have been rendered useless such that there is no means by which they can keep the water that these young children drink clean. Bombs sold to the Saudi coalition by the United States, bombs dropped from planes refueled by the U.Air Force, bombs that are directed via targeting centers in which U.personnel are embedded hit water treatment facilities inside Yemen, and there is now the worst cholera outbreak in our lifetime.  I cannot do a better job than Senator Lee did of explaining to the body why we believe it is so important for Congress to exercise our Article I responsibility to declare war. He laid it out better than I can. The Founding Fathers believed, as he said, that when there were matters of great import to the national security of this country, when there were decisions that the Executive was making with respect to hostilities with other nations that included serious consequences for the United States and the world, that should not be simply an Executive function. Very specifically, as Senator Lee said, that power of declaring war, of entering into hostilities against another nation, is housed here in the So it is relevant to talk about what is happening in Yemen today. What is the degree of the hostilities, and does it come with serious national security concerns for the United States of America, for the constituents we represent?  We are absolutely engaged in hostilities today. There is no way that what we see in these charts could not be categorized as hostilities. The bombs that ruined this entire neighborhood are made in the United States, are dropped by planes refueled by the United States, are directed by a targeting center that involves U.personnel. This is clearly an act of hostility that the United States, in partnership with the Saudi coalition, has entered into against the Yemeni people.  Remember, this is a civil war inside There are not-so-good people on both sides of this civil war. The Houthis have been responsible for major, catastrophic acts in the country, just as the coalition has, but we are only on one side of that, so it makes sense for us to focus on the hostilities that have been entered into by the United States and the Saudi coalition. But let's for a second talk about the other implications for U.national security.  What has happened inside Yemen as this civil war has persisted? Al-Qaida and ISIS have grown in strength. For a period of time, AQAP--the arm of al-Qaida inside Yemen that has the most direct intention to hit the United States--had captured a major port inside Yemen and was drawing substantial revenue, allowing them to become stronger than ever before. By continuing to feed weapons into this civil war, the United States is helping to expand the reach and the power of the two entities inside Yemen that the administration argues they do have authorization to fight--al-Qaida and Many of us would draw issue with the interpretation of an AUMF passed a decade and a half ago as it applies to ISIS, but no doubt the administration has the ability to pursue war against al-Qaida, and al-Qaida is gaining strength because of the continuation of this civil war.  If you talk to Yemeni-Americans, they will tell you that inside Yemen, this is not seen as a Saudi bombing campaign, this is seen as a U.S.-Saudi bombing campaign. And what they will further tell you is that Yemenis are becoming radicalized against the United States because there is a U.imprint on every bomb that is dropped and every single death inside that country.  While we may talk a good game about humanitarian relief and we may enter into occasional efforts to settle this conflict through negotiations, all they know is that for 3 years the United States has been supporting a Saudi bombing campaign that does not end. We have been supporting a Saudi-led coalition that has blocked humanitarian relief from entering this country. We may hear a lot about the money that the Saudis are putting into humanitarian relief, but we don't hear as much about the fact that at one point they completely closed the port through which the majority of humanitarian relief flows. Although now it is technically open, they are still narrowing the channel greatly through which relief supplies get to this country. So nobody should applaud the United States or the Saudis for providing relief to a country that they, indeed, are bombing.  I am not setting aside the culpability of the Houthis for substantial atrocities in this civil war as well, but we are only on one side of it.[[Page S1665]]  This is clearly covered by the powers vested in the U.Congress to make war. If it isn't, it unlocks a horrific Pandora's box. If the President can enter into hostilities against another country so long as all they are doing is providing vast logistical support to a coalition partner, then there is no end to what the President can do so long as he doesn't put a troop on the ground.  Our involvement in the Saudi-led coalition has serious national security implications for the United States, aside from the fact that it has resulted in the deaths of thousands of civilians and has set off the worst humanitarian catastrophe the world has seen today. As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I just want to bring these consequences to bear for our colleagues to think about--our colleagues who might not think that this rises to the powers vested in the Congress by the There are very few more serious conflicts with respect to consequences for the United States than this one. So I guess I would wrap back around that question that Senator Lee posed to Senator  If the United States doesn't weigh in here, then, when? What is the precedent that is set by Congress's continuing to remain silent even when you have a humanitarian catastrophe and a set of consequences for U.national security that are this big?

1395,topic-id,657,"Mr.President, I thank Senator Sanders for the question. This is incredibly important to understand.  There was great consternation in the beginning of this civil war, when the United States, under the Obama administration, was beginning to support the Saudi-led coalition. The Saudis were only targeting the Houthis, and as the al-Qaida wing inside of Yemen was getting stronger and stronger, no matter how much we asked, no matter how much we pushed, the Saudi-led coalition would not drop bombs on al-Qaida and would not send any of their forces near them. They were only focused on the  The answer as to why that was happening is very simple. The enemy of your enemy tends to be your ally, and inside Yemen, the Houthis were drawing fire from both the Saudi-led coalition and from al-In the early stages of this fight, the policy of the Saudi-led coalition was to have hands off of al-Qaida, and that made al-Qaida stronger and stronger and stronger.  Now, admittedly, recently we have been more successful in getting the Emirates, not necessarily the Saudis, to take on targeted missions against al-Qaida, but that is only a recent phenomenon, and it is frankly belied by the fact that we have new information that at the same time that the Emirates are occasionally taking out operations--and sometimes dangerous operations, with risk of life to their forces against al-Qaida--they are also supporting other militias inside Yemen--Salafist militias--that are in many ways just as radical as al-Qaida is and are recruiting the types of recruits that one day may join ISIS and one day may join al-Qaida, targeting against the United So this is a very chaotic space in which very purposefully, for a period of time, the coalition allowed for al-Qaida to grow. Even though that policy has changed recently, there are still signs that there are some people who are very dangerous to the United States who are being supported on the ground by members of our coalition.  I know Senator Durbin is here, so I want to turn it over to him. I just want to say two more quick things on this point. One is to note that our resolution does continue to allow for the United States to target al-We built into this resolution a carve-out for any military activities that are currently authorized by the 2001 AUMF, and the administration interprets that to be al-Qaida and affiliated follow-on organizations. So let's be clear that if you care about the United States targeting al-Qaida, that can continue here.  Finally, to Senator Lee's point about this interpretation of hostilities, let's be clear about how narrow a definition that is. There have to be American troops on the ground exchanging fire in order for the War Powers Act to be triggered. That is not what Congress intended because, in fact, that would then allow the administration to perpetuate an unlimited air campaign, dropping unlimited munitions, devastating, ruining a country, without any input from Even if one would say ``Well, that does involve U.personnel flying overhead, so maybe that is potentially putting U.troops in the line of fire,'' remember, we are also entering an era of robotic warfare, in which U.personnel are going to be less instrumental to hostilities that will still have grave consequences for the United  Clearly, the notion of war and how you fight it has changed over the years. The Founding Fathers never imagined air campaigns. Yet, the intent and the language of the War Powers Act and of the Constitution are clear. When war is being waged, when hostilities are being entered into, Congress has to have a say. Please, look at any of the pictures that we are putting before you and tell us that the United States is not engaged in hostilities if the effect in the country of Yemen is this.  I thank Senator Durbin for joining us on the floor today, and I yield to him.  ",CREC-2018-03-13-pt1-PgS1656-2.txt,1837,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2018.0,13.0,March

I have that respect and admiration for him, and I want him to know I will continue to do that because I believe in legislating, and I know he does as well. I share that respect.  To the Senator from Maine, through the Chair, I would also say I have a lot[[Page S1922]]of respect for the Senator from Maine and her passions and her goals on this as well. I say to both of them, this is an issue I care about deeply. I would not have sat down with any one of them to work on a bipartisan solution to the dilemma we found ourselves in throughout the last year as repeated decisions were made that undermine the security of people in terms of their ability to afford quality healthcare and a marketplace that was increasingly seeing uncertainty. I believe in those goals, and I know they do as well.  I remain committed to getting this done. I agree timing is everything, and we have been working on this since I regret the actions that were taken that we were not able to put this forward in September or December, and we are here now at this point.  I will state, as to the language that has been added, obviously and clearly, there is a real divide on how it is read, how it is interpreted, and how it could be applicable. That is our objection. I say to my colleague, my chairman, through the Chair as well, that we had offered him language on Friday that did indeed deal with the Hyde amendment. No one here said we cannot have that, but we have language that exceeds, in my opinion--I know that is not shared on the other side--but in my opinion extends well beyond into the private marketplace, where I think there is a line the people would not support, and I certainly can't myself.  In addition to the other language dealing with people's ability to protect their preexisting conditions, we clearly have a divide on how that is interpreted, but that does not preclude our ability, if we agree on the goal of stabilizing the marketplace and ensuring that we can do the CSR payments, that we can do the reinsurance program the Senator from Maine has championed, and rightfully so--and I hope we can all agree that moving on from here, we would return to that bipartisan proposal, not partisan proposals, and move to get this done.

657,topic-id,1199,"Mr.President, reserving the right to object, I want to take a moment to talk about how we got to this point and why I am hopeful that, despite the Republican leader's decision to once again scuttle bipartisan negotiations on health stabilization, we can return to the table and work together to do what patients and families want; that is, to strengthen healthcare and lower the premiums next year.  Chairman Alexander had said that in September every Democrat in the Senate was ready to pass the original Alexander-Murray legislation, and he is right. We wanted to work with Republicans to undo as much of President Trump's healthcare sabotage as possible because of how it is hurting families and forcing them to pay more for care. Unfortunately, Senator McConnell blocked our bipartisan agreement because he wanted to pressure his caucus into supporting yet another harmful Republican repeal bill. That TrumpCare bill failed, and I was again hopeful that after it did, we could make progress on our bipartisan legislation. Instead, Senate Republican leaders opted to do the exact opposite. They jammed through a terrible tax bill that actually raises families' premiums to pay for tax cuts for massive corporations. Even after that, I and Democrats were still at the table and ready to do what we could to stabilize markets and lower families' healthcare costs.  Imagine my frustration when, at the very last minute--just days ago--Republicans leaders once again made clear that they didn't want to lower families' premiums. They didn't want to stabilize a healthcare system that, as one House Republican said, they never supported anyway. Senate Republicans opted, instead, to surprise Democrats with a new, last-minute partisan proposal, the so-called stabilization bill, which included poison pills that Republicans knew Democrats would never agree to.  The partisan bill that Republicans surprised us with would undermine access to care for people with preexisting conditions by writing President Trump's junk plans rule into law and by taking away protections included in our original agreement with Chairman Alexander to make sure that the sickest patients don't find themselves in a dramatically more expensive market.  This partisan bill also pulled the most worn page out of the Republicans' ideological playbook--making extreme, political attacks on women's healthcare. This partisan bill would take huge steps beyond current law, making it so women can't even buy abortion coverage using their own money.  From the start of negotiations last fall, I made it abundantly clear I will not allow women's reproductive freedoms to become a political football in these conversations. I also made clear that I understood, like it or not, that current prohibitions on taxpayer funding for abortion services would apply to our agreement. But that is not what this is--not at all.  I think that was made pretty clear when Republicans surprised us with this last-minute change in a press release without inviting any Democrats to join. I believe, and I think most people would agree, that the massive expansion of restrictions on women's access to safe, legal abortion we see in this partisan bill has nothing to do with lowering families' premiums or making healthcare work better in our country. That is not something that was in our original deal that had bipartisan support, and it is not something that should be in this bill now.  I am extremely disappointed that we have reached this point, but it does not mean I am giving up on getting this done. I know many Republicans have said that this is the end of the road for bipartisan negotiations on healthcare, but it is only if they choose that route.[[Page S1919]]  Today I am laying out what I hope Republicans and Democrats will ultimately be able to agree on. This is legislation that includes current law prohibitions on taxpayer funding for abortion--what Senate Democrats and Republicans agreed was acceptable months ago. It would take strong steps to lower premiums and make healthcare more affordable for patients. It would hold protections for people with preexisting conditions, as so many Republicans and Democrats have said we need to do.  We are frustratingly close to an agreement, and I still do believe we can get there. This shouldn't be about the blame game. It should not be about pointing fingers. This has to be about getting results.  I hope Republicans and Democrats will join me in supporting the amendment I am offering today, and even if they don't, I hope we can get back to the table and resume talks. I truly believe there are Republicans who want to do the right thing for patients and families, even if their leadership is determined to avoid a real debate and vote on the so-called ObamaCare bailout. Our work last fall showed that we can reach an agreement when we put aside partisan politics and focus on what is best for our families. I am ready to get back to work to get that done.  I object to the pending unanimous consent request.                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.1625  I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate proceeds to the consideration of the House message to accompany H.1625, the omnibus appropriations bill, the Murray amendment that is now at the desk be considered and agreed to.  The PRESIDING Objection is heard to the first request.  Is there objection to the request from the Senator from Washington?  Mr.I object.  The PRESIDING Objection is heard.  The Senator from  Mr.Mr.President, this has been a very disappointing moment. Senator Collins is asking to pass an amendment that would not seem to be terribly controversial. As we have heard my colleagues state this afternoon, the Alexander-Murray-Collins-Nelson proposal would lower health insurance premiums--dramatically, in some cases--for American individuals and families. This assistance would be especially helpful to the middle-class families whom ObamaCare has hit the hardest.  How do my colleagues propose accomplishing this worthy goal? Through another top-down, one-size-fits-all scheme cooked up here in Washington? No, their legislation is designed to encourage new thinking and creative policymaking at the State level, through the expansion of section 1332 State innovation waivers and high-risk pools. It would end the practice of silver-loading, which unnecessarily costs the taxpayers tens of billions of dollars. It includes Hyde amendment language that has been commonplace for decades, going back to the 1970s, preventing taxpayer dollars from funding abortions. Apparently, that commonsense provision is suddenly just a bridge too far for some of our friends across the aisle.  For months, my colleague from Maine has led a bipartisan effort to bring common sense back to Americans' healthcare. Along with Senator Alexander, she has brought together Senators with different viewpoints and made real progress toward fixing the glaring failures of the current system. It is especially disappointing that their efforts are being blocked precisely when they stand the greatest chance of helping millions of It is not entirely surprising that my colleagues across the aisle are happy to talk the talk about lowering premiums for working families, but they refuse to actually walk the walk when given a golden opportunity. But it sure is disappointing.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor to the Collins-Alexander amendment.

296,topic-id,1773,"Madam President, I thank the Senator from Ohio for his gracious comments.  I just simply want to say my part as to why it is so important that we pass this legislation, because it is very obvious that an untold number of women and children in the United States are being sold into sexual slavery via the internet, and we now have an opportunity to do something about it by passing this legislation.  It is so bad. With just a few clicks or a few punches on an iPhone, victims from all walks of life and across all parts of the country are being forced into brutal slavery and unspeakable crimes.  I want to repeat that. I want Americans to understand what is going on behind the scenes. Women and children are being forced into sex slavery in modern-day It could very well happen to someone you know.  We have continuing stories in our history of what happened when slavery was brought to the New World--first, to Arabia, off the East Coast of Africa, and then, of course, the European nations later were going down with their ship captains. The Portuguese actually ended up having the most slaves transported to the New World by way of South The English and most European nations got into the act of these unspeakable crimes, slave ships going down the west coast of Africa, enslaving Africans themselves or by agreement with a particular tribe that would go out and capture members of an opposing tribe.  We have heard, over and over, the untold stories of the inhumanity of stacking people body-to-body in the holds of these slave ships. It finally took a civil war to settle the issue. That was slavery. That was slavery we opposed and now all of our laws try to protect against, but here in modern-day America, the same thing is happening, and it is happening because of the advances of technology using the internet. If this is not a wake-up call, I simply don't know what is.  According to the human trafficking hotline, my State of Florida has consistently ranked in the top five States in human trafficking cases. Florida was third in the country for the number of cases reported in 2016 and 2017, and that is just what we know about. It is just unacceptable, and it is wrong.  Tens of thousands of Americans, predominantly women and children, are subjected to this horrific reality. You can imagine the pain and the suffering they are subjected to. No one in the country should have to endure this kind of forced slavery. No child or woman in Florida, in America, should ever be trafficked for sex. To even contemplate that should offend any person's sense of decency and humanity.  The question before the Senate today, thanks to the leadership of a number of our colleagues is, Why aren't we going to do everything we can to stop these heinous crimes?  The bill we are considering on the Senate floor would help us shut down despicable websites that enable this sex trafficking. Don't kid yourself. These shady and these highly profitable website operators know full well how their sites are being used. What is more, they are hiding behind a decades-old legal shield to immunize themselves from prosecution. We have to change that legal shield that was set up a decade ago for a different purpose.  The bill sponsored by Senators Portman, Blumenthal, McCain, Heitkamp, and myself--and now many others--would eliminate the safe harbor in law for sex traffickers, and it would allow State attorneys general, other State and local prosecutors, and the victims themselves to go after the websites that knowingly provide a platform for sex trafficking. It would also make key changes to Federal criminal law to enable law enforcement to better target websites.  The purpose of the legislation is simple. Let's get it passed, get it signed into law, and let all of these various law enforcement entities be able to do their job. This legislation is an extensive bipartisan product by our congressional colleagues. It proves, once again, what we ought to be doing around here on almost everything, and yet we rarely do. It proves, once again, that if you cross party lines and put things together in a bipartisan way, you can tackle the important, lifesaving issues, such as this one, and we can get something done. Let's show today that we can get something done that really makes a difference to  It is a privilege for me to be involved in a bipartisan way with this legislation and to have worked with our Commerce Committee to get a unanimous vote out of the committee. I hope this legislation is going to serve as a wake-up call to the morally bankrupt website operators: We are coming after you. It seems like every day there are new ways that many bad actors are exploiting internet content and data to undermine society.  Obviously, the internet has been magnificent for so many of us, but now when technology advances, you have to be on your guard about how new technology is used for the bad operators. This bill is going to address that. We can't sit by idly any longer. We have to act today.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The majority leader.  Mr.Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 1:45 p.m., today, Senator Wyden be recognized for up to 60 minutes to offer and debate concurrently his amendments 2213 and 2212; that those be the only amendments in order; and that following the use or yielding back of that time, the Senate vote in relation to the amendments in the order listed with a 60-vote affirmative threshold required for adoption of each amendment; finally, that following disposition of those amendments, the bill be read a third time and the Senate vote on passage of the bill, as amended, if amended, without debate.  The PRESIDING Is there objection?  Without objection, it is so ordered.[[Page S1858]]                           Omnibus Appropriations  Mr.Madam President, I am pleased to report that the appropriations package is currently being finalized. I will have more to say once the bill has been filed, but I am proud to announce it will meet a number of vitally important objectives. This includes the largest year-on-year increase in funding for our servicemembers in 15 years, along with major steps forward for law enforcement and border security, for the fight against opioid addiction, for our veterans, and for a number of other priorities.  Madam President, before we take up that measure, the Senate has a very important piece of business to tackle. This afternoon we will vote on the anti-sex trafficking legislation we have been considering this week. I want to thank Senator Portman, who has worked hard to advance this reform, and Chairman Thune, for shepherding it through the Commerce  Many of us have paid careful attention to the scourge of child trafficking over the years. It has been a high-priority issue for me, for example, since before I arrived in the But as traffickers move their crimes from the street corner to the smartphone, the data tell us unambiguously that more action is required.  The legislation before us reforms a misused provision in a 1996 telecommunications act, which currently shields companies that facilitate and profit from the disgusting exploitation of women and children.  Later today, my colleagues will have the opportunity to implement commonsense reform with the potential to change vulnerable children's lives for the better.  I urge every one of us to vote to pass it.                               Tax Reform  Now, Madam President, on a final matter, we have been talking for months about the ways tax reform is helping to jump-start the economy, bolster family budgets, and make life better for millions of Just a few months in, many such stories have already made front-page news--the tax reform bonuses, raises, and benefits for 4 million workers and counting; the new investments and new hiring from businesses large and small; the bigger paychecks for middle-class Americans as the IRS withholds less of their money.  Other exciting parts of this once-in-a-generation reform aren't receiving the attention they deserve. Today, for example, is an initial deadline for States to nominate areas they would like to be designated as ``opportunity zones.'' This is thanks to a provision incorporated into tax reform through the unflagging dedication of our colleague, Senator  The premise here is simple. The best way to breathe new life into struggling communities is not to invent some new Federal program; it isn't to throw government money into one more top-down, tax-and-spend scheme. The best way to help rural areas, small cities, and suburbs left behind by the Obama-era policies is to get the government's foot off the brake and let the free enterprise system flourish. It is to make those communities attractive places to do business, open new facilities, and create good-paying jobs. This is exactly what tax reform does by deferring capital gains taxes on income that is invested in distressed areas that receive this ``opportunity zone'' designation.  As one estimate has it, three-quarters of all the jobs created from 2010 to 2016 went to major metropolitan areas. Only 3 percent went to rural This provision could help change that.  I know there is a lot of excitement in my State of From coal country to farming communities and everywhere in between, Obama-era overregulation was holding our economy short of its full potential. These opportunity zones offer a shot at real relief. According to the Cabinet for Economic Development, Kentucky may designate as many as 144 new zones, prioritizing growth in areas that need it most.  Or take West As my friend Senator Capito recently noted, her State understands the problem all too well. One recent study suggested that West Virginia has the third highest proportion of its population living in economically distressed communities. Opportunity zones will make a difference to her Of course, so will the rest of tax reform.  A few weeks back, Senator Capito reported that Worldwide Equipment in West Sulphur Springs plans to reinvest $8 million in its operations, including more than 1,000 employee bonuses--all thanks to tax reform.  I imagine West Virginians are quite glad that Senator Capito used her vote to make tax reform a reality. It is a shame their senior Senator didn't follow suit. It is a shame that he and every other Democrat tried to block it from taking effect. Fortunately, this President and this Congress didn't let that stop us.

1400,topic-id,890,"Mr.President, we have a series of Senators who are going to be speaking about what is happening as a result of climate change and sea level rise, which is having its effects in my State of Florida, particularly.  Few States are as vulnerable to climate change than what we find particularly in South Florida, Miami Beach being Ground What is happening as the sea level is rising--and these are not projections, they are not forecasts; these are actually measurements, measurements by NASA and NOAA over the last 40 years that the sea has risen in South Florida 5 to 8 inches.  We see the effects of that at the seasonal high tides--now, more increasingly, along with the cycles of the Moon each month. Water, typically, is sloshing around in streets and sloshing over the curves. As a result, the city of Miami Beach has had to spend tens of millions of dollars on huge, expensive pumps and has also had to raise the level of the roadbeds.  NOAA's most recent worst-case scenario projections predict a 2-foot sea level rise by 2060 and, if we take it all the way to the end of the century, 6 feet by 2100. Needless to say, in a peninsula that sits in the middle of what we know as Hurricane Highway, 6 feet would inundate so much of the coastal areas. By the way, the population of Florida is 21 million people, and 75 percent is along the coastal regions. That puts all of the entire Nation's low-lying coastal cities at risk of major flooding, not to mention our military installations along the coast.  The seas are not just rising; they are also warming, and they are rising because they are warming. Of course, I have explained this several times on the floor of the Senate: As the Sun's rays come in and hit the Earth, some of the heat is absorbed, but some of it is reflected off the Earth's surface and is radiated out into space.  When you put up an extra abundance of greenhouse gases--mainly carbon dioxide and methane--and they move into the upper atmosphere, they serve like a glass ceiling of a greenhouse; thus, the term, the ``greenhouse'' effect. Then, as that heat is reflected off the Earth that would normally radiate out into space, it is trapped and, thus, the entire Earth starts to heat.  Two-thirds of the Earth's surface is covered by oceans, and 90 percent of that heat is absorbed into the oceans. What happens to water when it is heated? It expands. So we see the reasons that warmer water means the sea levels rise.  Do you know what else it produces? More frequent and more ferocious hurricanes. After the back-to-back punch of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, imagine how much we would have to spend in Federal disaster aid if we had a hurricane season like last year every year. That is why it is so critical to continue funding climate and weather research and to keep improving NOAA's hurricane models.  This information can make the difference in a life-or-death situation. We saw what havoc the hurricanes visited upon Texas and then Florida after it had already crossed Puerto Rico, but then along comes Maria, and it hits the island directly. As of today, 5, going on 6, months after the hurricane, the poor island of Puerto Rico--our fellow American citizens--17 percent today do not still have electricity. So, indeed, there has been a lot more loss of life as a result of hurricanes.  Our coastline in Florida is blessed, as a hurricane is approaching, with a natural breakwater. It is called the Florida Reef It is along the southeastern coast. Of all the major barrier reefs in the entire world, Florida has the third largest. It starts south of Key West and continues all the way up the Keys, north, up to Fort Pierce,  This Florida reef is the only barrier reef in the continental United Healthy reefs are able to reduce storm damage by taking a lot of the impact, but climate change, ocean acidification, and an unprecedented coral disease outbreak are hurting Florida's reefs and diminishing their ability to act as a shoreline buffer. I am not even talking about all the other things that reefs do--which is the natural place for all the fish and critters of the sea to gather, swimming in and around and among all of the coral reefs.  That is why, last week, I wrote a letter to the Secretaries of Commerce, Agriculture, and Health and Human Services calling for an interagency strike team to be formed to finally diagnose the coral disease in an attempt to save the remaining reefs.  I want to show an example of the difference between a healthy reef and a diseased reef. Look at the difference. Here is the healthy coral. Look how the diseased reef has actually been bleached out. So time is running out on this third largest barrier reef on the planet. We have to respond to the causes and effects of climate change now. The longer we put it off, the harder and more expensive it is going to be to mitigate.  I thank Senator Whitehouse and my fellow colleagues who are speaking out on this critical mission.

1654,topic-id,949,"Madam President, so many are still grieving from the atrocious killing of 17 people at the high school in Indeed, our entire State is grieving. Broward County is grieving. Parkland is grieving. I think we are going to find on March 24, in the rallies and the marches that will occur in 500 cities around this country and will have a focus of the main one in Washington, that a lot of people are grieving, because a lot of people all across this country have been touched by these massacres that continue to occur, starting almost three decades ago at Columbine in We have certainly had our fill of it in Florida just in the last 2 years: 49 people gunned down with an assault rifle, a Sig Sauer MCX, at the Pulse nightclub; another assault pistol used to gun down 5 people in the Fort Lauderdale Airport; and now an AR-15 used to gun down 17. He would have gotten a lot more had he been able to open the third-story window overlooking the courtyard from a perch as the students fled across the courtyard to get out of the schoolyard. He couldn't get the window open. He tried to shoot it open, but it was hurricane-proof glass, and it only shattered; it didn't break.  It has been almost 1 month since the tragic shooting. Those 17 families--14 students and 3 adults--are certainly grieving, and we have seen in the last few weeks many of the parents, students, families, and community leaders stand up to say that enough is enough. They are asking us, the U.Congress, to enact meaningful legislation to reduce gun violence.  The action starts in Tallahassee, and the students are going there while the State legislature is still in session, talking about commonsense solutions, such as enacting universal background checks in the purchase of a gun; not allowing a gun show loophole or a private transaction loophole; not allowing a loophole for orders on the internet; universal background checks that would include mental problems; if you have been on the terrorist watch list, that would include, of course, criminal records but also mentally adjudicated records; universal background checks in the acquisition of a gun, particularly an assault rifle. But we can't get that passed here because some folks aren't listening.  Take, for example, what was said at the White House just last night. Giving in to the will of the NRA, the White House announced that it would provide Federal funding for firearms training for teachers and other school personnel. This Senator thinks that arming teachers is a terrible idea. It is not what the students are asking for. It is not what the teachers are asking for. It is not what the American people want us to do.  Just last week, the Florida legislature passed and the Governor signed into law a bill--a watered-down version, but it is still arming school personnel, and it falls short on what is really needed to reduce gun violence and especially the massacres that are occurring. While what Florida has done is a step in the right direction, particularly with regard to mandating 3-day waiting periods in the purchase of an assault rifle, we are far from where we need to be in addressing gun violence if[[Page S1623]]we are talking about putting more guns in our schools, and if--as the President suggested last night--we arm teachers. The teachers don't want it, and I can tell you who else doesn't want it. The SWAT teams that have to storm the building looking for the shooter don't want to encounter a teacher with a gun and mistakenly think that teacher is the shooter. It is common sense.  What studies do supporters of this idea cite, suggesting that arming teachers will reduce gun violence at schools? Why even propose this solution before seeing what policies are proposed by a new Federal commission on school safety, which has now been developed? Why don't we at least see what they are proposing? No, this is to sell more guns by arming teachers.  I have spoken to many teachers, students, and families. I haven't found one person who wants teachers to be armed, including the teachers themselves. There is near universal agreement that arming teachers is a terrible idea. Yet such an idea continues to direct Congress's attention away from obvious and commonsense solutions supported by most Americans, which are universal background checks and getting the assault rifles and banana clips that have 30 rounds off the streets.  I have supported several bipartisan bills--some with my colleague from Florida, Senator Rubio--that address background check issues and seek to make sure our schools have the resources to keep our students safe.  Senator Rubio and I announced last week that if there are red flags, they need to be brought to the attention of law enforcement. We are offering in our bill a Federal incentive program to the States to get those red flags about a problem person to the authorities before it is too late. But ideas like arming teachers and putting more guns in our schools are just plain dangerous.  Mr.President, I know you have backed off of certain things because the NRA wanted you to, and I know you are now proposing arming teachers. Let's get down to some real commonsense solutions. Let's work on how to prevent assault weapons from getting into the wrong hands and to stop the massacres that continue to plague this country. The people of America want no less.  I yield the floor.

1665,topic-id,977,"Mr.President, I join our colleagues who have spoken about the concern of the Russian cyber attacks on this country.  Every day that passes, we gather new information about how Russia, at Vladimir Putin's direction, has gone about interfering by committing cyber attacks on this country, not only in its stealing names and personal information but now in its interfering in our elections.  In a long indictment, Special Counsel Robert Mueller spelled out how the so-called Internet Research Agency--a front in Russia--created fake accounts on social media and other internet platforms. It spread divisive content, and it even organized political rallies in the United States with the help of unwitting Americans--all backed by one of Putin's cronies through a so-called catering company. This indictment tells a pretty remarkable and alarming story, and if you are still not[[Page S1399]]sure what this was all about, just read the Internet Research Agency's own words: ``information warfare against the United States of America.'' That says it all.  I know there has been a lot of discussion about Russian interference in our elections, and there should be. We have to get to the bottom of this. It is coming fast and furious, and it is going to be happening in the elections this year. We know what Russia did in the last election. Just as the CIA Director and the Director of National Intelligence told us, we know, in their words, that Russia will do it again. The more we learn, though, the more it becomes clear that we are not doing enough to protect ourselves from further attacks.  This is not a partisan issue; it is an attack on the very foundation of our democracy. At a time when it is getting harder and harder to come together as a country--when polarization is so rampant, when excessive partisanship is so evident--what Russia is doing is particularly sinister. It is trying to exacerbate our divisions and undermine Americans' faith in their institutions.  Months away from an election, the question is, What are we going to do about it? We are just days away from an election in Texas and about 8 months away from the November general election. What are we going to do? One thing we ought to do is to start defending ourselves.  Last month, Senator Shaheen, Senator Blumenthal, and I wrote to the Secretary of Defense and urged him to use our cyber forces--U.Cyber Command, which is the one instructed with protecting us--to disrupt Russian cyber operations that target our elections. We urged the Secretary of Defense to implement the recommendations of the Department's own task force to deter these cyber operations. Those were the recommendations of the Department of Defense's own task force.  Just a few days ago, four-star Admiral Rogers, commander of Cyber Command, told our Armed Services Committee that he had still not been directed to counter these cyber operations and that he needed approval from the White The White House, unbelievably, hasn't authorized him to act.  Until the Trump administration starts cracking down on Russia, Vladimir Putin is going to continue to get away with his cyber attacks on our elections and all of his other cyber attacks on our country. Admiral Rogers also told the committee that Russia has not paid a sufficient enough price for what it has done to us to get it to change its behavior.  This is the kind of thing--defending the Nation--for which our cyber forces were created. This Senator is the ranking member of the Cybersecurity Subcommittee of the Armed Services I can tell you that our cyber forces are growing, and they are getting better and better, but they are only good if they are put to work and given the task of defending us.

James Mattis,     Secretary of Defense,     Washington,       Dear Secretary Mattis: The Government of Russia, at      President Vladimir Putin's direction, conducted an extensive      campaign to influence our elections in 2016. The Russian      campaign--a mix of covert intelligence operations,      disinformation, and propaganda spread through traditional and      social media--represents a serious and unprecedented attack      on American democracy.       While the Obama Administration imposed targeted sanctions      on Russia in response to the attack, just last week, the      Trump Administration elected not to impose further sanctions.      Yet, Russia's influence activities continue in the United      States and elsewhere, according to the Director of the      Central Intelligence As the 2018 midterm elections      are now only months away, there is no time to lose in      countering Russian influence through multiple means.       Because Russian influence is conducted largely through      cyberspace, National Mission Teams (NMTs), part of the U.     Cyber Command's Cyber Mission Force, should be ordered to      prepare to engage Russian cyber operators and disrupt their      activities as they conduct clandestine influence operations      against our forthcoming elections. The mission of these      forces is to defend the Nation, including critical      infrastructure like our election systems, from foreign attack      and we urge the Department of Defense to consider employing      them as soon as possible.       Additionally, we urge you to implement the recommendations      of the Department's own Defense Science Board's Task Force on      Cyber The Task Force's report outlined a strategy      to deter further Russian attacks on our democracy by      threatening those things that our adversaries hold most dear      through tailored campaigns of both cyber and information      operations. To my knowledge, the Department has yet to      implement these critical recommendations.       Defending our democracy must rank among the most important      responsibilities of our government, including our military      cyber forces. We are grateful for your continued service to      the country and appreciate your prompt attention to this most      pressing threat.

I also thank Mr.Bishop, all the members of the committee, and the staff, of course, for the wonderful work they have done on this.  Mr.Speaker, I rise here to join in support of H.1350.  Basically, as was explained by Mr.Curtis, the bill authorizes a land transfer between the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service, a move that would greatly improve the overall land management and efficiency within the Voyageurs National Park in my district in northern I might add, we are very proud of that accomplishment.  Specifically, the bill permits the transfer of 49 acres of land within the park from the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management to the National Park Service, as was originally intended by the original legislation for the park when it was signed into law; but, for a variety of reasons, these 49 acres, including 61 separate tracts of land, were not included in the original Federal legislation that established the park in 1975.[[Page H1521]]  It may interest some of my colleagues to know that I was here in 1975 and was able to, of course, register my support for the establishment of that park.  Now, to be clear, the National Park Service administration already manages the 49 acres; but without a change in the law that permanently transfers the lands, a cumbersome and duplicative renewal process is required every 20 years. The procedure involves a notice, a publication in the Federal Register, and a review of comments, all of which are, essentially, a waste of taxpayers' money and everybody's time within the government who has to deal with it.  So make no mistake about it, as Mr.Curtis pointed out, this bill saves the taxpayers' money and the bureaucracy time.  In addition, the bill would also authorize the National Park Service to acquire and integrate new land into Voyageurs National Park through land exchanges with the State and local governments that own land within or adjacent to the park's boundaries.  In short, Mr.Speaker, this bill would eliminate any future concerns related to the Department of the Interior's ownership and jurisdiction, facilitating the ease of management for the National Park Service, the State, and the county; and it would do so at no cost, in addition, of course, to saving money for the Federal Government as determined by the Congressional Budget  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to adopt the measure.

336,topic-id,1990,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong opposition to H.5247, the Right to Try Act of 2018.  This legislation, introduced only last week, is an egregious attempt, in my opinion, by the Goldwater Institute to undermine the gold standard drug approval process at the Food and Drug  The supporters of this bill claim to be helping desperate patients who are looking for hope.  If this is such a patient-centered bill, then why does every major patient organization overwhelmingly oppose it?  More than 100 patient organizations, including the National Organization for Rare Disorders, the Friends of Cancer Research, and the American Cancer Society have all written in opposition to this legislation.  In a letter to congressional leadership, these 103 patient organizations noted ``that the alternative pathway in the latest version of this legislation is still less safe for our patients than the current expanded access process under the FDA.''  It is not only the patient organizations that are voicing concerns. Four former FDA Commissioners--Hamburg and Califf, who served under the Obama administration; and McClellan and Andrew von Eschenbach, who served under the Bush administration--also oppose this legislation. That is two former Republican Commissioners and two former Democratic Commissioners who are opposed to both the House bill and the Senate bill on this same issue.  These four Commissioners explained their opposition by saying: ``There is no evidence that either bill would meaningfully improve access for patients, but both would remove the FDA from the process and create a dangerous precedent that would erode protections for vulnerable patients.''  Mr.Speaker, I think most importantly, I would stress that this legislation is simply not needed. There is already a successful program in place today at the FDA in which seriously ill patients and their doctors can request access to an experimental treatment from a manufacturer. This application process, which takes as little as 45 minutes for a physician to complete, has been overwhelmingly successful.  Last summer, a review by the Government Accountability Office found that the FDA approves 99 percent of the requests submitted to the agency. In fact, of the nearly 1,700 requests the FDA received last year, only 9 were not approved.  Physicians and patients also receive approval quickly. Emergency requests are often granted immediately over the phone and, on average, receive a response within 4 days.  While the FDA approves 99 percent of the treatments it reviews through this expanded access process, as it is called, it also adjusts applications for 11 percent of the patients to improve patient safety protections.  In order to protect patients, this review, in my opinion, should continue. We must protect patients from bad actors or from dangerous treatments that might make their lives worse. Just imagine the health consequences to patients if these 11 percent of applicants had not been adjusted.  This is the very reason that the FDA must be involved in the process. If you eliminate FDA review, as this bill does, you are putting patients at risk.  I want to talk a little bit about the fact that many States now have right-to-try statutes. I fear that some Members--and I heard this last week when the bill was on the suspension list--might support this legislation under the false belief that the State right-to-try laws in their States have provided help to patients. But nothing could be further from the truth.  One example supporters of this legislation like to bring up is Delpassand from Texas, who claims to have treated patients under the State right to try.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from Mr.Andrew McFadyen of The Isaac Foundation, who dispels this myth.                                         The Isaac Foundation,                                                   March 20, 2018.     Greg Walden, Chair,     Frank Pallone, Ranking Member,     Energy & Commerce       Dear Mr.Pallone and Mr.Walden: I am writing to you      regarding your upcoming debate on HR 5247, the Right to Try      initiative fronted by the Goldwater I am the      Executive Director of The Isaac Foundation, an organization      that is dedicated to providing advocacy and support to      patients dealing with a wide range of disorders and needing      access to rare disease treatments. Our work pushes      international boundaries, with the bulk of our efforts taking      place in Canada and the United I am also a member of      the NYU Working Group on Compassionate Use and Pre-Approval      Access where we are making a concerted effort to improve and      address the issues around access to experimental medications,      and I'm involved with a non-profit called       I'm proud to say at The Isaac Foundation that we've never      been unsuccessful gaining access to life-saving medications      and treatments for patients in Canada, and our work directly      with pharmaceutical companies is helping countless patients      see similar results in the United We have had success      by being collaborative partners with industry, regulatory      authorities, and patients in need.       I watched the discussion last week with growing      consternation that many of our elected officials have not      taken the opportunity to fact-check claims being made by RTT      proponents. Most notably, continued mention of Right to Try      being used by Dr.[[Page H1741]]     Delpassand out of Texas is both egregiously wrong and,      indeed, is the perfect example of why RTT should not be      passed by lawmakers.       In October 2016, I testified during Senator Ron Johnson's      hearing on Right to Try, at which Johnson introduced and      played a video created by the Goldwater Institute of      During that 3-minute video, Delpassand      explained that he was using the state RTT law to treat his      patients because the FDA would not allow him to do it through      an Expanded Access Senator Johnson asked me what I      thought about this video--which included few facts, no      context, and was edited by the people fronting the RTT push      themselves. I explained that there must be a reason why      Delpassand was in the 1% of cases not allowed by the FDA and      vowed I would investigate.       In March of 2017, I received a set of documents from the      FDA under a FOIA request. They show that Delpassand's      clinic failed inspections during the clinical trial of      Lutathera (lutetium Lu 177 dotatate). Specifically, he failed      inspection due to 3 key and very important reasons:       1. Enrolling subjects into the study during a partial      clinical hold, issued by the       2. Underreporting of Adverse       3. 1572-protocol noncompliance.       The failed inspections were discovered after complaint from      the CDER Good Clinical Practice Compliance Oversight Branch,      Division of Good Clinical Practice Compliance Evaluation,      Office of Scientific Investigations (OSI). A ``Clinical      Hold'' was placed on the lab and During a      clinical hold, subjects may not be given an investigational      drug. Delpassand and his clinic disregarded this clinical      hold and enrolled 6 patients.       Additionally, and just as concerning in terms of patient      safety, Delpassand's clinic failed to promptly report      significant new adverse events or risks to the This      failure to report was noted numerous times during the      inspection. The inspection also found numerous other areas of      concern. I have attached the full report for your      consideration.       After these inspections, the FDA would not allow      Delpassand to open an EAP at his clinic for patients in need,      and rightly so. They FDA did, however, allow 42 different      locations the ability to provide this drug for patients      requiring access, including two sites in A quick      search on ClinicialTrials.gov shows this information, further      proving that the FDA has been able to provide patients the      required access they need, ensuring the environment that they      are receiving the drug they need is safe.       My understanding of the situation is that the company      running the clinical trial distanced themselves from      Delpassand after these failed inspections. Without company      support, and without the FDA's permission to open an EAP,      Delpassand had to use the state legislation to provide drug      to his patients. Questions remain, however, such as how      Delpassand paid for the product he was giving his patients,      did patients themselves have to pay for that drug supply      (which isn't allowed under the Texas RTT law) and who, if      anyone, was overseeing the program to ensure safety of the      patients, especially after multiple infractions were seen      during the failed FDA inspection.       Most important, it should be noted that the FDA process      here worked exactly how it is supposed to. A lab was      inspected for safety to ensure patients are looked after in      the appropriate fashion. That inspection placed a hold on      further treating of patients due to numerous infractions. The      FDA worked with the company to ensure access for patients      across the USA in 42 different sites, helping to monitor      adverse events while also allowing the product to advance to      approval. That product was approved by the FDA in January      2018.       Also importantly, RTT was used because it was the only way      for Delpassand to treat patients in his clinic after it      failed inspection. RTT is a loophole designed to allow people      who cannot otherwise follow safety rules set forth by the FDA      that are meant to protect vulnerable patients. It's not being      used--anywhere--to provide patients with hope or access to      life-saving drugs.       One final note, and one that I've not see mentioned      anywhere. HR 5247 includes the name of a young child--a brave      child battling Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy--named Jordan      Jordan has been photographed numerous times with Vice      President Pence, and is often used as an example of why Right      to Try is needed. The problem with these optics is that      Jordan has never received any treatment under Right to Try,      even though Right to Try has been available in his state of      Indiana for 3 years. He already has access to the life-saving      treatment he needs--through an FDA approved clinical trial.      He's doing well on that trial drug, as I understand it, and      receives all the benefits of FDA oversite to ensure his      safety on that trial. In essence, the child used to promote      RTT is the perfect example of why the FDA process works and      is needed.       The true reality is that the landscape for access to      medications for dying patients does not change tomorrow if a      Federal Right to Try law is passed today. Very clearly, those      patients in dire need of help today will wake up tomorrow      needing access to the same life-saving treatments, and feel      the same despair because they will not be getting the access      they need through Right to       The barrier to that access here isn't the FDA, and no Right      to Try law enacted by lawmakers in this country is going to      remove the true barrier--pharmaceutical companies. The      gatekeepers to these medications are the pharmaceutical      companies themselves, and we need to be working      collaboratively as a team--Industry, Government, physicians,      and Patients--to craft solutions that will work for everyone,      keeping in mind that we are all on the same side, that we all      want the same thing--broad and expeditious access to life-     saving medications for patients in need.       I understand how difficult this is for patients--I see it      every day, and I feel it every night as I check in on my son      (who is battling his own devastating and very rare disease)      to make sure he is still breathing, to make sure he is still      with us. But I also understand that the change we all need      will not come with Right to It will come through      collaboration with all stakeholders and by providing      companies the safety and assurances they need to make their      medications available to our dying patients.       Lawmakers should be spending their time helping make that      collaboration happen because that is how we are going to save      our dying patients. They should not spin their wheels passing      legislation like Right to Try that looks good, and feels      good, but will do nothing for those in need. If they do, they      are doing a disservice to a large and very vulnerable group      of patients now and in the future, my own son, my own hero      Isaac, included.

337,topic-id,159,"Andrew McFadyen said:       Delpassand claims to have used right to try because FDA      would not allow him to do expanded access. And this was for a      very good reason. FDA placed a clinical hold on a study, due      to the fact that his clinic was not reporting serious,      adverse events, as required; and he continued to enroll      patients, despite the clinic hold.       The work of Delpassand's study was associated with 40      deaths and 2 hospitalizations. FDA's clinical hold on      Delpassand's work is a sign to me that FDA's expanded access      pathway was working to prevent bad actors from continuing to      expose vulnerable patients to experimental treatments.  Mr.Speaker, H.5247 is dangerous for our patients. It is an unprecedented attempt to roll back the FDA's oversight of investigational treatments.

349,topic-id,391,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I want to explain some other reasons why I am very opposed to this bill. I am concerned that H.5247 essentially does nothing to address what may be the true barrier to expanded access, and that is the determination by the manufacturer as to whether or not they will provide access to their product that is under development. And I want to stress, there is nothing in this legislation before us today that would compel a manufacturer to grant access upon request.  Further, I believe that trusted manufacturers like J&J, or Johnson & Johnson, which is headquartered in my district, have already said that any compassionate use request must be subject to FDA review. Now, I have heard my colleagues refer to this as a Hail Mary pass for the terminally ill. I think, in reality, it is offering false hope of a cure to patients and their families when there is no guarantee that any patient will receive access to treatment from a manufacturer.  In fact, H.5247 sets an extremely low threshold for the types of experimental treatments that may be available through this alternative pathway by allowing patients access to investigational treatments that have only completed a phase 1 clinical trial. Patients will be exposed to treatments with no or relatively little data that they are actually effective. These extremely small trials only examine the safety and toxicity of a drug and do not determine the effectiveness or potential side effects. Access at this phase 1 stage in the development could expose patients to untested products and further harm and result in delaying access to a treatment that may be more appropriate and more beneficial for their underlying disease or condition.  Only 1 in 10 products move on from phase 1 clinical trials to FDA approval. Mr.Speaker, the bill does not make any adverse-event reporting to the FDA immediate. It also limits FDA's ability to use clinical outcomes associated with the use of an investigational product when reviewing a product for approval if it could adversely impact its review. It also prevents any entity from being held liable for use of the treatment.  Again, these are some of the many reasons that more than 100 organizations oppose this dangerous bill.

355,topic-id,292,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, there has been a lot of misinformation spread by supporters of this legislation that FDA is a barrier to patients receiving access to these investigational treatments, and I want to be very clear that that is simply not the case.  FDA's expanded access program approves nearly all requests for investigational drugs or biologics it receives. For the past 5 years, FDA's approval rate for expanded access requests has been over 99 percent. In fiscal year 2017, as I previously mentioned, only nine individual requests were denied.  FDA also conducts its review quickly. FDA physicians are available 24 hours a day to approve any emergency expanded access requests the agency receives, typically granting emergency requests immediately, over the phone, and nonemergency requests in a median time of 4 days and, generally, no longer than 30 days.  FDA has also taken actions to streamline the expanded access request process for physicians to make it less burdensome. I think that was mentioned by Mr.Walden, the chairman.  Pharmaceutical companies can choose to deny a patient access to an experimental treatment because, for example, there is not enough of the drug available or they are concerned about dangerous side effects. The fact is, when a patient is denied access to an experimental treatment, it is because the company has said no, not the  So let's be clear as to what this legislation is.

358,topic-id,225,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I said before that I have found that some Members were looking to vote for this bill because they said: Well, we have the right to try in our State by State statute, so what is the difference if we do it on the Federal level?  I just want to stress again that the State right-to-try laws do not give patients a right to try effectively and have done little to expand access to investigational treatments.  There are 37 States and the District of Columbia that have enacted right-to-try laws, and there is no evidence that anyone has obtained an investigational treatment via these laws that couldn't have been obtained through FDA's expanded access program.  Right-to-try laws do not compel companies to provide patients access to investigational treatments; therefore, under these State laws, patients still do not have a right to try, only the[[Page H1746]]right to request the treatment from the company.  State right-to-try laws do not address the fundamental barriers of cost and company restrictions. Neither the FDA nor States require insurers or pharmaceutical companies to cover the cost or reduce the costs of these often expensive treatments. Instead, these laws put patients at higher risk by prohibiting or weakening FDA's oversight of investigational treatments.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

362,topic-id,477,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I just want to stress that, as I said before, we have the four previous FDA Commissioners, two Democrats and two Republicans appointed by President Bush, who have raised serious concerns about this legislation because it excludes FDA review and they think could pose serious risks to vulnerable patients.  I just wanted to read, once again, a statement that they made jointly to The Washington Post, where they said: ``There is no evidence that either bill would meaningfully improve access for patients, but both would remove the FDA from the process and create a dangerous precedent that would erode protections for vulnerable patients.''  Mr.Speaker, I just want to stress to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that my concern is that no one is actually going to be able to get an experimental drug by this bill. In other words, if you are a manufacturer that actually has done something and come up with an experimental drug that you believe will make a difference to someone who is terminally ill, you are likely going to want to go through the FDA expanded access process because then there is a seal of approval that the FDA has actually looked at this and said that it is relatively safe to use.  So my real fear is that the only thing this is going to do is open up to the possibility of some charlatan, fly-by-night snake oil drug company or manufacturer who is going to make all kinds of claims that have not been reviewed by the FDA for any kind of safety, and that then people may say: Well, I will take that because I am terminally ill and I might as well try something.  But that isn't really what we should be doing here. We should be providing a process, as the FDA does right now, where, if someone is terminally ill and they want to try something, they at least have some certification of approval by the FDA that this is something that may help them, that may make a difference, and that, in the case of about 11 percent of the cases where the application is made to the FDA, some changes are made to make sure that even though there is a certain level of risk, that that level of risk is reduced by the FDA putting on additional safety precautions.  So my real concern here is I don't want people to vote for this legislation thinking that somehow it is going to make a difference. I really don't believe that is true. Otherwise, I wouldn't urge the opposition that I am. But for all these reasons, I do urge strong opposition to this bill and ask that my colleagues vote ``no.''

366,topic-id,740,"Mr.Speaker, this is an amendment to the bill, or the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. And this amendment would offer a more targeted approach to improving the FDA's current expanded access program.  In October, the Energy and Commerce Committee held a hearing on the widely opposed Senate right-to-try legislation. At that hearing, we heard concerns from FDA Commissioner Gottlieb and also from manufacturers, academic experts, and patient groups that 204 was legislation that would expose broad numbers of patients to harm, and sought to hamstrung the FDA's ability to oversee or engage in any meaningful way on the use of investigational treatments.  Since that time, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have drafted new legislation that maintains, in my opinion, the same harmful approach prohibiting FDA review of experimental treatments. The FDA is part of the process for a reason. It protects patients from potentially bad actors or from experimental treatments that might do more harm than good.  So my motion to recommit, Mr.Speaker, abandons this harmful attempt to undermine the FDA's expanded access pathway and, instead, seeks to make two improvements that have been identified as meaningful by both manufacturers and patient groups.  This proposal will also not be any surprise to Chairman Walden or Chairman Burgess because it was the bipartisan proposal our staffs were negotiating prior to the introduction of the current Republican bill.  So I want to stress that, unlike the current bill, H.5247, this proposal is not based on the false premise that FDA approval is a barrier to accessing investigational treatments. Rather, it addresses the two key problems identified by expert witnesses at our hearing: how the FDA will utilize clinical outcomes of investigational treatments and liability protection.  To that end, under this motion to recommit, the FDA is directed to issue guidance to manufacturers specifically on how and when the FDA will consider clinical outcomes, and when a sponsor may request the consideration of such outcomes when it comes time to submit an application for approval for the investigational treatment.  This will provide manufacturers with the clarity they are seeking regarding[[Page H1748]]how allowing patients access to drugs that are still under development may impact their ability to gain full FDA approval. It will also ensure that there is a public process for such guidance, ensuring that stakeholders will have the opportunity to offer their views on this issue.  Mr.Speaker, the motion to recommit also provides liability protection to manufacturers, physicians, clinical investigators, and hospitals, if they are in compliance with the current law and regulations for expanded access. If you are a manufacturer, a physician, or a hospital that is in compliance with current rules and requirements related to expanded access, you will receive protection for allowing access to the investigational treatment.  Finally, it also provides transparency around the number of expanded access requests the FDA receives and grants, how many requests a manufacturer receives and grants, and if there are any serious adverse events. This transparency, I believe, will provide clear data as to how many patients are making expanded access requests and how often these requests are granted or denied by the FDA and manufacturers.  Mr.Speaker, I believe that these legislative fixes will go a long way to bolstering the existing successful expanded access pathway, while maintaining the critical review and oversight of the agency charged with protecting our public health, that being the  I just want to say that, last fall, FDA Commissioner Gottlieb testified on right-to-try efforts and told our committee: ``There is a perception that certain products that aren't being offered under FDA expanded access will be offered under right-to-try, and I don't see that.''  That is our current Commissioner Gottlieb, who I respect a great deal.  Rather than creating an unnecessary alternative pathway that threatens our drug approval process and our clinical trial program, I would urge my colleagues to join with Democrats and 103 patient organizations in supporting the current expanded access program.  These targeted improvements under the motion to recommit to the existing program are, I think, a way to achieve a better goal. So I urge my colleagues to support my motion to recommit and oppose this, what I consider, dangerous Republican proposal in the bill before us.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

882,topic-id,653,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.1119, the ``Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving the Environment Act''.  The SENSE Act continues yesterday's latest effort by Republicans to undermine the commonsense protections found in the Clean Air Act in order to give special breaks to polluters at the expense of public health. The winner of today's Republican special breaks are power plants that burn waste coal.  The SENSE Act would give power plants that burn waste coal for energy a free pass on critical public health protections that keep dangerous toxins out of the air.  It does this by giving waste coal power plants a carve-out from the pollution control requirements of EPA's Mercury and Air Toxic Standards--or MATS This rule represents the first national standards to address power plant emissions of toxic air pollutants like mercury, arsenic, dioxin, sulfur dioxide and hydrochloric acid.  The SENSE Act provides a weaker compliance option for MATS that would give waste coal facilities license to pollute more than they should. And, the bill would lock in this weaker standard for the foreseeable future.  That means a small number of waste coal units would be allowed to avoid controlling harmful pollution in perpetuity, regardless of any subsequent developments in control technologies, or new information on the health effects of their pollution. Passing this bill means waste coal power plants would never have to clean up their act, putting the health and safety of those nearby and downwind in jeopardy.  So, why are we even discussing such a ridiculous sweetheart deal? Because the waste coal industry says they need, and deserve, a legislative earmark, just for using the coal that wasn't good enough to burn in other power plants.  But that claim doesn't pass the smell test.  EPA determined, and the D.Circuit Court agreed, that since emissions from waste coal units are no different than emissions from other coal-fired power plants, there is no justification for special treatment. Many of the waste coal plants already meet the requirements of the MATS rule, because in reality, waste coal plants are among the best performing coal-fired power plants in the country.  I see no justification for giving waste coal plants the ability to pollute more than other facilities, as the SENSE act would allow.  These special breaks are especially offensive to me since I represent a down-wind state. Pollution generated west of New Jersey moves into our air shed threatening the public health and welfare of my constituents. It also increases the burden on New Jersey businesses that would ultimately be required to do[[Page H1487]]more and spend more to compensate for the extra pollution generated by these plants.  The Republicans claim that EPA is over-regulating business. But, time and again, the courts have found that EPA is actually failing to regulate pollutants known to cause harm. This Mercury and Air Toxics rule has been in development and litigation for nearly 20 years--the time it takes for a child to reach adulthood. That's more than enough delay, enough mercury, and enough toxic air pollution. It's time to clean it up.  Republican-led attacks on clean air protections will not create jobs, nor will they magically build infrastructure. All a Yes vote on this dirty air bill will do is boost profits for Republican allies, and make it easier for corporate polluters to contaminate the air in our neighborhoods. Meanwhile our children's health is threatened and their future is sold out, all in the name of more corporate profits.

1765,topic-id,720,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I also rise in support of H.4986, the RAY BAUM'S This bill is the product of extensive bipartisan collaboration. After exhaustive negotiations, we were able to reach a deal that includes bills introduced by Democrats and Republicans in both the House and in the That does not happen often, and I would like to thank my colleagues for working with me so closely.  This bill is a real tribute to its namesake, Ray Ray had a passion for telecommunications policy and a special place in his heart for broadcasting. Ray was also an eternal optimist. He never faltered in his belief that we could find a way to work together to find a solution, and he was right.  We were able to incorporate proposals from Members on both sides of the aisle, just the way Ray would have liked it, and we were able to produce this legislation that will reauthorize the FCC for the first time in 28 years.  Mr.Speaker, I would like to briefly mention some aspects of this bill that I am most proud of. First, we were able to include the SANDy Act, which is named to honor those affected by Superstorm Sandy, a storm that ripped through the Northeast, including my district, over 5 years ago. During that[[Page H1410]]superstorm, we saw firsthand how important communications were for survival. From television and radio broadcasters to wireless providers and cable networks, each played its own role in making sure people knew how to find help, look for loved ones, and stay out of harm's way.                              {time}  1445  I used the lessons we learned from Sandy in writing this legislation. When this bill is signed into law, our networks will be stronger, more resilient, and more capable to serve in an emergency.  This FCC reauthorization bill also includes the Viewer Protection I introduced the Viewer Protection Act to make sure no viewer loses signal as a result of the FCC's incentive auction. Access to local information has become even more important as the number of natural disasters has increased over the past few years.  Not only does this bill help ensure consumers' broadcast stations don't go dark, as part of this bipartisan, bicameral deal, we have agreed to provide $50 million in funding to help educate consumers about the transition. This funding is critical to make sure that people have access to information about how to get their televisions to work.  My colleagues will discuss other important aspects of this deal. But before they do, I would like to point out two important provisions that we included as part of the reauthorization. First, we included a provision that makes the FCC's inspector general independent of the Commission's chairman. The IG is currently conducting a number of critical investigations, including one into whether the chairman of the agency has been improperly favoring Sinclair Broadcast But under current law, these investigations are being conducted under a cloud--the very chairman who is under investigation can obstruct the review by firing the inspector general or his or her staff at any time. So by passing this bill, we are ensuring that these important investigations can conclude without any interference.  Finally, I do not normally support unnecessarily cutting the budget of our agencies. But in this case, I would like to thank my colleagues for agreeing to limit this cut to the length of this administration. The current leadership of the FCC, in my opinion, has proven that it cannot be trusted to serve the public interest. Most notably, the agency has ignored its statutory duty and the call of the American people by destroying our net neutrality protections. Net neutrality safeguards our American values by empowering small businesses, creating new jobs, and ensuring free speech online.  By limiting the resources that we provide for the next 3 years, this reauthorization will limit this Commission's power, in my opinion, to do more harm.  For these reasons and many more, I urge my colleagues to support the bipartisan and bicameral agreement embodied by the RAY BAUM'S  I would like to also thank the Democratic committee staff--David Goldman, Gerald Leverich, and Dan Miller--for all of their hard work in getting this bill to the floor today.

On the other hand, I am very proud that this bill includes a bipartisan provision that Congressman Kinzinger and I worked on.  This provision will move us forward in closing the digital divide for our Nation's veterans. Access to broadband internet service is critical for the more than 20 million veterans across our country, with the highest population of veterans residing in  Having a broadband internet connection helps veterans apply for jobs more easily, obtain necessary vocational training, communicate with family and friends, keep up with current events, access healthcare services, and get important information about their benefits and military records.  Without broadband internet access, it is difficult to fully participate in today's society. Veterans face many challenges when they return home, and not having internet access makes what is already an incredibly tough transition process even harder. This is particularly likely to be the case for low-income veterans and veterans living in rural areas.  Although we lack specific data on the number of veterans with broadband internet access, we know that Americans who live in rural areas are less likely to be connected. This is also the case for Americans who live at or below the Federal poverty level.  We must find ways to ensure that veterans, especially the more than 1.4 million veterans living below the Federal poverty level and the 5.3 million residing in rural areas, are not left behind.  This is why my provision directs the Federal Communications Commission to examine the current state of broadband access for veterans and what can be done to increase access, with a focus on low-income veterans and veterans residing in rural areas.  The findings and recommendations from this report will be important for paving the way to get more veterans connected. I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill.

1828,topic-id,798,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.1917, the so-called ``Blocking Regulatory Interference from Closing Kilns Act of 2017.''  This is the first in a series of dirty air proposals on the floor this week. The BRICK Act is part of the ongoing effort by Republicans to undermine the commonsense protections found in the Clean Air Act, in order to give special breaks to polluters at the expense of public health.  We have seen this bill before. Last Congress we debated and voted on the BRICK Act: I opposed it then, and I oppose it now. Frankly, I have even more concerns with this legislation than I did in 2016.  That is because the BRICK Act was amended by the Rules Committee to include two separate attacks on clean air safeguards. Like previous versions, this version before us today would indefinitely delay standards to reduce toxic air pollution from brick and clay manufacturers. However, it now also incorporates a separate bill that would delay long-overdue pollution standards for new wood fired heaters. The only thing these bills really have in common is that they both undermine Clean Air Act protections and endanger the health of our children.  Regarding the treatment of brick and clay manufacturing facilities, the bill automatically delays implementation of EPA's final Brick and Clay rule by extending all deadlines . . . by however long it takes to complete all possible litigation. This blanket extension would be given to all facilities covered by the final rule, without regard for the merits of the legal challenges or their final outcome.  But that is not Congress' job. The courts already have the ability to issue a ``stay'' of any compliance dates in a final rule. Delaying a rule for legitimate reasons does not require action by Congress, but a legislative quick fix is the only remedy the proponents of this bill appear to care about.  By throwing out the existing judicial process, Republicans are giving polluters an incentive to ``run the clock'' on frivolous litigation, to put off ever controlling their pollution.  This is especially problematic because Administrator Pruitt has announced plans to reconsider the Brick and Clay rule, which is expected to be finalized in 2019. At that point, the pollution control standards for brick and clay facilities will be almost two decades overdue, and this bill would delay those protections even longer.  The new wood heater provision is not much better. The bill delays EPA's pollution standards for new wood-fueled heaters that have not been updated in nearly 30 years. The final rule included a gradual, five-year phase in to allow manufacturers time to adapt and develop cleaner and more efficient technologies, and the phase 2 requirements don't kick in until 2020.  These newer appliances are a win for consumers. The 2020-compliant products are both cleaner and more efficient, generating more heat per unit of wood burned and making them less expensive to operate.  But, with this provision, Republicans are picking winners and losers. They are rewarding companies that refused to clean up their dirty and inefficient products, while punishing innovative companies that invested in developing cleaner and more efficient technologies for wood heaters.  Ultimately, the BRICK Act is really more about transferring burdens than relieving them. This so-called ``relief'' from regulation comes at the expense of our children's health. Moreover, it doesn't reduce costs; it merely transfers them from favored businesses to the general public who will pay for more doctor visits and lost work or school days as a result.  My Republican colleagues repeatedly claim they support clean air, and yet, they continually put forward bill after bill designed to delay, weaken, or repeal safeguards that protect public health by cleaning up the air. Passing this bill allows dirty products to remain in operation for decades into the future, resulting in tons of additional pollution, and putting the health of our children and future generations at risk.  Exempting businesses from clean air rules leads to more air pollution. It is that simple. We all want small businesses to thrive, and the history of the Clean Air Act demonstrates clearly that we can grow the economy while cleaning up the air and improving public health.  Congress should not be selling out the health and safety of American children. But that is just what a YES vote on the BRICK Act would do.[[Page H1464]]  I urge all my colleagues to join me in opposing this dirty air bill.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

1946,topic-id,885,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise today in strong opposition to H.5247, or the Right to Try Act of[[Page H1523]]2018. Supporters of this legislation, Mr.Speaker, have claimed that it will provide seriously ill patients, who have exhausted all of their available treatment options, access to experimental therapies free from the barriers of FDA oversight.  While it is understandable that someone suffering from a disease who has no more options would want to try anything that could help them fight their disease, this legislation delivers the false hope to patients and their families that they will receive a cure to their underlying disease or condition.  In fact, this legislation provides patients and their families nothing more than the right to ask a manufacturer for access to early stage, unproven treatments. Like other so-called right-to-try proposals, H.5247 is based on the false premise that patients are not receiving access to the investigational treatments as a result of the Food and Drug Administration, and this simply not the case.  Through the FDA's existing expanded access program, seriously ill patients are able to request access to investigational products. The FDA approves 99 percent of all requests for investigational drugs or biologics that it receives through this program.  Last year, FDA received more than 1,500 requests, and only 9 were not approved. Despite this high-approval rate, supporters of right-to-try laws have argued that the process is too slow and burdensome, but I have not seen evidence that this is the case, Mr.In fact, FDA often grants emergency requests for expanded access immediately over the phone, and nonemergency requests are processed in an average of 4 days.  FDA has even made improvements to streamline the process. For example, FDA has revised the application for physicians to ensure that it now takes less than an hour to complete. FDA has also released additional guidance to industry, outlining the expanded access program's requirements and addressing common questions related to the different programs and submission process, and how outcomes will be considered as part of the review process.  Last fall, FDA Commissioner Gottlieb testified on right-to-try efforts and told our committee that: ``There is a perception that certain products that aren't being offered under FDA expanded access . . . will be offered under right-to-try. I don't see that,'' the commissioner said. As I have said, the review process is working well, but this legislation would completely take FDA out of the review process. This is dangerous and could put patients at serious risk.  FDA is part of the process for a reason. It protects patients from potentially bad actors or from experimental treatments that might do more harm than good. While FDA approves 99 percent of the treatments it reviews, it also revises applications for 11 percent of patients to improve patient safety protections.  In order to protect patients, this review should continue. We must protect patients from bad actors or from dangerous treatments that would make their lives worse. I am extremely concerned that the legislation we are considering today is advancing a solution to address barriers to investigational treatments that do not exist and could expose seriously ill patients to greater harm instead of the greater access that they are looking for.  The true barrier to any expanded access is the determination by the manufacturer as to whether or not they will provide access to their products that are under development. But nothing in the legislation before us today would compel a manufacturer to grant access upon request.  Further, H.5247 would allow patients access to investigational treatments that have only completed a phase I clinical trial. That is an extremely small trial. It does not determine the effectiveness, or the potential side effects of a drug. Access at this stage in the development could expose patients to untested products, further harm, and result in delaying access to a treatment that may be more appropriate and more beneficial for their underlying disease or condition.  H.5247 also erodes important patient safeguards. It limits FDA's ability to use clinical outcomes associated with the use of an investigational product when reviewing a product for approval if it could adversely impact its review. It also prevents any entity from being held liable for use of the treatment.  And while I appreciate, Mr.Speaker, the intent of this bill, I can't support it. The last thing I want to do is give patients false hope and to potentially put them at risk by completely removing FDA from the review and approval process.  Finally, Mr.Speaker, it is outrageous, in my opinion, that a bill of this magnitude is being considered under a suspension of the rule. As my Republican colleagues well know, bills considered under suspension are traditionally bipartisan bills that have worked their way through the appropriate committees with overwhelming bipartisan support.  This bill was never considered by the Energy and Commerce In fact, it was only introduced today. A bill with such critical patient safety implications should not be considered in this fashion. So I urge my colleagues to oppose this misguided legislation and stand with the more than 100 organizations that have come forward expressing their concern for patients and the unnecessary risk this legislation could expose our Nation's most vulnerable to.

Mr.Speaker, as I have said, I have great concerns that H.5247 would expose our most vulnerable and desperate patients to unnecessary risk.  Supporters of this legislation have argued that those patients who are suffering from a terminal illness deserve the right to take their health and treatment into their own hands, as they are faced without any other treatment options. Some have even asked: What risk could be worse than the risk of death?  As Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist from NYU, has pointed out: ``There are things worse than death; being made to die faster, being made to die more miserably.''  These are all very real scenarios that patients could be exposed to under the misleading and ill-conceived right-to-try pathway.  As I stated before, while the FDA approved 99 percent of the requests it received, of those, they revised 11 percent in order to protect patients. If this bill becomes law, the FDA no longer will have the opportunity to make those revisions and to protect vulnerable patients.  We must protect patients from bad actors or from dangerous treatments that might make their lives worse. That is why more than 100 organizations have written in opposition to this legislation, including 83 patient organizations like the National Organization for Rare Disorders, the Friends of Cancer Research, the American Cancer Society, Cancer Action  In a letter to the Speaker and the Democratic leader, the patient organizations noted that ``the alternative pathway in the latest version of the legislation is still less safe for our patients than the current expanded access process'' that the FDA uses.  Ellen Sigal, the chair and founder of Friends of Cancer Research, said: ``In its current form, the proposed legislation does nothing for patients other than provide false hope by allowing them to request a drug with no evidence of efficacy they may never receive and, should they receive it, may do more harm than good.''  So I think we should all be concerned about protecting patients. Rather than rushing this bill through today, I would urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation and to come back to the table to find a solution that will streamline Expanded Access Programs while protecting patients from unnecessary harm.

Mr.Speaker, there are a lot of reasons to oppose this bill today, and I have given a number of them, but the primary reason being the need to continue protecting patients by ensuring that the FDA remains a part of the process.  While we are speaking about process, I have to also oppose this legislation based on the inappropriate way the Republican majority is bringing this bill to the floor. Bills considered under suspension have traditionally gone through the committee process with overwhelming bipartisan support, and neither of those things is the case with this bill.

1968,topic-id,322,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.[[Page H1527]]  Mr.Speaker, I just want to talk about two other aspects of this bill that I haven't so far. One is the fact that States have actually implemented right-to-try laws that have done little to expand access to investigational treatment. Although 17 States and the District of Columbia have enacted right-to-try laws, there is no evidence that anyone has obtained an investigational treatment via these laws that couldn't have been obtained through FDA's expanded access program.  Right-to-try laws do not compel companies to provide patients access to investigational treatments. Therefore, under these State laws, patients still do not have a right to try, only the right to request the treatment from the company. State right-to-try laws do not address the fundamental barriers of cost and accompanying restrictions.  Neither the FDA nor States require insurers or pharmaceutical companies to cover the cost or reduce the cost of these expensive treatments. Instead, these laws put patients at a higher risk by prohibiting or weakening FDA oversight of investigational treatments.  With regard to clinical trials, the legislation could also expose patients to unnecessary risk by allowing access to investigational drugs that have only completed a phase I clinical trial. Phase I trials are extremely small trials, in the range of 20 to 80 patients, and are used primarily to determine toxicity. They do not determine effectiveness or potential side effects. Patients could suffer from harmful side effects or delay enrolling in a clinical trial program for a treatment that actually has evidence of efficacy for their disease or condition.  Finally, the bill would weaken the FDA's ability to oversee the adverse events or other clinical outcomes from the use of investigational drugs and provide broad liability protections for manufacturers, leaving patients with no recourse in the case of an adverse effect.  I just wanted to mention those.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2018-03-13-pt1-PgH1521.txt,887,DACA,2018.0,13.0,March

Excluding the FDA will not benefit      those patients and would be a mistake. There is no need to      create a new potentially dangerous paradigm by passing      this legislation which does not address the real issues at      hand and could have unintended negative consequences,      leading to a possible impediment of the development and      approval of safe and effective therapies.  And then, finally, is the former FDA Principal Deputy Commissioner, Joshua Sharfstein, who said:       FDA review allows doctors and patients to tell the      difference between a medication that works and one that does      not. Evidence also orients the pharmaceutical market towards      developing products that produce meaningful benefits for      patients instead of just hope. Undermining FDA review by      giving a right to patients to try anything at any time will      leave more patients in desperate situations with fewer      options and less understanding of what could really make a      difference.

Minnesota is among the States that have already enacted these credits at the State level.

1219,topic-id,1731,"Mr.President, I thank the Senator and am honored to follow my good friend from North  It took courage for the Senator from North Dakota to be a leader on this issue in committee. The Banking Committee fought hard and long on this issue. I think there were 30 amendments that we discussed and voted on in coming to this bill that we are bringing forward today. The Senator from North Dakota was a shining star in that debate, one that reminded both sides of what was most important--the people back home. The Senator has reminded me today of something that I have come prepared to talk about but that, I think, warrants merit.  The Citizens State Bank was my hometown bank, and it has been bought and sold a few times. My father, who was a schoolteacher and a school superintendent, was actually on that board. It was my first exposure as to how banking worked. I remember going with my dad then, who was a schoolteacher and didn't make a lot of money but who wanted a loan to buy a car. At that time, I was a little older, but this was a 1954 Ford that my dad had been driving. I am not really that old, but it was an old car, and he wanted to buy a new car. I remember sitting off to the side and listening to the conversation.  When you talk about relationship lending, relationship lending could not go very long if that relationship lending didn't lead to a loan that got paid back. I knew the lending officer because he taught me in Sunday school. We saw him every week in church. His children went to the school where my dad was the principal.  This is a different time today--I understand that--but the fact still remains that relationship lending, as the Senator from North Dakota just reminded us, should be at the core of what we consider here when we talk about this being a lending institution, making a transaction with an individual for him to then pay that loan back. That is what we tend to forget sometimes because of the debacle in 2008.  Since Dodd-Frank has become law, over 1,700 banks have been closed. Let me say that again. Since Dodd-Frank has become law, 1,700 banks have been shut down. Most of these are community banks and regional banks--entities that had nothing whatsoever to do with the financial situation in 2008. While some in this body may see that as encouraging signs that Big Government is now getting more control of the lending principal in the banking industry, I think they are misguided. I think they are overlooking the reality that these 1,700 banks aren't the massive big banks or the very few banks that had responsibility in the 2008 financial crisis. These are local banks, credit unions, regional banks--the banks supporting our Main Street, as the Senator from North Dakota just reminded us. They are providing small businesses with capital and sponsoring Little League Baseball games.  I grew up in Little League, as many Senators here did--and in softball leagues and so forth. Right there in center field was The Citizens State Bank sign, for, every year, they were involved in that effort in that community. Yet, for nearly 8 years, those same small town entities have been hammered by Big Government regulations that had been enacted by the[[Page S1355]]Dodd-Frank Credit unions, community banks, regional banks were simply not responsible for the financial crisis of 2008, period. None of the draconian rules put on them make them safer today than they were in 2007. These onerous rules have subjected these small lenders to the same regulation and compliance costs to which the major four or five banks are now being subjected. Overall, it is estimated that compliance costs for community banks have risen by at least 20 percent, but I think it is much higher than that.  I met with a regional bank just this morning from Georgia, and their compliance costs have gone up $400 million because of Dodd-That is money that could be in the community in the form of loans; yet it is now coming in the form of higher compliance costs. Some of those are fines, by the way, coming from the Federal Government up here. That is another topic for another day that we don't address in this bill.  This is eating up those small banks' bottom lines and is discouraging some banks from offering some services to their communities--services that small businesses and Main Street rely on for capital every day as they try to grow. What happens when a bank grows? Lending grows. That means small businesses grow. What happens when small businesses grow? Jobs are created. Compliance costs run diametrically opposite to that dynamic and do not increase or lower the risk.  The CFPB's qualified mortgage rule is a perfect example. This rule has driven many community banks actually out of the mortgage lending business altogether. So, while it was intended to protect the consumer, yes, it protected the consumer all right. It protected him from being able to get a mortgage.  Government restrictions on reciprocal deposits are what is at topic here in this bill. Reciprocal deposits have created uncertainty around this critical lifeline for community banks and especially minority-owned banks that have specialized in serving customers with limited discretionary income and limited access to capital. Dodd-Frank is crippling the ability of community banks and regional banks to serve these communities.  We recently heard from one community bank in Georgia that has not even established a residential mortgage department to serve the community because of these draconian compliance regulations. Why isn't it doing this? It is simply because the Federal Government--the people in this room--decided a few years ago in the Dodd-Frank Act that they knew more about the free enterprise system, the capital formation dynamic, the relationship between a lending entity and a borrowing entity, and how all of that translates into jobs and economic growth. Because of that, we have ended up with this arcane Dodd-Frank rule that overregulates these small regional and community banks.  Look, we are not trying to blow up Dodd-Many of us have taken a big step back in terms of what we think we need to do in terms of growing the economy in order to accommodate this bill. I think there are some 14 cosponsors on the other side of the aisle, and I applaud them for the courage that it has taken to work with us to get to a bill on which we both give and take. In the Senate, the 1 criticism we get back home is: Why can't you guys work together to get anything done? Here is a shining example. If we can get it across the finish line here and get a vote on this, we may have a tremendous example that will have a dramatic impact on Main Street back home.  Small banks tend to spend too much time and resources dealing with the regulation and compliance costs that this Dodd-Frank law has created. Put simply, Dodd-Frank is just another one-size-fits-all, Washington bureaucratic policy that hurts the very people it claims to champion--the middle class and the working poor and those communities that have the least access to capital to borrow. Fortunately, we have an opportunity to do something today to fix these problems.  The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act takes major steps to roll back Dodd-Frank's overreach. It will bring relief to the more than 5,000 community banks across the country. It will help free up capital for small businesses to invest in our economy and put people to work. It will help minority-owned banks, again, to provide a wider range of services.  In my State, the Citizens Trust Bank is a minority-owned bank in Why is that important? You may have heard of that bank. Martin Luther King, Jr., was a customer of the Citizens Trust Martin Luther King, Sr., served on its board. Many distinguished Atlantans and Georgians have been customers and members of the board of this auspicious bank in Citizens Trust, though, has been forced to draw back its entire mortgage business because of the regulatory costs that have been imposed by Dodd-This is counterintuitive. Thanks to the action we are taking this week in the U.Senate, Citizens Trust will be able to grow its mortgage business again because of safe harbor provisions in this plan.  Citizens Trust is not alone. Carver Bank is a minority-owned bank that has been serving Savannah, GA, for 90 years. The restrictions and regulatory uncertainty on reciprocal deposits have limited its resources. This bill we are voting on this week will more than remove government restrictions on reciprocal deposits, meaning Carver Bank and Citizens Trust and many others will have additional lending capacity and lower compliance costs, which is another way to provide more capital to the community.  This bill was written by both Democrats and It is a shining example of what people back home expect us to do up here--our job. No, it is not perfect from my perspective. It is not perfect from the Senator from North Dakota's perspective, but do you know what? Between us, there is common ground, and we have found it. This bill will bring relief to rural communities and help small businesses, which will, in turn, grow our economy--something that both sides want dearly. This bill also preserves and improves consumer credit protections.  A vote on this plan is a vote for Main Street growth, obviously. It is a vote for rural communities and small businesses. It is a vote for people who work with their local banks to secure capital so that they can keep building the American dream.  I commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for coming together in support of this bipartisan effort, and I encourage every Member of this body to think seriously about this and to support this bill in its final passage.  I thank the chairman of the Banking Committee, the Senator from I cannot tell him how much I appreciate his leadership.

But a temporary solution, such as the one the Senator from Arizona has proposed, is not a solution, as he just said. It is, rather, another failure of Congress to provide real border security for the American people. It provides only 25 percent of what we need to secure that border for the next 3 years. Does anybody really think that is acceptable?  Something the President and the American people have in common is that they want border security. In addition, Members of this body and the administration have spent a great deal of time over the last year, as a matter of fact, talking about a potential DACA solution. I am happy to report that people on both sides want this DACA situation solved permanently. I think the Senator from Arizona and I have the same desire there.  Further, as a result of recent decisions by Federal district courts, current DACA recipients are free to continue renewing their status unless and until the Supreme Court overturns those lower court decisions. It will likely be over a year before the Supreme Court would even hear such a case.  It is my opinion that we should take that time right now and continue working on a permanent DACA solution, as well as the other legal immigration issues that we know are within reach, rather than settling for a temporary solution that does not address the problem. That permanent solution should also be one that ensures we are not back here in the future dealing with the same issue again.

I am joined today by two of my friends, Jared Huffman, Congressman from northern California; and Dan Kildee, Congressman from Flint,  We are here on another very important topic. We just heard our friend, Jamie Raskin from Maryland, talking about gun violence and the need to try to limit that and bring it under control, but today we have another very important topic, a very troubling topic, and it has to do with the sovereignty of our                              {time}  1730  It has to do with our freedom, and it is really as pretty simple as that.  This country separated from England so that we could be a sovereign nation, so that we could rule ourselves, and right now that is a real big question as to whether or not that is happening, because it is clear that the Russians interfered with our elections last year.  The investigation into that interference now has resulted in at least 13 indictments of Russians, coupled with indictments of 5 or 6 people, 5 of whom have pled guilty to some crime or another based upon the investigation conducted by Robert There seems to be something going on between the Trump administration and Russia, and we want to know what it is. The investigation is directed at that.  Mr.Speaker, it starts with something that we asked for last year. We asked to see the President's tax returns. We asked for it on a number of occasions. But unlike anybody else who has run for President or who has been President, our President has refused to turn over his tax returns.  So the question we ask is: Why? What is in there that would stop him from producing his tax returns? Is it a relationship that shows some kind of financial connection to Russia or the like? What is in there? Is he hiding something? What is it?  As time has gone on, starting with that question, we have some more questions. There has been this effort, beginning last summer, to question the integrity of the FBI and to question Mr.Mueller and this investigation to the point there was word that Mr.Mueller was going to be fired from his job last summer, and that question seems to percolate to the surface every so often.  And the question is: Why? What are they afraid of that he might find? What connections are they worried about that Mr.Mueller may uncover that really are hurting our Nation? So what is it that they are hiding? What are they afraid of?  These are very simple questions that need to be answered. This is important because this goes back to the heart of why our Nation was founded and the heart of all of us as It is our sovereignty, and it is our freedom. And if, in fact, we are being directed, our government is being directed by a foreign entity, by Vladimir Putin or Russia, generally, then this country has been undermined to a degree none of us could have ever seen coming.  Now, hopefully, that is not the case, but let's get this investigation going.[[Page H1473]]Let's keep it going. Let's not impugn the integrity of our detectives, the FBI, or the prosecutors who are trying to just find out what the truth is. And any kinds of actions to really undermine that, whether it is from here in the Congress or from the executive branch, it is like: What are you afraid of? What are you hiding?  So just to kind of connect a couple more dots, something that I am concerned about, and I know my friends are, too, is you go back to our sovereignty, our freedom--and this Congress, Mr.Speaker--particularly concerned about the interference by the Russians in our elections. There is not any question that there has been some interference.  We know that the Russians are flexing their muscle around the world. In fact, Putin, the other day, said: I have got nuclear weapons you can't detect.  So they are flexing their muscles.  We as a Congress--419-3 in this House, and 98-2 in the Senate, virtually unanimously--said: We want you to be imposing sanctions against this Russian interference, against some things that they have been doing around the world.  Not one sanction has been added by the Trump administration. Why not?  Even more perplexing, the State Department has been appropriated, Mr.Speaker, $120 million to prevent further espionage and interference by the Russians in our elections. Do you know how much money has been spent by them, by the State Department under this White House, to stop this interference, to stop this espionage? Not one dollar.  These departments generally say we need more money to do X, Y, or Here, something so important as to the integrity of our elections, not $1 spent by the State Department, despite the fact that this Congress appropriated $120 million. Why not?  So a lot of questions are out there. I think it is time, and I think my friends will make some comments and statements similar to mine: What are you afraid of? What are you hiding? Let the detectives in the FBI, let the prosecutors do their job.  Why aren't sanctions being imposed? And why aren't we using the money we have appropriated to spend against this espionage and interference? Why aren't you spending it?

1866,topic-id,513,"Mr.Speaker, I also want to join my friends in honoring National K-9 Veterans  Every March 13, we commemorate the United States Army's first K-9 Corps training program. While this program began in 1942, the history of our ``best friend'' engaging in training and combat with us extends well beyond that date.  Today, we commemorate the iconic Sergeant If you don't know about Stubby, Sergeant Stubby was a brindle bull terrier mutt from New Haven, Stubby was adopted by U.Army Private Robert Conroy, who stowed him away on a ship bound for France in the First World War, where his service was integral to saving American lives. Stubby was allowed to join our soldiers on the front lines after he was discovered by Private Conroy's commanding officer. Because Stubby rendered a salute to the commander, he was allowed to stay.  While on the front, he was once injured during a gas strike and developed a unique sensitivity to the smell of chemical weapons used at that time. His sensitivity was used to alert sleeping troops to another gas attack. He rescued them on numerous occasions from an ill and very painful fate.  Sergeant Stubby also thwarted a German spy attempting to map out the battlefield of the Allied trenches. He did that by grabbing onto the German soldier, biting him and subduing him until the American soldiers could arrive.  Sergeant Stubby served in 17 separate battles during World War Private Conroy's grandson, Curt Deane, recalled stories about Stubby:  ``My grandmother was always clear: he was a service dog. He gave the troops comfort . . . and support. He used to run through the trenches and warn them about gas attacks. He used to go outside of the trenches and into this sort of no man's land between the U.and the German trenches and stand by soldiers who had been injured until the medics could come and get them.''  Sergeant Stubby became a lifetime member of the American Legion and was recognized as the mascot of Georgetown University in the 1920s, where Private Conroy then studied law. In 1921, Stubby was awarded the Humane Education Society's Hero Dog gold medal and earned the honor of meeting General John ``Blackjack'' Pershing, the highest ranking servicemember since General George Washington, at that time.  Sergeant Stubby died in Private Conroy's arms on March 16, 1926.  Today, Sergeant Stubby is set to be immortalized in an animated film[[Page H1533]]premiering next month. That will be great for us all to see. His loyalty, bravery, and selflessness is the legacy for thousands of service dogs being trained at any given time in all branches of our military, as well as our local, State, and Federal law enforcement agencies.  While we aren't yet able to measure the exact number of lives saved by service dogs, one thing is certain: dogs really are a man's and woman's best friend. We are forever grateful and indebted to these animals and applaud them, their handlers and caretakers for their tireless service and devotion to duty and showing us the true meaning of ``battle buddy.''

649,topic-id,670,"Mr.President, my home State of Michigan has the best and most productive workers in the world. Michigan workers built the American auto industry and the American middle class, and they continue to roll out cutting edge innovations.  Our farmers and agricultural producers deliver an incredible diversity of fresh products to American families day in and day out. Our cars, trucks, crops, timber, furniture, and more are shipped across the United States and exported all across the globe.  In America, we believe that if you work hard and you play by the rules, you will be able to support yourself and your family and prosper. Unfortunately, our Nation's workers and businesses are too often facing unfair competition from foreign competitors.  Our businesses, which play by the rules and pay their workers a fair wage for a hard day's work, too often lose business to foreign competitors who cheat. It is one thing to lose a sale to a competitor that has the right product at the right time or is better positioned in the market--that certainly happens--but it is another thing altogether to lose because an international competitor is being subsidized by a foreign government or deliberately dumping goods below cost to drive American companies out of business. This needs to stop, and it needs to stop now.  Large companies are able to directly combat these practices by hiring teams of lawyers to enforce international trade rules, but what about family farms, small auto parts suppliers, and other small manufacturers that don't keep international trade lawyers on their payroll? American small businesses, family farms, and the workers who show up every morning can outcompete anyone on this planet if they are given a level playing field. It is time to give them that level playing field. We should be using the expertise and the strength of the Federal Government to stick up for these small businesses and give them a fair fight.  Under current law, the Commerce Department has the authority to start their own trade investigation into these harmful trade practices, but they barely ever use it. That is why I have introduced the Self-Initiation Trade Enforcement Act with my colleague Senator  This bipartisan legislation will strengthen protections for small businesses and their workers by creating a permanent task force within the Commerce Department to support proactive investigations into unfair trade practices by foreign competitors. This task force will research trade data, spot abusive, unfair trade practices, and start formal investigations. This task force will also focus on cases impacting small- and medium-sized businesses--the exact businesses that need the support but may not even know how to ask for it.  Additionally, putting the weight of the Commerce Department behind[[Page S1915]]these efforts shields these businesses from foreign retaliation. If a small business is able to track international trade data and if they are then able to hire a legal team necessary to successfully prosecute their claims--and believe me, these are two big ifs--they could still face retaliation from foreign governments that could make it harder for them to export after they win their case. An individual cherry grower in northern Michigan, for example, faces nearly impossible hurdles in taking on a foreign government, but the Commerce Department can look out for these small growers across the Nation and be their champion.  At a recent bipartisan trade policy meeting that I attended, I was able to speak with President Trump and Commerce Secretary Ross about this bipartisan legislation. They both expressed their strong support, and I will continue working with them and my colleagues in Congress until this legislation is signed into law. Michigan workers and businesses just want a fair chance to compete, and I will never stop fighting for them so they can compete fairly and so they can win.  I urge my colleagues to support the Self-Initiation Trade Enforcement Act that will help small businesses and family farms all across Michigan and all across the United  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

So these businessowners in my district and around the country have approached me and said, as I said, that they will go out of business if this second phase is not delayed.

1678,topic-id,526,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague from California (Mr.Lowenthal) for yielding me the time.  Mr.Speaker, I, too, rise today in support of H.4266, the Acadia National Park Boundary Clarification I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this bipartisan bill, which was introduced by my colleague from Maine (Mr.Poliquin).  While you have already heard from Mr.Poliquin a lot about the importance of the intertidal zone, about the livelihood of clam diggers and wormers, and about the Acadia National Park, because our State is so important and we love our park, I am pretty much going to say it all again.  Maine is very proud to be home to Acadia National This national treasure is a place where the mountains actually meet the sea. When you climb those mountains, you see miles of clear, blue ocean dotted with literally some of the hundreds and thousands of islands off the coast of Maine, one of which I am lucky enough to live on, not the one where Acadia National Park is.  But millions of people visit Acadia National Park every year to experience the incredible natural attractions, the hiking, and the climbing. But they also come there to be in downeast Downeast Maine is full of very many tight-knit communities, and those tight-knit communities are full of hardworking men and women, many of whom make their living on the water; and it is really hard work. Some of them are hauling lobster traps every day so that we can enjoy the wonderful lobster that is only delicious if you get it from the State of But many of them are bent over digging in the mud for clams, for other species, and for bloodworms; and it is really hard work.                              {time}  1730  H.4266 would clarify a number of points to strengthen the park's relationship with the surrounding communities that we have been talking about. Most importantly, this bill will ensure that clammers, wormers, and other traditional harvesters can continue to work in the places where, frankly, they have worked for generations, many of them working alongside their sons or daughters when they go out every day.  In the spring of 2016, the harvesters were shocked when the park staff began prohibiting them from working[[Page H1520]]along the coastline within Acadia's boundaries. There was no warning about changing a practice that had, frankly, gone on for decades. I appreciate the fact that park officials quickly ended their enforcement, but the actions sent shock waves throughout the area.  Washington County is the poorest county in Maine, and families there simply just can't afford to lose any source of income. H.4266 would give the communities a sense of security by very explicitly stating that harvesters have a right to work within the park. It is a critical step to ensuring that Acadia National Park remains an attraction not only for its natural beauty, but for its unique way of life.  Again, I want to thank my colleague, Mr.Poliquin, for recognizing the issue, for working with his harvesters, and for moving this forward. I am proud to be an original cosponsor. I urge its passage and urge all my colleagues to support it.  ",CREC-2018-03-13-pt1-PgH1518.txt,1927,"ECONOMIC GROWTH, REGULATORY RELIEF, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT--MOTION",2018.0,13.0,March

This common-law document, which we adopted from the British ancestors, gives public access to this land between high and low waterlines for the purpose of ``fishing, fowling, and navigation.''  Now, unlike some States, Mr.Speaker, some property owners in Maine own to the low watermark of the tidal range, so this doctrine is incredibly important for the public to have access to our flats for these purposes.  This bill that we are passing today codifies the unique ownership and public access rights of Maine fishermen on the intertidal who have worked on this for hundreds of years. Traditional harvesting is meant to include the harvesting of clams and worms, which are harvested by hand with a rake at low tide, and the collection of periwinkles. It also includes accessing intertidal areas by boat at all tides for the purpose of harvesting these species.  Now, to be clear, the intent of this bill is for ``traditional harvesting.''

Do you know what happened?  The court system said: I am sorry. Under a Federal law that was passed by the Congress--a 21-year-old law--this website is not culpable. It has a shield. It has an immunity.  That is why we are here today.  Justice cannot always be seen, but its absence is felt, and the absence of justice is exactly what we are trying to address here today.  You have heard from my colleagues, and I appreciate all four of them for speaking up and talking about their experiences and how we got to this point. We may hear from a couple of other colleagues later today who were part of helping us put together a sensible approach that targeted this activity. Sure, we have freedom of the internet on the one hand, but on the other hand, this is criminal activity that cannot continue to go on here in America, in this century, at this time.  Again, as we have learned, this is where you see the increase in trafficking. You not only hear this from the experts who give us their data that show huge increases in trafficking reports, but you also hear it and feel it from the victims and the survivors whom I have met with in Cleveland, in Cincinnati, in Columbus, in Dayton, in They have told me the same story, which is: Yes, I was sold online. It is very efficient.  One 9-year-old girl was sold online by her father. I first met her when she was almost 20 years old and had finally escaped from the clutches of her own father.  Think about that--backpage's going from sporting event to sporting event around the country and, online, one being sold many times on a single night with the efficiency of the internet.  This is legislation that is overdue, in my view, and it is required. The courts have told us that. The district attorneys have told us that. The attorneys general have told us that, and 50 of them sent us a letter, writing to make this change. They have all said: Congress, step forward. They have not just invited us to do it; they have welcomed us to pass this legislation to give these families the justice they deserve and to give our prosecutors the ability to go after them.  One thing that I hope has been made clear from the other comments we have heard today is that one of the important parts of this legislation is to simply allow these local prosecutors we talked about earlier to take these cases while using the Federal standard rather than just relying on the Department of  Having said that, sifting through those 1 million pages, our report, with all the documents we received, you can go online to see this at the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations,  We did provide this to the Justice We did provide this to the prosecutors around the country who were interested. We did provide it to others who are pursuing lawsuits so they have information now that they never had before, but we also need to change the law, and that is what we are about to do today.  You heard from my colleagues about the amendments that are likely to be offered. There are two amendments. The first amendment is one that is going to be called a moderating amendment, meaning that if somebody is on their website moderating the website, cleaning up the website, they should be given a good-faith acceptance. Let me just be clear. This amendment is a poison pill and will make it easier for those sites that are involved in sex trafficking to continue to do so.  Right now, under current law, there is a good-faith exception. There is a Good Samaritan exception under current law. We actually restate that in our legislation, to be absolutely clear, that if you are one of the good guys--a website online--who wants to be sure your site is not going to have these girls being sold that we talked about earlier, that you should be protected. However, this legislation, having restated the Good Samaritan provision, also says that if you are one of the bad actors, you don't have that protection. The first amendment that is going to be offered includes protections for some of the bad actors. It purposely strips the good-faith element, and I believe it would assist online sex traffickers rather than hold them to account.  For instance, if backpage or another website filters for illegal content and, as a result, learns that their site is being used for trafficking but ignores that activity, I think this amendment would say that evidence could not be considered in a case against backpage. To me, that is wrong, and I hope the first amendment is going to be handled appropriately, which is to say, we don't want to weaken this bill or have a poison pill in here.  By the way, the law enforcement community represented nationally by their associations agrees with us, as do the victims groups, as do the groups who are concerned about the effect of trafficking on girls, women, and boys online. So we are together on this with all the outside groups.  The second amendment is going to be asking for additional Department of Justice resources specifically to combat online trafficking. I support funding to investigate and prosecute traffickers, of course, but we have to appropriate that funding in the proper manner. This amendment would be subject to a budget point of order because it is not going through the right process. The right process is the bill we are taking up the day after tomorrow, which will be the spending bill.  In fact, there are three budget points of order that the Committee on Budget in the U.Senate has found against this amendment. This amendment is subject to points of order. Every law enforcement group in the country opposes the amendment because as law enforcement said, it is a poison pill that is dead on arrival if sent back to the We have to defeat these amendments in order to have this legislation move forward. I hope my colleagues will all stick with us on that as they stuck with us through this process of getting the information, coming up with the right legislation, being sure we have the opportunity to take it to the floor and get it to a clean vote, get it to the President's desk and get it signed, and starting in a couple of weeks to be able to make a difference in the lives of the people we represent, stopping the online trafficking that is occurring and providing justice to those who are victims and survivors and ensuring that, indeed, justice can be served.  One of my colleagues has joined us on the floor. Senator Nelson is the ranking Democrat on the Commerce Committee that took up this legislation and clarified some points in the legislation. By the time he was done with it--and, by the way, he was a cosponsor of the legislation long before that--but by the time the Commerce Committee was done clarifying the legislation, listening to the testimony from both sides, he received a unanimous vote in committee. That doesn't happen very often, and I appreciate Senator Nelson being on the floor today. More importantly, I appreciate his leadership on the issue.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent additional material be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:[[Page S1856]]                               Congressional Research Service,                                                    March 7, 2018.                               Memorandum     To: Ann     From: American Law     Subject: Ex Post Facto Implications of the Allow States and          Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017 (H.         1865), as Passed by the House of       This is in response to your request for an analysis of the      ex post facto implications of the Allow States and Victims to      Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017 (FOSTA) (H.1865),      as passed by the House of Representatives in February, 2018.      You expressed particular interest in the ex post facto      implication of Section 4 as it relates to Section 230 of the      Communications Act of 1934 (Section 230) (47 U.S.     230), originally enacted as part of the Communications      Decency Act of 1996.       As discussed below, the Constitution's Ex Post Facto      Clauses limit congressional and state authority to pass      legislation that applies retroactively. Because Section      230(e)(5)(B) and (C) would amend the Communications Act to      allow states to prosecute online facilitators of sex      trafficking but would not create any new federal crimes or      enhance the punishment for any existing federal crimes, the      Ex Post Facto Clause does not appear likely to bar Congress      from making these amendments. In addition, Section      230(e)(5)(A), which amends Section 230 to allow civil causes      of action under 18 U.S.1595 for 18 U.S.1591      violations, does not appear to violate the Ex Post Facto, Due      Process, and Takings                               discussion       Among other things, Section 230 of the Communications Act      protects online providers of internet services from being      treated as publishers of information provided by other      entities. Section 230 states: ``No provider or user of an      interactive computer service shall be treated as the      publisher or speaker of any information provided by another      information content provider.'' Section 230 does not bar      criminal prosecutions under federal law.       Courts have found Section 230 to prevent states from      enforcing state laws intended to reduce sexual abuse of      minors. For example, in 2012, a court found Section 230 to      bar state prosecution of an online classified advertising      service pursuant to a state law that criminalized advertising      commercial sexual abuse of a minor. Other courts have      construed Section 230 to immunize online classified      advertising services from civil liability.       Among other things, FOSTA is intended to clarify that      Section 230 of the Communications Act does not protect      providers and users of interactive computer services from      federal and state criminal and civil laws relating to sexual      exploitation of children or sex trafficking. The relevant      substantive provisions FOSTA include:       Section 3 (proposed 18 U.S.2421A), which would      proscribe ``promotion or facilitation of prostitution and      reckless disregard of sex trafficking,'' authorize      restitution, and provide a civil cause of action for the      victims of such an offense;       Section 4, which would amend Section 230, to ``ensur[e]      [the] ability to enforce federal and state criminal and civil      law relating to sex trafficking'';       Section 5, which would amend 18 U.S.1591, which      proscribes certain aspects of commercial sex trafficking of      children or by force, fraud, or coercion, by defining the      term ``participation in a venture'';       Section 6, which would amend 18 U.S.1595, which      establishes a cause of action for damages and attorneys' fees      to benefit victims of violations of 18 U.S.ch. 77 (18      U.S.1581-1597) (relating to peonage, slavery,      and trafficking in persons, including commercial sex      trafficking), to allow state attorneys general to bring civil      actions on behalf of victims of commercial sex trafficking.       Section 7, which would establish a savings clause relating      to pending federal and state criminal and civil litigation.       Section 4 of FOSTA addresses the scope of Section 230's      grants of civil and criminal immunity. It reads:       (a) In General.--Section 230(e) of the Communications Act      of 1934 (47 U.S.230(e)) is amended by adding at the end      the following:       ``(5) No effect on sex trafficking law.--Nothing in this      section (other than subsection (c)(2)(A)) shall be construed      to impair or limit--       ``(A) any claim in a civil action brought under section      1595 of title 18, United States Code, if the conduct      underlying the claim constitutes a violation of section 1591      of that title;       ``(B) any charge in a criminal prosecution brought under      State law if the conduct underlying the charge would      constitute a violation of section 1591 of title 18, United      States Code; or       ``(C) any charge in a criminal prosecution brought under      State law if the conduct underlying the charge would      constitute a violation of section 2421A of title 18, United      States Code, and promotion or facilitation of prostitution is      illegal in the jurisdiction where the defendant's promotion      or facilitation of prostitution was targeted.       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section      shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act,      and the amendment made by subsection (a) shall apply      regardless of whether the conduct alleged occurred, or is      alleged to have occurred, before, on, or after such date of      enactment.       Section 4(b) clarifies that the Section 4(a) amendments      apply retroactively, which raises the possibility of ex post      facto issues. With respect to Congress, the Constitution      provides that ``No . . . ex post facto Law shall be passed,''      and, with respect to the states, the Constitution provides      that ``No State shall . . . pass any . . . ex post facto Law      . . .''     Proposed Section 230(e)(5)(B) and (C)       Proposed Section 230(e)(5)(B) and (C) concern state      criminal prosecutions. Section 4 of FOSTA would amend      existing federal law to remove impediments to criminal      prosecution under state law as described in proposed Section      230(e)(5)(B) and (C). Strictly speaking, it would neither      create new federal crimes nor enhance the punishment for      existing federal crimes. Thus, on its face, it would not      appear to violate the Ex Post Facto Clause that binds      Because Section 4 does not contemplate state      enactment of retroactive legislation, it would not appear      likely to violate the Ex Post Facto Clause that applies to      states. It is possible, however, that an argument could be      made that allowing prosecution for parallel state offenses      effectively enhances punishments for 18 U.S.1591 and      proposed 18 U.S.2421A violations retroactively.       The Supreme Court has considered two ex post facto cases      that involved removing impediments to state prosecution and      punishment--Stogner v. California and Dobbert v. In      Stogner, the Supreme Court found a California statute that      attempted to revive expired statutes of limitations to      violate the Ex Post The Court stated:       The second category [of Calder v. Bull's inventory of      statutes that violate ex post facto]--including any law that      aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was, when      committed--describes California's statute as long as those      words are understood as Justice Chase understood them--i.e.,      as referring to a statute that inflicts punishments, where      the party was not, by law, liable to any punishment. After      (but not before) the original statute of limitations had      expired, a party such as Stogner was not liable to any      punishment. California's new statute therefore aggravated      Stogner's alleged crime, or made it greater than it was,      when committed, in the sense that, and to the extent that,      it inflicted punishment for past criminal conduct that      (when the new law was enacted) did not trigger such      liability.       In Dobbert v. Florida, the Court considered a Florida      statute that sought to revive the death penalty. Dobbert had      committed murder, then a capital offense, several months      before the Court decided Furman v. Georgia, which invalidated      Georgia's, and by implication Florida's, procedures for      determining death sentences. After reinstating the death      penalty with constitutionally valid procedures, Florida      prosecuted Dobbert, and sentenced him to death. The Court      found no ex post facto violation. ``The new statute simply      altered the methods employed in determining whether the death      penalty was to be imposed; there was no change in the quantum      of punishment to the crime.'' The Court explained further:       Petitioner's second ex post facto claim is based on the      contention that at the time he murdered his children there      was no death penalty in effect in This is so, he      contends, because, the earlier statute enacted by the      legislature was, after the time he acted, found by the      Supreme Court of Florida to be invalid under our decision in      Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.238 (1972). Therefore, argues      petitioner, there was no valid death penalty in effect in      Florida as of the date of his actions. But this sophistic      argument mocks the substance of the Ex Post Facto      Whether or not the old statute would, in the future,      withstand constitutional attack, it clearly indicated      Florida's view of the severity of murder and of the degree of      punishment which the legislature wished to impose upon      murderers. The statute was intended to provide maximum      deterrence, and its existence on the statute books provided      fair warning as to the degree of culpability which the State      ascribed to the act of murder . . . Here the existence of the      statute served as an operative fact to warn the petitioner of      the penalty which Florida would seek to impose on him if he      were convicted of first-degree murder. This was sufficient      compliance with the ex post facto provision of the United      States       Because Section 230(e)(5)(B) revives the prospect of state      prosecution for conduct outlawed by 18 U.S.1591, it      seems analogous to Dobbert and critically distinct from      In Stogner, the defendant could not be prosecuted      until the impediment was removed. Under proposed Section      230(e)(5)(B), defendants could be prosecuted before the      impediment's removal if 18 U.S.1591 proscribed the      underlying conduct. In Dobbert and under proposed Section      230(e)(5)(B), the defendant knew beforehand that government      authorities considered the underlying conduct criminal and      warranting punishment under the law.       Proposed Section 230(e)(5)(C) is different because dual      state and federal prosecutions would only occur after      proposed 18 U.S.2421A's enactment and, consequently,      any conduct subject to revived state prosecution would not      have been a federal crime when the conduct occurred.       However, Section 230(e)(5)(C) would create no new federal      crime or enhance punishment[[Page S1857]]     for any pre-existing federal crime and only impacts state      law. We have been unable to locate any case that indicates      that the Ex Post Facto Clause limits Congress's legislative      authority in such a situation.     Proposed Section 230(e)(5)(A)       Proposed Section 230(e)(5)(A) concerns civil causes of      action. Section 230(e)(5)(A) would remove Section 230 bars to      causes of action under 18 U.S.1595 and predicated on      18 U.S.1591 (relating to commercial sex trafficking)      violations. Ex Post Facto Clauses ordinarily do not apply to      statutes providing retroactive civil remedies. The Supreme      Court has stated: ``Because [the Court will] ordinarily defer      to the legislature's stated intent, only the clearest proof      will suffice to override legislative intent and transform      what has been denominated a civil remedy into a criminal      penalty.'' Section 1595 appears to be remedial in contrast to      the criminal provisions in the same chapter of Title 18 of      the United States Code, including Section 1591.       Retroactive civil remedial statutes raise Due Process      Clause and, occasionally, Takings Clause concerns. The Court      has not presumed retroactivity in civil cases unless such      legislative intent is clearly indicated. When legislation is      explicitly retroactive, the Court's due process analysis      generally is more forgiving than its ex post facto analysis.      The Court has stated: ``Provided that the retroactive      application of a statute is supported by a legitimate      legislative purpose furthered by rational means, judgments      about the wisdom of such legislation remain within the      exclusive province of the legislative and executive      branches.'' Section 230(e)(5)(A) appears to have a legitimate      legislative purpose--to make facilitators of commercial sex      trafficking compensate its victims and, having a narrowly      drawn cause of action, its means appear rational.       In rare cases, retroactively imposing liability on private      parties raises Takings Clause claims. The Court in a 5-4,      plurality decision, Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, found it      unconstitutional to require coal companies to cover health      care expenses of retired miners whom they had employed before      exiting the coal industry. Four members of the Court found      the legislation violated the Takings Clause because it      ``imposes severe retroactive liability on a limited class of      parties that could not have anticipated the liability, and      the extent of that liability is substantially      disproportionate to the parties' experience.'' Justice Thomas      concurred, but wrote separately to suggest revisiting whether      to apply the Ex Post Facto Clauses in civil cases. Justice      Kennedy concurred in the judgment, but maintained that a Due      Process standard provided a more appropriate analysis. The      four dissenters agreed that the Due Process Clause should      control and that, accordingly, the legislation was      constitutional. It is not clear, however, that Section      230(e)(5)(A) would impose retroactively the kind of massive,      unanticipated civil liability at issue in Eastern       ",CREC-2018-03-21-pt1-PgS1849-8.txt,924,BLOCKING REGULATORY INTERFERENCE FROM CLOSING KILNS ACT OF 2017,2018.0,21.0,March

Matt leaves behind his beloved wife, Amy, and their two beautiful children, Anna and  I first met Matt in 2005 when he was an Assistant U.Trade He was well known in the trade community, and he stood out as a substantive expert in his field. Matt would say that his time at USTR was the most fun he had ever had in government. That says a lot as Matt also worked on Capitol Hill for the National Republican Congressional Committee and as a congressional liaison for a number of private companies and organizations throughout his life.  Matt played a key role in our successful efforts to pass the Central American Free Trade He was a happy warrior in that he loved trade, USTR, and getting things done. I think his thick skin and constant hopefulness was a credit to his upbringing as a long-suffering and then long-celebrating Boston Red Sox fan. He always found a way to get his mission accomplished and always had a quick wit.  I was lucky to remain close with Matt after our time together at USTR had ended. He would go to any length for his friends, and he was always thoughtful, kind, and jovial. He never passed at the opportunity to joke about one of his earliest experiences in politics, when he worked for the first primary opponent I ever faced. He would generously tell me how happy he was that, for one of the only times in his career, he wasn't successful in that job.

1302,topic-id,939,"Mr.President, I rise tonight to talk about the bipartisan legislation that is before the body. It is an opportunity that provides significant needed regulatory relief, primarily to smaller financial institutions like community banks and credit unions.  The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act will modernize the Federal Dodd-Frank regulations to ensure that small- and medium-sized banks, as well as credit unions, can lower their compliance costs, which will mean more loans to small businesses and better deals for their customers.  For years, Dodd-Frank has hurt these smaller community banks and credit unions that have been caught up in this broader effort to rein in a select few larger financial institutions--primarily financial institutions on Wall In effect, these smaller banks were caught in the web.  Last week, I met with some of Ohio's community banks. I meet with them regularly, and they tell me these stories. Their view, of course, is these Dodd-Frank rules targeted at the big banks are actually hurting the little guys. Over the past several years, they have told me story after story about how their compliance costs have increased. A small bank will say they used to have one person doing compliance, but now they have three people doing compliance, and those costs get passed along to their consumers. They also say, with the redtape and regulations and rules they live under, it makes it harder for them to lend to small businesses, which is one of the problems we have today in our economy. As the economy is beginning to grow, we need to ensure that startups and people who are interested in taking a risk and may not have a lot of business experience are able to get that loan to get started.  What has happened is, there has been a consolidation of these community banks because of these costs. In fact, they say one community bank is becoming insolvent every day in this country because of these big compliance costs, but others are consolidating into larger banks. That may be fine in some cases, but I like these community banks.  I like the fact that these community banks are close to the people in the neighborhood, and they know the businesses that are coming to them for loans. Again, it is easier for small businesses to get loans when you actually have a banking relationship. They also are very involved in our communities.[[Page S1400]]  So these community banks, which are really the backbone of America's financial sector, are what this bill is primarily about. The bill on the floor this week makes it easier for them to extend credit, loans, mortgages, and provide other products and services to working families in Ohio and around the country.  The legislation does more than that though. It also focuses on the regional banks in These are banks that were not part of the financial crisis. They had nothing to do with it, but despite that, they have been required to live under the onerous systemically important financial institution rules and regulations or the SIFI designation. It has caused higher compliance costs for them. Again, it has hurt lending to Ohio businesses.  In Ohio, we happened to have three very big employers in the State that are regional banks--Fifth Third Bank, Huntington Bank, and They are all examples of well-capitalized Ohio regional banks that will benefit from this legislation, and the benefit will go to their thousands of employees, but it will also go to their many thousands of customers.  This legislation also increases important consumer protections for veterans, senior citizens, victims of fraud, and those who have fallen on tough financial times  Another thing I like about the legislation that is particularly important to me is it includes a specific piece of legislation I authored to make it easier for a group called Habitat for Humanity to carry out their mission of providing safe and affordable housing to those in need. Habitat is a great organization. I volunteer at Habitat regularly. I see firsthand the great work they are doing back in my home State of  My legislation is called the Housing Opportunity Made Easier Act or HOME Act, and it simply ensures that Habitat affiliates and other organizations--nonprofits--can receive donated appraisals of the homes they build. This is a really important issue for Habitat because Dodd-Frank disallows this donated appraisal, and the affiliates have traditionally accepted the donations. That has allowed them to have lower costs. When they have to pay the appraisal fees, it increases the cost of the homes to the families that are so badly in need of affordable housing. So getting rid of this redtape is something that should be bipartisan and even nonpartisan. It has been tough for us to get this legislation moving because people have wanted to block anything that has to with Dodd-Frank, but this obviously, I hope, was inadvertent. So in this legislation we have the ability for Habitat and other nonprofits to take advantage of these donated appraisals. Getting rid of that redtape is going to help create more affordable housing for families in need.  I want to thank Chairman Crapo for including that legislation. I also want to congratulate him and his colleagues on the Banking Committee for their bipartisan work on this legislation, dealing with the very real problem we have, which is the burdens, the redtape, the compliance costs, and coming up with a balanced product that can be supported on both sides of the aisle, get through the House, get through the Senate, get to the President for signature, and begin to improve this economy even more.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-06-pt1-PgS1399.txt,924,SECURING THE FUTURE OF DREAMERS,2018.0,6.0,March
1306,topic-id,1170,"Mr.President, on another economic issue, I want to talk for a minute about the good news coming out of my State of Ohio with regard to the tax reform legislation. In just the past few weeks, I have visited eight separate businesses across the State talking about this issue, asking them what has been the impact of the tax reform bill, what are they doing with their savings.  There are three of these I want to talk about tonight, briefly. One is a small auto parts manufacturing business in Zanesville, They have three auto parts stores. One is a multinational credit card processing company headquartered in Cincinnati, OH, and one is a premier medical center in Cleveland, They are very different businesses in different sectors of our economy, but all are benefiting from the tax legislation.  GKM is the small auto parts store in They are reinstating healthcare benefits to their employees directly as a result of this tax reform bill. Under the Affordable Care Act, the company's healthcare costs increased dramatically--like so many other businesses--by double digits every year. They had a 22-percent increase in their costs in 2016, and the company went to its employees and said: We simply cannot afford to pay for this 22-percent increase on top of other double-digit increases. We don't know what to do. We are going to have to have you go out on your own and find healthcare, including in the exchanges.  Now, with the money GKM Auto Parts is saving as the result of this tax reform, all of their full-time employees are once again able to get healthcare through the company, and they are very grateful, having talked to some of the employees who had to go out to the exchanges, while others chose to pay the penalty. They are really happy to have their healthcare back.  These kinds of real, tangible benefits are exactly what we intended to accomplish in developing tax reform, but businesses small and large are benefiting from these pro-growth changes to the Tax  The second company I want to talk about is a big C corporation--Worldpay, It is the largest credit card processing company in the world now by volume. It has about 2,000 employees in Ohio at their headquarters. I recently went to their headquarters to talk about what they were doing, and when I was there, they announced cash bonuses of $1,000 and up to $2,000 for all of their hourly employees, higher wages for their frontline positions, an increased 401(k) match, greater company investment in employee wellness and recognition programs, and significantly more charitable giving. As Worldpay's executive chair said, tax reform is ``ensuring Ohio companies like Worldpay can remain competitive and recruit the region's top talent.''  They merged recently with a foreign company. Thank goodness they stayed in Ohio, but now they are rewarded for that because, although they were punished for being a U.company before, now with our Tax Code changes in place, they are actually benefiting from being an American company, where it is more beneficial to make the investment here rather than, in their case, in the United  A more competitive business tax code, an international tax code that encourages investments in this country rather than overseas, and incentives like immediate expensing that is in the Tax Code now are helping to create jobs in my home State of It is helping Worldpay continue to be an American company and to be strong. It also is helping foreign direct investment in my home State because companies that are not American companies but foreign companies invested in Ohio are more likely to increase that investment rather than an investment somewhere else in the world because of the tax reform legislation. Immediate expensing and lower tax rates, this all helps to create good American jobs.  The most recent Federal jobs report shows strong job gains and the fastest wage growth since 2009. According to a recent National Federation of Independent Business survey, the NFIB, which represents a lot of small businesses in Ohio, 32 percent of their companies now say they are going to expand. By the way, that is the highest level in the survey's history, and it is the highest level of optimism also in their survey about the future among these small businesses. A lot of that is from the increased opportunity and the optimism that comes from this tax reform legislation.  One website I saw here in Washington tells us that across the country more than 400 businesses have now announced bonuses, higher wages, increased benefits, or a combination of these things as the result of the tax reform law. Four hundred is impressive, but I have to tell you it is a lot more businesses than that. I have been to small business roundtable discussions and individual businesses over the past several weeks in Ohio and talked to over two dozen individual companies--none of whom are on the list of 400 because they are not big companies that made a big public announcement--but every single one of them are taking this tax reform and the benefits they are getting from that, and they are reinvesting it into their people, their[[Page S1401]]workers, their company's plant, equipment, technology, making their workers more productive. So 400 is impressive, but I know it is much larger than that. Thousands of businesses are taking advantage of this and therefore their employers are and therefore you are seeing this increased optimism.  The final example I want to talk about is one that has to do with our communities. I recently visited the University Hospital Rainbow Center for Women and Children in Cleveland, OH--a really impressive new facility they are building. This is a new $26 million medical facility, and I learned during this visit that it was the new markets tax credit that was key to making this project possible. New markets is a tax incentive to spur economic growth and community redevelopment projects, and it helps to spur private investment, as it did in this case. In this Cleveland case, it spawned significant private investment from foundations and from individuals. This is something that has worked in the cities I represent in We fought to preserve the new markets tax credit in the Senate version of the tax legislation, and the final agreement that became law has the new markets tax credit made permanent. That is critical for economic development opportunities like this new university hospital medical center I talked about.  So these benefits from tax reform are not abstract. They are very real. They are extra money in your paycheck, they are more affordable healthcare coverage, they are increased investments in emerging communities, and much more.  As the good news continues to roll in from tax reform, I will keep traveling Ohio, meeting with businesses, families, and workers to discuss ways tax reform can help them achieve a better economic future. A brighter future is really what our tax reform and tax cut legislation was all about.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-06-pt1-PgS1400.txt,924,WEEK ON THE STATUS OF BLACK WOMEN,2018.0,6.0,March
1343,topic-id,1300,"Mr.President, finally, I want to talk about something else we were working on in Congress to create a brighter future for many I am talking about our efforts to provide justice for victims of sex trafficking and to hold accountable those online entities, those websites that knowingly facilitate these evil crimes. I am talking about this because, although this week we are focused on these reforms to Dodd-Frank to help our smaller banks make the economy stronger and help individuals and small companies, next week we hope to take up this issue of sex trafficking.  We are closer than ever to getting this legislation passed, and just recently we had some good news in our bipartisan effort. The Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, or SESTA, a bill I introduced with 24 Senators back in August, is gaining momentum in Last week, the House of Representatives actually offered the SESTA legislation as an amendment on the floor to a broader bill, and it passed by an overwhelming vote--over 300 votes. Just a couple of days later, the White House expressed their support for this legislation.  It is now the Senate's turn to act on this critically important issue, and Leader McConnell--the leadership in the Senate--again has made a commitment to me and my colleagues that we will hold a vote on this sex trafficking legislation, the SESTA legislation, in the next couple of weeks. We now have 67 Senate cosponsors for That is not typical around here.  It is a majority of Democrats; it is a majority of Republicans--two-thirds of the Senators in this body. By the way, this is a diverse group with wide-ranging political and ideological backgrounds. They have all signed on to this legislation because they want to be part of the solution. It is a commonsense solution to what is unfortunately a growing problem here in our country and in every State represented here in this body.  Unbelievably, sex trafficking is actually increasing in this country right now. In this century, in this country, sex trafficking is actually increasing. How can that be? What the experts tell us is that it is because of the online presence of these evil websites that are selling women and children online. The ruthless efficiency of social media--of the online presence of these websites--is what is causing this increase.  Victims of sex trafficking in Ohio have told me, as I have met with them: Rob, this has moved from the street corner to the smartphone. One website called backpage.com is the industry leader in online sex trafficking. They are involved in nearly 75 percent of all child trafficking reports that the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children receives from the public. Seventy-five percent of the reports that this great organization receives to try to stop sex trafficking relate to this one site.  The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations here in the Senate, which I chair, conducted an 18-month investigation into this issue. We looked at what the online presence was and why it was happening. We learned, of course, that backpage.com was by far the biggest problem. We found that backpage not only had the vast majority of the commercial sex traffic on their site, but they had knowingly facilitated and assisted criminal sex trafficking and covered up evidence of those crimes in order to increase their own profits.  For years, unbelievably, we have allowed them to get away with it. I think that is a stain on our national character. I think we need to address it, particularly because we have the opportunity here in the Senate to change a Federal law to help stop this.  Courts have consistently ruled that backpage.com and these other websites are protected by a Federal law--a law that we passed over two decades ago--called the Communications Decency Act that protects these websites from liability for crimes users commit through their site, no matter how complicit they are in those crimes. It was certainly not the intent of Congress to permit this, but that is how the courts have interpreted it.  Prosecutors and courts from across the country, including 50 State attorneys general, have called on Congress to fix this injustice. In one of the most direct calls that I have seen, a Sacramento judge last year dropped pimping charges against backpage.com, stating: ``If and until Congress sees fit to amend the immunity law, the broad reach of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act even applies to those alleged to support the exploitation of others by human trafficking.'' In other words, this judge is saying that there is now an immunity--a protection under Federal law--that allows these people, even when they are knowingly involved with sex trafficking, to continue to do what they are doing.  Our legislation makes two very simple changes to the Federal law that currently protects websites like backpage in an effort to restore justice.  First, SESTA says that if you are violating a Federal law, the Federal law on trafficking--and that is a law that was in existence long before we started this investigation. It is a law that is well established. If you are violating the Federal law on trafficking, assisting, supporting, or facilitating sex trafficking, and if you are doing it knowingly, which is a very high standard to prove, then you can be held liable and held to account. Again, this is very narrowly targeted legislation to deal with this specific problem.  Second, the legislation will allow State attorneys general--who cannot now but would be able under this legislation--to prosecute websites that violate Federal sex trafficking laws. It is very important because that is where you are going to see most of the action--at the State level, the State prosecutors.  We have tailored this legislation narrowly to ensure no threat to the freedom of the internet but ensure we are getting at this problem and actually dealing with immunity in Federal law.  Sex trafficking survivors, their families, and anti-trafficking advocates have shown great courage by sharing their tragic stories and personal accounts of injustice at the hands of online sex traffickers as we worked with them to develop this narrowly crafted legislation.  In testimony before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and in testimony before the Commerce Committee--which unanimously endorsed this legislation--we heard from victims and their families. We heard from moms who told us about their teenage daughters having been trafficked online.[[Page S1402]]  One mom talked about her daughter who, at 14, was trafficked. She had been missing for 10 weeks. She finally found a photograph of her daughter on backpage. She called and said: I found my daughter. She is on your website. Thank you for taking her off your website. She is 14 years old.  The person at the other end of the line from backpage said: Did you pay for the ad?  The mom said: No, I didn't pay for the ad. That is my daughter.  They said: Then we can't take down the ad.  That is who these people are.  They have shown great courage by coming forward with their stories. Now it is our turn to show courage by coming together and voting on this bill, sending it to the President's desk, and fixing this problem, fixing the Federal law to allow justice for the trafficking victims and to finally hold accountable those who knowingly facilitate these crimes.  We have an opportunity to do something important here to create a better, safer, and more just society. I am hopeful that next week we will have that legislation before this body. We will have the debate. We will pass the legislation and begin to provide these victims of trafficking the justice they deserve and, most importantly, stop women and children from being exploited online.  Thank you, Mr. I yield back my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-06-pt1-PgS1401.txt,924,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1119, SATISFYING ENERGY NEEDS AND",2018.0,6.0,March

1379,topic-id,2351,"Mr.President, today I want to talk about the tragedy of human trafficking. I want to talk about it today because this is an issue that I hope the entire U.Senate will take up within the next week.  We have legislation on which we have worked on a bipartisan basis over the last couple of years, and we have an opportunity late this week or early next week to address this growing problem. I have spent a lot of time focused on this issue over the last couple of years because of the growth of trafficking and my sense that we can do something constructive about it. Others have been involved as well.  Today, I will be at the White House for a meeting that Ivanka Trump is hosting with congressional colleagues, anti-trafficking advocates, and others who have demonstrated a commitment to addressing this issue. We will talk about the need to pass this legislation, get it to the President's desk for signature, and begin to help women and children across our country who are currently being exploited online.  We will probably talk about lots of different kinds of trafficking this afternoon, including work trafficking and other human trafficking, but the one I want to focus on this afternoon is sex trafficking, and the reason is that we think we have a legislative solution for addressing the biggest problem.  Unbelievably, right now in this country, sex trafficking is actually increasing. That is based on all the best data we are getting from all the experts around the country. They say that it is increasing primarily for one simple reason, and that is the internet. The great increase is happening online.  As some have said, this is because of the ruthless efficiency of selling people online. When I am back home in Ohio, victims tell me: Rob, this has moved from the street corner to the smartphone. There is a ruthless efficiency about it.  Anti-trafficking organizations, such as the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, Shared Hope International, and others, have told us that the majority of the online sex trafficking they encounter occurs through one single website, and that is backpage.com.  The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children says that backpage is involved in about 75 percent of the online trafficking reports it receives from the public. Shared Hope International says it is more than that.  I chair the Permanent Subcommittee on Learning about what is going on online, we decided to do an in-depth investigation to find out what is really happening and how we could address it. We spent 18 months studying this, and studying online trafficking quickly led us to backpage.com because, again, that is where the majority of this commercial sex trafficking is occurring.  What we found was really shocking. Not only was backpage--as other websites have in the past--selling women and children online, but this organization and others are actually complicit in these crimes; in other words, they knew much more than we had previously thought. We found that backpage was actually knowingly selling people online.  We did this through a subpoena process that had to be approved here in the U.Senate because the company objected to responding to our subpoenas. For the first time in 21 years, we had to come to the U.Senate to get approval to actually enforce the subpoena. We then had to take it all the way to the Supreme Court because they appealed it all the way up, and we won.  Through this, we were able to get about 1 million documents. We went through these documents to find out what was happening. What we learned was that this website actually was actively and knowingly involved in selling people online. When a user would post an ad that might have a word indicating that the girl they were selling was underage--for instance, it might say ``cheerleader'' or it might simply reference the age of the girl being 16, 17 years old or younger sometimes--instead of rejecting that ad, knowing that it was of course illegal, they would instead clean up the ad; in other words, they would edit out the words that indicated someone was underage. They didn't just remove the post because they didn't want to lose the revenue--and you can imagine this is a very lucrative business. They just insisted that the ad be edited.  By the way, this also covered up the evidence of the crime, so it was then harder for law enforcement to find out who was involved in the selling of girls online--and underage girls. Of course, it also increased the company's profits. That is what we found in our investigation.  We also found that for years and years people who had been trying to hold these websites accountable in court had failed, and they had failed and been unsuccessful because of a Federal law that, in essence, said to these websites: You have an immunity to be able to do this. You couldn't do it on the street corner, but online you have an immunity to be able to do it.  I recommend a powerful documentary. It is called ``I am Jane Doe.'' You[[Page S1661]]can find it on iamjanedoe.com. It is on It tells the story of underage girls who have been exploited on backpage. It talks about the trauma they have experienced, and, finally, it also talks about their frustration with their inability to hold these websites accountable.  What might surprise you is the reason these websites are not held accountable--the more we dug into it, the more it became clear--is that Washington basically passed a Federal law, which I believe has been misinterpreted by the courts, but it has been interpreted by the courts to say that these websites have no risk, that they are not liable, and that they have an immunity under Federal law. It is called the Communications Decency  The Communications Decency Act was enacted back in 1996, when the internet was in its infancy. It was intended to protect websites from liability based on third-party posts on that website. I understand the intention of Congress, but it now protects websites when they knowingly allow this criminal activity--the crime of sex trafficking--to occur through their site.  I believe Congress meant well when enacting this law. In fact, part of its original intent was actually to protect children from indecent material on the internet by holding individuals liable for sending explicit material to those children.  Now that same law is being used as a shield by websites that promote and engage in online sex trafficking with immunity. I don't believe Congress ever intended this broad liability protection for websites that actively and knowingly facilitate online sex trafficking, but the legal interpretation of the law has led to this. That is why America's district attorneys, 50 State attorneys general, judges all over the country, and so many others have called on Congress to amend this Communications Decency law and fix this injustice--really, this loophole.  Last year, a Sacramento judge threw out pimping charges against backpage and directly called on Congress to act. Here is what this judge said--again, this sort of message has been repeated by other courts: ``If and until Congress sees fit to amend the immunity law, the broad reach of section 230 of the Communications Decency Act even applies to those alleged to support the exploitation of others by human trafficking.'' That is not just a suggestion; it is an invitation--an invitation to this Congress to act, calling on us to do what we were sent here to do, which is to craft laws that promote justice.  For too long, victims of online sex trafficking have been denied the justice they deserve, and now we have the opportunity here in the Senate--I hope within the next week--to fix that.  Last August, I introduced legislation called the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, or SESTA, with a bipartisan group of 24 cosponsors, including my coauthor, Senator Richard Blumenthal, and Senators John McCain, Claire McCaskill, John Cornyn, Heidi Heitkamp, and others.  SESTA would provide justice for victims of online sex trafficking and hold accountable those websites that intentionally facilitate these crimes. We do this by making two very narrowly crafted changes to Federal law. First, we remove the Communications Decency Act's broad liability protections for a narrow set of bad-actor websites that knowingly facilitate sex trafficking crimes--high standard: knowingly. Second, the legislation allows State attorneys general to prosecute websites that violate existing Federal trafficking laws. SESTA simply says that if you are violating Federal sex trafficking laws and you are knowingly facilitating it, then you have to be held to account. That seems to make all the sense in the world, and it will make a big difference for these girls and women who are being exploited online.  Our bill protects websites that are doing the right thing, by the way. In fact, it preserves what is called the Good Samaritan provision of the Communications Decency Act, which protects good actors who proactively block and screen their sites for offensive material, and thus it shields them from frivolous lawsuits. I think that is appropriate. We simply carve out a very limited exception in the Communications Decency Act's liability protections for those who knowingly facilitate sex trafficking.  By the way, there are already exceptions for things in this law--exceptions for things like copyright infringement. This isn't a new idea. So unless you think protecting copyrights is more important than protecting women and children from the trauma of trafficking, you should be for this. Even those who support section 230 otherwise should strongly support this.  If a prosecutor can prove in court that a website has committed these acts, SESTA allows that website to be held liable and the victims to get the justice they deserve.  By the way, 68 Senators now--more than two-thirds of this body--have signed on as cosponsors of this legislation, a majority of Republicans and a majority of That doesn't happen very often around here. The House of Representatives passed SESTA as an amendment to a broader anti-sex trafficking bill just a couple of weeks ago by an overwhelming margin--more than 300 folks. The Trump administration has endorsed this solution and again shown a commitment to the issue. So SESTA has overwhelming support from the White House, from more than 300 House Members, and from the 68 Senators who signed on to be a part of this solution.  I think one reason it has gotten so much support is because of the logic of the legislation, the fact that we narrowly drew up the legislation not to affect internet freedom, to be sure we were listening to people who had concerns, but also, and more importantly, because we are all hearing about this issue back home. We are all hearing the stories, and they are powerful, they are compelling, and they are heartbreaking.  Kubiiki Pride came to Congress, to our subcommittee, as we were looking into this issue and told us her story. In testimony, she said: My daughter ran away from home. She had gone missing. She had been missing for several weeks. Obviously, I was very concerned. I couldn't find her. Someone suggested that I look at this website called backpage, so I did. I found my daughter.  She found her daughter--14 years old--but found her daughter in very sexually difficult photographs, horrible photographs of her beautiful daughter. So she called backpage.com and said: I am Kubiiki Pride, and that is my daughter on your website. She is 14 years old. I am so glad I found her. Thank you for taking down that ad. She is 14 years old.  Do you know what the person on the other end of the phone said? They said: Did you post the ad?  This is how evil these people are.  She said: No, I didn't post the ad. That is my daughter. I have been trying to find her. She has been missing for several weeks.  They said: If you didn't post the ad, if you didn't pay for it, you can't take it down and we won't take it down.  That is what we are dealing with here.  Eventually, she found her daughter, got her daughter back. She went through the proper process to be able to hold backpage accountable, and guess what. The court said: Under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act--Congress wrote this bill--this website has immunity, even though she is 14 years old and she was being sold online.  So I think that is why 68 Senators have said: Let's step up and do this. This is something we can do around here that is not partisan, that isn't about politics. It is about people. It is about human dignity. It is about ensuring that more girls like Kubiiki Pride's daughter don't have to go through this trauma, that more women and children can live out their life's purpose without having to go through this trauma. I think that is why we have been able to find so many Members who want to step up and do something here and do something that will really make a difference.  So let's vote on this legislation in the next week. Let's get it signed into law so that more children and more women are not exploited through this brutally efficient online process of selling people. If we do this, we are going to be able to provide justice to those victims who deserve it, and we are going to make this world a little better place. I urge the Senate to vote this next week.[[Page S1662]]  For those Members who are not yet a part of this legislation, we urge you to join us. Wouldn't it be great to have everybody on board to correct this injustice, to close this loophole, and to ensure that everybody has the ability to meet their God-given purpose in life?  I yield the floor.  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

It is the question of gun violence and what Congress is doing about the problem of gun violence.  I want to start by invoking something that all of the schoolchildren of America know about, which is the idea of a social contract.  You can go back and read John Locke or Thomas Hobbes, or Rousseau, but all of them began with the idea that, in the state of nature, we are all in a dangerous and perilous condition because there is no law. It is the rule of the jungle. Hobbes said that the state of nature was a condition that was solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short. Because of that, people enter into civil society to create a government.  The first principle of government is that we have got to protect our people. As Cicero put it, the safety and good of the people must be the highest law. That is why we have a social contract.  But, Mr.Speaker, in America today, our social contract is bruised and battered and damaged and tenuous because of the gun violence which has come to our public schools, to our universities, to our churches, to our movie theaters, to the public square.  America's high school students have woken us up to the fact that this is not a normal condition. America is an absolute outlier nation in terms of the levels of gun violence that we permit to take place in our own society. Our social contract is threatened by the gun violence that is a menace to every single American citizen.  Now, we have a social contract, we have got a social covenant, and it is the Constitution of the United We know that we have an amendment in there which deals specifically with the question of guns, the Second Amendment, which says: ``A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.''  That is the Second                              {time}  1700  Now, some people would have us believe that, because of the Second Amendment, there is nothing that we can do about the problem of gun violence. If you remember nothing else about what I am about to say, please remember this: this is demonstrably, absolutely, categorically false, and we know it is false because the Supreme Court has told us that it is false.  In its 2008 decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, the Supreme Court adopted the individual rights view of the Second There was a contest between those who said, no, you only have a right to bear arms in connection with militia service versus those who said that it is an individual right. The individual right won in a 5-4 decision.  But in the course of making that 5-4 decision, the majority on the Supreme Court agreed, readily, that the right to bear arms is one that can be conditioned on all kinds of regulation by the government. That is true of all of the rights in the Bill of  Think about the First Amendment, which guarantees all of us the right to speak. You have a right to go protest across the street from the White House, but do you have the right to go protest across the street from the White House at 2 in the morning with 20,000 people without getting a permit? Of course, you do not.  The Supreme Court has said that the exercise of First Amendment rights is conditioned by reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions. And in the same sense, the Second Amendment right to keep and to bear arms is conditioned on reasonable time, place, manner, and use restrictions by the government. We know that to be the case. The Supreme Court told us that in  In Heller, the Court said everybody has a right to the possession of a handgun for purposes of self-defense; everybody's got a right to a rifle for purposes of hunting and recreation. But nobody's got a right to possess a machine gun, even though someone might describe it as an arm; nobody's got a right to possess a sawed-off shotgun, much less does anybody have a right to access a weapon without going through a background check, without going through the government's policy for determining that you are not going to be a danger to yourself or to other people. The Supreme Court was very clear about that.  Those people who were out there saying, ``We can't allow any gun safety regulation or we are going to lose the right to have guns, our guns are going to be taken away,'' are engaging in a knowing falsehood. There is no way that the guns of the people of America--the hundreds of millions of guns that are out there--could be confiscated. They can't be confiscated.  People have a right to them for purposes of self-defense and for purposes of hunting and recreation, but it doesn't give you a right to an AR-15. It doesn't give you a right to carry weapons of war into public schools and into movie theaters and into public places, and it does not give you the right to access guns without a background check, yet that is precisely what the law is today. We have a huge gaping loophole where terrorists can go to a gun show and simply buy a gun without any background check at all.  Now, here is the good news that people want to keep from you. We have great news, Mr.Speaker, we know there is good news, and here is the good news.  We have a consensus about what to do in America, starting with a universal criminal and mental background check, supported by, no longer, 95 percent of the American people. In the wake of the Parkland massacre, it is 97 percent of the people who think that you should not be able to access a weapon without first passing a background check.  That is the vast majority of the people, maybe almost a unanimous verdict by the American people. Almost everybody believes that we need to close the gun show loophole, we need to close the internet gun sale loophole, we need to close the 7-Eleven parking lot loophole, and we need to close the loophole that would allow criminals and gangsters and terrorists to go to a gun show and purchase a gun. Ninety-seven percent of the American people agree with that.  Sixty-seven percent of the American people agree with the call of the young people who survived the massacre in Parkland, which took the lives of 17 students and teachers, the call for a ban on assault weapons. Sixty-seven percent of the American people, more than two-thirds of the American people, agree with a ban on the sale of military-style assault weapons.  And 75 percent of the American people say that Congress must be acting to reduce gun violence. So we have a consensus over what to do.  But what is happening now?  Well, I serve on the House Judiciary Committee, Mr.Speaker, and we had a vote today that had nothing to do with guns. It was about collecting data on[[Page H1470]]bail policies, which is not to say that that is unimportant; but, seriously, millions of people in America are demanding action from Congress, and we can't even have a hearing on the problem of people accessing assault weapons and going to public schools and assassinating our school children at pointblank range.  Now, I had the good fortune of meeting some of the young people from Parkland who have awoken the conscience of the country. One of them was asked a question: Why, suddenly, is America waking up in the wake of the Parkland massacre, which took the lives of 17 people, but it didn't in the same way after the massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, at Sandy Hook, which took the lives of even more people, 26 people?  She had a fascinating answer. She said: Most of the people killed at Sandy Hook were first graders, and first graders can't start a revolution against the political power of the NRA; but high school students know how to do it because they understand how to contact people, and they know social media. They know Facebook and Twitter, and they have enough education so that they can speak with authority about the recklessness and the negligence of government not addressing the problem.  Congress now is the outlier. Congress will not act.  Are we a failed state such that when more than 95 percent of the American people agree that something needs to be done, Congress cannot act?  Are we abandoning our social contract?  Are we abandoning our primary commitment to defend the lives of our own people?  Well, it is a very serious moment. We are having our Special Order hour on the problem of gun violence, the failure of Congress to act, but the need for Congress to act.

1053,topic-id,1807,"Mr.Speaker, we are so grateful for Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal from Washington, for her powerful leadership and her lucid discussion today of the gun violence problem.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for placing emphasis on the fact that we have had no hearings in our Congress since we arrived here more than a year ago on the problem of gun violence in the House Judiciary  Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for placing emphasis on the Dickey amendment, which forbids the expenditure of any public money even to research the epidemiology of gun violence and gun violence epidemics in the way that certain outbreaks of gun violence and mass shootings will trigger others.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman also for placing emphasis on the fact that the Newtown families who come to lobby in Washington, the families from Parkland, just want to see us break the logjam; they just want to see us end the paralysis and do something. And why not start with the thing that is backed by more than 9 out of 10 Americans, a universal criminal and mental background check so that people who are carrying guns in America are the lawful gun owners who can do it responsibly? That is something that the overwhelming majority of American people believe in, yet this Congress seems to be completely stuck, totally hamstrung.  Mr.Speaker, please help us dislodge this legislation.  Now, Congresswoman Jayapal praised her home State of Washington, rightfully, for the actions they have taken recently to ban the bump stocks and to pass other commonsense gun safety reforms.  I would like to talk about what has happened in my home State, the great State of Maryland, which is touching Washington, D.C., where we all are right now.  In 2013, after the catastrophe took place in Newtown, Connecticut, at Sandy Hook, where an AR-15 was used to assassinate 26 people at pointblank range, we acted in We passed a ban on the sale of military-style assault weapons. We passed a ban on high-capacity magazines.  We gave our State police the right to engage in frequent and unannounced inspections of the gun dealers so that bad apple gun dealers couldn't be dealing firearms directly into the underground.  Then we said if a firearm is lost or stolen, it has got to be reported within 48 hours, and if not, that is a misdemeanor, because what was happening was they were selling guns to criminals, they would surface in a homicide investigation 10 months later, we would trace it back to the gun dealers, and the dealers would say: Oh, yeah. That was stolen. We forgot to report it.  Or they would say: We lost that, but, yeah, we never filed a report.  So now, in our State, you have got to file a report--commonsense gun safety supported by people across the spectrum--so we don't have a leaky system where guns are getting into the wrong hands.  Now, our opponents on this, of course, marched and protested and said they were opposed to all of it. They said this was an attempt to confiscate everybody's guns, which, of course, it was not. And responsible law-abiding gun owners have all the guns that they had before, they have still got them, but it was challenged in court. They said it violated the Second  I raise it because I want America to notice this. They sued in the United States District Court in Maryland, and they lost. And the court said, reading the District of Columbia v. Heller decision in 2008, that the Second Amendment permits reasonable gun safety regulation that does not infringe on the fundamental right to bear arms for self-defense or to have rifles for hunting or recreation, but there is no right for civilians to be carrying military-style hardware and weaponry in public.  They appealed it to the Fourth Circuit Court of The Fourth Circuit affirmed the ruling of the district court.  Then they brought it to the United States Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court let that ruling stand.  So there is a perfect example of how you can enact reasonable gun safety regulation and it doesn't infringe anybody's Second Amendment rights and it doesn't impinge on the right of reasonable, law-abiding gun owners to have guns for lawful purposes.  So why are we involved in this terrible, atrocious situation where we have rates of death and fatality and injury greater than six times higher than any other modern industrialized country on Earth?  In the U.K., it is less than 50 people a year who die by gun; in Japan, it is less than 50 or 60 people a year. We are losing tens of thousands of Americans every year.  Is it because we have mental illness and they don't? They have got mental illness, too. Is it because Americans are more violent than other people? I don't think so.  It is simply because of the ready access to firearms wherever you go, and anybody can get them almost anywhere. Okay? So we need to follow the rest of the world in terms of enacting reasonable gun safety legislation.  Now, we have got our Second Amendment, so nobody's handguns are going to get taken away. The Supreme Court said it in the Heller decision and reaffirmed that 2 years later, that it applies not just in the District of Columbia directly against Congress, but it applies in the States, in a case that came out of  So we know that nobody's handguns are going to be taken away and nobody's rifles are going to be taken away.  All we are talking about is keeping our children and our grandchildren[[Page H1472]]safe; keeping people safe at concerts, like in Las Vegas; keeping people safe in church, like in South Carolina; keeping people safe in their public schools, like in Parkland, Florida; keeping college students safe, like at Virginia That is what we are talking about doing.  Now, we don't know why Congress won't act. Some people are starting to hypothesize that America has become a failed state, that we can't respond to an almost unanimous demand by our own people to legislate in the interests of public safety, which is the most elementary requirement of a civilized society under a social contract.  Some people say we have become a failed state, like failed states we see around the world. You know that authoritarianism is on the march all over the world, whether it is in Putin's Russia or Duterte's Philippines or Orban's Hungary or Erdogan's Turkey, where it is all about enriching the people in power--ignoring the needs of the people, ignoring the rights of the people, but instead, using government as a money-making operation for a tiny group of people.  Have we become a failed state? Is that what we are? I don't think we are a failed state.  We have had other periods in American history where Congress has refused to deal with pressing public policy problems. One of the most famous ones, beginning in the 1830s, was when a proslavery faction within Congress said it would refuse to have any hearings at all and would refuse to entertain any petitions against slavery from anywhere in the country. It was a direct assault on the right to petition Congress for redress of grievances, it was a direct assault on the freedom of speech, but they imposed this stranglehold on Congress so there could be no debate on the most pressing issue of the day.  Now, I am not likening slavery to gun violence. Okay? I want to be clear about that. But I am saying that there are other times in American history where Congress has acted as a chokehold against the ventilation of serious public concerns and grievances. There have been times when Congress has refused to engage in debate, discussion, and analysis of the most pressing problems of the day, and that is where we are right now on gun violence.  All we are saying, Mr.Speaker, to the majority in Congress, is let's have some hearings on this, let's have some hearings on a universal criminal and mental background check being demanded by nearly every American right now. Let's start with that. Is that one thing we can all agree on, that there should be a background check before people go out and obtain weapons of war that they then carry into the hallways and the schoolrooms of our country? Can we have a hearing on that?  If you don't want to vote for it, you can stand up with the 1 or 2 percent of the people who are against it, but allow those of us who want to represent the 97 or 98 percent of the people who are for it to have a vote, because we don't think that terrorists and criminals should be able to go to a gun show and purchase firearms, including AR-15s, without a criminal background check. We don't think that.  So, Mr.Speaker, we have got a consensus in America on this. Let's not stifle the consensus. Let's not choke off the ability of the American people and their representatives to govern. That is why we were sent here, to legislate.  The essence of legislation is hearings. We have to hear the American people, we have to hear the experts, we have to collect the evidence. We have got to overturn the ban on the collection of statistics about gun violence that was imposed a few decades ago on the We have got to collect the information, and we have to act.  The time for just prayers and meditation about the problem is long gone, as the young people from Parkland, Florida, have told us.  They were told in the wake of the massacre: It is too early to start debating gun policy.  They turned around, and they said: It is too late to be debating gun policy. This should have been done after Las It should have been done after San Bernardino It should have been done after the Sandy Hook massacre. It should have been done after Virginia  How many more massacres do we have to await before this Congress decides something really must be done? How many more massacres? That is what America is asking us, Mr. Please, let's do our job. We have sworn an oath to the American people. Let's go and represent the public will, let's make it consistent with the Second Amendment, because it is very easy to do so. We proved it in the State of Maryland, and the Supreme Court has told us we can pass reasonable commonsense gun safety measures without violating anyone's rights.  We have got a consensus in In Congress, we have got to do our job and let that consensus become the law.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-07-pt1-PgH1469.txt,1835,"ECONOMIC GROWTH, REGULATORY RELIEF, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT--",2018.0,7.0,March

1348,topic-id,1981,"Mr.Speaker, I wanted to bring the good news to Congress about where we are on the gun violence debate because I know there have been a lot of accusations flying back and forth. I want us to look for the common ground. I want to bring the good news today.[[Page H1497]]  The good news is that we actually have an overwhelming policy consensus in America as to what we need to do about gun violence, and we have an overwhelming--indeed, a unanimous--judicial consensus about what is constitutional to do.  I want us to focus on that, and then that will allow us to isolate what the problem is in dislodging the paralysis in Washington today. But let's start with the overwhelming policy consensus that has emerged in the wake of a sequence of massacres, and it is enough to invoke their names to remind people of the bloodshed that is engulfing our society in Parkland, Florida; in San Bernardino, California; in Las Vegas; in Texas; at Virginia Tech; at Sandy Hook in Newtown, Connecticut; and so on. In the wake of all these massacres, America is demanding action.  But here is the good news. Everybody has agreed. As close to a unanimous agreement as you are ever going to find in the United States of America has emerged: 97 percent of the American people favor a universal criminal and mental background check on all firearm purchases in  That is the overwhelming majority of Democrats, the overwhelming majority of Republicans, the overwhelming majority of Independents, the overwhelming majority of gun owners, and the overwhelming majority of non-gun owners. Almost everyone in America, 97 out of 100 people--and if you take the margin of error, it might be 99 out of 100 people--agree that firearms should not be sold without a background check so that criminals, gang members, and terrorists can't go to a gun show and acquire a weapon of war and then use it in our schools, in our movie theaters, in our churches, and in the public square.  So we have got virtually unanimous public consensus on that. Every public opinion poll is showing the same thing, except the numbers continue to go up.  Now, some people will say in response to this: Aha, but the Second Amendment won't allow us to do anything.  There are a lot of people in this debate who are now wrapping themselves in the flag of the Second Amendment and saying that the Second Amendment prohibits us from implementing this overwhelming public mandate for a universal criminal and mental background check; but they are wrong, and we know that they are wrong.  The Supreme Court, in 2008, in the District of Columbia v. Heller case, interpreted the Second Amendment definitively for us, at least sufficiently for us to understand that a background check is perfectly constitutional.  In the Heller case, the Supreme Court first divided over the question of whether or not the Second Amendment confers a collective militia-based right or an individual right. Four Justices said that the text of the Second Amendment means that you only have a right to a firearm in connection with militia service, which today we would call National Guard service.  You will recall the language of the Second Amendment is: ``A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.''  Four Justices suggested that your right to bear and keep an arm is tethered to service in the militia. But that view lost. Five Justices took the individual rights view that the so-called prefatory clause just announces the purpose of the Second Amendment, but it defines an individual right.  But nine Justices, the entire Supreme Court, agreed that, whether the right was collective or individual in nature, that right is subject to reasonable regulation by Congress and by the Of course, that has got to be right. Every right, all fundamental rights, are subject to reasonable regulation by the government.  Think about the First Amendment, which guarantees the right of free speech. It gives you the right to go out and march in front of the White House, but does it give you the right to march in front of the White House at 2 o'clock in the morning with bullhorns and to wake up the President's family? Of course not.  The First Amendment is conditioned on reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions the Supreme Court held in a case called Ward v. Rock Against Racism, where the Court said it was perfectly fine for New York City to turn the sound down when they have a concert in Central Park because there are other social activities taking place.  The Second Amendment is the exact same way, said the Supreme You have the right to possess a handgun for self-defense. You have a right to possess a rifle for purposes of hunting and recreation. You don't have a right to a machine gun. There is no constitutional right to carry a sawed-off shotgun.  There is no constitutional right to carry weapons of war in public places. There is no right to carry a firearm in public buildings, said Justice Scalia, into public schools and into the U.There is no constitutional right for that, and there is certainly no constitutional right for anybody to access a weapon without passing through the regulatory screen that the government sets up.  That is the common sense of the American people, too. Thomas Paine, who wrote the pamphlet ``Common Sense,'' said that common sense is essential in a democracy because it is the sense that we have in common. The sense that we have in common today about guns that we need a universal criminal and mental background check is something that is nearly unanimously held, and it is something that clearly passes constitutional muster according to the Supreme Court's decision in the District of Columbia v. Heller in 2008.  So we have got a public policy consensus, a popular consensus, and a constitutional juridical consensus about the right thing to do and the constitutional thing to do. Yet what do we have here in Congress? We have got paralysis. We have got absolute inaction in defiance of the public will.  Why? Nobody really says. The GOP leaders, Mr.Speaker, simply refuse to bring a universal background check bill to the floor of They won't even permit a hearing in the House Judiciary Committee about it, despite the fact that that is what everybody wants and that is what the times demand right now.  Why? Have we become a failed state?                              {time}  1215  Are we unable to govern?  Does democracy not work anymore?  Is that what we are saying?  I hope not. I hope we have not become a failed I hope we are able to address the public safety needs of the people. I hope we are able to address the democratic will of the American public. I hope we are able to effectuate the majority will of Congress, because we know that, forced to a vote, a majority of Congress would support this.  So what is going on?  Well, James Madison, in Federalist Paper 10, predicted it well when he talked about the problem of faction. He talked about a minority of people animated by some passion or some common interest that goes against the rights of the rest of the public and against the common good, against the general interest of the people.  But our institutions have got to be set up to legislate over the demands of one small faction, the 2 or 3 percent of the people who don't want to see a universal background check because they spread the mythology that any gun safety regulation will lead to a confiscation of people's firearms, which is utterly absurd and ridiculous and demonstrably false.  Yet, that tiny group of people, that tiny faction, has been allowed in this Congress to control the public agenda and to dictate to everybody else, when we have tens of thousands, and soon, on Saturday, March 24th, hundreds of thousands of young people marching for the most elementary rights of life in a civil society.  And what is that?  The right to security and safety--the whole reason we have got a social contract. If you read your Thomas Hobbes, you read your John Locke, you read your Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the whole basis of civil society is that we will be safer entering into the social contract than we would be if we stuck it out in the state of nature, which John Locke and Thomas Hobbes described as a war of all against all, where life is nasty, poor, brutish, and short.  So we are asking for the leadership in Congress simply to act. Let us bring this bill to the floor of Congress, and[[Page H1498]]stop with the distractions and the deflections and the diversions. They can bring up 50 other things. The people of America know, with our common sense, that we need a universal criminal and mental background check for everyone.  Mr.Speaker, I would love it if someone could explain why that legislation is not allowed to see the light of day on the floor of the House with not even a hearing or a vote in the House Judiciary This is a public emergency. The young people of America, beginning with the heroic kids, the survivors in Parkland, Florida, will not let us off the hook.  One of them was asked the question: Well, why suddenly have you unleashed this revolution across the country against one minor faction control of all of Congress? Why did it happen now, but it didn't happen back at Sandy Hook?  One of the young leaders said: ``At Sandy Hook, they assassinated first graders with an AR-15 at pointblank range; but in Parkland, Florida, they assassinated high school students. We are more educated and we have a voice and we know how social media works.''  There is no putting the genie back in the bottle. There is going to be no avoiding this question. At the very least, we must have a vote on a universal criminal and mental background check for all firearm purchases in the United States of The people want it. The Supreme Court has made it clear that such legislation is constitutional.  In Maryland, in 2013, we passed not only fingerprint licensing and universal background checks, we passed a ban on military-style assault weapons, a ban on high-capacity magazines. These are bans that are, again, favored by more than two-thirds of the American people.  It was challenged in Federal district court in Maryland and it was upheld against Second Amendment attack. They appealed to the Fourth Circuit of It was upheld against Second Amendment attack. They went to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court let it stand.  So within the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, within our circuit, we have already got all of the legislation upheld as constitutional, which some people are saying you can't do because of the Second  Stop hiding behind the Second Stop hiding behind it. The Second Amendment is just like every other amendment. You can pass a reasonable regulation, as long as you don't destroy the underlying right itself.  Nobody is trying to take away anyone's handgun for self-defense. No one is trying to take away anyone's rifle for hunting and recreational purposes. But you don't need an AR-15 in order to go hunting. Any real hunter will tell you.  You certainly don't need to allow the sale of firearms in the United States of America to criminals and terrorists and gang members in order to support the Second That is ludicrous. It is absurd. We should stop spreading that propaganda. I think it is just so important that we get this message out to the American public.

1732,topic-id,531,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Mr.Perlmutter very much for yielding for just a moment. I was very moved by his comments. We know that eternal vigilance is the price of liberty, and I want to salute him for his vigilance and his zealousness in defending American freedom and our democratic process against foreign and potentially domestic enemies, those who would subvert and undermine our political processes.  It seems to me that, in Congress, we have two jobs that we need to do now. One is to defend the Mueller investigation and the Department of Justice against unfair attacks and attempts to subvert and undermine investigation; and two, and perhaps more importantly now, is we have got to work to fortify our election systems against a repeat in 2018.  The U.intelligence agencies, they told us, in January of 2017, that there had been a campaign of cyber espionage and cyber sabotage and cyber propaganda against the American elections. They have told us that the Russians are very likely to be doing the same thing with respect to the 2018 election. And, by the way, it is not just the Russians now. They may have just set the template for other bad actors who want to stick their nose into American elections, too.  You know, James Wilson wrote this book called, ``Broken Windows,''[[Page H1475]]where he said if somebody throws a rock into a window and you have got a broken window and nobody does anything about it, it is an invitation for more people to come along and break some more windows. Well, right now, the U.Government has done nothing.  As you have said, we have not spent the money in the State Department to try to defend ourselves against the foreign subversion of our elections and cyber espionage and sabotage. And when we had the Attorney General come to the Judiciary Committee, we asked him what had he engaged in to try to defend our elections across the country against another attack, and he said basically nothing. And followup efforts by members of the committee to get the Attorney General to meet with us have resulted in nothing.  So, this week, we have asked for $14 million from the appropriators to go to the Election Assistance Commission, which is the only Federal body we have got that is charged with trying to help State election administrators defend themselves against cyber attack. That $14 million is urgent and necessary, and it is obviously a very small sum of money, given the amount of money we spend on defense in America, but this is defense of our elections.  We are also asking for $400 million to help update outmoded and weak election technology in the States today. That is another badly needed infusion of cash to the States so we can fortify our elections. We know that at least 22 States suffered attempted electronic probes by foreign actors in 2016, and they are coming back in 2018, and everybody wants to know what are we doing about it, and we have no coordinated plan. At the very least, we should get this money to the Election Assistance Commission so we can help the States harden themselves.

Nationally, the unemployment rate increased from 5 percent in January 2008 to 10 percent in October 2009, and in Rhode Island, the unemployment rate was even higher, increasing from 6.2 percent in January 2008 to 11.9 percent in December 2009.  In short, we had to do something to respond and avoid another financial crisis because behind each of these harrowing numbers were our constituents and their families, who saw their life savings, their jobs, and their homes evaporate in a flash. That something was the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, also known as the Dodd-Frank  I am proud to have drafted and supported several of its provisions, such as the creation of a consumer watchdog--the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the CFPB--whose primary focus has been on protecting consumers from unscrupulous financial activities; my bipartisan language calling for a dedicated Office of Servicemember Affairs at the CFPB, which helps ensure that our servicemembers and their families are protected in the consumer finance space in the same way these service men and women protect us. That is now a part of the CFPB, and it has done remarkable work protecting the men and women of our armed services, who do remarkable work protecting us.  Also , I was able to provide an additional $1 billion in funding through the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, which provided targeted emergency assistance to help local communities acquire, redevelop, or demolish foreclosed properties.  Frankly, in the wake of the crisis, every city and many rural areas were seeing foreclosed properties sitting there, reminding us all of the devastation. With these resources, they could be repurposed for families to live in, or if they were decrepit, they could be demolished for urban development and economic development in rural areas.  These are just a handful of the many good and worthwhile provisions in the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, but, like any other major piece of legislation, it was not perfect.  Years ago, the custom here was that we would come together and agree on technical fixes to comprehensive legislation. It was almost predictable that after we had a complex piece of legislation, we would discover unintended consequences, and we would come together on a bipartisan basis to fix those technical issues without having to relitigate the entire bill.  Unfortunately, that moment to make needed fixes never happened, and while the legislation before us today makes changes to the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, I am concerned that this legislation may actually go too far and go beyond the needed technical fixes. For example, I worry that this legislation may actually make it tougher for community banks and credit unions to compete against the larger financial institutions despite the regulatory relief provisions in this bill for smaller financial institutions. This is because the legislation encourages large financial institutions to grow even larger--from $50 billion up to $250 billion. It does so, in part, by removing some of the extra oversight provisions we put in place with the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, such as making sure large banks undergo strong and robust stress tests to ensure that they have their own sufficient rainy day fund and that any type of problem is not funded by taxpayer bailouts.  In addition, this legislation may further encourage larger financial institutions to grow by increasing their competitive edge for the kinds of businesses and customers currently served by community banks and credit unions, which should be concerning to all who support our smaller local financial institutions. Larger institutions can absorb more costs than smaller institutions. They can have programs that cost them a lot in the short run but drive out the competition in the medium and long run. Because they can stretch costs over bigger institutions, they can provide services that might be better provided or more personally provided by smaller institutions, but these will be pushed out of the marketplace. So the potential net result of this bill, ironically, may make it more difficult for regulators to spot a threat to financial stability from a larger bank while increasing competitive pressures on community banks and credit unions.  To address some of these concerns, I have filed several amendments to improve the bill and add needed protections for consumers. Let me describe some of these amendments in greater detail.  One amendment seeks to prioritize regulatory relief for institutions with a strong history of doing right by their customers. In the legislation before us, Federal financial regulators are given the discretion to provide regulatory relief to certain financial institutions, and in so doing, to consider factors they deem appropriate. My amendment simply directs the regulators, when exercising this discretion, to also consider whether the financial institution, in the preceding 24-month period, paid any Federal fines or penalties and to consider whether there was any violation or settlement related to an alleged violation of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act--the SCRA--or the Military Lending Act and if these violations could have been avoided. Again, that is a strong emphasis on protecting the men and women who protect us--our servicemembers. These two pieces of legislation, the SCRA--the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act--and the Military Lending Act, are the strongest protections our servicemen and women have against financial abuse by institutions.  In short, how well an institution serves its customers, including our servicemembers, should help determine whether certain financial institutions deserve the regulatory relief provided under the bill.  On a very strong bipartisan basis, I hope we can adopt this amendment. It just seems so clear to me that when we are giving relief, we should give it to those who have earned it--those institutions that have treated our service men and women well and have treated their customers well.  Another amendment I filed would empower the CFPB and its Office of Servicemember Affairs to enforce existing SCRA safeguards--the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act safeguards--such as those that protect our servicemembers from being overcharged. This amendment is needed because, despite the importance of the SCRA's protections to our servicemembers, enforcement of this critical law has been inconsistent and subject to the discretion[[Page S1410]]of our financial regulators, which can change with each  According to a July 2012 report from the Government Accountability Office, the estimated percentage of depository institutions that serviced mortgages that were examined for SCRA compliance varied widely, ranging from rates of 4 percent in 2007, 17 percent in 2008, 18 percent in 2009, 26 percent in 2010, and then dropping down to 15 percent in 2011. You can see that sort of tracked with the financial crisis, where at a point after 2007 and 2008, the regulators understood the threats that were being posed to service men and women in terms of their mortgage obligations. But that seems to be fading. We can't lose focus on protecting the men and women who serve us.  As someone who has had the experience and privilege of leading soldiers as an executive officer of a paratrooper company, I spent a lot of time trying to explain to people who were trying to collect from men and women in uniform that they couldn't because the law had set certain interest rates that they exceeded and that they couldn't because they were violating--back then it was called the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief We need an agency of the government, not individual members of the Armed Forces, to protect these men and women. I think that is what we are trying to do with this legislation.  Simply put, prioritizing the consumer protection of our service men and women should not be discretionary; it should be mandatory. This amendment ensures that the SCRA enforcement will be permanently a priority of the CFPB and the Office of Servicemember It is supported by more than 30 organizations, including the National Military Family Association, Military Officers Association of America, Veterans Education Success, Student Veterans of America, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United  We also need to do more to protect student loan borrowers. There is a growing private market to refinance student loans, including Federal student loans. I filed an amendment to require lenders to disclose the benefits that borrowers might forfeit, such as income-driven repayment plans, loan forgiveness, and deferment options, when they refinance a Federal loan into a private loan.  I have also filed an amendment to clarify that the Education Loan Ombudsman at the CFPB should monitor and report student loan complaints for all education loans, including Federal student loans.  Additionally, I support Senator Durbin's amendment to strengthen student loan servicing and protections for private student loan borrowers and to provide greater transparency and accountability for campus-based banking products beyond just credit cards. We have all read about the many abuses that have taken place, and we owe it to consumers everywhere to ensure that these abuses are detected and prevented.  Continuing this focus on consumer protections, another of my amendments responds to the difficulties that Rhode Islanders face when trying to secure a loan modification by taking greater advantage of bank branches. If you are able to walk into a bank branch and get a mortgage, then you should also be able to walk into the same branch and get help to avoid preventable foreclosures. What we found in the crisis was that often this was not the case. They could get a loan at the branch, but if they needed any type of assistance, they had to call a servicer or go someplace else. My amendment, which is supported by the National Consumer Law Center and the National Association of REALTORS, establishes a pilot program to see whether this would be feasible--whether we could get bank branches not only to make loans but also to help borrowers when they come into difficult circumstances.  I have also filed an amendment that would direct GAO to conduct a retrospective study of the impact of the provisions of this legislation on economic growth and consumer protection. Specifically, my amendment asks GAO to evaluate the bill's impact on non-managerial wages, senior executive pay, stock buybacks, the interest paid on savings or money market accounts, jobs being moved abroad, foreclosure rates, and enforcement actions.  In so doing, we will be able to determine whether the legislation actually delivers on the claims by its sponsors of economic growth and consumer protection. I think we always have to go back and check our work, and this provision would allow us, in a formal and systematic way, to check our work. I hope we can do that.  Finally, I have filed an amendment supported by the former Federal Reserve Chairman, Paul Volcker, to retain and strengthen the Federal Reserve's emergency safety and soundness powers. To quote Chairman Volcker: ``It's clear that circumstances can arise where the activities of some banks with less than $250 billion in assets would pose a grave threat to financial stability. To address such a threat, regulators have certain tools in their arsenal that we wish they will never have to use. Senator Reed's amendment wisely restores and strengthens one such tool, allowing it to be deployed under limited circumstances and only upon approval of a supermajority of the [Financial Stability Oversight] Council.''  Surely, at the very least, we should agree to preserve and strengthen the ability of our financial regulators to avoid grave threats and another financial crisis.  Before I conclude, I would like to make one further observation. Ten years ago today, few of us knew ahead of time that we would see an economy that would collapse into depths that we did not anticipate, that our Nation would literally recoil due to the recklessness and unchecked greed of too many on Wall We should not forget that, nationally, over 8.6 million jobs were lost between January 2008 and January 2010, with over 33,000 jobs lost in Rhode Island alone. If anything, the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was a sensible and long overdue response to the reality that people are nowhere near perfect and cannot always be trusted to do the right thing.  We learned in the hardest and most painful ways that certain safeguards are necessary. Unfortunately, the bill before us today removes some of those safeguards. Absent any serious changes made to the bill during this week's debate and for all the reasons I have stated, I cannot support it.  I yield the floor.

1417,topic-id,865,"Mr.President, let me thank Senator Udall for his kind remarks and his great leadership.  I rise today to add my voice to his voice and to that of so many of my colleagues in calling attention to the growing threat of climate change, and to encourage the Senate to take meaningful action. First, let me join all of my colleagues in recognizing and thanking my colleague, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse from Rhode His tireless work to raise awareness about the devastating impacts of climate change has truly made a remarkable difference in our country and around the world.  Senator Whitehouse comes to the Senate floor every week to tell us why it is ``time to wake up,'' and I am pleased to be able to join him as he gives his 200th such speech. These 200 speeches provide at least 200 reasons why we should be acting quickly and decisively to address climate change. Just one of those reasons, which I would like to highlight, is the impact of climate change on our national security. Climate change acts as a threat multiplier, exacerbating other problems in unstable areas around the world. It is already creating conflict related to a lack of resources, whether it is access to food, water, or energy.  I was just traveling through Djibouti and Somalia--adjacent to Yemen--and one of the great crises in Yemen is not just the conflict on the ground, but it is a water crisis that is causing massive drought. Then I moved on up to Jordan, and there spoke with our representatives. There is a water crisis in Jordan also and another threatened drought.  These national security problems are climate problems, and these climate problems are national security problems. When it comes to our national security, decisions are made through a careful evaluation of risks, and we must be sure to include risks caused by climate change. It is particularly troubling to me to see that the current Administration is instead choosing to ignore the reality of scientific consensus by removing all references to climate change from documents like the ``National Security Strategy'' and the ``National Defense Strategy.''  The Department of Defense must be able to execute its missions effectively and efficiently. So it is disconcerting that climate-related events have already cost the Pentagon significant resources--measured in both monetary costs as well as in negative impacts on military readiness.  In fact, Secretary Mattis, who understands these issues very well, and despite the official publication of the Department of Defense speaks very candidly and directly, has declared the following before the Senate Armed Services Committee:       Where climate change contributes to regional instability,      the Department of Defense must be aware of any potential      adverse impacts. . . . climate change is impacting stability      in areas of the world where our troops are operating today. .      . . and the Department should be prepared to mitigate any      consequences of a changing climate, including ensuring that      our shipyards and installations will continue to function as      required.[[Page S1679]]  Across the globe, we see our forces in conflict. They are in the Horn of They are there facing not just radical fighters, but drought and environmental issues. Here at home, we have shipyards and naval bases on the coast that are seeing rising waters that are going to cost us hundreds of millions of dollars to remediate so they can continue to function. If we don't respond, if we put our heads in the sand on the issues of climate change, our national security will be in endangered.  I was very pleased as the Ranking Member of the Armed Services Committee to support my colleagues when they included in the fiscal year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act a direction that the Department of Defense conduct a threat assessment and deliver a master plan for climate change adaptation. That was a bipartisan bill led by Chairman McCain and supported by vast numbers on both sides of the aisle who understand that climate change must be addressed. It also codified several findings related to climate change and expressed the sense of Congress that climate change is a threat to our national security. We are on record as a Congress saying that national security is jeopardized by climate change. That has to be embraced by the whole of government, not just the Senate or the House acting together.  I must commend our colleague--Sheldon's and my colleague--Congressman Jim Langevin of Rhode Island because he pushed for the same measure in the House of Representatives, and he was successful.  Just like other threats to our national security, it is critical that we recognize, plan for, and take steps to address climate change. Combating climate change may not seem as urgent as other threats we are facing today, but I would argue otherwise. If we don't begin to take aggressive action to protect ourselves from the effects of climate change, we will face ever increasing and severe consequences. Because of his clarion call to pay attention to climate change, Senator Whitehouse is advancing our national security interests in an important way, and I stand here to commend him and thank him.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2018-03-13-pt1-PgS1656-2.txt,1982,COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY REVIEW ACT,2018.0,13.0,March
210,topic-id,767,"Mr.President, as you may know, agriculture is vital to the economic success of my home State of Idaho, and ranching in particular has a long and proud history in the A rancher myself, I know that operating a ranch and managing land and cattle are challenging propositions that require quite a bit of industriousness and determination. While American ranches are often depicted as those with huge quantities of cattle and vast land holdings, it is important to remember the numerous small, family owned agricultural operations that exist all across our country. These smaller enterprises, like Colyer Herefords and Angus Ranch in Bruneau, are successful in part because they are committed to finding innovative ways to meet specific market demands. It is my pleasure as the chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship to recognize Colyer Herefords and Angus Ranch as the Senate Small Business of the Month for March 2018 and to highlight the unique story of their family focused small business.  Not only do small businesses like Colyer's make a positive economic impact to State, local, and national economies, but they also contribute to the well-being of our communities. A mainstay in the Bruneau community, the Colyers have been in business for more than 42 years. This family owned business has worked diligently, incorporated new innovations into their business model, and displayed dedication to the quality of their product.  Located just 60 miles southeast of Boise along the beautiful Snake River, Colyer Hereford and Angus Ranch has truly been a family run operation for decades. In 1976, the ranch's founders, Ray and Bonnie Colyer, sold their Bureau of Land Management permit and moved their herd to deeded lands and rented private lands in order to better monitor the health and quality of their cattle. This early commitment to the quality of their purebred bulls and sires has continued and is a key to their success in building a loyal customer base over the years. Innovation has also been a major focus for the Colyer family, passed from generation to generation. For example, in 1993, Ray and Bonnie added an Angus cattle herd to the ranch as a response to commercial customer demand for a breed of cattle uniquely suited to Idaho's environment. Additionally, the ranch has adapted a number of innovative technologies to help select the finest bulls and sires to breed superior cattle for their customers, including ultrasound, artificial insemination, DNA markers, herd management software, and embryo transplants.  Today the ranch is managed by Ray and Bonnie's son and grandson, Guy and Kyle and his sister Katie grew up helping out on the family ranch, which fostered their shared love of the industry. The two went on to pursue animal science degrees in college and were active in agriculture activities such as livestock judging and ag student government. Since graduating, both have helped their father, Guy, with the family business. Kyle helps with the day-to-day management of the ranch, while Katie coordinates cattle shows, manages auction broadcasts, and travels to sales across the country. Katie is also a part-time employee of the Idaho Cattlemen's Association and owns her own video production company. The Colyer family and their enterprise have also greatly benefited from the hard work and expertise of longtime employees Adan Juarez and Tony Willis, who have worked on the ranch for over 30 and 15 years, respectively.  Apart from the Colyers' commitment to their product, their commitment to the community is also self-evident. Several members of the family serve as emergency first responders on a volunteer basis in the Bruneau area. Guy is a member of several local and national cattle associations, including the Owyhee County Cattle Association, the Idaho Cattle Association, and the National Cattlemen's Beef He also serves on the board of directors of the American Hereford Guy and his wife, Sherry, have also served as advisers for the American Junior Hereford Association to help mentor the next generation of ranchers.  Colyer Herefords and Angus has been a pillar of Bruneau and surrounding communities for many, many years. This family owned business is a prime example of the American entrepreneurial spirit. Through hard work, a commitment to a quality product, and community service, the ranch has thrived as a small family owned agricultural operation.[[Page S1945]]  I would like to extend my sincerest congratulations to the Colyer family and all of the employees at Colyer Herefords and Angus for being selected as the March 2018 Small Business of the You make our great State of Idaho proud, and I look forward to watching your continued growth and success.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-22-pt1-PgS1944-3.txt,1896,COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY REVIEW ACT,2018.0,22.0,March

As chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I recognize the importance of the work done by the nearly 1,000 small business development centers across This SBA resource partner works tirelessly to support the backbone of our economy, and we thank them for their significant contributions to our small business community.  America's small business development centers, or SBDCs, provide our country's small businesses with high-quality consulting and educational programs, at low or no-cost to the entrepreneur. With centers in all 50 States, this network supports both established small businesses and developing entrepreneurs alike. SBDCs help America's entrepreneurs develop and execute individual business plans tailored to fit their needs, experience, and level of business acumen.  SBDC staff understand the unique local challenges of entrepreneurship specific to their area which is one of the many things that sets their services apart. This tailored approach benefits nearly 500,000 entrepreneurs a year and creates over 95,000 jobs annually. Additionally, sales growth in SBDC clients averages 13.6 percent, a rate four times greater than the national average. These statistics demonstrate America's small business development centers' dedication to excellence, and I congratulate them on their hard work.  In my home State of Idaho, the Idaho small business development center is determined to help businesses grow with consulting and training. Last year, the Idaho SBDC achieved a return on investment of five to one, and created over 1,300 jobs. Their network served over 1,600 clients and helped start more than 100 businesses. One of these clients is House of Design, a robotics and systems firm located in House of Design offers engineering consulting, robotic system, and machine vision integration services across a variety of industries. Shane Dittrich, the owner of House of Design, believes that his company would not be where it is today without SBDC assistance. Since its inception in 2008, House of Design has grown into one of the top engineering firms in the region and now partners with multiple firms across Idaho to produce high-quality engineering and robotics products. House of Design is an example of both the unique entrepreneurial spirit of Idaho as well as the impact SBDCs have on small businesses across  I would like to thank and congratulate America's small business development centers for their efforts this past year. The support they provide to small businesses across our country is considerable, and it is my pleasure to recognize today, the March 21, 2018, as SBDC I wish them the best of luck and continued success as they move forward in their work to enhance American entrepreneurs.

1081,topic-id,877,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Michigan for yielding.  You know, I think it is so interesting. We are all coming together, various States, to celebrate these accomplishments and to take a step back: how far we have come in the past year or the past several months where you look back and, basically, there was a national consensus that had developed, and the consensus was nobody[[Page H1428]]liked our Tax Code--I mean nobody. Nobody could defend it because it was absurd. It was so complicated.  Those of us who are from the Chicago area, we know that the last time the Tax Code was updated was when the Bears won the Super Bowl, so that is 30 years ago. And yet we have got this Tax Code that had been a complete throwback. The Tax Code was such a throwback that the last time it was updated, 1986, the internet didn't exist, basically, as a commercial enterprise.  There was no shared economy, per se. Airbnb, Uber, Lyft, all those things, they didn't exist. Global supply chains were nowhere nearly as connected as they are today, which all begged the question that we needed a Tax Code to update things.  Now, here is what was interesting: The hyperbole that surrounded the debate on the tax reform bill as H.1 kept moving in and, ultimately, came to a crescendo, passed through the House, passed through the Senate, and was signed into law, it was described by, God bless them, our friends on the other side of the aisle as the worst bill ever, Armageddon, and, obviously, now, the famous line that the result of these things were crumbs. Well, none of that turned out to be true. This was a terrific bill.  Let me just give you a couple of examples, Mr.Speaker, of people in my constituency who have written publicly or they have written to me privately about this bill.  Here is Mary from Wheaton, Illinois, my hometown. She said: ``Our family is already feeling the positive impact of the changes made in the Tax Our daughter and her husband just had their first baby and will be able to take advantage of the doubled child tax credit next year. Throughout our extended family, those who work for big and small businesses alike are witnessing immediate effects. Companies are investing the anticipated benefits of the new tax law in the form of bonuses, pay raises, capital improvements, and new hires. And that's just the beginning. The true value of this Tax Code will become even more evident in the months and years ahead.''  Mary is absolutely right.  Or another person, Nicole, from She says: ``Thanks to the new tax bill, my family will be saving an estimated $4,000 on our taxes next year. Not only that, but I'm getting a $1,000 bonus and an extra $1,500 in my employee pension account from my employer as a result of the changes.''  Or how about an enrolled agent, Stephen, from He prepares people's taxes. He says: ``As an enrolled agent entering my 35th tax season, I am anxiously awaiting the smiles I will be getting from my clients when I inform them how much they will be saving on their 2018 tax return . . . the clear majority of my clients will be paying lower tax rates in 2018 due to the recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.''  And then I will go to the end of his note. He says: ``I haven't been able to say this very often over the past 35 years, but I am actually looking forward to this tax season.''  So we know that these things are true. We know that they are manifesting themselves.  I have got a constituency where there are about 30,000 people who get hit hard by the alternative minimum tax, and they are not going to be hit by the alternative minimum tax. They are going to be spared that tax.  There are many other examples in the State of Illinois where you see real progress being made.  Up by me in Chicagoland, MK Incorporation, a fleet management company, is giving $1,000 bonuses to 150 employees.  Ameren Illinois, the customers are using both electricity and natural gas. They will see a combined savings of lower utility rates.  We have talked about AT&T already today: $1,000 bonuses to 10,000 Illinois-based employees and, nationwide, over $1 billion increase in capital expenditures.  There is example after example after example after example.  Look, if all the critics can do is basically say, well, this isn't enough or this is crumbs, they have not been to my constituency. To tell a family that I represent, Mr.Speaker, that $1,000 is crumbs is just patently obtuse. $1,000 is real money: $1,000 is getting ahead on a car payment; $1,000 is the ability to move forward and say we are going to go on a little extra special vacation, we are going to put a little bit more money toward our college fund, we are going to put a little bit more money toward our retirement. And that is just one particular example.  Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for organizing this, and I very much appreciate his bringing us together to celebrate these things.

This is a debate about one size fits all coming out of Washington, D.C., and the failure of folks in this town at regulatory agencies to not appreciate the nuance of what is going on in the rest of the country.  I have been on these waste coal piles of western I have seen streams that are dead. I have seen hillsides scarred. I have seen restoration. I have seen streams come back to life. I have seen hillsides come back to life.  This Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving the Environment, SENSE, Act, makes sense for those who live outside the Capital  The SENSE Act is a vitally important effort that I have championed in various forms throughout my time in The bill recognizes the huge success that the coal refuse-to-energy industry is making in Pennsylvania, and especially my district, to make it a healthier and cleaner place to live.  Without the SENSE Act, five coal refuse-to-energy facilities in western Pennsylvania and West Virginia will close, and their environmental remediation efforts will end.  Despite what the bill's opponents say, the SENSE Act is, first and foremost, a pro-environment bill, but it is also a pro-jobs bill, a pro-union jobs bill, because it is union workers who are going to be thrown out of work when these plants close. And it is a pro-taxpayer bill because the environment is being cleaned up without a contribution from the taxpayers.  The coal industry has a long and storied history in Not only has it been an important part of the economy for generations, but Pennsylvania coal helped the U.and our allies win two world wars.  Historic mining activity, unfortunately, left behind large piles of coal refuse. These piles consist of lower quality coal mixed with rock and dirt.  For a long time, we did not have the technology to use this material, so it accumulated in large piles outside of cities and towns, close to schools, neighborhoods, and in fields across coal country. This has led to many environmental problems that diminished the quality of life for people in these areas surrounded by these piles. Vegetation and wildlife have been harmed, the air has been polluted, and acid mine drainage has impaired nearby rivers and streams.  I have seen these sites firsthand, as I said, and the environmental danger they pose.  Coal refuse piles can catch fire. Think about that. They can catch fire with no limitations at all. It is an unmitigated disaster when these things catch fire--uncontrolled air pollution. Many are already smoldering, giving off toxic emissions, again, without any controls whatsoever.  Runoff from these sites literally turn rivers orange, leaving them devoid of life.  The cost to clean up all of this is astronomical. Pennsylvania's environmental regulator estimates that fixing abandoned mine lands could cost over $16 billion, over $2 billion of which would be needed for coal refuse piles alone.  We needed an innovative solution to this tough challenge, a commonsense compromise. This was necessary to get the job done and to protect the environment. That is where the coal refuse-to-energy industry comes in.  Using advanced technology, this industry has been able to use previously worthless material to generate electricity. This activity is what powers remediation efforts and has successfully removed over 200 million tons of coal refuse, reclaiming polluted sites across Pennsylvania and other historic coal regions.  Thanks to the hard work of the dedicated people in this industry--again, many union workers in this industry--landscapes have been restored, rivers and streams have been brought back to life, and many towns have been relieved of hazardous waste coal piles.  Here is an example of what this industry has been able to do. Here you have an abandoned waste coal pile, but through the restoration efforts, the countryside has been reclaimed. This is a picture of success done without taxpayer money, improving the environment.  I want to highlight again private sector leadership on this issue that has saved taxpayers millions of dollars in cleanup costs; and if the SENSE Act becomes law, taxpayers will continue to save millions.  I should also note that the waste-to-energy industry pays millions in tax dollars, too, something that my colleagues should be mindful of, because many of the plants in these areas are areas where there is still a struggle economically. Multiple groups have previously endorsed the SENSE Act, including Pennsylvania's abandoned mine reclamation groups and clean water advocates.  Unfortunately, intensifying and, importantly, inflexible EPA regulations threaten five plants in western Pennsylvania and West This would leave hundreds of millions of dollars of vital cleanup unfinished, lead to job losses, and leave many localities exposed to the harmful conditions waste coal piles pose.  Mr.Speaker, we are talking a handful--a handful--of plants.  The sky is falling. The catastrophic scenario the opponents of this legislation are arguing about, they don't appreciate the nuance of what we are trying to do here. The SENSE Act, as it has been amended, addresses a significant challenge arising from the implementation of the existing rules, including those under the Mercury and Air Toxic  Importantly, these plants comply with mercury emission standards. There is an issue with how they deal with HCL, hydrogen chloride, and sulfur dioxide,  This is a targeted piece of legislation, a customization, as it were, to recognize the important and vital work that this industry has been doing. Contrary to what critics allege, the SENSE[[Page H1483]]Act simply provides operators with additional alternative MATS compliance standards, but it is still strict and it is still achievable.  Despite opponents' claims, this bill is not a sweetheart deal for the coal refuse-to-energy industry. This bill only prevents a few plants from being regulated out of existence. This industry represents a tiny fraction of the energy industry, but it provides enormous environmental benefits.  Again, this legislation brings a stark contrast to the difference between elites in this town and what is out there in flyover country, that you cannot even go in and see the specific issue and that you have to apply this one size fits all because you are operating from some ideological framework. It is really unfortunate, because it is the environment that is going to hurt; it is jobs that are going to be lost.  The industry works with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to identify especially dangerous piles and prioritize remediation.  Mr.Speaker, the amended version of this bill accurately reflects the spirit of previous SENSE Act versions, and I thank my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee for their work on it.  It is my hope that we can continue to build support for this bill, especially in the Senate, where Senators Toomey and Casey, Republican and Democrat, have previously offered a bipartisan amendment relating to it in the past. Despite that prior bipartisan Senate support, previous efforts have failed to achieve the supermajority necessary to pass, but I am hopeful that the SENSE Act can win enough support to pass both  What we are looking to achieve today is this: a narrow and limited addition to existing rules for a very small but pro-environment industry.  This should not be a controversial or partisan issue. We want to hold this industry to high standards, but to standards they can actually reach. But for the EPA emission extension that expires in 2019, current regulations discount the environmental remediation benefits this industry provides.                              {time}  0930  My bill will help keep the coal refuse industry in business so that local communities, economies, and the environment will continue to reap the benefits.  The people who live near coal refuse piles and all of the communities downstream of these hazards expect us to find a solution. Many workers at the endangered power plants, folks throughout the supply chain, and their families, are counting on us to protect their livelihoods. We owe it to them to pass the SENSE Act, including people like Bill  Bill is a shift supervisor at the Colver refuse facility in Cambria He has worked at Colver for over two decades. He has also lived close to coal refuse piles. Bill and his colleagues at Colver are proud of the reclamation work they do. He has put three kids through college thanks to his job. I know I have said this before, but his children even played soccer on a field reclaimed from a coal refuse pile because of this industry. Bill said it would be a travesty if the coal waste-to-energy industry disappeared.  Another industry worker is Dennis He is an engineer at For him, this issue is personal. He said three generations of his family lived in the shadow of a large coal refuse pile. Unfortunately, his relatives died without ever seeing this environmental catastrophe corrected. He said: ``There is a real shot now that I will see it in my lifetime.''  Finally, I would like to recognize Vince Brisini, who testified at the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee hearing last fall. Vince not only worked for the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, but he also lives next to a waste coal pile. Like Bill and Dennis, he has devoted so much of his time and energy, both professionally and personally, to solving this problem.  Madam Speaker, we owe it to the environment to keep these five endangered plants open. We owe it to people like Dennis and Bill and Vince to see if we can solve the waste coal problem during this generation. The SENSE Act will help ensure that that remains a probability. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense, pro-environment bill.  ",CREC-2018-03-08-pt1-PgH1480-6.txt,2158,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF THE SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 1625,",2018.0,8.0,March
869,topic-id,426,"Madam Speaker, I would like to make a couple of points here. Without this relief, the plants are going to close. This is not a broad-based industry carve-out. This is for a subset of plants.  When you look at the economics of running a plant, you are looking at income, you are looking at cost. The fact is, we are seeking a nuanced approach to recognize the environmental benefit that these plants have provided, the hundreds of jobs, family-sustaining jobs that are at stake. It is just frustrating to hear my colleagues just insist on this one-size-fits-all, seemingly we are incapable of appreciating a nuance.  We don't rail against regulation. We rail against overregulation. Regulation is important. It is necessary. It should be responsible. It should be prudent. It should meet a cost-benefit analysis.  I talked about right regulation, not deregulation; right regulation. You pick the regulation to fit the circumstance that you are in.  A picture paints a thousand words. That paints a thousand words right there, and the EPA has even recognized the benefit of this industry here. A quote from the EPA: ``Coal refuse piles are an environmental concern because of acid seepage and leachate production, spontaneous combustion, and low soil fertility. Units that burn coal refuse provide multimedia environmental benefits. . . . ''  Let me say that again. The EPA said: ``Units that burn coal refuse provide multimedia environmental benefits by combining the production of energy with the removal of coal refuse piles and by reclaiming land for productive use. Consequently, because of the unique environmental benefits that coal refuse-fired EGUs provide, these units warrant special consideration. . . . ''  Let me say that again. The EPA said: ``These units warrant special consideration,'' because of the unique environmental benefits they provide.  That is what the SENSE Act is about.  Up in Cambria County, where they have a number of these piles, there are streams that flow into the Conemaugh River, that flows into the Kiskiminetas River, that flows into the Allegheny River, that flows into the Ohio This industry is cleaning up those tributaries, preventing acid seepage into the Conemaugh, into the Kiskiminetas, into the Allegheny, and the  This bill makes sense, and I would urge my colleagues to seriously consider it because this is an area where people can come up out of their trenches and find common ground, something that makes common sense, reaches common sense. It is pro-environment. The sky is not falling, as some of the opponents might say. And it saves jobs and union jobs.  ",CREC-2018-03-08-pt1-PgH1480-6.txt,2158,LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM,2018.0,8.0,March
872,topic-id,311,"Madam Speaker, I want to talk about some burdens, burdens like uncontrolled release of toxins into the air when these piles catch fire, uncontrolled seepage into rivers.  This subset of plants, my colleague from Pennsylvania makes the point about some of these plants are in compliance. There is such a thing as economies of scale. And when any business is in operation, you are looking at costs[[Page H1485]]and expenses. You are looking at revenue. And when the costs and expenses exceed the revenue, you go out of business.  Unless we are able to do a customization for these handful of plants, they will close. Hundreds of people will lose their jobs. The cleanup they are doing will stop. While some other plants may continue to operate and continue the good work, that is great, but it is going to go at a slower pace. It is going to cost taxpayers more because less will be cleaned up.  This industry, so far, has cleaned up 200 million tons of waste coal in Pennsylvania, and that is just the start of the work that needs to be done. My hope is that it is all going to be cleaned up in our lifetimes.  So, no, this isn't forever. This isn't forever.  This, again, is taking a look at a situation we have in Pennsylvania, that we want to recognize the good work that is going on there and, again, when you look at the EPA under the Obama administration, talking of the unique environmental benefits that these plants provide and that they warrant special consideration.  Again, I just urge my colleagues to come up. Let's get out of our trenches. Let's take a look, meeting, you know, in the middle here. Support this legislation. Save these jobs. Save these union jobs. Let these plants stay open, and let's continue to clean up western  ",CREC-2018-03-08-pt1-PgH1480-6.txt,2158,LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM,2018.0,8.0,March
875,topic-id,347,"Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I wonder if my friend from Pennsylvania has really taken a look at the legislation, because there are rules that apply. The entire bevy of environmental rules apply to these plants, and the SENSE Act is going to leave those in place, all the rules.  What the SENSE Act does is take a look at two factors--two factors--hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide. That is it. And it says, if you are in compliance with hydrogen chloride, you will be deemed to be in compliance with sulfur dioxide, or, conversely, if you are in compliance with sulfur dioxide, you will be deemed in compliance with hydrogen chloride. Everything else is applicable. Everything else is applicable.  This is why I talk about a customization for a small handful of the plants. The group that represents these plants supports this legislation. The workers in these plants support this legislation. The people who live next to these coal piles support this legislation.  But to suggest that this legislation means no rules for these plants is just not accurate. All the rules apply to these plants. We are seeing a small tweak because, again, when you look at the economics of running a business, running a plant, you are looking at cost; and if you are going to impose the cost to put the additional mechanics within the plant, it is not going to happen. Those plants are going to close. That is what we are looking at.  So, again, I would appreciate if folks who take a look at this legislation understand that these plants are still subject to strict regulation both at the Federal and State level and that this is a minor tweaking of one rule. While the EPA may have been discussing the benefit of these plants in the context of another rule, the fact remains the same: these units warrant special consideration. If it is true under one rule, it is going to be true under all rules because of, again, the unique environmental benefits that these plants provide.

915,topic-id,831,"Mr.Speaker, I would like to commend Mr.King for his work on the Heartbeat Protection It gives us an opportunity to reflect on some of those bigger issues that we have going on in our society.  This is personal to everybody. We all have our own stories of when we are in a family situation and somebody becomes pregnant. I certainly remember that when my wife and I had our first child. The first visit to the doctor when you got to hear the heartbeat was just amazing.  I remember also having a subsequent appointment where the doctor couldn't find the heartbeat. We were very concerned, very worried, so they sent us to the hospital. They wanted us to have another test. It is a small town we were in. The hospital was where they had the sonogram. My wife and I were praying all the way: Please, let this baby be okay.  Well, we got to the hospital and the technician did a sonogram, and, lo and behold, we saw the baby, we saw the beating heart, and we were just in awe at this new human life.  Mothers and fathers are forever changed when they first hear that heartbeat, that tiny pulse that reinforces the big and beautiful reality of a precious human life.  Mr.Speaker, that is why I rise in support of H.490, the Heartbeat Protection As a lawmaker, I took an oath to our Constitution to protect the constitutional rights of all That is why I am cosponsoring this bill.  This legislation protects a pre-born baby's life when his or her heartbeat is detected. A heartbeat is a very basic sign of life. The pulse represents a unique person with inherent dignity and natural, human and constitutional rights that extend throughout the continuum of life through conception until natural death.  And where do these rights come from?  The Founders who signed the Declaration knew, for the Declaration itself says: ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights.''  That is interesting, Mr.Speaker, because the first unalienable right that is identified is the right to life.  Do you know who else knew?  President  President Kennedy reminded us in a different context, in the struggle against atheistic totalitarian communism. He said these words: ``And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe--the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of God.''  The right to life, defined in our Declaration, protected in our Constitution, and reiterated time and again by leaders across the religious and political spectrum, applies to every human life. It is easy to see who is human, if you look.  Twenty-six years ago, the late Governor Bob Casey from Pennsylvania, and others, including Sargent Shriver and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, signed onto a statement regarding abortion as true today as when it was published. Under the section of that document that was titled ``Without a Doubt, a Human Life,'' Governor Casey and his coauthors observed:       From the beginning, each human embryo has its own unique      genetic identity. Three and a half weeks after conception,      its heart starts beating. At 6 weeks, brain activity can be      detected. At the end of 2 months, the limbs, fingers, and      toes are complete. By 3 months, the baby is quite active,      forming fists, bending arms, and curling toes. At 4 months,      vocal cords, eyelashes, teeth buds, fingernails, and toenails      are all present. By 5 months, the baby is sucking its thumb,      punching, kicking, and going through the motions of crying.      By 6 months, it responds to light and sound and can recognize      its mother's voice.[[Page H1437]]  The statement went on:       Advocates of unrestricted abortion do not want the public      to focus on these undeniable facts of fetal development,      but the facts cannot be ignored. They may claim that      abortion is a violent act, not against potential life, but      against a living, growing human being, a life with      potential.  Governor Casey subscribed to that belief.  Mr.Speaker, let's be clear. Intentionally stopping a heartbeat is not healthcare.  H.490 recognizes what science has already affirmed: that there is a baby growing in her mother's womb, one with her own distinct heartbeat.  Therefore, we have an obligation to protect the most vulnerable among us: to defend the defenseless.  How can our country continue to flourish and claim itself as a champion of human rights when we allow our society to rid ourselves of our own future generations?  That is why I came to the floor today to urge support for the Heartbeat Protection Act, to give our country a chance to reflect on some of the deeper questions and deeper values, to walk in solidarity with one another when one encounters a difficult situation, and to stand in each another's shoes with empathy.

1259,topic-id,811,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding time to me.  Mr.Speaker, just listening to the other side's comments about the SENSE Act, I am wondering if they[[Page H1454]]have read the same bill or if they have ever visited the hills of western Pennsylvania where we see the environmental damage that waste coal piles have done and the tremendous progress that we have seen over the last number of decades in actually cleaning up the environment.  Mr.Speaker, I am happy to rise in support of 762, the rule that is under consideration, and I want to talk about the SENSE Act, which is included within this rule, H.1119.  This is a pro-environment bill. The purpose of the bill is to ensure that coal refuse-to-energy facilities can be held to strict but achievable standards.  To be clear, these plants comply with nearly all standards as it is, including mercury emissions. We are talking about a modification, a customization, as it were, in recognition of the tremendous benefit that these plants have made to the environment.  I have introduced versions of this bill during prior Congresses, and I am hopeful that this bill can become law. It enjoys bipartisan support.  As many of you know, coal refuse is a by-product of historic coal mining operations. Throughout many parts of coal country, towering black mounds of this material loom beside cities and towns, especially in Pennsylvania and in West  I would invite my colleague from Florida to come up to western Pennsylvania and take a look at the scarred landscape and polluted rivers we have there as a result of these coal refuse piles.  Many of these piles can smoulder, can spontaneously combust, giving off emissions with no controls, zero controls. They catch fire, burning uncontrollably, sending hazardous smoke into the air and into surrounding communities. Local governments are then forced to spend increasingly scarce taxpayer resources fighting these fires.  Rainwater leaches terrible chemicals from these mounds, polluting nearby rivers and streams.  Fortunately, the coal refuse-to-energy industry turns this material into energy, while cleaning up and remediating many polluted sites, at no cost to the taxpayer.  These power plants are really the only practical solution to this massive environmental problem that we have in Pennsylvania and West Virginia that could cost, in Pennsylvania alone, an estimated $2 billion to remediate. This is being done without taxpayer funding right now, the cleanup, because of these plants.  For several years, I have spoken about the tremendous work being done by hardworking folks in this industry, which I have seen firsthand. I have stood on coal refuse piles in the process of remediation, and I have also walked on restored sites, many of which are parks and meadows, now regarded as community assets rather than liabilities. I have seen the streams that were once dead that now have fish.  Despite all the good that this industry does for Pennsylvania and West Virginia, five coal refuse-to-energy facilities are under threat from Federal regulations, seemingly incapable of needed flexibility to accommodate private sector work that is actually improving the environment.  If rigid EPA orthodoxy makes no exceptions for this pro-environment industry, it is not just the environment that will continue to suffer. These plants support family-sustaining jobs, and thousands of jobs are at stake if these plants are regulated out of business, both direct and indirect.  I should note that many of these jobs are in localities that have already been hit exceptionally hard by both the last recession and the ongoing opioid crisis.  The people expect us to stand for them, especially when their livelihoods come under threat from heavy-handed, one-size-fits-all Washington policies. So as we debate the SENSE Act, please keep in mind what the bill's supporters are fighting for.  Here is what is going to happen if this law doesn't pass: rivers and streams aren't going to come back to life; hillsides aren't going to be restored; and these piles, they can spontaneously combust, again, with no emissions control whatsoever.  The SENSE Act is about protecting family-sustaining jobs and ensuring the continuation of the environmental success story of the coal refuse-to-energy industry.

641,topic-id,1093,"Mr.President, first of all, let me offer my thanks to Senator Alexander and Senator Collins, and let me add my support for what Senator Graham has just indicated in terms of the importance of this particular amendment to the omnibus bill.  Look, I am a pro-life By allowing the Hyde amendment to prevail in this particular case, as it does with all of the other funding that we send back to the States so that it cannot be used to fund abortions--and that[[Page S1908]]is what this is all about--it allows us to still continue to provide, with clear consciences, the dollars necessary to provide healthcare for individuals who otherwise may not get it.  This particular proposal allows for States to, once again, take charge of part of the healthcare that we want to see delivered at the local level. By taking section 1332 and expanding what States can do, we actually provide more local control, which is a conservative approach. It is also one more opportunity to reduce the impact of what many of us have said was a mistake with ObamaCare in the first place.  For conservatives, a lot of us campaigned on the fact that we wanted to repeal and replace To repeal it and replace it, you have to have 60 votes here. In this particular case, what we have said is: Let's take those parts that are the most onerous and those parts that are adding to the cost of healthcare and take those out, but let's provide and continue to provide the protections that some people feel ObamaCare was responsible for, such as guaranteed renewable products, which were included in South Dakota's law before ObamaCare ever came along, and the opportunity for everybody to apply for a policy and to be accepted one way or another.  This particular piece of legislation allows for, perhaps, as many as 3.2 million Americans to actually be able to afford the policies that, today, they can't afford. I believe Senator Alexander used the example of someone who is making $60,000 a year and has a bill of $20,000 for his healthcare. The reality is that that person is not buying healthcare. So let's allow those folks the opportunity to have a reduction in the premiums that they otherwise could not afford to pay.  This allows for the States, on a very responsible basis, to do what Senator Collins, as a former insurance commissioner, understands so clearly. What we have done with ObamaCare is to force individuals who have no place else to go into what we call the individual market. When we force all--or the vast majority--of the individuals who have health problems into the individual market to get coverage, it artificially drives up the cost of that individual policy. That individual market makes up 6 percent of the total number of the people who are covered, but that 6 percent of the premium going in picks up an unfairly large number of individuals who have no place else to go to get insurance. That drives the cost of the premiums up for those individuals and makes it, in many cases, more costly than they could ever afford.  With a reinsurance provision for the States, it allows for a State to say: Look, issue the policies, but then allow us to expand the base over which we spread those losses. Let those States do that. This worked successfully before ObamaCare was ever a bad dream. This allows for us to take a larger base of people to share and to spread that risk. When you do that, you make that market more stable, and you start to invite carriers to step back into the market. That is what this is all about.  I am not going to try to assign the intention of our colleagues who are on the other side of the aisle. I am a pragmatist. I really do believe that we have some very sincere colleagues on the other side of the aisle who understand how important this is.  What I would invite is this: I am a conservative I want to see this move forward. I think, for the good of the American people, this is the right move to make. I would ask our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to consider the good this would do for people across this entire country and to find a way to work through this process in such a fashion that they could comfortably come forward and help us to get this to the finish line.  If we can do this, we will make things better not just for those 3.2 million Americans who would be able to qualify for insurance once again and be able to pay for it, but we honestly believe--and it is the Congressional Budget Office that has suggested this--that somewhere between 20 percent of the premiums they would otherwise pay would solidly be reduced. In some cases, according to healthcare professionals in the private market--these are the people who actually suggest and work with the insurance companies--as much as 40 percent of that total cost could be reduced.  This is not a partisan issue. This is a matter of trying to actually make an impact on the lives of real Americans who need our help. Remember that the American people did not ask for ObamaCare, but they are the ones who are suffering because of the premium increases that have been caused by this law in the first place.  What we are trying to do in what is, hopefully, an acceptable fashion is to find colleagues on the other side of the aisle who will once again join us in this legislation that they had previously supported--for them to find a way to step forward--and actually help fix a problem for real  Once again, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for all of the hard work he has done.

As a member of the Senate Banking Committee, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this important legislation which will provide much needed regulatory relief to our community banks and credit unions whose ability to serve their customers has been made more difficult since the passage of the Dodd-Frank  Enacted in 2010, Dodd-Frank was an overreaction to the 2008 financial crisis. Rather than actually addressing the underlying issues that caused the financial crisis, Dodd-Frank created a massive new bureaucracy and saddled our financial institutions with burdensome and onerous new regulations. It is 2,300 pages in length and created more than 400 new rulemakings, which led to 27,000 new Federal mandates on American businesses. This limits the ability of our financial institutions to grow and serve their customers, especially for smaller banks in rural areas such as in my home State of South  Just last summer, the U.Department of Treasury reported that the regulatory burdens of Dodd-Frank have reduced economic growth and ``undermined the ability of banks to deliver attractively priced credit in sufficient quantity to meet the needs of the economy.''  Without question, no one wants to repeat the events that contributed to the economic recession that began in 2008. We are only now beginning to lift out of that nearly decade-long economic slump, thanks to the tax relief law and President Trump's focus on regulatory reform.  Just in the last year, we have enacted historic tax reform, we have undone burdensome and unnecessary regulations at a record pace, and we are restoring the American people's confidence at levels not seen in decades, but we must do more, which is why our bipartisan legislation is so important.  Making sure American families and businesses have access to credit when they need it is critical as we work to grow our economy and create jobs. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act will strengthen America's financial system and expand economic opportunities across the entire country, especially in rural areas which are often the most underserved.  Of the many fatal flaws of Dodd-Frank, perhaps most damaging was its one-size-fits-all approach. By taking a one-size-fits-all approach, Dodd-Frank imposed disproportionate compliance costs on our smaller community banks and credit unions, especially given the improbability that these smaller institutions pose a significant risk to our financial system. This type of approach is particularly harmful to our smaller financial institutions which are so vital to our communities.  With more than 6,500 community banks throughout the country supporting even the remotest areas, we must make certain we are helping and not hindering their ability to serve their communities.  Almost half of small businesses, which we all know are the drivers of job creation and economic growth in America, are supported by small community banks. Providing these institutions with regulatory relief is critical, which is what our legislation does.  Let me go through some of the highlights, which include seven provisions or bills I introduced. It includes the Home Mortgage Disclosure Adjustment Act, which I introduced with Senator Heitkamp earlier this year, and will provide small banks and credit unions with data reporting relief.[[Page S1414]]  We also provide relief from Dodd-Frank capital rules that allow banks to count high-quality municipal bonds toward capital requirements, providing help to both banks and local units of government that issue that debt. In other words, those banks can now make a market for those municipal bonds once again.  Our legislation also streamlines Federal rules to help small, local Federal savings associations, known as FSA's or thrifts, expand their ability to offer loans to more families and businesses without going through a costly charter conversion process.  It also includes parts of the Community Bank Access to Capital Act, which would free small banks from having to complete arduous and expensive tests which are already mandated by Dodd-Frank, and it makes it easier for banks with less than $3 billion in assets to raise capital and grow.  I am also pleased it includes my provision to protect the credit of our Nation's veterans, so veterans waiting on delayed payments from the VA Choice Program cannot lose their credit ratings because of it. It is a sad commentary when you have to make a law in the financial institutions section of the code to take care of veterans because the VA cannot pay their bills on time.  It also protects seniors by removing liability for financial services institutions and professionals reporting suspected fraud of senior citizens to the authorities. We also provide relief to small public housing agencies by reducing regulatory burdens on and increasing flexibility for these entities.  This bill also provides rural appraisal relief for cases when buyers have trouble finding a qualified appraiser. The reason for this is because if you want to get a home loan, one of the requirements under Dodd-Frank is that you have to have a qualified appraiser actually appraise the home, regardless of where you live. What this provision does is it relaxes some of those rules with regard to where the amounts on a mortgage can be, less than a particular amount as specified in our bill, and still be a qualified mortgage so banks can move them on to the secondary market. That helps to create a market for those mortgages, making it easier for a consumer to actually access that credit.  Our bill also gives the Federal Reserve flexibility in designating banks as systemically important, exempting banks with less than $100 billion in assets from several Dodd-Frank provisions that apply to systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs, including reporting requirements, limits on lending, and limits on mergers and acquisitions.  Also banks with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion would receive relief from tighter oversight applied by Dodd-This would exempt 15 regional and midsized banks from these more stringent rules. Meanwhile, more than a dozen of our country's largest banks will still have to comply with the SIFI requirements. These are the largest financial institutions.  We also eliminate barriers to jobs by allowing mortgage loan originators to work temporarily in a new State or for a new financial institution while their applications for new licenses are pending. Our bill also requires the Treasury to study and report on the risks of cyber threats to our financial institutions and capital markets.  Finally, our bill provides regulatory relief from enhanced supplementary leverage ratio for certain banks that service organizations like mutual funds and State and local pension plans. It doesn't hardly seem appropriate that we would make our banks less competitive than foreign banks for providing that same service. Let's keep that opportunity and that market within our own borders as well. Let's allow them to be competitive, which saves on costs for mutual fund purchasers.  This benefits countless local governments across the country that do business with these banks. In my home State alone, this includes the State of South Dakota, the South Dakota Retirement System, the Rapid City Regional Hospital, the city of Vermillion, and the Watertown School District, just to name a few of them. While this provision will not help all banks, it will affect some banks, which benefits consumers, and in the future perhaps we can give the same relief to all banks that offer these important services.  These provisions, along with the many others of our bill, will strengthen our financial system in the United States and reduce the unnecessary burdens on small or midsized banks so they can focus on serving their communities, not complying with layers of bureaucracy.  Making sure families and businesses have access to credit when they need it is critical as we work to grow a healthy American economy. Every step we can take to provide relief to our lenders is a win for families and businesses that rely on them to run their businesses, to buy a home, or to save for college.  Small community banks don't think of banking in terms of derivatives and default swaps like they do on Wall They think of banking in terms of how they can best serve their communities, their friends, neighbors, store owners, and job providers. Our bipartisan Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act will help these lenders focus on doing just exactly that.  I thank Chairman Crapo and the other 24 cosponsors of this legislation for their commitment to working together to provide much needed relief that will enhance our ability to grow our economy.

1241,topic-id,3129,"Mr.President, since the tragedy 3 weeks ago tomorrow in Parkland, FL, we have all, as a nation, had a conversation about how did this happen, why did it happen, and what can we do to make sure something like this never happens again. As part of that conversation, we have spent a significant amount of time talking to all sorts of different groups and individuals--from students and teachers impacted by this to experts across the country, to other communities that have put in place policies to address this. We have learned a lot about not just this particular incident but some of the dangers around the country.  It is interesting, just in the last couple of weeks since it happened, you have seen a significant increase in the number of potential shooters who have been reported to law enforcement and people who have been arrested. I think one of the lessons from this terrible tragedy is, we live in a day and age when someone who is out there talking about hurting people has to be taken seriously. We can no longer afford to be a country in which people make these sorts of threats, and they are taken lightly.  Based on all of this information we have gathered, last week I came to the floor and announced a number of initiatives that I hope the Senate will move forward on to make sure these things never happen again. It is important to begin by recognizing that those of us who serve here are in the business of passing laws and making public policy. Making public policy isn't just about coming up with the best idea you can come up with, but it is also about coming up with the best idea you can come up with that actually has a chance of being implemented into law. What that means is, in order to get something done, we need 60 votes in the Senate on virtually any issue, we need a majority of the votes in the House, and we need a White House that is willing to sign it. If those three things don't happen, you do not have a law.  So what we spent time trying to do is identify what can we get 60 votes for in the Senate, can pass in the House, and be signed by the President that will make a difference. That has been our criteria. That does not mean there are not other important issues that deserve to be debated--and they will continue to be debated--but it means what can we pass quickly and put in place because, unlike tax policy or some of the other issues we talk about here, there is a time urgency related to this. The time urgency is that it is fair to say there is a high probability that somewhere in America today there is someone like the killer in Parkland who has ideas about doing something similar, and we do not have the luxury of waiting until November or waiting until next year before we act, especially if there are things we agree on.  Something remarkable happened over the weekend. Almost all of the 17 families impacted by this horrifying event came together and spent a significant amount of time meeting and talking because they wanted to issue a joint statement as families. It was difficult because these families and some of the people in these families have very different views on a number of issues, including on the Second Amendment, but the one thing they all agreed on is, our schools should be safe places and that when we drop our children at school in the morning, they should be safe, and no one should be worried there is a possibility their children may not come home that afternoon because someone walked into the school and took their life.  I would say that is not just true of these 17 families; I think that is true of the country. No matter where you are on the issues regarding the Second Amendment--how much or how little you believe our laws should govern and regulate the sale of guns and what type of guns should be sold--I cannot imagine there is anyone in this country in their right mind who does not believe our schools should be safe. I also do not believe there is anyone in this country in their right mind who would disagree, if we have the opportunity to identify someone before they act, we should act against them and stop them. Because there is such broad consensus on those issues, those are the first steps I believe we should try to take.  Now, sometimes when you describe it that way, people think, ``Well, that is all you are going to do or that is all you want to talk about,'' and that is not true. That can't be true because these Second Amendment issues preexist We have debated them in the past, and we will continue to debate them in the future. They often find their ways into court. So those issues aren't going anywhere, and they will continue to be here for us to debate and act on, if the body so chooses.  The issue that I am afraid will go away, the issue I am afraid may be forgotten in a number of weeks is the fact that, in this case, there was the chance to stop the shooter before he acted. There were clear signs. It is one of the things you see in every single one of these events. It isn't like from one moment to the next they woke up one morning in a bad mood and did these sorts of things. They had been showing signs, for a significant period of time, in case after case after case. If we know this, should we not then create systems in this country to identify people before they act and stop them?  On that point, I believe there is broad consensus, and on that point is where I think we should start. Let's act. If there is a law we can pass or a program we can put in place to prevent one of these things from happening, let's do it. Obviously, we may part ways on different views on the other parts of this, but at least, for now, we are together to get these things done. This is the commonsense way forward. This is the way people operate in real life.  In real life, if you and another group of people agree on something, you do the thing you agree on first, you get that out of the way, and then you have the debate and the vote on the things you may not have a consensus on. We have a chance to do some things, and they are meaningful.  The first is a bill Senator Hatch introduced yesterday. We joined him, along with a broad bipartisan coalition, on the STOP School Violence Senator Hatch's bill is a bill that was innovated by Sandy Hook It is their 1 legislative priority right now, and it is a bill I cannot imagine having a single ``no'' vote in the U.What the bill does is it basically creates a Federal grant program through the Department of Justice for States and through the States' local communities to create risk assessment programs--in essence, to have programs in place to train teachers, administrators, and students to identify the warning signs of someone who may hurt themselves or may hurt other people. It also sets up a task force in each one of these school districts to monitor these students, to identify them collectively. For example, if it had existed in Broward County or something like it that was effective, you can only imagine a room where the sheriff's office and the school and the Department of Children and Families and potentially even the FBI were all there comparing notes. If those entities had been together in one room comparing notes, the sheriff's office would have said we have been to his house 40 times for all sorts of things. The school would have said we had to kick him out, and we had to do all kinds of things because he had fights, he was violent, and made threats. The FBI would say someone actually called our hotline and said this guy was going to shoot up a school. I cannot imagine, through that collaboration, there would not have been action or, at least, the opportunity for action. It didn't happen that way, and we have a chance now to change that.  By the way, I saw last week where it was described by some media outlets as a modest bill. This is not modest. Just because it is not controversial doesn't make it modest. Preventing an attack, identifying an attacker, and stopping them before they act is the best thing we could possibly do.  Hopefully, the STOP School Violence Act is something we will be able to move on fairly quickly. The House announced earlier today that they will be[[Page S1367]]taking that bill up next week on the floor, and I hope we will move quickly to pass Senator Hatch's bill that has already over 20 other Senators involved in it.  Another bill that has been filed that we have joined with as well, with Senators Toomey and Coons, is ``Lie and Try.'' Another problem we have identified in the broader scheme of things is that local law enforcement may not always have sufficient information to investigate individuals who try to buy a firearm, knowing that they are prohibited from doing so. Under our current law, when a person fails an FBI background check, some State law enforcement authorities are not even made aware of the failed background check. Individuals who are willing to lie and try to buy a gun in these situations could very well be very dangerous, and laws are only as good as our willingness and our ability to enforce them. We have to crack down on this. If someone who is ineligible to buy a firearm is trying to buy a firearm, shouldn't law enforcement already, at least, know that--because they may be able to take that piece of information and put it together with other pieces of information to realize this is someone we need to be looking at because they might be up to something.  I hope we can pass that. Again, I cannot imagine anyone not being in favor of it. This law would require Federal authorities to alert State law enforcement within 24 hours when someone who is prohibited from buying a firearm lies and tries to do so.  The third thing I hope we will look at--and we are working on the language now to address this--is the PROMISE Initiative in schools. As I already said, improving our prevention and information sharing systems as the first two pieces of legislation would do is the best thing we can do to stop school shootings before they happen, but these systems will not work if the clearest warning signs of school shootings--suspicious and violent misbehavior at the school--are not reported in the appropriate places in the first place. Anything blocking this flow of information is very dangerous, and it is a risk to our children. For this reason, a directive to schools issued by the Federal Government during the previous administration deserves for us to look at it again.  In 2014, the Department of Education, working with the Department of Justice, issued guidance which used the threat of reduced Federal funding to encourage schools to alter how and which misconduct at school is reported to law enforcement. Now, the goal of this directive was to reduce the school-to-prison pipeline, to reduce suspensions and expulsions, to prevent racially biased discipline. These are laudable goals, which I share and support, but we have to balance that with some common sense. The failure to report violent misbehavior from students--like the shooter in Parkland--to law enforcement can end up having some very serious repercussions as we saw. So no matter how laudable this goal is, it is not worth risking the safety of our children or losing the public's trust and the trust of our parents about sending their kids to school. This directive needs to be refined. It has to allow for schools and law enforcement to communicate, when warranted, for the safety of the student and the community, and furthermore we need clear pathways of intervention and repercussions that need to be established and followed so local education agencies and law enforcement are effectively able to work together to either navigate students back onto the correct path, properly identify and address red flags that can lead to severe consequences or prevent a student from being lost in the system altogether.  Yesterday, I wrote to the Department of Education and the Department of Justice, and I asked them to immediately revise this directive from 2014, and any associated guidance, to make sure that schools are appropriately reporting violence and dangerous actions to local law enforcement.  In addition to asking them to do that, proactively, I will also be introducing legislation to make sure that the Federal Government does not fail our children in this way.  Finally, I believe the Parkland shooting has identified an area of law that can be improved to reduce gun violence of all kinds, particularly school shootings. Amidst the many systems that we have in place, law enforcement often lacks a flexible tool that they can use to prevent the sale or the possession of guns to someone who should not have them, based on their behavior and the behavior that they have exhibited around those who know them best.  There has to be a way to identify and prevent circumstances like what occurred in Parkland, while also preserving the Second Amendment constitutional right of law-abiding Americans and the right to due process. That is why we are working to try to figure out a way to encourage States to enact policies like the gun violence restraining order, so State and local law enforcement and families who have identified someone who is at risk of either taking their own life or hurting other people could petition a court to obtain a court order that allows law enforcement temporarily to stop that person either from buying a gun or from possessing that gun and the ammunition. This would put power back in the hands of people who see something, not just to say something, but they have the opportunity to do something about it.  We continue to work on what the right formulation of that is. The most effective implementation is at the State level. We are trying to figure it out with our colleagues. There are different ideas floating around about the right way to structure it.  It has to have strong due process. You don't want this used to abuse people. You don't want courts to misuse it or have it being used for false claims, but we need to have a tool at our disposal. If the schools and local law enforcement, and others, identify someone who poses a threat but has yet to commit a crime, there has to be a tool available to stop them from buying guns or using the ones they already have.  The State of Florida is probably going to be passing, either today or tomorrow, a law that puts that in State law. Other States like Indiana and California have one as well. What can we do at the Federal level to incentivize more States to do this and have these tools? That is what we are working on.  Hopefully, we will have the resolution on a bill that doesn't just work, but that can pass. We can all file the perfect bill in our own minds, but if it doesn't have 60 votes, it is nothing but a piece of paper. That is why we need to work toward that.  I want to conclude by mentioning one of the students, Kyle Kashuv, who is a junior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High Like many students at that school, he is motivated to advocate for changes in our laws to prevent something like what happened in his school from ever happening again. In his advocacy, he wants to make sure that the Second Amendment is protected. His 1 concern is to make sure that the rights of innocent Americans aren't infringed upon.  His opinion on this issue might be different from some of his other classmates, but that doesn't change their shared goal, which is to stop this from happening to anyone ever again. Although their opinions may vary, he and his classmates still go to school together and still root for the same sports teams at their school. They take the same classes with the same teachers, and they still faced the same danger on February 14. As they lift their voices in political discourse to advocate for change, they have differences. They have differences on some issues, but they share a common goal, to keep themselves and students like them safe.  I think we can learn something from this example--from them and from their parents. The lessons learned from Parkland are that changes can be made. Some of them I just mentioned action on would immediately reduce the chances of school shootings but would not infringe upon the Second Amendment rights of all  The Members elected to the Senate, like the students at Parkland, have a wide array of opinions on many of these issues, but I think we all share a common goal. We all agree that our schools should be safe. So I am here to urge my colleagues to remember that we have to share a country, no matter what our views may be on any political issue. We have to find a way not just to live together but to thrive as a nation. We have to find a way to keep our children safe. If we keep that in mind, I am[[Page S1368]]sure we can work together to create real, enduring consensus on solutions, on things we agree on that will stop these from happening again.  We can have respectful and productive debates on the issues upon which our Nation and this body are still divided, but let us first come together and do the things we agree on. Then we will have the time to argue and debate and solve the things we may not agree on. This is the opportunity before us, and we should not let it pass us by.  I yield the floor.

I hear from a lot of people and I talk to a lot of people about what is on their minds.  Needless to say, in these very complicated and difficult times, there is a lot the American people are concerned about. They are concerned about gun violence, and they want strong legislation to be passed as soon as possible to protect their kids and the American people.  Overwhelmingly, they want legislation--over 80 percent of the American people in poll after poll--want legislation to protect the 1.8 million young people who are eligible for the DACA That is what people talk about.  People talk about the high cost of healthcare, and they talk about the fact that they cannot afford prescription drugs because the drug companies are ripping us off every single day.  They talk about climate change and their fear about what kind of planet we are going to be leaving our kids and our grandchildren if we don't transform our energy system away from fossil fuel.  The people I talk to in Vermont and throughout the country talk about our crumbling infrastructure.  They talk about the need for decent-paying jobs.  They talk about the high cost of a college education. I just talked to a teacher the other day in She had tears in our eyes because she cannot afford to send her own daughter to college. I talk, every day it seems, to people who graduate from college, $30,000, $50,000, $100,000 in debt, and they wonder how that debt will impact the rest of their lives.  I talk to people in Vermont and around the country about the childcare crisis that we have and about the lack of affordable housing and about a million other issues that are on the minds of people in Arizona, in Vermont, and all across this country.  But I can honestly say that I have not heard one person come up to me and say: Bernie, we have to deregulate 25 of the largest banks in this country with cumulative assets of $3.5 trillion. No one has ever come up to me and said that is a major priority for the American people. No one has ever suggested to me that instead of talking this week about and moving forward on gun safety legislation or the DACA issue or the high cost of prescription drugs, we should be here on the floor of the U.Senate talking about the needs of some of the largest banks in this country. But that is precisely what the Senate will be discussing this week and probably next week as well.  If you want to know why the American people, in very, very strong numbers, hold the U.Congress in contempt, it is precisely because we have a Republican leadership that does exactly the opposite of what the American people want. And it is not just not dealing with the DACA issue or dealing with the gun violence issue. Over the last year, despite the overwhelming objections of the American people, Republican leadership tried to throw some 32 million Americans off of health insurance. Thank God we were able to beat that back.  At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, the American people do not believe that the Koch brothers and other billionaires should receive massive tax breaks. That is exactly what the Republican leadership provided.  And on and on it goes.  The needs of the middle class and working families are ignored while the needs of the wealthy and powerful, including Wall Street, are addressed.  Today, my Republican colleagues, along with some Democrats, tell us that what we should be doing right now is spending our time on deregulating some of the largest banks in How absurd is that? Not gun violence, not the DACA crisis, not the high cost of prescription drugs, not 30 million people without health insurance, but deregulating some of the largest banks in  Are our memories so short that we learned nothing from the 2008 Wall Street crash? Have we learned nothing from the savings and loan disaster of the early 1990s or the thievery of Wells Fargo over the last couple of years or the dishonesty of Equifax or the accounting fraud at Enron and Arthur Anderson or the failure of long-term capital management or the billions of dollars in fines that financial institution after financial institution has paid out for illegal or deceptive activities?  Just 10 years ago, as a result of the greed and the recklessness and the illegal behavior on Wall Street, this country was plunged into the worst economic crisis since the Great The official unemployment rate shot up to 10 percent and the real unemployment rate jumped to over 17 percent. At the height of the financial crisis, more than 27 million Americans were unemployed, underemployed, or stopped working altogether because they could not find employment.  Fifteen million families, as a result of that financial crisis, lost their homes to foreclosure as more and more people could not afford to pay their mortgages. Thousands of Americans set up tent cities in Sacramento, Fresno, Tampa Bay, and Reno because they had no place left to live.  As a result of the illegal behavior of Wall Street, American households lost over $13 trillion in savings, which shattered retirement dreams, wiped out life savings, and made it impossible for parents to send their kids to college. That is what Wall Street did 10 years ago. Against my strong opposition then, Congress and the Federal Reserve provided the largest taxpayer bailout in the history of the world to these huge banks because they were too big to fail.  But now, 10 years later, hoping that we forget all about that, these large financial institutions are back again. How pathetic is that? Just yesterday, the Congressional Budget Office told us that the legislation we are debating today will ``increase the likelihood that a large financial firm with assets of between $100 billion and $250 billion would fail.'' That is from the  In other words, this legislation makes it more likely that we will see another financial crisis and makes it more likely that there will be another huge taxpayer bailout and massive dislocation of our economy.  Under this bill, large banks with assets of up to $250 billion will no longer have to submit comprehensive plans on winding down if they fail. They will no longer have to hold sufficient capital in case their loans go bad. And they may never have to undergo a stress test to find out if they are adequately prepared to withstand an economic downturn.  Further, this legislation makes it easier for financial institutions to offer bogus subprime mortgages that caused so many Americans to suffer during the 2008 financial crisis.  This legislation makes it easier for large banks to steer African Americans, Hispanics, and the elderly into mortgages with high interest rates and hidden fees.  This legislation deregulates foreign banks like Deutsche Bank--a bank that in January of 2017 agreed to a $7.2 billion settlement for selling toxic mortgages during the financial crisis.  This legislation guts the Volker rule, allowing banks all over this country to gamble with the bank deposits of their customers on risky derivative schemes that were at the heart of the financial meltdown.  Let us be very clear. The major banks that we are deregulating in this bill were forced to pay over $49 billion in fines for a wide variety of fraudulent and deceptive activity. These very same banks received a taxpayer bailout of $47 billion from the Treasury and trillions in financial assistance from[[Page S1362]]the Federal Many of these banks, it should be pointed out, like Wall Street in general, have enjoyed record-breaking profits over the last 2 years. They are not coming here because they are losing money. Over the last 2 years, most of these banks have done very, very well.  So how does it happen that Congress finds itself worrying about the needs of huge financial institutions but ignores the concerns of ordinary Americans? The answer, as I think most Americans understand, has everything to do with following the money. Follow the money.  Since the 1990s, the financial sector has given more than $3.2 billion in campaign contributions and last year alone spent over $200 million on lobbying. If you want to hear about the corruption of the      American political system, here it is. Since the 1990s,      the financial sector has given more than $3.2 billion in      campaign contributions and last year alone spent over $200      million on lobbying. That is why Congress will be spending      day after day trying to make life easier for these large      financial institutions, while at the same time ignoring      the needs of working families.  No, we can't get a bill on the floor of the Senate that will lower the cost of prescription drugs. We can't do that. The American people overwhelmingly want us to act on gun violence. We can't do that. We are not able to protect the 1.8 million young people who are eligible for the DACA We can't do that. But we can spend a week or two worrying about the needs of some of the largest financial institutions in this country. And that is why the American people are disgusted with what goes on in Washington,  I have a radical idea, and that is that maybe--just maybe--instead of listening to the lobbyists here in DC, maybe we should listen to the American people, who believe that we should strengthen, not weaken, Wall Street regulations.  Believe it or not--of course we are not going to hear any discussion of this at all--believe it or not, the four largest banks in America are, on average, 80 percent bigger today than they were before we bailed them out because they were too big to fail. Incredibly, the six largest banks in America--this is wealth. This is power. This is who owns The six largest banks in America have over $10 trillion in assets--six banks, $10 trillion--equivalent to 54 percent of the GDP of this The six largest banks hold more than half of all credit card debt, control over 90 percent of all bank derivatives, underwrite a third of all mortgages, and control over 40 percent of all bank deposits. If any of these financial institutions were to get into financial trouble again, there is no doubt in my mind that once again the taxpayers of this country would be asked to bail them out--except this time, the bailout might be even larger than it was in 2008.  Now is not the time to be talking about deregulating large financial institutions--quite the contrary. If a financial institution is too big to fail, in my view, it is too big to exist. Now is the time to take on the greed and power of Wall Street and break up the largest financial institutions in this country, and I will be introducing an amendment to this bill to do just that.  I understand fully, as the American people do, the power of Wall Street and the huge amounts of money they spend on campaign contributions and lobbying. That should not, however, intimidate us. Now is the time for us to have the courage to stand up to these very wealthy and powerful institutions, defeat this legislation, and support the needs of the American people.

1387,topic-id,825,"Mr.President, along with Senator Murphy and Senator Lee, I rise to talk about one of the most important jobs the U.Congress has, and that is to fulfill its constitutional responsibility about whether the United States of America engages in military action.  We can disagree about the merits of this or that military action, but there should be absolutely no confusion that sending men and women of the U.military into conflict is the responsibility not of the President of the United States alone but of the U. Let us be very clear--and I say this especially to my conservative friends who talk about the Constitution all the time. Let me remind them as to what article I, section 8 of the Constitution reads in no uncertain terms: ``The Congress shall have Power . . . to declare War.'' The Founding Fathers gave the power to declare war to Congress--the branch most accountable to the people. For far too long, Congress, under both Democratic and Republican administrations, has, in my view, abdicated its constitutional role in authorizing war. We are moving down a very slippery slope by which Congress is now becoming increasingly irrelevant in terms of that vitally important issue.  In my view, the time is long overdue for Congress to reassert its constitutional authority. That is what Senator Lee, Senator Murphy, and I are doing with S.54. I am proud to have as cosponsors on that resolution Senator Durbin, Senator Booker, Senator Warren, Senator Leahy, Senator Markey, Senator Feinstein, and Senator  Many Americans are unaware that the people of Yemen--one of the poorest countries in the world--are suffering terribly today in a devastating[[Page S1663]]civil war with Saudi Arabia and their allies on one side and Houthi rebels on the other. In November of last year, the United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator said that Yemen was on the brink of the ``largest famine the world has seen for many decades.''  So far, thousands of civilians have died. The last count that I have seen is about 10,000. Over 40,000 have been wounded in the war. There are 15 million people who lack access to clean water and sanitation in an infrastructure which has been devastated. More than 20 million people in Yemen--over two-thirds of the population--need some kind of humanitarian support, with nearly 10 million people in acute need of assistance. This is a humanitarian disaster.  This very sad picture of a young child who faces starvation is what is taking place throughout this country. Sadly, this is not the only child in that position. Famine is a serious and growing problem in Further, more than 1 million suspected cholera cases have been reported, potentially representing the worst cholera outbreak in world history. The pictures I have here today have been taken by photojournalists in Yemen, and they can attest to this human disaster.  One of the problems we have is, unfortunately, foreign policy is not an issue we talk about enough on the floor, and it is certainly not talked about enough in the media. Many Americans today are not aware that American forces have been actively engaged in the support of the Saudi coalition in this war--in its providing intelligence and the aerial refueling of planes whose bombs have killed thousands of people and made this crisis far worse.  My colleagues and I, along with all of our cosponsors, believe that as Congress has not declared war or authorized military force in this conflict, the U.involvement in Yemen is unconstitutional and unauthorized and the U.military support of the Saudi coalition must end. Without congressional authorization, our engagement in this war should be restricted to providing desperately needed humanitarian aid and diplomatic efforts to resolve this terrible civil war. That is why Senator Lee and Senator Murphy and I have introduced this joint resolution pursuant to the 1973 War Powers Resolution, which calls for an end to U.support for the Saudi war in  The War Powers Resolution defines the introduction of U.Armed Forces to include the ``assignment of members of such Armed Forces to command, coordinate, participate in the movement of, or accompany the regular or irregular military forces of any foreign country or government when such military forces are engaged, or there exists an imminent threat that such forces will become engaged, in hostilities.'' Assisting with targeting intelligence and refueling warplanes as they bomb those targets clearly meet this definition.  Here is the bottom line: If the U.Congress wants to go to war in Yemen, vote on that war, but I and the cosponsors of this legislation do not believe that the authority to go to war is now appropriate. We think what is going on now is unconstitutional, and unless Congress authorizes this war, it should be ended and ended immediately.  I look forward to a colloquy with Senator Lee and with Senator I now yield to Senator Lee, who has been very active on this issue from day one.

1391,topic-id,618,"Well, let me thank Senator Murphy for his comments and Senator Lee before him. I think they touch on the most important issues. I wish to respond to what Senator Lee and Senator Murphy both said, but I wish to make a point that needs to be made again and again.  This is not a partisan issue. We are talking about Democratic administrations acting militarily without congressional authorization. We are talking about Republican administrations doing the same. Senator Lee is a conservative Senator Murphy is a I am an Independent who caucuses with the So if you are talking about bipartisanship, you are looking at it right here.  I should tell you that there are many organizations around the country--conservative and progressive--that are raising exactly the same issue that we are raising right here, and that is that Congress has to reassert its congressional authority over the issues of war.  If you want to go to war and you think the war in Yemen makes sense, that is fine. Come down here on the floor and tell us why you feel that way. Tell the American people and tell your constituents why you think it is a good idea to work with Saudi Arabia to wreak utter horror on one of the poorest countries in the world. Fine, come on down here and tell us. What we have to do, from a precedent point of view, is finally to say to our Republican President or a Democratic President: Enough is enough. Listen to the  The Founding Fathers of this country were amazingly smart on this issue, and they understood that before we send our young men--and now women--off to war to die or to get maimed, there better well be a very good reason that we have to explain to the people who elected us--not just somebody sitting up there in the Oval That is why the authority for going to war is vested in the representatives of the people, whether we are elected for 2 years or elected for 6 years.  I would also point out that this is not the first time that the Congress has weighed in on the devastating war in In November of last year, the House of Representatives--and I hope my Senate colleagues know this--voted by a vote of 366 to 30. That was not even close. There was overwhelming support among Democrats and They passed a nonbinding resolution stating that the United States' involvement in the Yemen civil war is unauthorized. The Democratic leadership supported it, as did the Republican chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ed  Here is the bottom line. The bottom line is that Congress has ducked its responsibilities for many years, and if we continue to duck our responsibility on the all-important issue of U.military intervention, this Congress and, in fact, the people of the United States become increasingly irrelevant on this most important matter.  We are bringing forward a privileged motion. There will be a vote on this issue in one form or another. If you like the war in Yemen, then be prepared to defend why you think it is a great idea to work with the Saudis to destroy the infrastructure and to create a situation where famine and cholera are rampant in that incredibly poor country. Come on down and tell us why you think it is a good idea. If not, I hope you will vote with us to end this war and to allow the United States to get involved in bringing the warring parties together to see if we can bring peace and to see if we can bring humanitarian relief to these terribly suffering people.

1756,topic-id,802,"Mr.Speaker, I rise to encourage folks at home, folks in this body, folks wherever they may be scattered across this country to speak out against what the administration has proposed with regard to raising tariffs on steel and aluminum. At the end of the day, I believe it would be disastrous not just for the economy at large, but, frankly, for every one of us in the way that it would impact our pocketbook or our wallet.  In short, what I guess I am saying is that you don't have to do stupid to find that stupid is indeed stupid.  What I am getting at here is that we have had real-world experiments about once every 100 years in this country on these kinds of policies.  It was in 1828 that you had the so-called tariffs of abomination, and it was designed to supposedly protect jobs and protect industry. It proved to do neither. It actually proved to be disastrous for the South and, in particular, South Carolina, where I am from.  About 100 years later, you had the Smoot-Hawley tariffs that were equally disastrous in not producing what they were supposedly designed to do. They didn't protect jobs, didn't protect industry, and, in fact, world trade declined by about two-thirds during that time period.  So as a country, what I am suggesting is that we need to take a breath, we need to look before we leap.  In life, I would say there is a value to listening to the advice and counsel of others. In this case, Gary Cohn, the President's chief economic person, who is actually leaving based on this dispute, has said this is not a good idea. Steelworkers unions have said this is not a good idea for the way it will impact Canadian steel and, by virtue, American steel. The markets, which are sort of the collective opinion of what we all think is going to come next economically, dropped 600 points on Thursday and Friday, saying this is not a good idea. In fact, the Prime Minister of Sweden was here yesterday, and he was saying it was not a good idea.  A lot of folks have spoken out and said: This is a genuinely bad idea. Let's not move forward.  I would say further that, in negotiations, rescue teams shouldn't be the ones shooting the hostage.  In this case, we have our Cs mixed up. The administration talks about doing something about China, but, in fact, the group--the country--most impacted would be the The Canadians have to be some of our staunchest allies over a long period of time, with us in war, with us in trade, with us culturally; yet the bulk of all steel that is imported to the United States comes from Canada and 50 percent of what we export in steel goes to  Let me put it this way: what I am saying is that what we need to do here is to trust our allies. If you walk into a bar and somebody says, ``If you take one step closer, I am going to hit you in the face,'' we need to trust them that they are telling the truth. And[[Page H1448]]what they said is: If you do this to us, we are going to do it to you.  In short, a trade war will ensue.  I remember watching a movie back when I was in high school or college, somewhere along there, called ``War Games,'' and basically what it said was: the only way to win was not to play.  If we move forward, we are going to get hurt. Nobody wins in a trade war.  Finally, I would say this: in life, it is easier to burn down than to build up. You can take years constructing something and have it gone as a consequence of a match in a matter of moments or hours.  As we look at this, this administration, in conjunction with the Congress, has worked hard to construct a better environment for jobs, capital, and way of life with the tax cuts, with regulatory reform; but all that could be erased if we move forward with these tariffs.  More telling is the 70-year apparatus that has been created--over 70 years, since the time of World War II--that had us engage with the rest of the world, and we see movement in the wrong direction.  Do we want better trade?   Can there be changes that are made?  But this is not the answer.  A tariff, at the end of the day, is a tax.  My simple presumption and my simple ask of this administration, the ask of everybody in talking about what is occurring here, is to say: Let's not increase taxes as a way of ``protecting jobs and capital in this country.''                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-07-pt1-PgH1447-3.txt,91,"250TH ANNIVERSARY OF SANFORD, MAINE",2018.0,7.0,March
42,topic-id,1069,"Mr.President, yesterday at the White House, two terrible things happened, and it shouldn't be difficult to condemn both of these things at once.  First, at the podium in the White House press room, it was suggested that the U.Government is unsure if Putin's reelection was perhaps legitimate, free, and fair or that perhaps the United States is morally indifferent to the question of whether Putin's reelection was fair, free, and legitimate.  It was not fair or free or legitimate, and it matters.  The second horrible thing that happened yesterday is that the President's confidential briefing materials for his call with Vladimir Putin were anonymously leaked to the public. That should not happen. The President's congratulatory call was terribly ill-advised, but that doesn't change the fact that the leaking of the confidential briefing materials for his call was also wrong.  It shouldn't be difficult to say both of these things. They are both true. So we should be able to say both of them at once.  Our people are very divided right now. They are unclear about who we are and how we conceive of ourselves on the global stage. Our tribalism has run amok. If you listen to some of our cable news today--I haven't--I suspect that what you would find is that on certain networks there is only discussion of the leaking and no discussion of what a terrible abandonment of American foreign policy yesterday's failure to condemn Putin's phony sham reelection was. And on the other networks, I imagine you are going to get exactly the opposite story, where the only thing that matters is how stupid this call was to Vladimir Putin, and nothing about the leaks. That isn't helpful for building a nation of 320 million people who know what we stand for together.  Here is what is true. A President's staff shouldn't leak. In cases of principle, you may need to resign. So resign. Do the right and honorable thing if you believe your conscience is compelled to do so, and resign your position and go out and publicly make a case for why a certain policy is failing. But that is a different thing than anonymously leaking the information that a President has--not just this President, but that any President has--to make his or her decisions, to deliberate with their staff, to plot their actions.  Leaks like this weaken us both at home, in terms of public trust in our institutions and our public servants, and they weaken us abroad, in terms of whether or not we have any coherence to who we are as a people and how we make our decisions.  Now, as to this decision to fail to condemn Putin's sham reelection, it is very foolhardy. Vladimir Putin is not a friend. Vladimir Putin is a despot. The President of the United States was wrong to congratulate him, and the White House Press Secretary was wrong to duck a simple question about whether or not Putin's reelection was free and fair.  It was not. The American people know that, the Russian people know that, and the world knows that. Yesterday, when the White House refused to speak directly and clearly about this matter, we were weakened as a nation, and a tyrant was strengthened.  Around the world, there are two great symbols of America from this city. The first is the dome of the Capitol, in which we stand. This building testifies to the strength of our self-government and to our belief in inherent human dignity, but the other symbol that comes from this city that is known around the world is the podium in the White House press room. Tucked into a small room and surrounded by members of a free press, it is simply the free world's biggest megaphone. It symbolizes Americans commitment to the universal dignity not just of 320 million people--the citizens of this country--but to 7.6 billion men, women, and children across the globe.  Speaking clearly about tyrants is one of the things that we do. It is not seeking monsters to destroy. For more than 200 years, the American people have clearly understood this. For more than 200 years, administrations of both parties have clearly understood this.  At times in the past, previous administrations have made mistakes. They have split hairs. They have smoothed edges. They have dodged. They have hedged. But what happened yesterday at the podium at the White House--the dodge on Putin--broke with the basic[[Page S1881]]American moral tradition. It broke faith with our core values, and it broke trust with freedom seekers across the globe.  This very day there are dissidents all over the globe struggling against totalitarian regimes in darkness. To them, America has always said and America still says: We see you. We stand with you. We may make long and deliberate decisions about how we engage in the world and about what particular commitments are prudent to exercise at different times with different allies, but we have always spoken unequivocally about the universal dignity of 7.6 billion people. To those who struggle, we have always said: We see you, and we stand with you.  These simple truths matter. The moral responsibilities of the Office of the Presidency matter. When we don't affirm these basic truths, it is a failure to who we are, and it is a failure to do what we do. It is a betrayal not just to the millions of people who were denied free and fair elections in Russia this week, but it is a failure to people all across the globe who are struggling in darkness against tyrants.  Each and every Member of this Senate--all 100 of us--was elected in the kind of free and fair election that Vladimir Putin fears--the kind of election that he would not win. Vladimir Putin is a coward. Vladimir Putin is a despot.  Just this month, Vladimir Putin tried to assassinate a political dissident and his daughter on NATO soil in the Given that we have taken an oath in this body, after our free and fair elections, to uphold and defend the Constitution--given that--we ought not, in this body, find it difficult to say basic true things, like that we condemn leaks by the President's staff against him.

1787,topic-id,434,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding and for his leadership working together in a very bipartisan way to bring forward RAY BAUM'S Not only is this piece of legislation important to reauthorize the FCC and the important work that they do, but it also is a fitting tribute[[Page H1413]]to Ray Baum himself and, in so many ways, to all of the work that our great staffs do to allow this Capitol to work properly and to allow Congress to work for the American people.  It doesn't just take Members of Congress, but an incredibly dedicated and talented staff, and each of us are blessed to have wonderful staffs--I am surely no exception--who allow us to do our jobs so well. The fact that we are using this legislation to pay tribute to Ray Baum and all of the staff of the Capitol, I think, is equally important that we do just this.  Mr.Speaker, President Trump challenged Congress to make the Federal Government more accountable to the American people and to eliminate red tape that hurts job creation and economic growth. The RAY BAUM'S Act does just that.  First of all, we meet those two goals by doing a number of things. The legislation will reauthorize the Federal Communications Commission for the first time in 28 years.  The FCC does important work for our country, especially in the telecommunications arena. I am proud to continue to serve on the Communications and Technology Subcommittee, which is one of the great examples of United States dominance--America is the dominant force in technology--and it is important that we have fair rules of the game. The FCC is that arbiter. The fact that they haven't been reauthorized for 28 years, I think, it is long past due that we get this done. We also make critical reforms that will modernize the agencies with tools that it needs to meet the demands of consumers for the 21st century.  This legislation creates an important backstop for our local radio and TV broadcasters who have been completing the final stage of the incentive auction. This keeps America on track to be the global leader on 5G communications by implementing new spectrum policy.  This is something our committee has led on. The country needs more spectrum. We have been able to find creative ways to free up more spectrum so that billions of dollars of private sector investment can be used to build out these great networks in 3G, 4G, and, now, 5G so that we can continue to advance technology.

This is included as part of this legislation. This will provide relief to so many job creators and to the FCC by consolidating and eliminating so many outdated reporting requirements.  What do I mean by eliminating outdated reporting requirements, Mr.Speaker?  How often do we hear about things that are on the books, laws that are on the books that are so outdated and so unnecessary? This is one of the reports that we are outdating in this bill.  Right now, there is still, on the books, a requirement that the FCC report on the annual competition within the telegraph industry. Mr.Speaker, that is right.  Since Samuel Morse invented the telegraph back in the 1830s, that might have been important in the 1800s, even in the early 1900s; but the fact that today, in 2018, there is still a requirement that the FCC issue a report on competition within the telegraph industry is a glaring example of why it is so important for us to update our laws and eliminate outdated laws.  We are getting rid of this ridiculous requirement and a number of other unnecessary and ridiculous requirements like that so that we can free the FCC up to do the important work they need to do.                              {time}  1515  So, again, I commend the chairman for the work that he has done in a very bipartisan way to bring forth the RAY BAUM'S Act, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation.

I want to say, Mr.Speaker, that I rise in opposition to H.5247 because it creates a dangerous back door for modern-day snake oil salesmen, a back door around the FDA approval process for people who may or may not be preying on desperate people, and it ignores that there actually is a safe pathway for terminally ill patients to get treatment.  This bill failed to pass last week and it should fail again. It is a harmful policy that both Republican-and Democratic-appointed former FDA Commissioners concluded there is ``no evidence'' that this bill ``would meaningfully improve access for patients, but would just remove the FDA from the approval process and create a dangerous precedent that would erode protections for vulnerable patients,'' the most vulnerable patients. People whose lives are in danger feel that they will try anything, and there are people out there who will prey on that.

Senator Daniel Kahikina Akaka died on Friday at the age of 93, leaving behind a legacy of integrity, kindness, and service to Hawaii and to the  In Washington, Senator Akaka was an ambassador of ``aloha.'' He showed people kindness, respect, and hospitality rarely seen in this town. He didn't just represent Hawaii's interests in the Congress; he showed the world what Hawaii represents; in the words of President Kennedy, ``all that we are and all that we hope to be.''  He started that service as a welder in the U.Army Corps of He fought in World War II in the Pacific arena, traveling to places like Tinian and When World War II ended, he took advantage of the GI bill to attend the University of Hawaii to become a teacher--an occupation he never fully left behind.  Senator Akaka served for 36 years in Congress--14 years in the House and 22 in the U.He was loved by colleagues in both parties because he was kind to everyone. In fact, he never said a bad word about anyone, not even in private. The foundation for his kindness came from his faith, which he learned from his mother  He was a faithful attendee of the weekly Senate Prayer Breakfast, where he would lead Members singing hymns. He always began with the history of each song--a tradition he passed on to our own Chaplain, Chaplain Black, who continues it today.  Danny Akaka was also very humble. There were times he didn't get credit for the work he did here because he didn't care about the credit. He cared about the work, about making a difference for people, especially those whom he represented.  He was deeply convinced that the government could improve people's lives because he had seen that in his own life as a beneficiary of the GI bill. He would become the Senator who modernized that bill, bringing it into the 21st century. He always fought hard for veterans--for their benefits and their recognition, no matter the color of their skin or their country of origin. When someone once challenged him on the cost of benefits for veterans, he answered by saying: ``The price has already been paid, many times over, by the service of the brave men and women who wore our nation's uniform.''  Senator Akaka never forgot the costs of war on our country, and he did everything he could to make sure his colleagues didn't either. He voted against the Iraq war and advocated for peace and nuclear nonproliferation throughout his career.  He was unrelenting when it came to the causes that were most important to him. As the only Native Hawaiian to ever serve in the U.Senate, he never stopped working to see Native Hawaiians recognized in a government-to-government relationship with the United  In his years on the Indian Affairs Committee, including as the chairman, he successfully sponsored the apology resolution, which recognized that the overthrow of the Queen--the only monarch in the United States--was illegal and facilitated by agents of our own Federal  This was the theme of Senator Akaka's career--to advocate for people who did not have power and for people who were vulnerable. He was a champion for the Federal Government employees who, to this day, continue to be a punching bag for some. He sponsored the 2012 Whistleblower Protection Act, which ensures that Federal workers cannot be retaliated against if they report waste, fraud, and abuse. That was just one of the many things he did to make the Federal Government a better employer.  Senator Akaka also fought for consumers. He helped people who were trying to get out of credit card debt. He made sure investors had an advocate at the Securities and Exchange Commission, and he protected people who sent remittances around the world so they aren't swindled out of their hard-earned money.  Every morning he would begin his day by meeting visitors from Those connections to his constituents--to home--drove his work and kept him focused on helping  Much of his work was possible because of the bipartisanship relationships he built with other Some of his best friends in the body--Senators Inhofe, Cochran, and Barrasso--were people with whom he did not agree very often. Every Member of this body--those who knew Senator Akaka and those who didn't--can learn from his legacy--a legacy of quiet leadership, of treating others the way you want to be treated, and focusing on the things that matter to the people we are here to represent.  I want to end with a few words from Chaplain This is what he had to say about Senator Akaka:       There's something called ethical congruence--it refers to      when your actions back up your rhetoric. And most of us      struggle with that, because it's very easy to say something      but much more difficult to live it. There's a verse in      Scripture that says, we are living letters, so our lives      should be something that people should be able to read.      Francis of Assisi said: preach the gospel everywhere you go;      when necessary, use words. Senator Akaka preached the gospel      everywhere he went, and very rarely had to use words. That's      the kind of ethical congruence that he had.[[Page S1998]]  The U.Senate and our country would be better off if there were more leaders like He fought for the vulnerable, promoted peace, and looked for common ground. Most of all, he embodied the ``aloha'' spirit and showed us all what it means to have a pure heart and be a true public servant.

1405,topic-id,979,"Mr.President, the news about climate change certainly feels daunting. In the United States, we have historic wildfires, hurricanes, storms, and floods. Severe weather has upended people's lives, destroyed businesses and homes, and is now costing the economy tens of billions of dollars every year. Around the world, it can sometimes seem even bleaker. Cities are running out of water, and drought has distressed entire regions and pushed people out of their homes and fueled conflict.  Meanwhile, here in Washington, DC, the Trump administration is actively undermining our ability to address climate change. At the EPA in particular, Scott Pruitt is allowing polluters to violate the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water He plans to eliminate limits on methane emissions and protections that keep toxic chemicals from polluting our waterways. He is rolling back the Clean Power Plan and fuel efficiency standards that keep too much carbon from polluting the air. He has cut the number of fines for polluters by more than half, and he has reduced the EPA's staff so that it is down to the same level that it was in 1984. There are 700 EPA employees, including 200 scientists, who have left since the beginning of the Trump administration. In other words, this administration is not just ignoring climate change and its impacts, it is actually throwing fuel on the fire.  So is there any reason for hope? Let me give you three reasons to actually be hopeful.  First, the rest of the world is going to move forward with or without leadership. Every single nation in the world is working to lower its emissions and meet its commitments as part of the Paris Experts said that even without the United States, the Paris Agreement can succeed if nations follow through, and there are some promising signs that this is happening.  In China, experts predicted that coal consumption would peak between the years 2020 and 2040, but Brookings reported earlier this year that the country's consumption of coal has already peaked. One-third of global investments in renewable energy today come from In 2018, they will likely make up half of the entire global market for new solar installations.  China is not the only one making progress here. The world is in a race for clean energy. A coalition of 22 countries and the EU is investing more than $30 billion a year in clean energy research and development.  That brings us to the second reason to have hope on climate change, and that is economics. Here in the United States, financial incentives remain the law regardless of what Scott Pruitt wants the law to be. We still have the investment tax credit and the production tax credit for solar and wind, and they are pushing us toward clean energy. Last year, more than half of the[[Page S1672]]new energy generation that came online in the United States was that of wind and solar--more than coal and natural gas combined.  The fact is that clean energy is now cheaper than dirty energy. In 2009, coal cost $111 per megawatt hour, natural gas $83, wind $135. Utility-scale solar cost a whopping $359--about 3\1/2\ times the cost of coal. By 2017--listen to these numbers--it was $102 for coal, $60 for natural gas, $45 for wind, and $50 for utility-scale solar. Now wind and solar are 20 percent cheaper, on average, and coal is twice as expensive as clean energy.  Even the fossil fuel industry understands that we are moving toward a low-carbon economy. That is why their investors are demanding accountability. Last year, a majority of shareholders forced ExxonMobil to start reporting on how the fight against climate change will impact the oil company, which is the largest oil company in the world. TransCanada canceled its plans to build an oil pipeline that would have carried 1.1 million barrels of oil a day because of the changing economic and political calculations.  Third and finally, the United States may not have the President's leadership on climate change, but when it comes to the Paris Agreement, corporations, States, and cities have stood up and declared: We are still in. Thousands of mayors, Governors, CEOs, Tribal leaders, and average Americans are working to meet our commitment to the Paris Here is one example at the State level. More than half of the States have clean energy policies in place, and many have capped emissions. In Hawaii, we will transition to 100 percent clean energy by the year 2045, and analysts are optimistic that we may reach our goal sooner than that. These efforts are making a difference. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon found that the United States can meet our original commitment to the Paris Agreement regardless of what Rex Tillerson, Donald Trump, and Scott Pruitt want. Even if the EPA undermines our effort, we are still on track.  George Washington once said that ``perseverance and spirit have done wonders in all ages.'' He also said that ``it is infinitely better to have a few good men than many indifferent ones.'' By these two measures, there is even hope in Senator Sheldon Whitehouse will be remembered in history as the epitome of perseverance and spirit when it comes to climate change. He understands the moral urgency of this moment. When we look at the Senators joining him on the floor this evening, it is clear that we have more than a few good men and women working on this issue.  We will continue to shine a light on the many ways that this administration is failing the American people by ignoring climate change. We will also continue to hope because the absence of leadership from this President has not stopped the rest of the country or the rest of the world from acting on climate, and it will not stop us from moving forward.

What Pruitt is doing is just incredible. In a relatively brief tenure at EPA, he has amassed an embarrassing list of scandals. He has ordered the construction of an expensive soundproof office at the EPA for reasons unknown, when none of his predecessors, Democratic or Republican, saw any need for such a facility. He has typically flown coach when paying for travel out of his own pocket but elected to fly first class when the taxpayers foot the bill. After moving to Washington, Administrator Pruitt rented an apartment for a cutrate price from--guess who--an energy lobbyist and former campaign donor who represents multiple clients with businesses before the EPA during Pruitt's tenure.  The level of hypocrisy in this administration is staggering. President Trump says he is going to drain the swamp. Pruitt characterizes the swamp in just about all of his actions, and Trump sticks by him. If you want to drain the swamp, Mr.President, get rid of Mr. Unfortunately, President Trump has stood by Pruitt, despite obvious abuses of the taxpayers' money and trust. Why? Well, he likes what he is doing to unwind critical environmental protections on behalf of powerful industries.  The bottom line is simple. President Trump is so beholden to the special interests that supported Administrator Pruitt and his extreme, anti-green, industry-driven agenda that he is willing to turn a blind eye to serious ethical problems.

197,topic-id,1805,"Mr.President, I have a few items I would like to address this morning, but first I would like to recognize our dear friend from Mississippi, the senior Senator, who will be delivering his farewell speech today.  Senator Thad Cochran has served in this body for decades with a sense of dignity, decorum, and respect for his colleagues. That was always appreciated but never confused for lack of fierceness or conviction. When his issues were on the line, Senator Cochran fought for Mississippi as hard as any After all, he was first bitten by the political bug in his run for head cheerleader at Ole Miss, and he shares that distinction with Trent So if you want to be a Senator for Mississippi, join the cheerleading squad for Ole Of course, for New Yorkers, we like Eli Manning too. Senator Cochran never stopped being a cheerleader for  Chairman Cochran and I certainly had our differences. The chairman once said:       I don't call a lot of news conferences. I just don't see      that as a necessary part of my responsibilities.  Well, we will agree to disagree on that one, but there are many things we have in common, and there is a particular part of his legacy I admire.  After Hurricane Katrina buffeted his State, he convinced the recalcitrant lawmakers to deliver aid to the gulf coast--far exceeding the administration's request--and he did it by working Members on his side of the aisle and across the aisle behind the scenes. That is how he earned the nickname the ``quiet persuader.'' It is a skill I greatly respect after going through something similar when Hurricane Sandy hit my home State of New  At the time, Chairman Cochran was the ranking member on the Appropriations He and his staff were extraordinarily helpful throughout the process. Ultimately, Senator Cochran voted for the Sandy relief bill when many of his colleagues opposed it. I will never forget that.  Under his stewardship of the Appropriations Committee, we have just completed the text of an omnibus spending bill, which I will address in a moment. Once the bill passes, it will be a fitting legacy that Senator Cochran will retire with another bipartisan accomplishment under his belt.  I wish him and his family the best, and I thank him for his distinguished service to the State of Mississippi, to his beloved country, and to the U.He will be missed in the                      Omnibus Appropriations Bill  Mr.President, I am pleased to say the four congressional leaders have reached an agreement on the omnibus spending bill that is now public. It didn't happen until last night. It took a long time. There were painstaking weeks of negotiations, more than a few of which we went past the midnight hour. Before I go further, I want to thank Leader McConnell, Speaker Ryan, and their staffs, Leader Pelosi and her team, Chairman Cochran, Vice Chairman Leahy, the Appropriations Committee staff, and many others for all the hard work that went into this bill.  It certainly doesn't have everything Democrats want, and it contains a few[[Page S1887]]things Democrats aren't thrilled about. The same is true of our Republican friends. That is true of all compromises. If each of us stood on our hind legs and said ``If I don't get everything I want, I am voting no,'' we would be totally paralyzed, and that happens far too often in this body, but on this appropriations bill, this omnibus, somehow that didn't happen. There was a remarkable spirit of give-and-take in the room.  Overall, we Democrats are very happy with what we have been able to accomplish on a number of very important priorities to the middle class in America: infrastructure, education, opioid treatment, mental health, childcare. For nearly a decade, the middle class in this country has suffered from a needless and self-imposed austerity, limiting investment of all of the things that create good-paying jobs and improve the working conditions of Americans, improve the lives of This spending bill, this spending agreement, brings that era of austerity to an unceremonious end and represents one of the most significant investments in the middle class in decades.  So many of the middle class are frustrated, and they don't know why. Well, one of the reasons is quietly, but unfortunately and quite decisively, this Congress cut back on the very ladder that helps the middle class climb in education, in infrastructure, in healthcare. It was cut and cut and cut. The help that the Federal Government has given to the middle class since the progressive era of the early 1900s was taken away quietly but decisively. It is back. It is going to help middle-class people stay in the middle class. It is going to help those aspiring to the middle class climb that ladder and get there. It is really a good thing, and I am excited about it.  As the Republican leader mentioned, it robustly funds our military, giving our men and women in uniform the resources they need; it also improves our ability to respond to wildfires; it makes a critical downpayment on election security; it provides a reliable pathway for the essential infrastructure projects in our country; and it makes an incremental but important progress on the issue of gun violence--a debate this Congress must resume soon.  Again, that era of austerity, which so hurt middle-class Americans, is coming to an unceremonious end because this bill respects one of the most significant investments in the middle class in decades. For these reasons, I am confident this agreement will pass both Houses of Congress; hopefully, with comfortable margins; hopefully, in a bipartisan way.  Again, I thank the Republican leader for his part in reaching this agreement, and I look forward to passing this legislation as soon as possible.          China and Protecting American Intellectual Property  Mr.President, now on a final issue, while we are talking about agreement and bipartisanship, I don't agree with President Trump on a whole lot, but today I want to give him a big pat on the back. He is doing the right thing when it comes to  For many of us, since Senator Graham and I went and visited China over a decade ago, we have watched China rapaciously take advantage of America, American jobs, American workers, and America's intellectual property. China is ruthless in how they go after us. They do it quietly. They do it with a smile. Unfortunately, previous Presidents--Democratic and Republican--just stood by as China did what it did to us.  President Trump is exactly right when, this afternoon, he will propose a plan designed to punish China for its most flagrant trade abuses.  I have called for such action for years and have been disappointed by the inactions by both President Bush and President I am very pleased this administration is taking strong action to get a better deal on China because China has stolen and extorted the intellectual property of American companies for years without repercussion.  Our intellectual property is our family jewel. The American way of openness, of thinking, of debate has created the kind of place where great thinkers come, think of great ideas, and those ideas are often translated into millions of middle-class, good-paying jobs. China knows this, but China is not a free and open society. To achieve the kind of gains and advancements in technology, in biomedical science, and so many other things, they have to steal what we do sometimes by buying our companies, sometimes by cyber theft, sometimes by just these joint ventures, and they tell American firms: You can only come to China if you give away your intellectual property. China is taking huge advantage of us.  Intellectual property is the lifeblood of emerging industries and the good-paying jobs they provide. The American advantage of intellectual property is one of the main things that will keep us 1 economically in this century but not if we allow it to be stolen and taken advantage of, and the country that does that more than any other is  As I said, intellectual property is the lifeblood of emerging industries and the good-paying jobs they provide, so it is impossible to overstate the cost of IP theft to our economy and our workers. This sentence pains me, and I think about it often: GEN Keith Alexander, a four-star general, nonpolitical, was in charge of cyber security in America, and here is what he said: China's theft of our intellectual property is ``the greatest transfer of wealth in history.'' We are letting them do it. The crown jewel of America, our free and open society that allows great thinkers to create great ideas and products, they steal it, and we do nothing. It is one of the things that aggravates me more than most others. Finally, President Trump is doing something, unlike his predecessors, so I commend him.  The WTO--they have been grossly inadequate for this problem. We cannot continue to ignore flagrant cheating by China, whether WTO likes it or not. So the administration's announcement today is a leap forward. If this new push is going to be successful, we need our allies to work with us--Germany, Italy, France, Britain, open and free societies, unlike They know their stuff is being stolen too. Join with us. If we are a united, strong front against Chinese activities on intellectual property, we can force them to change their ways, but they will not do it by persuasion; they will not do it by smiling; and, frankly, they will not do it by diplomacy when some of our diplomats come in and say: We need China for this thing; ignore the economic theft; ignore the economic disadvantage. So I support what the President is doing.  When it came to the tariffs on steel and aluminum, I supported the thrust, I supported the President's instinct, but it wasn't focused enough on China and hurt too many of our other allies, like Canada, where we have a trade surplus. I hope the President corrects his thinking on that, but, here, this is aimed at China and one of the ways China hurts us the very most. It is smart. It is good. I salute our Trade Rep Lighthizer for pushing this issue; I salute our Commerce Secretary Ross for pushing this issue.  By the way, to help support the administration's efforts to crack down on China, we will fully fund the USTR's trade enforcement fund at $15 million in the omnibus. So let's make sure China starts playing by the rules, and intellectual property is certainly at the top of the list. Today's announcement by the President will be a great start in that direction. Democrats, Republicans, Americans of every ideology and every region of the country should support these actions.  I yield the floor.

Folks want to be able to afford quality healthcare. That is probably their greatest worry. They know healthcare is so vital to them and for families. They know costs keep going up. They are worried about premiums, especially after the Republican Congress has done so much to sabotage our healthcare system; talking about tearing down the healthcare system but never building it up in any way.  Folks also want a good job with decent benefits and higher wages, but they are not seeing much of that in the wake of the Republican tax bill. In fact, many of them are disappointed that they are not receiving more. They are seeing corporations buy back a lot of their stock, which boosts compensation for executives and shareholders, but they don't see that much of a bump in their paychecks.

Another example where our Republican colleagues who run this Senate haven't done enough--not close to enough--is on the issue of gun safety. On these issues and more, the Republican majority has done very little.

1030,topic-id,2753,"Mr.President, later this afternoon President Trump plans to announce sweeping steel and aluminum tariffs. Let me say once again, I believe the President's instincts on China are correct. All those who are trying to push him away from his instincts will allow China over the next decade to become the dominant economic power and greatly hurt American jobs and American prosperity as well. So I would say: Mr.President, stick to your instincts.  But while the President's instincts are correct, the execution on these tariffs is poor. That is the difference here--not the instinct, not that we shouldn't go after China, and not that we have to do more to bolster American wealth and American workers against rapacious policies of China's. China will stop at nothing, nothing, nothing, to steal our intellectual property and to manipulate its currency to exclude American companies from being there.  China has been rapacious about trade, and I have spoken about this problem for years. Early on--I think it was 2004 or 2005--Senator Graham and I discovered that China was manipulating its currency. I heard it from Crucible steel up in Syracuse,  The great thinkers said: They don't manipulate their currency. This is protectionist.  In the same week--I was quite proud of this--the New York Times editorial board, which is liberal, and the Wall Street Journal editorial board, which is conservative, both said: There is no such thing as currency manipulation, and Schumer and Graham ought to back off.  Of course, we proved to be right on that and other issues.  China is rapacious. If we don't stop China, America will be a weaker place with fewer good-paying jobs, with less wealth, less strength, and we probably won't stay the greatest country in the world--although we deserve to because we play by the rules.  President Trump has identified the right opponent--China--much better than both the Obama and Bush administrations did. Both Democrats and Republicans have been blind to this issue, and Trump isn't. But I would say to the President: Don't swing blindly and wildly at our foe, Establish a well-placed jab at Set them back. Let them know we mean business.  President Trump ought to rethink his plan so it actually achieves what he says he wants it to achieve.  U.steel and aluminum workers have been battling heavily subsidized products from China for decades. I know. I have Nucor in my State, in Auburn and in Chemung On aluminum, I have Alcoa in my State, in Our steel and aluminum workers deserve a more level playing field against these countries like China that heavily subsidize their products or other countries that purchase Chinese steel at artificially low prices and ship it to the United A targeted trade action against China would be very helpful not only in providing relief for the steel and aluminum workers in New York and around the country, but it would send a strong shot across the bow to China for the first time in decades: We mean business. We are not going to let you prey on us any longer.  Targeted trade against China and against countries that allow China to sell them steel at artificially low prices and then send it here, go after them, but instead of getting right at China, the President's across-the-board tariffs will cause more damage to key allies and other domestic industries. I not only have steelworkers in Upstate New York, I have a lot of autoworkers. For instance, we are so proud of the GM plant in Tonawanda near Buffalo and the Ford stamping plant also in Western New We are so proud of our agriculture.  Incidentally, the President is right, Canada has put in certain restrictions on American dairy going to Canada that has hurt companies like the Cayuga cooperative in Central New York and O-AT-KA in Genesee  We have to protect and help our workers in auto manufacturing and our farmers who do export and who do good things. China doesn't let our auto products in, in a fair way, but other countries do--Canada does.  So the President's proposal does more harm to Europe and other allies[[Page S1531]]like Canada than it does to That is what is wrong with it. It is so typical of this White Even when they have a good idea, they mess it up because they don't think it through, and the President acts only by his instincts. You have to act by your instincts and put a thought process on top of it.  The goal of the President to go after China was not really achieved very well in his proposal. The haphazard way these tariffs were put together has caused policy to miss the mark. It seems no one is at home in the White House right now. President Trump makes up his mind one day, changes it the next, and meanwhile trade policies, foreign policies, gun policies, immigration policies are all in chaos because he says one thing one day and another thing the next. So we need the President to follow his instincts but then allow the people who know this issue to craft something smart.  The President and I may agree on trade. As I said, we are closer on this issue than I have been with either the Bush or Obama administrations, but the slapdash way these tariffs were constructed have few of us cheering, even those of us who really have wanted to go after China long before politics was a gleam in President Trump's eye. Well, maybe that is not true; it may have been a gleam in his eye but before he ran for anything.  I strongly urge the President to rethink these tariffs and focus his policy more directly at China and countries that ship cheap Chinese steel to the United On the flip side, I am sure some of our business interests will tell the President do nothing on trade.  The chamber of commerce--they are interested in the bottom-line profits of their big companies, and they don't care if they make those profits at the expense of American workers. They are not a barometer here, and President Trump is right to ignore them. We have to be smart about this--not just tough, but tough and smart. We need to get tough and smart on China, and the right approach is targeted action against China's most flagrant abuses.                          Republican Tax Bill  Mr.President, on tax, since the Republican tax bill passed last year, nearly every day there has been a new story about a corporation choosing to pass along the savings from the tax law to wealthy shareholders and corporate executives because they buy back their stocks. They use this new tax money not to help their workers but to buy back their stocks. In January, there was an initial flurry of all these bonuses. They have been totally overwhelmed with stock buybacks. What Democrats said is proving to be true. The vast majority of this tax break is for the wealthy, by the wealthy, used by the wealthy to help themselves, not help workers. That has been the history when you give these corporations lots of money, when they have so much money already, without pointing it in the direction of helping workers.  Yesterday, Chevron joined the parade of those with stock buybacks. It was Chevron who announced that while it was making no changes to workers' compensation or benefits, it would be restarting its dormant stock repurchasing program. Do you know how much Chevron got from this tax bill? Mr.President, $2 billion. Do you know how much they are giving their workers--or benefits--out of that $2 billion? Nothing as of now. Do you know what they are using it for? Stock buybacks. Let our Republican friends come to the floor and defend those stock buybacks. Let them do that.  Today, another oil company, Hess, announced it would be purchasing back $1 billion of its stock by the end of the year. Since the start of 2018, just in the last few months, the cumulative total of share buybacks has passed $200 billion. Let me repeat that, $200 billion has been used for stock buybacks. The month of February set the 1-month record for share buybacks, and analysts at JPMorgan--hardly a liberal think tank--says they ``expect total buybacks in 2018 to surpass $800 billion, way up from the $530 billion last year and demolishing 2007's all-time high that came in a bit below $700 billion.'' That is not Chuck Schumer or CPAC or any of these liberal think tanks, that is JPMorgan  So our poor Republican friends had hoped this tax bill would send them on a trajectory to win elections and, by February, the numbers are starting to turn against them again. Look at the Quinnipiac poll of yesterday. Why? Because, as this tax bill plays out, what Democrats said all along; that the vast majority of the benefits are going to the wealthy, it increases the deficit, and it increases the clarion call of many on the Republican side to cut Medicare and Social Security to pay for the deficit they created--it is not going over too well. We will match our argument against theirs now in October and We are confident we are going to win that argument, and that is why already the enthusiasm about this tax bill is fading.  The massive deluge of corporate share buybacks is proving to be the principal legacy of the Republican tax bill--not benefits to workers, not bonuses, not wage increases, not even new equipment or investment in R&I would welcome that. Nope, corporations are spending the bulk of the savings from the tax bill on themselves, their corporate executives, and their wealthy shareholders.  Guess how much of the capital companies have earned from the tax bill has been allocated to their employees, the workers who were going to get such huge benefits from this bill--6 percent. No, no, it is not 60; it is 6. Sixty is the percentage that has gone back to corporations in the form of stock buybacks--a 10-to-1 ratio. It doesn't make much sense. The American public is beginning to realize that. Those are the numbers according to Just  As I said, the American people are starting to catch wind of the truth. Three separate polls yesterday--I mentioned Quinnipiac, and there are evidently two others. Three separate polls show the popularity of the Republican tax bill was significantly underwater and has lost ground since the last round of polling. I predict those numbers will continue to slip as more Americans learn that their hard-earned taxpayer dollars were used to give a tax break to corporations who hoard the savings for themselves. It is no wonder their candidate in a hard-fought race in Southwest Pennsylvania has abandoned the tax argument. It is not going over well with his working-class constituents because they get a tiny, little bit, and everyone else gets so much more.  Mr.President, Democrats have a plan to rein in these buybacks and put the middle class first. Yesterday, Senator Baldwin and I announced an amendment to the pending banking bill that would rein in corporate buybacks by giving the SEC the authority to reject buybacks that come at the expense of workers. Who will object to that? I hope not my colleagues. They say the buybacks will benefit workers, so they shouldn't be objecting to our bill. Senator Baldwin's bill and my bill would require company boards and their executives to put their money where their mouth is and certify that the buyback is in the best long-term financial interest of the company.  We are going to make this one of the top amendments to the banking bill, and I hope it gains Republican support. If Republicans mean what they say about their tax bill helping workers, they should join Senator Baldwin's amendment. The glut of corporate share buybacks highlights precisely how the corporate tax cut in the Republican bill is being put to ill use. Rather than stimulating the economy, creating jobs, or raising pay, corporations are spending the lion's share of the tax savings on goosing their stock.  Let's not forget, these buybacks are relatively new. A ruling by the SEC in the early eighties said they could start doing these. Before that, the heyday, when corporate America dominated the world, profits were great, jobs were growing, and wages went up, the safe harbor provision wasn't there. Corporations had to go through a lot of proof before they could buy back their stock, and that made sense, but once our Republican colleagues got in power, they did what the corporate leaders want them to do and look what happened.  The amendment to say no buybacks unless they can prove it is really going to benefit their workers and be in the long-term financial interest of their company, that amendment is going to be one of the top amendments to the upcoming bill. I hope it gains Republican support. I really do. If Republicans mean what they say, they should[[Page S1532]]join Baldwin's amendment, as I said before, but I want to repeat it for the benefit of all my good Republican friends.  Now, the glut of corporate share buybacks highlights precisely how the corporate tax cut in the Republican bill is being put to ill use. Rather than stimulating the economy, creating jobs, raising pay, corporations spend the lion's share of the tax savings on goosing their stock. Americans are just scratching their heads, wondering why we put ourselves in deeper debt so corporations could further enrich themselves. Why do we tell our children and grandchildren they are going to pay for the pay raise of the CEO of Exxon or the increase in value because his stock is going up? That doesn't make any sense at all. There are much better uses for the money.  Yesterday, Democrats announced our plan to help build a trillion dollars of desperately needed infrastructure in How do we pay for it? We unwind some of these tax cuts for the biggest corporations to pay for a massive infusion of Federal funds in infrastructure--job-creating infrastructure, which is desperately needed. Just by putting the top rate on individuals where it was, reinstituting the AMT and the estate tax, which goes only to the very wealthy, and setting the corporate rate at 25 percent--you may recall it was the Business Roundtable that asked for 25 percent. Oh, no, for our Republican colleagues and Donald Trump, that wasn't good enough. Make it lower--even though the 200 biggest businesses in America said 25 percent was certainly an adequate drop. Many on my side wouldn't even think that is good.  In any case, the BMT asked for 25 percent. We go to 25 percent, along with these other changes, and guess what we do with $1 trillion. We create infrastructure jobs--millions. We create new roads and bridges, new water and sewer. We say that every rural home in America should get broadband just as Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930s said every rural home should get electricity. We update our power grid so all this new energy coming from other places can go to the most populated centers. It would be a huge shot in the arm for jobs in America, for prosperity in America, far more than this slanted tax bill aimed so much at the few wealthy who are so tight with this new Republican  I daresay our proposal is a much more effective use of taxpayer dollars than a handout to the biggest corporations and will create far more good-paying jobs in the process.  I hope our Republican colleagues will rethink things. Their path is a path to a cul-de-sac, to great losses in the election. Rethink that tax cut. Don't allow these buybacks. They are doing no good for anyone but a handful, and that is where 60 percent of the money is going on the corporate rate.  Join us in taking some of that money to do what the Federal Government has done since Henry Clay proposed it in the 1820s: Put that money into infrastructure, jobs, good-paying jobs, efficiency. Let's not let China or another country become the leader in infrastructure. They invest. The Chinese Government, the Japanese Government, the European Government invest in infrastructure, and so did this government, until Donald Trump became President and the hard right gained a stranglehold over the Republican Let's reverse course before it is too late.

1312,topic-id,1692,"Mr.President, President Trump's instincts on China are correct, but his execution is poor. He should stick with those instincts and not those who label anything we do to protect America against China's rapacious policies as protectionist. At the same time, he should fix his plan so it really does what he intends it to do or wants it to do.  I have been one of the chief critics of the status quo on trade. Americans--and I share this view--resent all those academics who any time we try to do anything with China say: protectionist, trade war.  The bottom line is simple. China is eating our lunch. China is rapacious. China, day by day, gnaws away at our economy by manipulating currency. They sometimes do it, they sometimes don't, but they will again when they can.  By having no reciprocity, they don't let good American industries in, but they want to come here--and do, easily--buying our family jewels, our intellectual property, our leading companies in robotics, artificial intelligence, chips, and pharmaceuticals.  China has a plan to take advantage of America, to surpass us economically by not being fair. They keep their huge market protected, steal our stuff, learn how to do it, then try to come sell it here and gain an advantage when they can by manipulating currency.  The President should not be deterred by all of those business interests that are only interested in their profits, not in what is good for That is their job, their shareholders--I get it--but he should not be deterred by them. At the same time, he has to back off this plan which doesn't do what it is supposed to do. Major harm is done to allies like Canada and Europe, not to  That is the tightrope we need to walk on. If the President walks on that tightrope carefully and well, we will support him.  The President's instincts to go after China are correct, but the policy he proposes doesn't fit the bill. It is not well targeted, it is not precise and, as a result, it could cause a mess of collateral damage that hurts America more than it helps.  The sweeping nature of the tariffs has already justifiably angered key allies in Canada and Europe and could draw reciprocal tariffs on American goods, raising costs on average consumers from coast-to-coast. A country such as Canada, with which we have a trade surplus, could retaliate.  Mr.President, focus on Go after China and do it in a smart, focused but sharp-edged way. Don't create a policy that hurts our allies more than it hurts China and causes China to sort of giggle at our ineffectiveness.  A trade war is not what we want. Making China play by the rules is what all Americans want, except for a handful of businesses that just see their interests and raising their profits no matter where the jobs go or where they sell goods.  China dumps counterfeit and artificially cheap goods into our market, denies productive U.companies fair access to their markets, and steals the intellectual property of American companies. I am pained, actually pained, because I love this country, and I want to see us stay economically 1. I am pained when I go over in my mind the statement of retired four-star GEN Keith Alexander, who is in charge of cyber security in He called China's theft of our intellectual property the ``greatest transfer of wealth in history.'' American wealth is actually being stolen by China, and we sit here and shrug our shoulders or do things that are not effective.  The Trump administration should rethink its approach to sweeping tariffs while there is still time and focus attention on China is our 1 trade problem--not Canada, not President Trump could do a much better job of tailoring his trade policy to address the real problems instead of creating new ones.                             Infrastructure  Mr.President, on infrastructure, a year ago last January, guided by what President Trump had said, wanting to[[Page S1407]]work with Democrats on infrastructure, Senate Democrats unveiled our $1 trillion infrastructure plan. It was an outline.  We sent it to the We said it was one of the areas where we could work with the President to get something done. Then we waited and we waited and we waited. A full year after we made our proposal, the Trump administration finally released one of its own. Frankly, President Trump's plan on infrastructure, to put it kindly, was underwhelming. It is going over like a lead balloon, and it is very simple why. After a year of bold promises about trillion-dollar infrastructure, a plan to build ``gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, and waterways all across our land,'' President Trump's infrastructure plan proposes no new net increase in infrastructure funding. He put in $200 billion and then took it away by cutting the existing programs on infrastructure. It will not get the job done. Robbing Peter to pay Paul a pittance will not do nearly enough to rebuild our infrastructure.  Because so much of the funding is not from the Federal Government, which has traditionally funded the lion's share of infrastructure--highways, water and sewer--the money is going to have to come from two places, neither of which is a good option: localities, which are starved for cash already--they are not going to build much--or the private sector, which will, of course, quite naturally want a payback. That is how the private sector works. They are not going to put money up unless they are paid back. They are not going to lend money without being paid back. We know what that will mean--tolls, tolls, and more tolls. Trump tolls from one end of the Nation to the other. That is not what America wants. Trump's plan is already a huge flop. Hardly anyone is paying attention to it.  We Democrats have a better deal to offer the American people. Rather than cutting existing infrastructure projects to pay for a paltry program that will not work, we want to roll back the Republican tax giveaways to big corporations and the very wealthy and invest that money instead in job-creating infrastructure. The overwhelming majority of Americans would say, they would rather see millions of jobs created than give tax breaks to the wealthiest. Our plan could create up to 15 million good-paying jobs for the middle class.  We have already seen, by the way, that those tax breaks are not creating many jobs. Instead, they are going to stock buybacks, which is a way for corporate executives to take that money, raise their own salaries and raise the salaries of shareholders, the vast majority of whom are in the top 10 percent of  We are proposing something new and different. We propose to put the top rate back to 39.6 percent. The wealthy are doing great in America; they didn't need a tax cut. It is the middle class that needed more of one.  We propose restoring the That AMT prevented the wealthiest of Americans from evading taxes. It is a tax expert's way of restoring the Buffet rule, which says that a rich corporate executive shouldn't pay a lower rate of taxes than his or her secretary.  We restore the estate tax. After all, that benefits 5,000 wealthy families. We also close the carried interest loophole.  We raise the corporate tax rate to 25 percent, which is what the Business Roundtable called for. But our Republican friends and President Trump were in a mania to just cut, cut, cut corporate taxes--even at a time that corporations are doing well--and moved it to 21 percent. We go back up to the 25 percent that the Business Roundtable suggested.  With all that money, what do we invest it in? A modern infrastructure plan that would build everything from roads and bridges to schools and airports, to high-speed internet and more, with a focus, by the way, on rural internet because one-third of rural America doesn't have it.  In addition to the traditional types of projects we have long built in this country, we are building 21st century infrastructure--as I mentioned, rural internet, high speed. In the thirties, Franklin Roosevelt said that every home in America should have electricity. It was aimed at rural homes that didn't have it. Today, we Democrats believe that every home should have high-speed internet, and that, too, is aimed at rural America--where close to one-third of the homes don't have high-speed internet--and at our inner cities as well.  Only with real, direct investment of Federal dollars will we build the kinds of transformational projects that need to be built. Only with real investment will rural America see the projects it needs built. Only with real investment will we create millions of good-paying jobs.  You say: Where is the money going to come from? We don't want to increase our deficit. The tax bill has done that enough.  We say: Take some of those tax breaks from the wealthiest of Americans and put them into middle-class jobs, plain and simple.  Americans are realizing now where that money is going. The tax bill, before it came out, was unpopular. It had an initial splurge of popularity, and now, as Americans learn what it is actually doing, it is becoming less popular again. It will go back to where it was, I believe. More Americans will dislike it than like it, but when they hear we can take some of that money and put it into infrastructure and create millions of middle-class jobs, I think Americans of all stripes will embrace that policy.  We Democrats want to work with the President and our Republican colleagues on infrastructure, but we want to do it in a way that produces real results, not the chimerical proposal the President made that will produce very little infrastructure, almost no jobs, and put Trump tolls all across We hope the President will move away from his plan and come much further in our direction so that we can get something done for the American people, particularly the American working and middle classes.

1401,topic-id,734,"Mr.President, first, let me thank my good friend from His State may be more affected by climate change than just about any other. We hear about water lapping up on the shores of Southern Florida already and the constant flooding. We have seen these amazing pictures that equal 1,000 words about the coral reefs--and he even talked about a word we rarely use in Brooklyn, ``critters.'' We want to save the critters too.  So he has been eloquent--not just today but constantly--on the issue of climate and does it in such a practical perspective that just about every American of every ideology, part of the country, and thought process can understand. So I thank him.  Of course, I thank our great leader on this issue, the Senator from Rhode Island, Sheldon He is passionate, and his passion carries over into effective action. There has been no voice more clarion, more constant, more effective in remembering that we cannot ignore this issue, constantly reminding us how important it is. I thank Senator Whitehouse not only for pulling us all together tonight but for his great strength and constancy on this issue.[[Page S1669]]  I join my colleagues to shed light on the subject of climate change, which has received scant attention, unfortunately, from President Trump and this Republican Despite decades of incontrovertible evidence that climate change is harming our planet, President Trump and the Republicans have done nothing about it. In fact, worse than doing nothing, they have actively weakened our environmental laws, decrying the very science that has helped us progress, has helped men and women progress through the centuries.  Republicans in Congress have undone the environmental protections that held corporations accountable for polluting our streams. They have undone the rule that increased transparency in the management of public lands. Through an unrelated tax bill, congressional Republicans opened up the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling.  In the executive branch, EPA Administrator Pruitt has implemented an extreme deregulatory agenda, unwinding the rules that keep our air clear, our water clean, and limit carbon emissions that poison our atmosphere and our planet.  Worst of all, President Trump announced that he will pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord, which would make America the only country in the world that isn't a part of the agreement. While the world comes together to negotiate sensible climate change policies, while other nations and other foreign businesses grab the mantle of leadership on green energy, the United States, which used to be such a leader on so many issues, can only sit and watch from the sidelines--all because President Trump decided to pull out of the Paris accord. What a remarkable mistake. It will go down in history as one of the worst days in American history, as the world gets hotter and climate change takes its toll on our country and the world.  Climate change is real, human activity is driving it, and it is happening right now. These are facts. This is not speculation. This is not someone spinning a tale. These are facts not in dispute. Scientists know it. Businesses know it. The world knows it. The American people know it too.  We in New York learned about the devastating impact of Hurricane It took so long to rebuild our coastal communities. All of Long Island understood that climate change is real and devastating when you do nothing about it.  The storms are getting more powerful--storms like Sandy--more frequent, and there is no doubt that climate change is playing a role. We watched three recordbreaking hurricanes buffet our cities and our coastlines, devastating parts of Louisiana, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.Virgin Stronger wildfires have ripped through our Western According to NOAA, 2017 was the most expensive year on record for disasters in the United States, costing hundreds of billions of dollars.

This is a dereliction of duty.  Over the last few weeks, the Senate has heard testimony from the DNI--the Director of National Intelligence--and the head of the U.Cyber Neither had been directed by the administration to counter Russia's continued efforts to undermine our democracy.

Still, the Trump administration has not fully implemented the sanctions Congress passed to punish  Meanwhile, Russia-linked bots continue to sow division and inflame political tensions on social media.

We have done nothing to harden our election security in anticipation of the midterms.

Yet we hear nothing, nothing, nothing out of the White  You only have to look to our ally, the United Kingdom, for an example of how a nation should respond to the threat from Just today, Prime Minister Theresa May went to the House of Commons to expose a likely Russian attack against two people in her country using a nerve agent. She demanded a response from President Putin and promised appropriate countermeasures if he refuses or the answer is insufficient.  Prime Minister May's quick and decisive action is exactly what is missing from President Trump when it comes to cyber security in our elections.  President Trump still has an opportunity. Over the weekend, President Putin rather ridiculously blamed Ukrainians, Jews, or other minorities for the attack on our election in 2016--another attempt, of course, at misdirection and distraction. In reality, Special Counsel Mueller's investigation has charged 13 Russian nationals with subverting the 2016 elections--not Ukrainians, not Tatars, not Jews but 13 Russian nationals.  Today Leader Pelosi and I, alongside Senator Feinstein and Congressman Nadler, sent President Trump a letter urging him to use all available resources to extradite the 13 Russian nationals named in the special counsel's investigation to stand trial here in the United Ensuring these Russian nationals stand trial in the United States would be a clear signal to those who seek to meddle with our elections that their actions are not without consequences. This is imperative to deter Russia and any other nation in the future from attacking our democracy. This is another test of President Trump's leadership and another test he is failing miserably.  If President Trump really cared about our country, he would expand every resource in his possession to bring justice to these foreign actors who meddled with our country's most sacred democratic process--the one enshrined by the Founding Fathers, embraced and even worshiped by Americans over the centuries with good reason.  Now there is meddling in this sacred process and President Trump does nothing? Why are we not hearing anything from those on the other side of the aisle about that? You can be sure that if it were another President--particularly a Democratic one--we would hear howls, but this is not about Democrats or This is about our democracy, and Americans inevitably ask the question, Why is President Trump so afraid to do anything about Putin?

1572,topic-id,501,"Mr.President, when the Republican majority forced through a $1.5 trillion tax cut to big corporations and the richest Americans, a big question was, What will those companies do with the money? Roughly, $1 trillion of that $1.5 trillion was aimed at the biggest corporations.  Republicans promised that corporations would reinvest the savings from the tax bill, stimulating jobs and economic growth. We Democrats warned that corporations would do what is best for themselves, not necessarily what is best for workers or the economy. There is often a dichotomy, as we have learned over the years.  It has been only a few months since the Republican tax cut was signed into law, and while a few corporations here and there announced annual bonuses with a whole lot of hoopla from the President and the Republicans, we don't hear a peep now that they have been announcing an avalanche of corporate stock buybacks--an absolute bonanza for corporate leaders and for wealthy shareholders. Over $200 billion in corporate buybacks have been announced since January, putting corporations on pace to spend over $1 trillion this year buying back their own stock.  This morning, the oil and gas giant Chevron announced it expects to restart its share repurchasing program since halting it in 2015. Why? Because they just reaped $2 billion in savings from the Republican tax bill. Chevron told the Houston Chronicle last week it is planning no major changes or benefits given to its workers. Let me repeat that. Chevron is planning no major benefits to its workers but huge stock buybacks. Is that what America wants? No, but that is what is happening, as we predicted, with this tax bill.  The Chevron example is not alone, unfortunately, my fellow An analysis by Just Capital found that 6 percent of the savings companies received from the tax bill are going to employees, while 58 percent are going to shareholders in the form of dividends, share buybacks, and retained earnings. The problem is, buybacks don't really help workers or average They don't really grow the economy. In fact, the money corporations spend on buybacks crowds out investment in the things that do help workers and help our economy--research, development, new equipment, new hires, better pay for employees. But those benefits are in the long term. The corporate CEOs, the boards, the leaders of the corporations--the big ones--get an immediate benefit when they buy back stock. The stock goes up, the shareholders are happy, but workers and America get no benefit.  What buybacks accomplish is the funneling of even more money to corporate executives and wealthy shareholders. Buybacks don't help the American workers. They don't grow the economy. By taking stock off the market, corporations inflate the value of their stockholdings.  Who holds all this stock? Not average The richest 10 percent of America owns 80 percent of the stock. That is including pension funds and everything else. When corporations goose their stock, those benefits go to a tiny piece of the pie--the upper crust.  (",CREC-2018-03-06-pt1-PgS1343-7.txt,1036,TAX REFORM,2018.0,6.0,March
1703,topic-id,954,"Now, Madam President, after the deadly shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School, the American people are wondering if Congress can do something meaningful to curb the epidemic of gun violence--an epidemic that has gone on far too long and taken the lives of far too many.  For years, Democrats have proposed commonsense gun safety policies to ensure that dangerous people can't get their hands on dangerous weapons. Recently, Democrats have reiterated our support for several specific measures, including universal background checks, protection orders, and a debate on banning assault weapons.  Americans of all political stripes support a debate on these policies, and yet the majority leader, who has given gun safety no time on the floor of the Senate, has also given us no indication we might consider the issue anytime soon. He is sweeping it under the rug. The NRA is powerful around here.  At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, President Trump failed to show the conviction and steady leadership required to make progress on this issue. After indicating support for a host of reasonable gun safety measures a few weeks ago and in front of the TV cameras he invited in, yesterday President Trump released a list of administration policies which represent a 180-degree reversal. What President Trump said at the public meeting and what he proposed yesterday are opposites.  After signaling, for instance, he would be for raising the age of purchase of assault weapons from 18 to 21--a modest measure--President Trump backed off saying he would leave it to the States and the courts to decide. That is a copout, and we know that. After indicating support for universal background checks, President Trump makes no mention of closing the dangerous gun show loophole or internet sales loophole. There is no mention of anti-domestic violence legislation, no mention of assault weapons or support for significant changes to protection orders. The President's plan consists only of small-bore, NRA-approved policies, including the absurd proposal to send more guns into classrooms by arming teachers.  In the wake of so many American tragedies, the Trump proposal on gun safety is utterly insufficient as a response. Even if you discarded the idea of arming teachers and took the Fix NICS proposal and the changes to mental health in President Trump's proposal, that wouldn't be close to enough to address the issue of gun violence. The Nation is clamoring for significant, meaningful progress on gun safety, but President Trump's proposal is just a baby step, when America needs to take a giant leap.  The administration's proposal makes it perfectly clear that President Trump has an obeisance to the Even when President Trump momentarily departs the NRA script, he quickly gets reeled back in. If President Trump, his staff, and some of our Republican friends are wondering why his ratings are so low, it is because he does this all the time. At the meeting, he publicly challenged conservative Republican Senator He said: Oh, I guess you are afraid of the  Well, Toomey is not afraid of the He has taken them on. It is President Trump who is afraid of the He is afraid to do anything that doesn't meet their approval. We all know what this Fix NICS bill is about. It is tiny, but it is OK with the NRA, so my good friend from Texas is happy to come to the floor and talk about it. When is he going to come to the floor and say something we really need that the NRA doesn't support? We are all waiting, not just for him but for our Republican colleagues. We all know the game going on here--make it seem like you want to do something but don't offend the NRA, which is way to the extreme when you look at where Americans are at on this issue.  After watching the same sequence of events take place on guns, on immigration, no one should be surprised when President Trump initially talks about bipartisanship but ends up caving to hard-right special interests. No one should be surprised that the Republican leadership in the Senate, when it comes to guns, does the same exact thing. In this case, the gun lobby is the hard-right special interest.  President Trump's behavior on the most sensitive political issues is turning into a predictable Kabuki theater, where he invites the cameras in, talks the good talk but then refuses to walk the walk. It shows great weakness in this President, and if he doesn't have the guts to move forward, he shouldn't invite the cameras in and act like he[[Page S1619]]does. Now, that may give him a temporary little high, but it is not what the American people want. It is not leadership and, in my judgment at least, that is why the President is down so much in the polls no matter what he does. That is why even a race in the southwestern corner of Pennsylvania, in a district he won by 20 points, is a nail-biter.  I hope the President will change, I hope he will become a leader, and I hope he will stop just focusing on the show but actually get things done. So far, the American people, not just us, are disappointed.  Now, Democrats in the Senate are going to keep fighting to go much further than the President's proposal. We are going to fight to pass universal background checks, to actually get Federal legislation on protection orders, and to start debating banning assault weapons. This is the conversation the country needs to have. We will keep pushing our Senate colleagues and President Trump to do something real, not just something they think they can talk about that the NRA rubberstamps approval of.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-12-pt1-PgS1618-3.txt,1036,TAX REFORM,2018.0,12.0,March

I thank my colleague from                               Gun Safety  Mr.President, as the Senate debates the banking bill, Americans are wondering if the Republican majority will ever move to take up the issue of gun safety. Tomorrow, thousands of students across the country--awakened students--will participate in a nationwide walkout to demand action. At 10 a.m. in high schools from one end of America to the other, students will walk out for 17 minutes in honor of the 17 who gave their lives at Stoneman Douglas High School, in solidarity. But they are not going to stop there; they are going to keep working and working and working until we get something done.[[Page S1648]]  When the students walk out, what will this Senate, what will this Congress, what will our Republican friends be able to say? Nothing, because we will have done nothing in that time to address gun safety in a meaningful way.  The unfortunate reality is that it seems there is too little courage in the White House to take on the After sounding the right notes when the cameras were on, President Trump has backed away from everything but the policies to which the NRA gives its rubberstamp approval.  I am still amazed at this. I believe it was on the issue of age that the President criticized Senator Toomey at his televised meeting and told him not to be afraid of the He said he wasn't.  And what does the President do? He doesn't show one one-hundredth of the courage that Senator Toomey showed on guns.  Senator Toomey and I don't agree on much, and I would have gone further than he did in the checks bill that he and Senator Manchin put together, but he had the courage to buck the  President Trump, you have no courage to buck the You talk a good game, and then, when it comes to action, you are afraid to do anything--anything--that gets the NRA upset.  The NRA is so far away from where America is. Over 90 percent of America wants background checks. The NRA and Trump don't. A huge percentage--over 80 percent of gun owners--want background checks--comprehensive and universal background checks. President Trump and the NRA don't. The majority of Americans want protective orders so that if a family member or a friend or a teacher sees a young person acting like they are angry or upset and might do damage, their gun could be temporarily taken away. Most Americans want that. President Trump and the NRA don't, and neither do our Republican friends. The vast majority of Americans would like a debate on assault weapons--or certainly the majority. President Trump, the NRA, and our Republican majority don't.  Mr.President, why don't you retract what you said to Senator Why don't you admit that he had more courage than you? Why don't you say that you are afraid of the NRA, because that is really what is going on here. No one is going to be taken in by nice words spoken in an hour in front of a TV camera when you then back off on anything. Of course, the plan was released Sunday night. They thought, hopefully, that it would get no news coverage, but it is still in the news.  Unfortunately, too many Republicans here on the Hill are in the same boat as President Trump, but not Senator They want to appear as though they are doing something for gun safety but are only willing to support the smallest bore policies that the NRA gives a green light to. They say: OK, let's do these small things first; maybe we will do more later.  We all know the game here. Everyone sees what is going on. My friends on the other side don't dare support anything that the NRA opposes, even though the vast majority of Americans want them to. Our friends hope that we will pass something tiny, something small so that they can clap their hands and say they did something on gun violence and move on. The day they want to do something meaningful and real on gun safety never seems to come.  My friend the Senator from Texas--he is a good friend of mine. We banter in the gym almost every morning. I have worked with him on a number of issues. But he comes to the floor every day and says: Let's do the small Fix NICS bill, and then we will see about other proposals. He knows as well as I do that Fix NICS is not even close to enough of a response to the epidemic of gun violence in the country. He knows as well as I do that the NRA is OK with Fix NICS but not universal background checks.  Fix NICS only improves reporting within the existing background check system. The big loopholes that allow so many bad people, felons, and those adjudicated mentally ill to get guns--the gun show loophole, the online loophole--are not touched by Fix  I say to my good friend the senior Senator from Texas, when you are a doctor and you are sewing up a wound, you don't just do the first stitch and then walk away and say: We did something. No, you have to do the real job to cure the injury. I appreciate that my friend from Texas wants to pass this bill. Democrats support it. I am a cosponsor. But as a response to the spree of shootings in our schools, on our streets, in our churches, movie theaters, nightclubs, concerts, and on street corners every evening, a bill to repair just one tiny little aspect of the background check system is not sufficient.  A policy or an attitude that says that we cannot offend the NRA on anything will never, never, never help ameliorate our problem of gun violence to a sufficient extent.  As my colleague Senator Murphy, Senator Cornyn's coauthor of Fix NICS, has said: ``If we were to only debate the Fix NICS Act, we would be slamming the door in the face of all of these kids who are demanding change.''  He said it perfectly.  Democrats are fighting to make sure that Fix NICS isn't our only response. I hope and pray that my Republican colleagues will find the courage to go beyond what the gun lobbyists tell them is OK and work with Democrats on real and significant gun safety legislation.                                 Trade  Mr.President, now on another matter, this is a happy moment because many Democrats--certainly I--agree with the Trump administration when they blocked the proposed bid by the Singapore-based Broadcom to purchase the San Diego-based Qualcomm, on national security grounds.  Let me say this unequivocally: President Trump and his administration made the right decision on blocking Broadcom from taking over  We all know that China has been rapacious about trade and very smart. They look for places where they can steal our best technology. They develop it there in China and keep us out of their markets and then try to flood the world with their products, sometimes dumping them. China has been rapacious about trade. Frankly, in my opinion, neither the Bush administration nor the Obama administration did enough. President Trump has a much better attitude.  One particular area of concern is how frequently foreign companies have sought controlling stakes in cutting-edge technology companies like Qualcomm has done a great job, and they are leading the world in developing the 5G system. We need to preserve that as Americans because it has both economic and national security concerns.  As China seeks dominance in the semiconductor and wireless industries, the United States must be wary of attempts to acquire U.leaders in these industries. As to a foreign-controlled Broadcom, I don't know what the links are between Broadcom and I suspect there may be some, but China could move to take it over and, poof, the dominance that we would seek in 5G technology developed here would go away. It is a national security concern and an economic security concern.  We Democrats believe that the CFIUS model should extend not just to national security but to economic security. When China attempts to steal our best technology by buying American companies--whether it is robotics, AI, or chips on Qualcomm--we ought to block it.  China doesn't play fair. Lifetime President Xi hopes to dominate in the crown jewel of America's industries--the tech industries and others, where we dominate because we have been so good because we have taken immigrants, Mr.President, from around the world, and they helped develop these great things. We have to be wary of China--wary of To his credit, President Trump is more wary of China than the last five or six administrations, and I am glad he is. I am glad his administration is. It is just almost too late, but it is not yet.  It is no secret that President Trump and I share similar feelings on the issue of trade, particularly when it concerns I have often been critical of this administration--like I have been of previous administrations--when it fails to follow through on the President's rhetoric or misdirects its policies.  The recent steel and aluminum tariffs are an example of how the administration has the right instincts but bad[[Page S1649]]execution. If properly calibrated, tariffs could be an effective tool to rein in China certainly dumps and has sought dominance in the steel and aluminum industries. Instead of targeting heavily subsidized Chinese steel and aluminum, the President has put in place across-the-board tariffs that would hurt many of our domestic industries. There was an article today about a Missouri ball bearing company that doesn't know where it is going to get its steel from. It hurts allies like  Canada makes its own steel and aluminum. We have a trade surplus with Putting Canada in the same boat as China is a huge mistake. That is why these tariffs--and I support the thrust of them--should have been more carefully targeted.  In contrast, the action on Qualcomm is targeted and effective in terms of protecting U.industry, and I urge the Trump administration to do more of these things. They will fill a hole that previous administrations failed to fill.                          Russia Investigation  Mr.President, finally, on Russia, we all know that the Republican majority on the House Intelligence Committee has ended its investigation into foreign interference in the 2016 elections. The House Republican majority on the Intelligence Committee has so discredited itself.  The report makes several assertions that are contradicted by already well-known facts. It says that Russia had no preference for Donald Trump in the 2016 elections. Remember, it is not just the intelligence community's assessment that the Russians were trying to elect Trump, but an independent grand jury--nonpolitical--in the special counsel's investigation concluded the same thing on the basis of evidence independently acquired and presented by the special counsel. By saying they disagree with the intelligence community's assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump, Speaker Ryan and Chairman Nunes are closer to Putin's view than the view of the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, and the DNI--people in the administration.  It seems that there are no lengths to which Chairman Nunes and Speaker Ryan will not go to protect this White House, even when it damages America's security.  After Chairman Nunes's midnight run to the White House, his partisan memo, fake memo, and fake scandals about unmasking FBI text messages, no one should take this report seriously. I would say, to the vast majority of Americans, Chairman Nunes has discredited himself. He is much more of a partisan operative than a representative helping America be secure.  The House Republican majority has never taken this investigation seriously. From the very beginning, they have sought to distract and kick up dust. They have shown time and again that they are willing to put party before country--something our Founding Founders warned against. They are willing to twist facts and ignore evidence about a foreign power attacking our democracy because it might cause political damage to the It is a shocking and shameful abdication of duty.  In my judgment, Chairman Nunes, you and your committee have made a shocking and shameful abdication of duty to A congressional party that is wholly subservient to the political interests of the President is failing fundamentally to fulfill its constitutional obligation. Congress is supposed to be a separate, equal branch of government. Read the Read the Federalist One of the main purposes of Congress was to check the power of the executive branch. Our Founding Fathers feared an overreaching executive branch, as I know my friend from Nebraska knows, because he cites these things. That responsibility doesn't fall only on one party. It falls on all of us.  That is why there has been a history of bipartisanship and cooperation on the Intelligence Committees, where the vital interests of the Nation are at stake. That has been the case through the years. Until Chairman Nunes seemed to get ahold of this, that tradition was a grand one and a good one. Now that tradition has been discarded by House Republicans on the Intelligence Committee through this embarrassing episode that will historically go down as one of the lowest moments of any committee's actions in  Let me say pointedly to my colleagues that the Senate Intelligence Committee has been quite different than the House Intelligence I salute both Chairman Burr and Ranking Member Warner for trying to run things in a different way. Let us hope that the Senate Intelligence Committee does not go the way of the House and continues its bipartisan cooperation to get to the bottom of this mess. That is because we have a responsibility to get to the bottom of what happened in 2016 and to report those findings in an unbiased way. If the House isn't going to do it, the Senate must.

That, I think, I learned a long time ago, is hard to get through to be signed by the But with that said, it yielded amazing results in a process that needed to come to a conclusion.  This 12-bill appropriations package provides funding for fiscal year 2018 at levels consistent with the bipartisan budget agreement and the National Defense Authorization  After years of neglect, this body has taken the important step of reshaping and rebuilding the United States military by providing them $659.6 billion worth of funding for our national defense. But it is for more than just national defense. It is also trying to give better protection to the men and women who protect us, the men and women who, today, are in cold, lonely, hot, dangerous places around the globe.  Mr.Speaker, a much-needed $65 billion increase over 2017 fiscal year spending was essential. Mr.Speaker, the numbers speak for themselves. More members of our armed services gave their life in defense of this country in training exercises than they did in combat last year. This is a hardy reminder for Members of Congress and the American people to understand that our men and women not only fight hard, but they train hard. And in that defense, we need to do a better job to make sure that the equipment, the training, and the needs that they have are top flight year-round not just in combat areas, but in training missions where they are preparing to protect this country. Mr.Speaker, we have come a long way to that, and I am proud of the work that we have done.  The agreement ends, I think, the irresponsible practice of pairing dollar-for-dollar increases in defense spending with nondefense. This is a hard fight. This is a hard fight not only Republican-Democrat, but across this country. We have tried to make some balanced decisions. We have tried to err on the side of using money for the best interest of research and development and to move this country forward.  The bill strengthens missile defense. It strengthens and funds new weapons systems for the military. And it heavily increases designated counterthreats around the globe. As you know, Mr.Speaker, we are facing down one of the greatest threats to the world right now, North Now is not a time to[[Page H1760]]shy away. Mr.Speaker, we will not shy away. These colors don't run.  It funds additional national security priorities, including nuclear modernization, new nuclear submarines, and other important shipbuilding and aircraft procurement for our United States military.

776,topic-id,1647,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, to the gentleman from Massachusetts, I not only accept his advice about process and procedure, but I certainly would join in with him to thank our appropriators, the men and women who, on a bipartisan basis, Mr.Speaker, took time to wander to the other side of the Capitol to engage their colleagues.  I can tell the gentleman, and he knows this probably on a firsthand basis, much was discussed. This was a big process. This was at the end of the year that I do agree with that should have taken place on October 1, not on March 22, that we decided where we are headed.  But the discussion, the decisionmaking, the ability for both sides, both parties, to deal on the same issues has gotten tougher and tougher.  I support our Speaker and what he is attempting to do. He has opened up the process. He has tried to make it to where the discussions take place on a bipartisan basis. And the Speaker, I believe, has tried to place before us, as Members of Congress, the opportunity to be heard, to represent our thoughts and ideas.  I didn't win some of the issues that I was for. I held some ideas out about a number of issues that we had been working on that were contained in the bills that came out of the House only to come back months later from the Senate in a different priority, in a different way, and perhaps not exactly what I would have wanted.  It would be easy for me to say, however, that the greater good of what we are attempting to accomplish is why we are here. Ultimately, we have a duty, Mr.Speaker, we have a duty and a responsibility, to ensure that which we finalize is in the best interest of the American people. The overriding concern here is to make sure that the efforts of government, albeit that we as Americans, I don't think, want to get all that we pay for from government, we still recognize that there are people in our midst that need a government--and I do, too--a government that works well and is funded properly.  Mr.Speaker, last night we had an opportunity to hear from a number of my colleagues on the Republican side, a number of Members of Congress who spent hours waiting their time before the Rules Committee, not an unusual intuitive process from a number of our Members who had questions, comments, and concerns.  I promised to address one of them. The gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.Massie) brought forth what was a discussion about what is known as the NICS fix, or, as we refer to it, fixing NICS, a NICS fix.  Well, this is the database that is responsible for holding names and giving approvals for those people who purchase weapons across the United I agreed to provide some bit of an answer today and I hope some clarity on the issue that relates back to December of 2017.  I told the gentleman last night that I believed that, while his arguments were important and I supported exactly the underlying ideas, and that is that we do not believe that agencies by themselves should have the ability to deny an American citizen the right, the constitutional right, for them to properly, legally own a weapon, as we do know and remember back during a previous administration, at least two agencies, the Social Security Administration and the Veterans Administration, developed procedures by which they believed were appropriate, but that I think have proven incorrect, to deny people a weapon based upon a criteria that they established.  This fix NICS provision was corrected and is still in law, and, to the best of my ability in double-checking, I would now like to notify the gentleman from Kentucky that I believe it is properly done.  I would not be a part of making a change in the law, as I told him, that would deny an American citizen under these two agencies without lawful consideration of a hearing and with due process, and based upon the law and constitutional requirements of our Constitution to deny someone their right to keep and bear arms.  Mr.Speaker, please consider that I appreciate the gentleman who showed up last night until late, late in the morning, and that he was doing his duty, which I respect and admire, and I am trying to respond back to him.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, the gentleman from Texas, the distinguished chairman of the Rules Committee, said that he appreciated the Speaker's listening to the different opinions of all Members here in the  I think the frustration here is not that we can't raise our voices, the frustration here is that we cannot bring things that we care about to the House floor for debate.  The gentleman just talked about the issue of guns. We are living in a country where we have massacres on a regular basis. The American people overwhelmingly want us to bring gun safety legislation to the floor. Things like universal background checks, for example. The leadership of this House will not let us bring those bills to the floor for debate or for a vote. They have shut us out.  So this process that has been endorsed by the Republican leadership is not open. It is very, very closed. In fact, we are on record to becoming the most closed Congress in the history of the United States of That is not something that I think the United States Congress should aspire to. Maybe that is something that the Russians might want to aspire to, but it is certainly not something that we here in this country want to aspire to.  Everybody in this Chamber has ideas. Everybody represents the same number of people. Everybody should be heard, and important legislation and important ideas ought to be brought to the floor for debate and for a vote.  If you do not want to vote for universal background checks, or if you do not want to vote to ban bump stocks, or if you do not want to vote for an assault weapons ban, then don't vote for it. But it is wrong and it undermines this institution when, on issues like that, we are told: You cannot deliberate on the House floor.  Another issue is The President of the United States single handedly ended the DACA program, and he threw the lives of hundreds of thousands of people into chaos. It was a cruel and rotten thing to do.  The President's arbitrary March 5 deadline ending this program has come and gone, and instead of leadership and compassion, all we have seen is partisan tweeting. It is maddening, and it betrays our values.[[Page H1762]]  Earlier this month, President Trump tweeted: ``Total inaction of DACA by Where are you? A deal can be made.''  Well, to answer President Trump's question, the Democrats are right here, offering bipartisan solutions to protect these young  This is the 26th time that we have attempted to bring a bipartisan bill, the Dream Act, for a vote on the floor. And I am going to ask people to vote against the previous question so we can bring a solution to the floor and protect these incredible young people who have given so much to our country.  But this is the 26th time that we have attempted to do this.  And, by the way, this is not just a Democratic bill. There is bipartisan support for this. And what is particularly frustrating is that the Republican leadership of this House will not let us have that vote.  Why?  Because they know it will pass. They know it will pass. They don't want the majority to work its will in this They have deliberately said: We are not allowing you to bring that to the floor.  If you want to help these people, you have to bring a bill to the floor. And if you don't want to help them, well, bring the bill to the floor and vote ``no.'' But this is ridiculous. There is bipartisan support to fix this problem, to help these people, to live up to our values in this country.  Again, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up H.3440, the Dream Act, and this bipartisan, bicameral legislation would help hundreds of thousands of young people who are American in every way except on paper.  Mr.Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.Womack). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts?  There was no objection.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I would just say to my colleagues: Give us the vote. Give us this vote. If you don't like it, then vote ``no.'' But if we were to bring this bill to the floor, I guarantee you it would pass. I think every Democrat would vote for it, and a big chunk of Republicans, maybe even a majority, might vote for this.                              {time}  0945  I don't know what the gentleman is afraid of. I don't know why this is so hard. This is the Congress of the United This is the place where these issues are supposed to be resolved; and, instead, all we get from the leadership of this House is obstruction, obstruction, obstruction. They block everything--block everything. Everything is closed. It is my way or the highway. These people deserve better than this institution is providing. They deserve a vote.

791,topic-id,1003,"Mr.Speaker, when the Committee on Rules filed its report (115-614) to accompany House Resolution 796 the Committee was unaware that the waiver of all points of order against consideration of the motion to concur in the Senate Amendment to H.1625 included:  A waiver of section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act, which prohibits consideration of legislation providing new budget authority in excess of a 302(a) allocation of such authority.  A waiver of section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act, which prohibits consideration of legislation that would cause the level of total new budget authority for the first fiscal year to be exceeded, or would cause revenues to be less than the level of total revenues for the first fiscal year or for the total of that first fiscal year and the ensuing fiscal years for which allocations are provided.  The material previously referred to by Mr.McGovern is as follows:          An Amendment to 796 Offered by Mr.McGovern       At the end of the resolution, add the following new      sections:       Sec 7. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the      Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare      the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on      the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.     3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment      of status of certain individuals who are long-term United      States residents and who entered the United States as      children and for other purposes. The first reading of the      bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order[[Page H1766]]     against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate      shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour      equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking      minority member of the Committee on the After      general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment      under the five-minute rule.

The previous question shall be      considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to      final passage without intervening motion except one motion to      recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of      the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution      on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House      shall, immediately after the third daily order of business      under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the      Whole for further consideration of the bill.       8. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.3440.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What it Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

1538,topic-id,473,"Mr.President, the town of Madbury, NH, is celebrating its 250th anniversary this year. Madbury is a classic New England community, proud of its rich history, its tradition of direct town meeting democracy, and its family-friendly quality of life. Admittedly, I am not an entirely objective observer, as Madbury has been my home for nearly four decades. It is where I raised my family and have so many dear friends, and it is where I first got involved in local politics, serving on the town's zoning board. The roughly 1,800 residents of Madbury look forward to a nearly yearlong celebration of the anniversary, beginning with a special observance at our annual town meeting on March 13.  Of course, the human history of what is now Madbury--located today in Strafford County in southeast New Hampshire--goes back many centuries prior to the arrival of the first English explorers and settlers. In the 17th century, the Native American Chief Moharimet convened counsels in this area, and today our elementary school is named in his honor.  Madbury was originally a part of the settlements of Dover and Durham called Barbadoes, named after the West Indies island of Barbados, where local settlers sent lumber in exchange for sugar and molasses. It was named for the English town of Modbury, the ancestral home of Sir Francis Champernowne, who immigrated to what is now Madbury in the 1640s. Madbury was incorporated as a parish in 1755 and as a town in 1768.  One of our early residents was Major John Demerritt, who in 1774 joined with other New Hampshire patriots in storming the King's Fort William and Mary in New Castle, seizing its armory of weapons and gunpower. The ``Powder Major,'' as he came to be known, stored a portion of this armory at his farm, which still sits on Cherry It was later used by revolutionaries at the Battle of Bunker  Our Madbury town flag--thought to be the first town flag in New England--features an ax, a plow, and a rose. The ax represents forestry, which first attracted settlers to Madbury to supply shipbuilders at Dover, Durham, and The plow symbolizes our agricultural past. The rose symbolizes the former Elliot rose nursery, which in the mid-20th century boasted the longest greenhouse in the world at 1,400 feet in length.  Madbury is proud of its long and rich history, and we entered the 21st century as a forward-thinking community with a vibrant economy. Though surrounded by industrial areas, Madbury has remained largely rural in character, proud of its small town charm, hospitality, and lifestyle.  I look forward to celebrations of Madbury's 250th anniversary later this year, including a parade and other festivities on Madbury Day in June and a Revolutionary War reenactment in the fall. I salute my fellow residents of Madbury on this landmark anniversary of our beloved town.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-07-pt1-PgS1451.txt,1901,"LINN, AND MATTHEW BELLINA",2018.0,7.0,March
250,topic-id,544,"Mr.President, today I wish to express my gratitude to Jeremy Weirich, who has served as clerk for the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, or CJS, for his many years of distinguished public service.  Jeremy has dedicated much of his career to public service. He first came to the Senate in 2006 as a detailee from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, where he was serving as an NOAA Corps officer. The CJS Subcommittee needed an expert on all things NOAA, and Jeremy was brought to our attention as someone knowledgeable, capable, and ready to take on the challenge. He did not disappoint.  After his first stint at CJS, Jeremy returned to NOAA, but his knowledge and skills brought him back to the Senate in 2008. He initially worked on CJS for Senator Barbara Mikulski and then later as my subcommittee clerk. Jeremy is one of the few people on the Senate Appropriations Committee who has served as a clerk for both sides of the aisle. His honesty, integrity, and thoughtfulness have assisted in moving legislation through difficult situations. As can be witnessed by his dedicated work on behalf of both sides of the aisle, Jeremy is truly a consummate professional. His dealings with the members and staff in the Senate, both Republican and Democrat alike, are qualities that we all should strive to emulate.  Jeremy's first love is the ocean, having served as the first executive officer of the Okeanos Explorer, as well as at He carried that forward on CJS as he made sure that while we modernized our Nation's weather forecast system and took the first steps to make major capital investments in the NOAA fleet, we did so in a responsible manner. Jeremy helped ensure that our Nation's fisheries are managed responsibly and was always able to thread the needle in balancing the many differing interests. Jeremy's passion for exploration also helped guarantee that America has the vehicles and technology to further explore space with telescopes, satellites, and humans. He assisted in building the space launch system, but also kept an eye on the next generation of scientific exploration--everything from the James Webb Space Telescope to Mars rovers to  Jeremy embraced the justice portion of the CJS portfolio by promoting public safety, overseeing the current home of the FBI's Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center, and being instrumental in implementing the Federal Bureau of Investigation's 21st century facilities plan.  Most importantly, Jeremy approached his work with an essential appropriator's attitude: Let's get the job done. He was always ready to listen to members and their staffs, as well as experts from the agencies and outside communities. Every year, Jeremy worked tirelessly to craft a bill that garnered wide bipartisan support, and every year, he got the job done.  As Jeremy leaves the Senate after a decade of hard work and dedicated public service, he leaves the Committee on Appropriations in a better place, with a long list of accomplishments that have bettered our He also leaves many colleagues that are sad to see him go.  I want to thank Jeremy for his honorable service. I join the entire committee in wishing him continued success in his future endeavors and continued happiness in the years to come.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-21-pt1-PgS1874.txt,1049,"LINN, AND MATTHEW BELLINA",2018.0,21.0,March
614,topic-id,472,"Mr.President, I, too, would like to start by thanking my good friend, Senator Thad Cochran, for the tireless dedication and public service he has brought forth here throughout some 40-something years--45 years.  As has been said, he was elected to the U.House of Representatives over 45 years ago, and he was elected to the U.Senate in 1978. As all of us know, Thad was a practicing attorney in Jackson, MS, and a graduate of the University of Mississippi School of He also studied abroad at Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland, where we visited one time.  We have served together in the U.Senate for over 30 years. He has been an excellent colleague, and I have been honored to have worked with him. We represent neighboring States, Mississippi and Alabama, and we have both worked on some of the same priorities. But, mainly, he has served Mississippi with the utmost dignity and respect.  He has an excellent staff. We are all grateful for their hard work, their help, and their coordination with all of us.  As chairman of the Appropriations Committee, he has been a remarkable negotiator. As the majority leader will tell you--he is one himself--we need those traits at this point in time.  Thad has provided critical funding for various Mississippi priorities over the years. He hasn't forgotten where he is from. Right here, with a lot of help, he led the restoration of the gulf coast after Hurricane As I have understood them, his major priorities have always been the defense of this Nation; education, as Senator Leahy talked about; agriculture, where he served as the chairman of the Ag Committee for a long time; rural issues, not only in Mississippi but all over Thad also spent many years serving on the Rules Committee, where I now chair.  I believe history will reflect Thad Cochran's long legacy of strong leadership, and I, myself, believe that he has made an extraordinary impact here in the U. Thad, as we all know, is very courteous, well-mannered, and has a low-key demeanor most of the time. He is quiet, he is patient, and he has built seniority through power and perseverance.  Some people say that Thad Cochran is the last true southern gentleman, and I think there is a lot of truth to that. Some people say that he represents the lost art of being nice; we all need to work on that. He always has been and will be a hero both here and back home in  Thad, I wish you and your wonderful wife, Kay, well. I think all of us should strive to continue on the wise path that you have paved for us here in the  I believe we are all grateful for his service to Mississippi and our We wish him God's speed.

863,topic-id,451,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, coal-fired electric generation has been the subject of many costly regulations, and we are already seeing an economic impact on conventional coal facilities. But, today, we are focusing on a relatively small number of very unconventional facilities that take environmentally damaging waste coal, burn it to produce electricity, and then use the resulting ash to remediate the land.  The more you learn about H.1119, the Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving the Environment, the SENSE, Act, the more you will agree that these facilities are worth saving, which is what this bill does. I thank my colleague, Keith Rothfus from Pennsylvania, for sponsoring this innovative measure, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it.  Decades of coal mining in Pennsylvania, and other States, have led to a legacy of massive piles of waste coal that contributes to water and air pollution in communities where they are located.                              {time}  0915  The cost of eliminating this waste coal has been estimated at $2 billion for Pennsylvania alone, so absent a massive new program, it almost certainly won't get done.  Fortunately, coal refuse-to-energy plants have been developed and built in several communities with waste coal. These plants burn waste coal to produce electricity, and the resulting ash is then used to remediate the land. Thus far, these plants have eliminated 214 million tons of waste coal and restored thousands of acres and 1,200 miles of rivers and streams.  The electricity and the jobs created by these plants are really just a bonus compared to the tremendous environmental benefits; nonetheless, coal refuse-to-energy plants are now under threat. Although these plants utilize a specialized process, EPA has decided to treat them no differently than conventional coal-fired power plants. As a result, the Agency has jeopardized the continued operation of these facilities by setting standards that are not appropriate for them.  The SENSE Act addresses the problem by providing an alternative compliance mechanism for the compounds regulated under the Mercury and Air Toxic Standards, which is commonly known as the The bill still requires stringent emission reductions at these waste coal-to-energy plants, but ones that are achievable at these facilities.  I should note that earlier versions of the SENSE Act also included changes to the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, or CSAPR, but those provisions have been taken out of the version we are voting on today.  The result of this bill would be that these coal refuse-to-energy plants can continue operating, which would be a big win for the environment as well as for jobs in the communities in Pennsylvania and other States where they are located.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2018-03-08-pt1-PgH1480-6.txt,1527,REPACK AIRWAVES YIELDING BETTER ACCESS FOR USERS OF MODERN SERVICES ACT,2018.0,8.0,March

The first purpose is to clean up coal refuge sites, which are all over, again, and it keeps them from having the piles on the ground. And if they catch on fire, there is no controlling technology for that.  It keeps them from leaching into our streams, as Congressman Rothfus said numerous times, which is why EPA, again, has said these units warrant special consideration.

Some of these coal refuse sites leach into the groundwater, the streams, the tributaries, so that the water is yellow. These power plants clean them up.  The Obama administration, under Lisa Jackson, said that these units ``warrant special consideration.''  Why?  Because they are remediating all of these environmental hazards.

We had a House bill and we had a Senate bill, and then the two sides merged to keep some of the deductions that people really thought were important, and a great compromise that was working.  So the question is: Is the proof in the pudding?  In other words, is it operating as advertised for either side?  I think we are down here to say it is operating as advertised and we can proudly stand down here and tell some of these stories.  What we did is we posted a question on our newsletter to ask people to respond, and I want to share some of these responses. These are on the individual side. I will talk about the corporate side in a minute.  Ken and Pam from Joseph--we call it Joe--they say: ``Personally we have seen an increase in our net wages each week. With our business, we seem to have an increase in other companies starting new things.''  Gregg from Charleston says: ``More money in my take-home check.''  A pretty simple statement.  James from Marine says: ``My retirement check just went up. Thanks.''  Jeff from Carlyle says: ``Positive results only so far, just as expected with a commonsense tax cut.''  Carl from Collinsville, which is my hometown. I am glad Carl is happy. He says: ``I am seeing more on my paycheck each week. Keep up the good work.''  So that is just on the individual side.  Then we briefly want to talk about what is going on from business. You know, these are great announcements. I had the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, my good friend, Kevin Brady, tell me 50 percent of all manufacturers in this country are planning expansion. Not 50 percent of the manufacturers in Illinois or Michigan; across the country. That is pretty awesome.  So what is going on in my district?  Griffith Trucking, Broadway Express, Heartland Peterbilt, and Heartland Classics--which are in Effingham and Newton--gave $1,000 bonuses to 65 full-time employees.  FedEx has a big distribution hub in my district, same place, in FedEx has committed to more than $3 billion in wage increases, bonuses, pension funding, and expanded U.capital investment.  Charter Communications is raising their minimum wage to $15 an hour as a result of this tax cut plan.  It is great to see Congressman Roskam on the floor. He will get a chance to speak later. He was a major architect of this. I am very proud that he comes from These stories are attributed to Peter's great work.  The other one I wanted to mention--of course, I live in the metro Louis area. Boeing has a big presence in Louis, but a lot of their great workers, probably their best workers, live on the Illinois side. Boeing has announced employee-related and charitable investments of $300 million as a result of the tax law.  So great things are happening.  I want to follow what Fred Upton said, in that we as a body were tired of being in a malaise.  Is this all we can hope for?  We wanted an economy that would grow and create jobs and be vibrant, that people would be excited about going back to the workforce, working hard, taking home more of their pay, investing it into the market or in their retirement savings; and that is just what we are having.

Mr.Speaker, today we have a chance to help hundreds of small businesses, manufacturers, as well as thousands of employees, while also lowering prices for consumers.  I thank the bipartisan cosponsors of H.1917, the Blocking Regulatory Interference from Closing Kilns Act, the BRICK Act, and urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bill.  American brickmakers literally produce the building blocks of our They are primarily small businesses, and they are often the most important employer in small communities across America, where many are located.  Like an old brick house, this industry has had to weather a lot, including a long economic downturn, that we have finally come out of, that suppressed new construction activity and, thus, brick sales for many years.  They even weathered the 2003 EPA regulation that cost many millions of dollars to comply. That regulation was later thrown out by a Federal court, but the judicial relief came too late, as the industry had already spent considerable sums to meet EPA's tight deadlines.  We don't want to see a repeat of that unfair result, but, once again, EPA has imposed another regulation with difficult deadlines that will likely take effect before judicial review is complete.  Brickmakers have testified before the Energy and Commerce Committee that this regulation may result in layoffs and even plant closures. H.1917 would simply extend the compliance deadline until after judicial review is final.  This industry has already reduced its emissions by up to 95 percent, according to a study from the U.Chamber of It should not be forced to comply with another new regulation that may not withstand judicial scrutiny. We owe it to these brickmakers, their employees, and consumers of building materials to allow meaningful judicial review.  I might add that a Senate bill has been recently introduced that also provides regulatory relief for brickmakers, but it takes a somewhat different approach than our version. I pledge to work with the Senate so that we can provide timely relief to this important industry.  The bill also deals with wood heaters. As with bricks, the wood heaters industry is dominated by small business manufacturers who are often the economic anchors of rural communities, where many are located. Many wood heater buyers are low-income, rural households that rely on them to get through the winter.  In 2015, EPA set a two-step wood heater emission rule. The first step took effect in 2015 and reduced emissions in new models by up to 90 percent.  The more stringent second step is scheduled to take effect in 2020, but is causing a great deal of difficulty. Only a small fraction of the wood heating models currently available can meet the 2020 standards, and time is running out to design and certify any additional models.  One wood heater manufacturer testified before the Energy and Commerce Committee that he has already had to cut staff as a result of the 2020 deadline, and others feel there will be additional job losses if the 2020 standard is retained, but this is not just a jobs issue.  Users of wood heaters face both reduced product choice and higher prices for new models. Many would have to forgo buying a new wood heater and continue using older and dirtier ones, which undercuts the claims that the current deadline will improve air quality.  The provisions in the bill retain the 2015 standards, but extend the 2020 deadline by 3 years to 2023.  This is a reasonable fix that would avoid unnecessary economic damage while still prioritizing environmental protection.  In conclusion, the brick industry and the wood heater industry may both be small, but they are far from small to those who owe their jobs to them and to those who rely on their products.  I urge my colleagues to provide targeted relief to these two industries by supporting H.1917.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

It just focuses on a different way in which we view manufacturing and, really, as you heard in this debate, small manufacturers--small brick manufacturers, small wood heaters, because, as everyone knows, when you are in a big corporation, you have got lawyers and you have got--you can do an economic analysis and you can do research and development, but a lot of these folks are just small local operations, probably started by a husband and wife, probably brought on a kid and next-door neighbor.  In my opening statement, I mentioned how, in rural America, there are not a lot of businesses, other than maybe agriculture, people coming into the town; so not only are these manufacturers, they are the backbone of these small communities.  So, simply put, this bill is a combination of two. One says you really shouldn't force someone to comply with a rule and regulation until they have fought the litigation battle, because, in the example that we are talking about today, the claimants, the manufacturers, won, where either they went out of business because they were trying to comply or they had to have this excessive cost. That is issue one.  Issue two on the small wood heaters is just say they were forced to move forward in cleaner technology, increasing their environmental ability 90 percent; and we all know that the cleaner you get, the harder it is to get the last percentages. So all the folks are asking for is more time to comply.  They are both bipartisan bills. I applaud folks coming down to talk and defend those. This is an exciting time in our country. It is exciting because we are having economic growth. We are having economic growth for two reasons. One, our historic tax cuts. Fifty percent of all manufacturers of the country have said they are going to invest in capital investment. Pretty exciting.  There is optimism again. Wages are increasing. Benefits are increasing. You have people getting checks increasing or new growth capital expenses.  There is another component of this exciting time for jobs in the economy, and this other component is easing up on the assault that the EPA has done over the past decade on our manufacturing sector and our job creators.  So you put these two together, the American worker has a greater opportunity, and these are just a couple of examples of the bills we are moving today, how we can continue to make that happen.  Mr.Speaker, I urge passage of this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.

1827,topic-id,552,"Mr.Speaker, I include the following letters in the Record on H.1917.                                            Chamber of Commerce of                                 the United States of America,                                    Washington, DC, March 7, 2018.       To the Members of the U.House of Representatives: The      U.Chamber of Commerce supports H.1917, the ``Blocking      Regulatory Interference from Closing Kilns (BRICK) Act of      2017.'' The bill would ensure that the U.brick industry      will not be forced to comply with the Brick Maximum      Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards for air      quality issued by the U.Environmental Protection Agency      (EPA) until after judicial challenges to the rule are      resolved.       EPA issued an earlier version of the Brick MACT rule in      2003, which required the brick industry to spend millions of      dollars to purchase, install, and operate control equipment.      Five years later, a court threw out the 2003 rule. Now brick      companies are faced with having to pay to tear out the      equipment they installed and install even more costly new      equipment. Brick companies are rightfully worried that they      may make the investment to comply with the 2015 rule, only to      have it subsequently thrown out by a court. To avoid this      unfair and wasteful outcome, H.1917 would set a compliance      date for the final Brick MACT rule after judicial challenges      to the 2015 Brick MACT rule are completed and after any      subsequent final rule is promulgated.       It is important that American industries are not unfairly      penalized when they are compelled to comply with costly rules      that are later overturned by the courts. This wasteful and      unreasonable outcome must be avoided.           Sincerely,     Neil                                  ____                                              National Association                                             of Manufacturers,                                    Washington, DC, March 7, 2018.     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative, The National Association of      Manufacturers (NAM), the largest manufacturing association in      the United States representing manufacturers in every      industrial sector and in all 50 states, urges you to support      H.1917, the Blocking Regulatory Interference from Closing      Kilns Act of 2017 (BRICK Act), introduced by Representative      Bill Johnson (R-OH).       In September 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency      (EPA) issued final National Emissions Standards for Brick,      Structural Clay Products and Clay Ceramics Manufacturing,      often referred to as Brick It is estimated that this      rule will collectively cost the brick industry, which is made      up of predominantly small- and medium-sized manufacturers,      more than $100 million dollars per year.       Manufacturers support reasonable environmental policies,      but need regulatory certainty to ensure that the investments      made today match what regulations will ultimately require.      When regulations stretch beyond what the law allows,      manufacturers and other stakeholders must turn to the courts      for relief. Often times compliance deadlines for disputed      final regulations are too short for the legal process to      fully run its course and manufacturers are forced to make      investments to comply with rules that courts may ultimately      throw out or send back to EPA for more work.       This is exactly the situation brick manufacturers find      themselves in with this regulation, as EPA's rule requires      millions in new regulatory costs within a three-year period,      while the underlying regulation is being disputed in the      courts--a process that could ultimately span several years      H.1917 is a commonsense way to approach this issue, as it      simply ensures that manufacturers will have the certainty      that the investments they make are based on laws that the      courts have determined are appropriate and legal. The NAM      strongly urges you to support H.1917           Sincerely,     Ross                                  ____  ",CREC-2018-03-07-pt1-PgH1458.txt,1527,ALLOW STATES AND VICTIMS TO FIGHT ONLINE SEX TRAFFICKING ACT OF 2017,2018.0,7.0,March

I don't think we build and use bricks to make our airplanes, and I don't think we power our planes with wood heaters.  So what is the deal with this motion to instruct and recommit?  It is just purely politics, and it is not surprising.  Why?  Well, because Democrats want to distort us from our economic success of the Republican agenda. And it is built on two foundational principles. One is the very successful tax reform and bill that we passed in And Americans are seeing it. Fifty percent of all manufacturers around the country are going to invest in capital expansion. People have bigger paychecks now. They are getting bonuses.  In fact, I was on the floor last night with We were reading stories from constituents about the benefits they are receiving, either in less money being taken out on taxes or increase in wages; trucking companies expanding. So it is an incredible success of optimism when we have been in an economic malaise for the past 8 years.  And that is the kind of society I want to live in. I want to live in a society where, when my kids enter the workforce, there is a job there. And I want them to say: If I work hard and play by the rules, man, there is an opportunity for me. And that is what is coming back.  There is another component to this economic success, and that is calling[[Page H1465]]off the EPA dogs who have been attacking the job creators in our country over the past 8 years. Ease the regulatory burden, provide historic tax relief, excitement in the economy, new jobs, new energy.

It is a dangerous and highly sophisticated organization. Sinaloa smuggles heroin and methamphetamine across the border into Arizona and, with it, a pattern of crime, intimidation, and addiction that rips at the very fabric of our communities.  Arizonans know we need to be tough, smart, and aggressive to confront Sinaloa and other cartels.

Drug cartels like Sinaloa obtain wealth and power through money laundering; cybercrime; and human, drugs, and weapons smuggling.

304,topic-id,2133,"Mr.President, I wish to join my bipartisan group of colleagues who have been coming to the floor to talk about the very important bill that we are debating and are going to be voting on here in about an hour; that is, to help protect our children all across this country from the horrible scourge of human trafficking and sex trafficking. The Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act that we are debating right now is important for the whole country, and it is certainly important for my State of  We have a big problem in Alaska with the challenges of domestic violence and sexual assault at some of the highest rates in the country. We also have a big problem with the challenges of human trafficking and sex trafficking. A lot of people think that doesn't happen in It happens in It is a horrible issue to talk about, but it happens in our country.  There was a study done last year on young men and women in Alaska receiving services from a homeless shelter for teenagers. My wife Julie actually works at this homeless shelter, and one in four girls and one in five boys who used the services of this teen homeless shelter reported being victims of sex trafficking. This is a horrible number for a very vulnerable society. We need to do more to address this issue.  In this legislation, we are taking the fight to one of the places in this country where human trafficking and sex trafficking are really exploding, and that is the internet. The bipartisan legislation we are debating right now will ensure that websites and other institutions on the internet and the companies related that knowingly--and that is an important word, ``knowingly''--facilitate sex trafficking can be held accountable for their actions. It will also create new Federal crimes related to promoting or facilitating human trafficking over the internet and give more resources to State prosecutors to go after these heinous crimes.  In the remarks from a whole host of Senators this morning, I think we are seeing that we are going to make real progress in the fight against online sex trafficking without threatening the years of progress we have made in creating a free and open internet. Senator Portman, one of the leaders of this effort, along with many others--Senator McCain and his wife Cindy have been real champions and advocates for human trafficking issues throughout America; Senator Blumenthal and so many other Senators have been saying that this is a commonsense, targeted approach to addressing this very big and growing problem.  We are going to vote in about an hour, and I hope all of my colleagues will do the right thing and vote on these amendments that are put out there as helpful amendments, but, to be honest, they are meant to bring down the bill.  We cannot allow our children, whether in Alaska or across the country, to be lured into this kind of Hell--and the more we hear in terms of testimony, the more we recognize that what is going on over the internet in this area is Hell mostly for the youth of  Our children should not be sold online or anywhere else. Unfortunately, it is happening, and it is happening a lot, largely because of the internet. The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children reported, from 2010 to 2015, an 846-percent increase in the number of children being trafficked--an over 800-percent increase in  A lot of Americans think: Wait, really? That is a problem in Asia, Southeast Asia, or other countries. But it is a growing problem in the United States of America, and we need to address it.  As others have said on this floor, sex trafficking has moved from the street corner to the smartphone, where it is much more difficult to detect and much more difficult to stop, and it is one of the reasons we see this dramatic increase in rates of human trafficking in our country.  In the Commerce Committee, we had a hearing that covered this bill. Some members of the tech industry were opposed, but I think the overwhelming support that came out of that hearing was driven by the real-world tragedies we started to hear from hundreds--thousands--across the country that have occurred because of really lax laws and immunity on the internet that was not intended for companies or individuals who deal in sex trafficking and human trafficking. What we saw from the report and the investigations that Senator Portman and others did was that actually was what was happening.  For example, Senator Blumenthal earlier today talked about the very tragic, sad, and moving testimony we heard last September in the Commerce Committee from Yvonne Ambrose, whose 16-year-old daughter Desiree Robinson was trafficked online by a pimp on the website, She was later raped and murdered by a 32-year-old man who found her on that website. She was an American citizen, a 16-year-old girl. If you had watched her mom's testimony of in front of the Commerce Committee, you would be voting for this bill today.  Her mom ended her riveting and very sad testimony by saying: If there were stricter rules in place for posting on these websites, then my child would still be here with us today. It was a wrenching story and, unfortunately, one that too many American mothers and fathers are telling us.  We are going to vote on this today, and I hope all my colleagues vote for more progress. As the Presiding Officer knows, on this issue, there is actually positive progress that has been going on in the A lot of times, when they read the news--my constituents back home in Alaska and Americans throughout the country--they are always hearing about conflict and how there is no progress in the We have some difficult issues; there is no doubt about it. But on a lot of issues there has been bipartisan progress, and in this area of human trafficking, there has been significant bipartisan progress to finally start addressing this growing problem in America--which, again, is remarkable when you think about it--of young men and women trafficked for sex in this country.  In 2017, we passed on a bipartisan basis the Abolish Human Trafficking Act; in 2015, we passed the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Both were introduced by my friend and colleague, Senator Cornyn of Senator Thune has been a leader on these issues in the last couple of years in passing the No Human Trafficking on Our Roads Act and Combating Human Trafficking in Commercial Vehicles Act, which focused on the big problem we have seen in terms of the transportation system in America being used for human trafficking. In the Judiciary Committee, we passed Chairman Grassley's bill, the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, which brought more services to victims of these heinous crimes.  We are making progress, no doubt about it. But--and this is a very important point--despite this strong record of addressing human trafficking, when it comes to these crimes, some of the biggest things we need more of in America to address them, because they are growing, are resources--resources. To put it bluntly, there are too many cases, there is too much of this happening, and there are not enough resources, money, or prosecutors to put the bad individuals who are doing this behind bars.  Many of these cases involving human trafficking are Federal crimes that usually require Federal prosecutors to go after these Federal offenses. As we all know, there are limited numbers of assistant U.attorneys and Federal investigators to do this. So what have we done? What have we done in the past few years? What are we doing today in this vote to help address this? We have begun to change this issue of resources to go after the perpetrators of these heinous crimes in a much better way by allowing State attorneys general and State district attorneys to actually prosecute these crimes, even though they are Federal crimes. We are doing something in the law that says: We need more prosecutors, we need more investigators, and we need more resources. Let's unleash those in the States to help us address this growing problem throughout our country.  So we are doing that, and we did it for the first time in the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act in 2015. This[[Page S1865]]bill, for which Senator Cornyn was the lead, actually incorporated a bill that I had authored and had a lot of cosponsors on called the Mann Act Cooperation amendment. We put that in as part of the broader bill in 2015.  The Mann Act is the Federal law that makes it a criminal offense to transport someone across State lines for the purposes of prostitution and human trafficking. In my experience back home in Alaska, as attorney general, we had challenges in this regard. As a matter of fact, there was a very notorious case of a bad man--a very corrupt man--who a lot of people knew in Alaska, and he was engaged in this kind of activity with young girls from the Native villages in my We investigated it and realized that he violated not a State law but a Federal law. It was very clear that it was a human trafficking violation of the Mann  When I was attorney general, my office went to the Feds, and we said: Here you go. Here is the evidence. This guy violated the Mann He is a bad man. He should go to jail. We need to send a signal.  It is a rather long story. It is a sad story. But for whatever reason--I have wondered for years, and I have looked into this for years--the Federal Government wouldn't take the case.  I said to the Feds: Then, let my prosecutors take the case. We will take the case. You just need to cross-designate us. Let the State attorney general's office take these Federal laws and prosecute them against this guy. We will do it.  They still didn't allow us to do it. There were rumors in Alaska: Hey, what was going on here? Was there some kind of deal cut between the Feds and this guy who was a really bad guy and who was in jail for something else?  When I got to the Senate, I said: We are not going to let that kind of injustice happen again.  That was an injustice. A man who violated the Mann Act and clearly committed the crime of human trafficking is a free man right now. That shouldn't be the case.  As part of the Justice for Victims of Human Trafficking Act in 2015, we had a provision. My bill essentially said this: If a State attorney general brings a Mann Act case--a human trafficking violation case, Federal case--to the Attorney General of the United States, saying that we need to be cross-designated to prosecute--maybe the Feds don't have the resources; maybe they don't have the time--then, the Attorney General of the United States shall allow the cross-designation for more State attorneys general to prosecute these cases, unless it would undermine the administration of justice. That is in the law. State attorneys generals right now can go prosecute Mann Act cases. That is more resources, more investigators, and more prosecutors.  That is going to be in the law that we are voting on today. One of the elements--an important element--of the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, which we are voting on and debating now, is to allow State attorneys general the power and the authority to bring actions against those who violate Federal law for internet-based sex trafficking.  We are bringing the resources in these kind of cases. That is an important innovation in the development of the bill that we are voting on today. Just like in the previous legislation, State attorneys general can now bring these cases. If we pass this law today, that will mean more resources, more investigators, and more prosecutors for the perpetrators of these heinous crimes. To all the bad guys out there who are undertaking these crimes, when we vote to pass this legislation today, that is going to be a bad day for you because we are going to have more resources and the ability to put you in jail with this vote today.  As I mentioned, we have a big problem in this country. We have a long way to go in terms of human trafficking, sex trafficking, which is hitting all parts of Congress is focused on it, and I am hopeful that we will pass this legislation this afternoon for one more step in the right direction on addressing this issue.

I had the honor of presiding over much of the ceremony recognizing Senator Thad Cochran's incredible service to Mississippi and to You heard a lot. It was really remarkable--45 years in the Congress and four decades as a U.I think Senator Leahy, from Vermont, said it best when he talked about Thad Cochran's integrity--a man who will always keep his word.

He has this great nickname that I think was given to him in 2006, when Time Magazine said he was one of the best U.Senators and called him the ``quiet persuader.'' You heard that term a lot just a few minutes ago. In that article, they said that he had gained the trust of the administration and on Capitol Hill for his quiet, courtly manner, using his experience and mastery of the issues to persuade his colleagues privately rather than making demands of them in public.

I like to call that person our Alaskan of the  Right now what has been happening in Alaska is a very special time. Our State, in many ways, is shrouded with myth and mystique. We certainly have, I believe, the most beautiful State in the country. There is a lot of excitement that happens, a lot of special things.

It is still cold, and there is lots of snow, but the sun is now coming out high in the sky. Of course, in Alaska, there is hockey. We love hockey. We all know it is a tough and competitive sport, but it certainly fits into the ethos of my All across the State, kids and adults play hockey--boys, girls, men, and women, in indoor and outdoor rinks, ponds, and lakes--and skate up and take to the ice.[[Page S1900]]  However, as many parents who are involved in hockey know, gear can be very expensive. Actually, hockey can be very expensive. Many kids and adults can miss out on this great, great sport--a great sport in my State--because of the cost.  I would like to introduce you to Anchorage resident Carlos Gomez, who is our Alaskan of the He has dedicated an extraordinary amount of his time and his life to try to make sure that all kids in my State--boys and girls from all walks of life--get to play hockey, like so many others do in Alaska, no matter if they can afford it or not.  Let me tell you about Mr.Carlos Gomez, because he is not one to brag about himself. Like most Alaskans of the Week, he is an unsung hero, doing so much for the community. His impact on hockey--particularly, for the youth of Alaska--is remarkable. In many ways, his story is truly a classic story of the American dream.  Carlos was born in When he was 10, he and his brother went to live with an aunt in San His wife Dalia was born in Colombia and then moved to Alaska, also with an aunt, when she was just 7 years old. Carlos received a scholarship from the University of California San Diego but had to drop out and cut his studies short because the strain of both going to school and providing for his family and contributing enough for his family was very difficult.  He ended up in Alaska in 1972 to work as an ironworker, where he helped to build our He built the Alaska pipeline during that time. It was a huge and exciting time in the He met his wife Dalia, as I mentioned, and they settled down in a modest home in Airport Heights, AK, and began to raise a family.  They had three wonderful kids. His daughters are Monica and Natalie, and his son is All of them are great, bright kids. One of them, Scott, who we in Alaska simply call Scotty--and I will get to that--had amazing athletic talents. When Scotty was just 4 years old, Carlos took him to his first hockey game. Scotty wanted to try it himself. Soon the young boy was hooked and wanted to play hockey as often as he could, and he was good. The problem was that although they weren't poor as a family, they didn't have the extra money for all the equipment and the expense that hockey requires. The Anchorage Boys & Girls Club had a program that loaned out hockey equipment and hockey gear. They helped to utilize that. As Scotty grew, he needed more equipment, and he stayed focused on hockey. Soon Carlos, our Alaskan of the Week, became so involved in youth hockey and had such a heart for the youth who wanted to play hockey in Alaska but had difficulty affording it that he became this master fundraiser throughout Alaska for the sport, not only for his son but for all the kids in the community who wanted to play hockey across the city.  Fast forward to 1998, and Scotty, his son, a 4-year-old playing hockey on ponds in Anchorage, is selected by the New Jersey Devils as their first-round draft choice--the first Latino ever drafted to be in the first round of the NHL draft. Scotty went on to become an all-star, Stanley Cup winner and a recipient of the Calder Memorial Trophy as the league's rookie of the year--all in his first NHL season. That is not bad for a little kid from Anchorage--all before he turned 21. He went on to win another Stanley Cup and later played for the New York Rangers, the Montreal Canadiens, the San Jose Sharks, the Florida Panthers, and the Louis He even chose to return home to Anchorage during the NHL lockout to play briefly for our very own Alaska  As you can imagine, Scotty is quite popular and well-known in He is admired by so many, and his father is as well. He could have stopped championing, as he has done for so many years, the sport of hockey at any point along the way, but what he did was that he kept doing this. He kept working. He kept encouraging young kids in Alaska to get on the ice to achieve their goals, just like his son did. So Carlos, Scotty, and the rest of the family set up the Scotty Gomez Foundation, which is devoted to that cause, and Carlos Gomez is still running it today. There are more kids like Scotty out there, Carlos said, and ``we're going to give that kid an opportunity,'' like my son had.  The foundation has done so much for youth hockey in Thousands of kids across the State have access to gear and the ability to play this great sport that they otherwise wouldn't be able to afford. Around Anchorage's rinks, you will find the dark blue and gold gear--just like our Alaska flag--with a ram. It is the Gomez ram, and it helps kids, no matter their backgrounds or experience, get on the ice and play this great sport.  The foundation has put money into rehabbing rinks, like the one in East Anchorage, which is the neighborhood outdoor rink where Scotty learned to play hockey. When the Anchorage School District dropped the girls' high school hockey in the spring of 2013, the Scotty Gomez Foundation, under Carlos's leadership, stepped up, picked up the sport for 3 years, and redeveloped it into cooperatives across Anchorage's eight public high schools. Girls' hockey in Anchorage is alive today because of Carlos Gomez and his family. Also, in his never forgetting the generosity given to Scotty in his start in hockey, the foundation sponsors youth hockey events and grants for the Boys & Girls Club of That is really giving back to the community.  One of the Scotty Gomez Foundation's biggest events every year is the Last Frontier Pond Hockey Classic, which is organized by Carlos and his partner, Mike Davenport, in Big The event took place just two weekends ago, and it was quite an event. More than 600 hockey players showed up--kids, lawyers, doctors, slope workers, former pro and college players--men and women. Counting everybody, more than 1,000 people, from all walks of life, went to the event to raise money for youth hockey in  It is amazing what one family can do to touch so many, led by Mr.Carlos As Scotty said, ``It was my father's dream to give back. This is all him. He always just wants to help others.''  If you are a kid in Alaska who wants to play hockey, Carlos Gomez will egg you on and make sure nothing, especially the cost of equipment, will stop you.  Scotty said:       When I was growing up, he was like a father to all of the      neighborhood kids who needed one. My dad's a true hero.  I thank Mr.Carlos Gomez for all he has done for Alaska's youth and youth hockey throughout our great We are honored to call him our Alaskan of the  I yield the floor.

1039,topic-id,1252,"Madam President, as many of my colleagues know, one of my favorite parts of the week is coming down to the Senate floor to recognize somebody special in my State, somebody we refer to as our ``Alaskan of the Week.'' It is one of the most fulfilling things I do all week, to get to talk about people who make my State very, very special.  I know many of you--people in the Gallery--have seen Alaska on TV or have read about it in the newspapers, but there is no substitute for being there. We want you all to come. It would be the trip of a lifetime, particularly now.  What is going on in Alaska right now, one of the highlights of the entire year, is the Iditarod--the ``last great race'' in the world--which is in full throttle. When you visit, Alaska will change your life--the wilderness, the wildlife, the quiet, the sense of unbridled freedom, the liberty, and the majesty. It is all there.

We call it the ``last great race,'' and it finishes at  There is no place like Nome, we like to say in If you live in Nome, you might have seen Carol running in winter, spring, summer, and fall. Carol runs through the streets and into the mountains surrounding It is one of the ways that she has found purpose in her life, which in turn she has used to help others, to inspire others.  Like a lot of us, Carol had big dreams when she was growing up. She was interested in science and space. She was actually interested in being an astrophysicist. Then, as sometimes happens to young kids, her life took a bit of a turn. She got in with the wrong crowd and started drinking and using drugs, and her life lost meaning.  This is a difficult subject to talk about on the Senate floor, but we must. We must. Carol wants us to. Alaska has the second highest suicide rate in the country, and it has the highest teen suicide rate in the entire[[Page S1545]]The suicide rate among Alaska Native teens is also very, very high--tragically high, horribly high. When it comes to suicide, silence is deadly.  Carol knows all about this. When she was 16, she tried to end her life by shooting herself. After the gun went off, she remembers thinking: Dear God, save me. I don't want to die anymore.  Then she described how, during this awful incident, her ancestors came to her, her elders, telling her that she was going to be OK and that she had a reason to live. She did live. Badly scarred, after having multiple operations on her face, recovery has not been easy for Carol, but she has made it through. She has toughed it out.  What she did was remarkable and incredible. She began to speak about suicide at schools. She was a member of the State's Suicide Prevention Eventually, she got a job at an elders' home, where she is currently the cultural activities specialist. She organizes Alaska Native dances. She cooks traditional Alaska Native food for her elders. Moose and muskox soup is their favorite. I think Senator Murkowski is going to let us enjoy a little muskox stew over lunch today, so Carol will be pleased about that.  But as the years went by, she again experienced depression, which is not uncommon. She didn't feel like getting out of bed. She was unhealthy. But then again, in 2014, more inspiration--again, incredible. A high school friend who was a runner urged Carol to try it. You are not feeling healthy? You are feeling sad? Go out, try to get a run in. At first, when she did it, she could only go a few blocks. Eventually the blocks turned into miles, which is even more challenging for her because of some of her injuries. Nonetheless, she persevered.  We are seeing a theme in her life. She began to get healthy and to feel good about herself again. Again, she found her reason to live. Guess what. She has turned into an amazing athlete. She began to enter races in 2015 when she ran the local 8-mile Dexter ``I thought, if I do eight miles, I could do a half marathon,'' she said. And then she did.  Carol didn't stop there. Now she is running ultramarathons across the country--50 miles in Iowa, multiple ultramarathons in Utah, a 50K in Washington Early last month, she was running a 50K in Texas when, about 5 miles in, she broke her ankle, but that didn't stop her. She finished even with a broken ankle and is recovering. We are seeing a woman, a young lady of perseverance. Her ultimate goal is to do an ultramarathon in every State in  Because of Carol's scars, she wears a mask. In August she decided that it was too cumbersome to wear the mask while running, so during a race in Alaska--the very challenging 50-mile Resurrection Pass ultramarathon--she took it off, and it was liberating for her. Here is the beautiful thing: Everybody--everybody--was so supportive, so she doesn't run with a mask anymore.  It is not only runners who are supportive of Carol; she has gotten people in her hometown, the town of Nome, to start running themselves. Across the State, people approach her wherever she goes, and they tell her they have heard about her, they have heard about her life, and if she has made it through her challenge, they can too. In other words, she is an inspiration. She has become an inspiration throughout Alaska to so many people. She said:       I think I'm helping other people overcome difficulties.      They tell me I'm inspiring them to keep going. So that's why      I believe I'm here now--to help others.  That is Carol's quote.  So, Carol, for your inspiration to so many in our great State, for all you have done and all you continue to do, we are proud of you and thank you for being our Alaskan of the Week this week, as the Iditarod finishes up in your hometown of Nome,  Madam President, I yield the floor.

For generations, Elks around the Nation have dedicated themselves to building strong communities and lending a helping hand to their fellow neighbors.  Today I would like to recognize an outstanding group of hometown Elks who have made the journey from Oneida County to visit us here in Washington: Donna Townsend; Whitney Cook; Mary Bielby; and retired captain of the Rome Police Department, John  Our Elks in Rome and around the country help our youth develop lifelong skills, assist students who are attending college, support charitable work in their communities, and care for our local veterans.  However, Rome Elks are unique to all other Elks in the country. In addition to the honorable work of the Elks, Rome Elks also carry out the longstanding tradition of caring for the gravesite of a historic Rome native, Sir Francis Some of you may not know it, but Sir Francis Bellamy is the author of our uniquely American tradition, the Pledge of  Francis Bellamy was born in Mount Morris, New York, attended our Rome public schools, and graduated from Rome Free Academy, affectionately known as RFA, in 1872.  Every day throughout our country, in public and parochial schools; at Boy Scout and Girl Scout meetings; at American Legions and all fraternal and patriotic organizations; in government, including here in our Nation's Capitol, millions of Americans recite the Pledge of  The Pledge of Allegiance reminds our citizenry of the notion of what it means to be We pledge allegiance to this great experiment; to our constitutional Republic, a nation that reveres freedoms, individual rights, and liberty. We pledge allegiance to our country's historic Judeo-Christian values.  Bellamy wrote the Pledge of Allegiance in 1892 at the age of 37. During his time working as a writer for a magazine called ``The Youth's Companion,'' a family magazine that, at the time, had 500,000 subscribers, Bellamy was tasked with creating a patriotic school program to honor the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' arrival to Through this assignment, the Pledge of Allegiance, as we know it today, took shape.  At a trying time in our Nation's history, Francis Bellamy captured so elegantly and simply America's unity and loyalty. With only a sentence, Bellamy ultimately symbolized America's ability to surpass all internal differences. It is the manifestation of our patriotic conscience and it is recognized throughout our  Francis Bellamy's spirit pervades in Rome to this day, especially during patriotic holidays, like Flag On Flag Day, the Rome Elks replace the two American flags that fly over Sir Francis Bellamy's gravesite. These annual ceremonies are a dedication to the patriotic principles that our flag has stood for since it was first adopted in 1777. In 2008, the Rome Elks started a significant renovation project on Bellamy's gravesite, and completed it 1 year later, just in time to rededicate it for Flag  In addition to their work in honoring Sir Francis Bellamy and the American flag, the Rome Elks are also well known for their commitment to helping our local veterans.  Recently, the Rome Elks held a fundraiser to raise money for therapy dogs for veterans through a local organization called Clear Path for As part of the fundraiser, the Rome Elks took flags that had flown over Sir Francis Bellamy's gravesite and removed the stars and stripes. They then individually separated and added a slip of paper with the words ``This little star is proud to say I flew over Bellamy's grave.'' The Rome Elks call this project ``Stars Over Bellamy.''  They started with 300 of these little packets, but quickly added 200 more when they realized how popular this projects was. To date, the Rome Elks have raised over $1,000 for this fundraising effort. One of the most touching aspects is that every veteran that a Rome Elks member comes across receives one of these stars for free as a thank-you for their years of service.  I was lucky enough to be able to purchase a star for myself and a few others for my son, who is currently serving in the Marine It is a constant reminder for me of the legacy Francis Bellamy left for our country, as well as the patriotic principles I as a member of the Ilion Elks Lodge #1444--a nearby Elks Lodge down the street--have come to live by.  These are just a few examples of the hard work and devotion that the Rome Elks show for their community. The Rome Elks bring so much more to the community than just a building. Although it is a beautiful, historic building on Liberty Street--aptly named--in Rome, New York, they invest in programs that help children grow up healthy and drug-free, meet the needs of today's veterans, and improve the quality of life for our area.

1223,topic-id,1818,"Mr.President, I thank Chairman I want to associate myself with my good friend from Tennessee, Senator Bob We always say ``good friend,'' but the truth is that Senator Corker has truly been a good friend. We came to this body together, and he has exhibited uncommon common sense in this body time and again, and once again, he has today. I thank Senator Corker for his remarks about this bill.  Mr.President, time and again over the past year, I have been here on the Senate floor raising my concerns about the direction this body is heading--secret backroom deals on the healthcare bill, a ``take it or leave it'' tax bill that was dropped on our desks literally hours before the vote, and the floor time that has been wasted to score political points. Quite frankly, this dysfunction has turned the world's most deliberative body into a shell of its former self.  Folks in Washington have shied away from the big debates and refused to tackle the tough issues that are facing hard-working Americans every day, but this week I am hopeful that can change.  Today we begin the debate on the bipartisan Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection This bill is the product of years of bipartisan negotiations, hearings, and compromises. Under the leadership of Chairman Crapo and my good friends Senators Heitkamp, Donnelly, and Warner, we have struck a bipartisan agreement that is needed to provide an economic boost for rural Folks from both parties put their differences aside. We negotiated from our points of agreement, and we emphasized common ground. We kept working toward our shared goal of strengthening America's economy by providing commonsense regulatory reform to small- and medium-sized banks, community banks, and credit unions.  During the committee process, this bill was marked up and debated for 7 hours. We voted on 36 amendments during an open amendment process. The chairman handled that committee process incredibly professionally.  Since this bill was introduced in the Banking Committee last year, it has been strengthened by Senators who are not on that committee, and it has been endorsed by regulators, veterans groups, and job creators from both parties. This bipartisan bill has support from folks of all walks of life and is cosponsored by more than a quarter of this body because they know that reform is desperately needed.  In my home State of Montana, prior to the financial crisis in 2008, there were 72 chartered banks. Today that number has dropped to 49. What we have seen in Montana is not unique throughout this country. Across rural America, bank consolidation is leaving communities underserved. Community banks and credit unions didn't cause the financial crisis back in 2008, but they have suffered under a one-size-fits-all set of regulations specifically designed to rein in the behavior on Wall As a result of complying with these regulations, many of our community bankers are hanging up their hats, and our local banks are being swallowed up by bigger banks. Ultimately, they will be swallowed up by the folks on Wall  Furthermore, when a community bank is bought out by a big bank, its business model changes and it is no longer tailored to fit that community. Despite being a small portion of the banking industry, community banks provide--listen to this--48 percent of the small business loans in this country, 15 percent of the residential mortgage lending, 43 percent of farmland and farm lending, and 34 percent of commercial real estate loans. These banks are designed and built to serve their communities.  Since the passage of Dodd-Frank, the number of banks in this country has declined by 14 percent, and in our State of Montana, with some quick math, it is closer to 30 percent. If you are a product of rural America like I am, you know full well the consequences when a bank leaves town. It is just a matter of time before that community shrivels up. Folks, something must be done.  Eight years ago, during the dark days of the financial crisis, I proudly supported Dodd-Dodd-Frank was needed to crack down on risky financial behavior. For the most part, Dodd-Frank has been successful, but, like all major bills, Dodd-Frank had some unintended consequences. Since its passage, small business lending has declined by 41 percent. That is why our bill is needed--to bring more capital to Main Streets across America and to protect community banks from further consolidation.  Our bill provides small and midsized banks and credit unions with more flexibility to meet the unique needs of the communities they serve. It also provides our community banks with much needed regulatory relief and cuts the redtape to keep our local banks competitive. It includes critical consumer protection provisions to better protect our veterans, our seniors, and tenants. This bipartisan bill makes it easier for young families to purchase their first home. It helps family farmers and ranchers secure the capital they need to survive a tough year when Mother Nature doesn't cooperate. It helps small businesses and startups secure the funding they need to grow their businesses and create more jobs. It protects the small banks that serve as a cornerstone of rural communities from being eaten alive by the big boys on Wall  In addition to banking reform, this bill strengthens the rights of consumers. It provides consumers with unlimited free credit freezes and unfreezes. It prevents mortgage companies from immediately kicking tenants out of their homes if a landlord is foreclosed on. It increases safeguards against fraud for veterans, Active-Duty servicemembers, seniors, and children.  Over the course of this debate, there are going to be some folks who come to this floor and peddle misinformation, so let me be clear about what this bill does not do. It does not roll back the regulations on Wall Street's fat cats. It does not make structural changes to the Consumer Financial Protection It does not weaken or repeal the Volcker rule for large banks. It does not change the way the Federal Reserve regulates foreign banks. It does not weaken efforts to combat lending discrimination.  I have already seen a lot of falsehoods about this bill claimed out there, so I hope this debate stays grounded in the facts, and the fact is that folks in rural America need this bill.  Take for instance the Community Bank in Polson, Polson's population is 5,000, and that might be generous. The Community Bank had faithfully served this community for decades, but the regulations from Dodd-Frank were so burdensome on that small bank and so costly that it was forced to sell out to a larger bank.  But it is not just Here is what other folks in my State are saying about the bill. A small credit union in Billings, MT, said:       As a small credit union, we spend a ridiculous amount of      time complying with complex rules and I am pleased to see a      bill that would eliminate some of this red tape so I can      focus my resources on serving members.[[Page S1357]]  That was from Sydney El-Bakken, manager of Homestead Federal Credit Union in Billings,  This is a quote from another bank in Jordan, MT:       Dodd-Frank has disproportionately affected small banks like      mine who have limited staff and resources to comply with the      regulations created by the bill. Prior to Dodd-Frank's      passage, my bank was able to keep up with compliance      regulations with one staff member. Now, in addition to our      one staff person, we also have outside compliance consultants      that cost us over $23,000 last year alone.  I am going to get back to that figure in a second.       I have talked to many of my fellow bankers who decided to      sell to, or merge with, another bank. Almost every one of      them has told me that the regulatory burden was one of the      main reasons for them to sell or merge.       The loss of small community banks is not good for our      country, our consumers, or our economy. This bill provides      many remedies to lessen the regulatory burden on small banks,      which allow us to remain competitive, viable, and able to      serve the needs of our communities.  The reason I bring up the $23,000 is that there are some out there who may be listening and may say that $23,000 is not even a rounding error in a lot of businesses. Rex Phipps is the CEO of Garfield County Bank in Jordan, Their total assets are $86 million. This is a small bank that is getting pounded and that this bill is going to help in a big, big way.  I am going to tell you, I could go on reading the words of community bankers and credit union leaders and businesses in Montana that support this bill, but the bottom line is this: Folks sent us to the Senate to do something to help out the folks we represent. For too long, this body has been dragged into the mud, and as a result, we have had partisan and zero-sum policies and zero-sum politics. Dysfunction has kept this Congress from doing its job, and part of that job is to fine-tune laws to ensure that regulation fits the risk.  Enough is enough already. We must do something. And I am proud to work with 13 Republicans, 12 Democrats, and 1 Independent who worked so hard to compromise on this bill that I think works very well for rural The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act is a jobs bill, and it is a much needed solution for the folks who power our local economies. I look forward to this week's debate.  It is encouraging to see that the Senate is back here doing the job we were sent here to do. It is encouraging that we have a bill here that has gone through the process to gather public input, gather bipartisan support, and it is now on the floor so that we can debate it. I look forward to that debate, and I hope that debate is based on the facts.  I want to say one more thing before I yield the floor. We would not be here today without Chairman Chairman Crapo has done a fine job getting everybody's opinion, respecting everybody's opinion, and walking that line to allow for negotiations and having a good bill as the final product. I don't know what is going to be in the final managers' package, but I hope it doesn't change this bill dramatically because I think this bill really fits the needs of our economy, especially in rural America right now.  With that, I would just say, look, we have some work to do. Hopefully we can do it in a timely fashion and get this bill off to the Hopefully the House doesn't screw it up and we can get it to the President's desk for his signature.  I yield the floor.

This support would also provide for      such necessities as counseling, extra/co-curricular      activities, and mental health supports that are critical to      help students engage in learning.       We must support and value inclusive and safe high-quality      public schools where children learn to think critically,      problem solve and build relationships. We must support an      environment where all students can succeed beginning in the      earliest years, regardless of their zip code, the color of      their skin, native language, disability, gender/gender      identity, immigration status, religion, or social standing.

287,topic-id,441,"Mr.President, I, too, want to recognize and say to Senator Portman, who has been a leading voice in the Senate in the fight against human trafficking, what a great job he has done getting us to this point. This was a long, multimonth, as he said, 2-year effort. Senator Portman has been absolutely relentless in pushing and driving this process forward. I commend him for his important work, which will culminate today, I certainly hope, with a big bipartisan vote in support of the legislation in front of us.  I also commend the bipartisan group of Senators who worked hard to draft the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, which includes Senator Blumenthal, whom we will hear from in just a moment; Senators McCaskill, Cornyn, and Heitkamp; and as Senator Portman so very appropriately pointed out, Senator McCain, who has been a passionate advocate for addressing this issue for so many years too. We wish he could be here to participate and vote for passage of this legislation, but we know his work over the years has played an incredibly important role in getting us to where we are today.  This group also helped lead the effort to conduct important investigatory oversight that has helped us to get to the point where we are today.  Last year, as Senator Portman pointed out, I chaired a Commerce Committee hearing on his bill, where we heard testimony from experts on both sides of the issue. We listened carefully to what our witnesses had to say. After the hearing, we worked together to make some targeted changes to the legislation. The bill that ultimately advanced from our committee enjoyed, as Senator Portman pointed out, solid support from the internet industry. It passed the Senate Commerce Committee unanimously.  The bill is strongly supported by Members of both parties. It has racked up lots of bipartisan support: 68 out of 100 Senators are now cosponsors of this bill. The bill is supported by the White House, so we know that as soon as it leaves the Senate, it will land on the President's desk, where it will be signed into law.  It is supported by law enforcement organizations, organizations that fight sex trafficking, and by faith-based organizations.  At our Commerce Committee hearing, we also heard powerful testimony from Yvonne Ambrose, whose daughter Desiree Robinson was sexually trafficked repeatedly before being murdered. Desiree was just 16 years old, a bright and loving girl who dreamed of becoming a doctor in the Air Instead, she was raped and murdered by a man twice her age who had sought her for sex after seeing her advertised on an internet site.

972,topic-id,890,"Mr.President, the steady stream of good news for American workers continues. Just take a look at the headlines:  ``Craft brewers putting tax savings toward expansions and new jobs.'' That is one headline.  ``Grocery chain investing in employees and brand after tax reform.''  ``Quad/Graphics to give $22 million in stock to employees.''  ``Entergy Arkansas files plan to pass corporate tax cuts to customers.''  ``Taco John's International Shares Tax Reform Benefits With Employees And Surrounding Communities.''  ``Largest Health Insurer in New Jersey Says It Will Use Tax Refunds for Members.''  ``Tax reform payday: Kid's clothing giant Carter's giving bonuses, boosting retirement funds.''  ``Tax reform positive for farmers, ranchers.''  ``Express scripts giving employee bonuses averaging $1,200 following impact from tax law.''  ``Franklin Savings Bank to Give Employees $1,000 Bonus; Cites New Tax Reform.''  ``Sprouts plans to invest tax reform savings in employee programs.''  ``First Horizon announces minimum pay level increase.''  ``NC Blue Cross: Tax cut will hold down rate increases, workers to get $1,000 bonuses.''  ``Hormel to give employees stock shares, increase wages.''  I could keep reading. These are all headlines--headlines from the past 2 weeks that have come from news organizations around the country, highlighting the ways in which tax reform is benefiting American workers.  Businesses large and small are seeing the benefits of tax reform, and they are passing them on. More than 400 companies, and counting, have announced good news for American workers, from wage increases to increased retirement benefits. Utility companies in at least 39 States are passing tax savings on to consumers.  CNBC reports that small business confidence has hit a record high in 2018, driven by small business owners' optimism about the new tax law. In other words, tax reform is working exactly the way it was supposed to. It is putting more money into Americans' pockets and giving them access to new jobs, higher wages, and increased opportunity.  I don't need to tell anyone that Americans had a tough time during the last administration or that our economy had stagnated. All you have to do is look at the numbers. A chief priority of the Republican majority of this Congress has been turning things around for American families, and that is why we took up tax reform.  The Tax Code might not be the first thing people think of when they think of economic prosperity, but it actually plays a key role in determining the success of individual families and of our economy as a whole.  The more money the Federal Government takes from you in taxes, the less money you have to save or pay bills or buy a house or repair your car. The more money a business has to give to the Federal Government, the less money it has to grow the business and invest in its workers. If businesses are struggling to grow and succeed, that is a big problem for American workers.  In order for American workers to thrive, American businesses have to thrive. It is pretty hard for a small[[Page S1350]]business to hire a new worker or to raise wages if the owner can barely pay the tax bill.  It is unlikely that an American company is going to have a lot of spare cash for investing in its workforce if it is struggling to compete with foreign companies that are paying far less in taxes. And it is unlikely that America's global companies are going to focus on reinvesting in the United States if they face a tax penalty for bringing foreign earnings back home.  When it came time to draft a tax reform bill, Republicans knew that the bill had to do two things. First, it had to lower the tax burden on American families and put more money in Americans' pockets right away, and it had to create the kind of economy that would give American families access to security and prosperity for the long term.  To achieve the first goal, we lowered tax rates across the board for American families. We nearly doubled the standard deduction, and we doubled the child tax credit.  To meet the second goal, we lowered our Nation's massive corporate tax rate, which, until January 1, was the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. We lowered tax rates across the board for owners of small and medium-sized businesses, farms, and ranches. We expanded the ability of business owners to recover investments they make in their businesses, which will free up cash so that they can reinvest in their operations and their workers. We brought the U.international tax system into the 21st century by replacing our outdated worldwide system with a modernized territorial tax system so that American businesses are not operating at a disadvantage next to their foreign counterparts. It is working.  In less than 3 months, we have seen lower tax burdens for American families, pay increases, bonuses, new jobs, increased investment in the American economy, better employee benefits, and other kinds of benefits, such as lower utility bills. All of that means more money in Americans' pockets. It means more money to put toward a child's education, more money to save for a house or a car, and more money to save for retirement.  Tax reform is accomplishing our goal of making life better for American families, and the benefits have just begun.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-06-pt1-PgS1348-2.txt,1534,BLOCKING REGULATORY INTERFERENCE FROM CLOSING KILNS ACT OF 2017,2018.0,6.0,March

653,topic-id,641,"Mr.President, reserving the right to object, first, I thank Senator Durbin for 17 years of work on this issue and for highlighting the reality that there are so many people who came here through the decisions of their parents--not decisions of their own. I, for one, believe they deserve a path to citizenship.  I felt so strongly about it that I did something I don't believe any Republican-only bill has ever done before. I filed a bill, along with Senator[[Page S1918]]Lankford, to do just that--to provide a path to citizenship not only to the 690,000 who had enrolled in the DACA Program but to some 1.2 million.  I believe we need to come up with a solution to this problem, and I thank Senator Durbin for his dogged tenacity on this issue. I believe that if we continue to focus on it, we will succeed.  I just need to set a few facts straight. I know the majority leader is in the Chamber, and I will keep my comments brief.  I was in that January 9 meeting as well. In the January 9 meeting, we had an extraordinary meeting, and most of it was on tape. But the reality is, in the January 9 meeting, we walked away with an understanding that there were four pillars on which we were going to build a bipartisan bill. The President looked to the whips in the minority and the majority, and he said: You guys get together, produce a bipartisan bill, and I will support it.  The goal was to go out and have everybody get together with the diverse interests that were represented in the room and come up with that bipartisan bill. We have to talk about ``bipartisan.'' A bipartisan bill is not a bill that gets just Republicans and Democrats on it. A bipartisan bill is a bill that gets up to 60--at least 60--Republicans and Democrats on it. About a month ago, we came to the floor and had four bills. There was no open debate. It was just an up-or-down vote. That is why it failed. It also failed when there were supermajorities, when President Obama was in place, when not a single Republican vote was necessary. That is why President Obama issued the DACA Executive order.  President Trump did not create this problem. It was the inaction of Congress and even a Democratic-controlled Presidency and supermajority-controlled Congress that couldn't solve this problem for whatever reason.  On the bill that we had, we had three Democrats vote. I guess I could argue that 39 votes were That was a bipartisan bill, but it was a bill that didn't get 60 votes.  I hope we will continue to work on this issue so that we can provide certainty to the DACA population. It is not too late to do it. I think about the Dreamers every single day. They deserve a path to citizenship. The President deserves to be able to look the American people in the face and say he secured the border and made the homeland safer. I think we can work on some of the legal immigration issues that can actually get this solved.  Senator Durbin, I look forward to working with you, and let this be the Congress where we actually solve the problem.

1035,topic-id,1227,"Mr.President, I had not planned on talking about the bill we have before us, 2155, but the other day I was listening to another Member speak, and this Member was talking about how this bill could threaten and possibly increase the predatory practices of people who had mobile home loans.  As a person who had a mobile home loan and somebody who lived in a mobile home park, I thought I would try to speak maybe about the practical easing--what we are trying to accomplish with this bill. The truth is, I would go further on regulatory tailoring than we have. We didn't because we wanted bipartisan agreement on this bill, which we have.  As a matter of fact, I thank the members on the Banking Committee who joined with me and other members to make sure we kept the bill tailored enough so we had bipartisan support.  On mobile homes--we get out here in the Senate, and we talk about facts and figures. I can talk about the fact that half of my community banks have ceased to exist in North Carolina since the crisis. I can talk about a number of people I speak with who can't get loans, but what I thought I would talk about is my own personal experience as a 16-year-old, 17-year-old kid living in a trailer park working with my father.  He would do maintenance work. If a house caught on fire or there was some sort of insurance damage, he would work with the insurance companies to actually do repair work, and I was his handyman when we would do these projects. We did not have a whole lot of money. My father didn't have a lot of cash on hand, so the way we did it is, when you had this insurance job, you bid on the insurance job. You knew how much money you would make at the end. Then you go to a bank and get what is called a 90-day note. Most of these projects were about 60- to 90-day projects, and you would go to a banker whom you had built a relationship with, and you would ask them to trust you to get this project done. You would show them the project you were doing, and he would underwrite a loan that you had to pay back in 90 days. That is why they called it a 90-day note.  Today, in the postcrisis world, that virtually never happens. Today, we don't have community banks and personal banking relationships that people can rely on to get access to capital. Even worse, with all the community banks and smaller banks consolidating, ceasing to exist, there are entire areas of North Carolina--a lot of people think North Carolina is an urban The fact is, about half our population, about 5 million people, live in rural areas. They have been hardest hit by the consolidation of banks and the ceasing to exist of these sort of lending institutions out in communities like the community I lived in when I was 17 years old. They are not getting the money they need to make ends meet.  What this bill is trying to do is recognize that, of course, after the financial crisis, there was a regulatory exposure we needed to address. The problem is, we simply went too far or at least with the passing of time we now know we can claw back those regulations on certain banks--particularly community and regional banks. That is all this bill is intended to do.  As a matter of fact, this bill allows the regulators to go back after those banks that are under the $250 billion threshold if they determine that the practices they are involved in are particularly problematic or may have a systemic impact on the financial system as a whole.  What we are trying to do is make sure we start seeing community banks pop up in rural areas like the place I lived in outside of Nashville, TN, where bankers could work with people and give them the resources they need to pay their bills. Even as late as just a couple of years ago--we have some folks who are speaking against the bill who said it was important for us to advance these sorts of changes. As a matter of fact, one Member said: ``It is important we advance this conversation to ensure that prudential regulations for regional banks are crafted appropriately.'' That is what this bill does.  Another Member or maybe the same Member said: ``We all agree that regional banks are not systemically important.'' Regional banks are the bigger banks. They would be like BB&T or Fifth Third  They are not systemically important. Well, then, I guess we can all agree that the community banks and smaller banks aren't. That is what this bill is about, some of the midsized regional banks and community banks. We said we need to tailor it, and that is what this bipartisan bill does.  Another Member said: ``I continue to believe we will not be successful in providing regulatory relief to institutions of any size if we don't have broad, bipartisan consensus.'' That is what this bill has.  We always talk about the polar environment here and how we can get nothing done. This is a bill that has had members of the Committee on Banking, on which I serve, join together to make sure that all we advanced out of the committee was a bipartisan consensus for regulatory relief that allows cash to flow to people who need it--community banks, regional banks that have a more intimate relationship with people who need access to capital. That is what this bill does. For the life of me, I can't understand why we can't all agree.  You have these discussions here where it sounds like we are doing some big-bank relief--not at all. I have a couple of large banking institutions in North Carolina, and they are going to have to continue to submit 60,000-page, 100,000-page stress tests and CCAR reports to make sure they don't create a[[Page S1542]]systemic threat. This bill doesn't touch that.  What this bill touches is a part of the ecosystem that is suffering. What this bill does is reduce the regulatory burden so that guy who existed back in the midseventies who would give my dad a 90-day note can now do it and not have to say no because they simply can't afford to do it either because it affects their portfolio or because they are spending so much money on regulatory relief that they have to go after the bigger loans. It is the people at my level at that time back in the seventies who suffer.  This is a bipartisan bill, it is a responsible bill, and it is a bill that is going to provide much needed relief.  I thank the Members on both sides of the aisle who recognize that this is a prudent bill, that it is measured. I thank Chairman Crapo for all the great work he has done to live up to his commitment to the Members on the other side of the aisle to keep this tailored and to do exactly what we said we were going to do.

The urban areas have realized economic recovery since 2008, while the more rural communities have been slower to find sustained economic growth. Essential to these areas and their ability to be able to recover, a topic that I speak frequently on, is access to credit.  As Treasury's report to the President in June of 2017 notes: Regulations on capital, liquidity, and leverage requirements, as well as regulatory parameters that guide loan underwriting, have undermined the ability of financial institutions to deliver attractively priced credit in sufficient quantity to meet the needs of the economy.                              {time}  1300  In other words, our community financial institutions have lost access to the tools that they need to be able to help their communities recover as they have struggled to comply with regulations intended for the largest institutions. Mr.Speaker, it is our local communities, our small businesses, our first-time home buyers, and our working families who suffer the consequences from these regulations.  Mr.Speaker, let me give you one example of what unbridled regulation does and how it impacts families trying to be able to live that American  I have an example of a credit union in my home State of Colorado that had to stop offering home equity lines of credit to its members because the cost of keeping the forms in compliance with Federal regulation exceeded the income generated by the program. In other words, regulation priced this credit union out of a critical market and at a time when the rural environment the credit union serves needed access to credit most.  Fortunately, Mr.Loudermilk's legislation being considered here today will take important steps to require regulators to consider the institution's size and risk profile as they evaluate the necessity and effectiveness of regulatory rulemaking under the self-review mandated to them by the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Importantly, Mr.Loudermilk's legislation will also expand the EGRPRA process to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the National Credit Union Administration, encouraging the tailoring of regulations across the regulatory spectrum.  This legislation takes steps to encourage regulators to allow small institutions adequate leeway to exercise reasonably constructed consumer lending regimes to make sure consumers have the broadest array of choices and that institutions can appropriately navigate the compliance landscape.  Mr.Speaker, by requiring regulators to more frequently review and tailor regulations, this bill will help put Main Street back on the path to prosperity and help to end the tale of two economies in Colorado and throughout the Making these adjustments will help community banks and credit unions once again be able to meet the needs of their neighbors and encourage our businesses to be able to grow.

864,topic-id,465,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.1119, the Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving the Environment, or SENSE,  The SENSE Act continues the theme of the floor this week, giving unnecessary preferences to a handful of special interests at the expense of clean air and people's health.  The SENSE Act would weaken requirements of EPA's Mercury and Air Toxic Standards, or MATS, for power plants that burn waste coal by enabling a weaker compliance option for hydrochloric acid and sulfur dioxide[[Page H1482]]emissions. To make matters worse, the bill prevents EPA from strengthening these standards for waste coal pants in the future even if pollution control technologies become significantly better or less expensive.  I think we are all proud of the record of the Clean Air As a nation, we have made significant progress since the 1970s, reducing air pollution while growing our economy.  This bill is against the spirit of the Clean Air Act and the bipartisan amendments that have followed. We should not lock in an insufficient standard when progress is still possible.  Polluters should be pushed to do better, especially when comparable facilities are meeting those given standards; but instead, these power plant owners would prefer to get special treatment and a pathway for meeting the weaker standards for many, many years to come. All the while, these plants will produce harmful air pollution.  This is not only dangerous but unnecessary. The health risks of these pollutants are well documented, and it is, in fact, possible for waste coal plants to meet EPA's A number of waste coal units have achieved the standards, and pollution control technologies exist that would enable noncompliant facilities to meet them, too.  EPA's MATS have already been examined by the courts, which would not grant an exclusion for waste coal utilities. The courts did not agree with waste coal plant owners that these standards were impossible to meet.  EPA established that 8 out of 19 waste coal units nationwide could meet the rules' acid gas standard or alternative sulfur dioxide standard already. So now those companies are coming to Congress to circumvent the court process.  Last year, every Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee opposed this bill. Those members understood that this bill is simply not fair. It picks winners and losers in States with waste coal plants, it disadvantages traditional coal-fired power generators, and it will allow for more hazardous air pollution. That isn't a good deal for the power generators that are already compliant with the standards, and it is a terrible deal for the people who have to live with more dangerous air pollution.

878,topic-id,579,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  I have no other speakers. I just would make mention that some 18 groups that are public interest groups have joined together in a letter opposing this legislation, suggesting and indicating strongly that it pits waste coal-burning plants against coal-burning plants, that it creates a public health situation that is an outcome that is negative for our constituents, and it basically cites that the courts have reviewed some of the requests made earlier and denied those requests because they felt that technology was available.  I include the letter in the                                                    March 6, 2018.       Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members,      the undersigned organizations urge you to oppose the amended      Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving the Environment Act, or      SENSE Act (H.1119). This bill would weaken health      safeguards for Americans on behalf of special interest groups      and result in more toxic air pollution and health hazards.       The SENSE Act would provide a giveaway to power plants that      burn waste coal under EPA's Mercury and Air Toxics Standards      (MATS). The bill favors waste coal-burning power plants at      the expense of other in-state coal power plants and the      public through blunt political favoritism.[[Page H1486]]       Specifically, the SENSE Act would permanently exempt power      plants that burn waste coal from having to meet certain      pollution limits. Power plants, including waste coal plants,      are already meeting these standards--passing this bill would      be a free giveaway to polluters, and nothing more.       And the courts agree.       When waste coal plant owners filed lawsuits challenging the      MATS standards in the first place, they claimed it was      ``virtually impossible'' to meet the acid gas and sulfur      dioxide limits set in The court rejected the plants'      arguments.       The judges pointed to clear evidence that waste coal plants      already were meeting these limits. EPA had evidence      demonstrating that 8 out of 19 waste coal units nationwide      already could meet the rule's acid gas standard or      alternative sulfur dioxide standard. In fact, the court noted      that not only were the plants meeting these supposedly      ``impossible'' standards, but some of these plants were      ``among the best performers'' in achieving hydrogen chloride      reductions among all coal-burning units under the rule.''       Doomsday claims to justify this bill are just that. Waste      coal plants have already had more time than other power      plants to come into compliance with Rewarding laggards      who continue to drag their feet, even after already getting      special treatment, would undermine all pollution reduction      programs and disincentivize compliance.       Were this bill to become law, the result will be dirtier      air for communities. Indeed, the SENSE Act drags health      standards down to the level of the laggards--resulting in      greater harms for Americans living in states with waste coal      plants as well as in their downwind neighboring states. This      bill is not only bad policy--it is unjustified. It favors the      very dirtiest of polluting facilities at the expense of      Americans, air quality, and responsible power plants who have      already taken steps to clean up their air pollution. Worst of      all, it will lead to greater toxic pollution and health harms      to We urge you to oppose the SENSE           Sincerely,         Center for Biological Diversity; Clean Water Action;            Climate Hawks Vote; Earthjustice; Environment America;            Environmental Defense Fund; Friends of the Earth;            GreenLatinos; Hip Hop Caucus; Interfaith Power & Light;            League of Conservation Voters; Moms Clean Air Force;            National Parks Conservation Association; Natural            Resources Defense Council; Power Shift Network; Public            Citizen; Sierra Club; Southern Environmental Law             ",CREC-2018-03-08-pt1-PgH1480-6.txt,1942,COMMONSENSE VALUES,2018.0,8.0,March
879,topic-id,155,"Madam Speaker, much like the bill considered by the House yesterday, the SENSE Act would provide so-called relief to a handful of companies by shifting the burdens of pollution onto the public. Congress should not be in the business of putting the profits of polluters before the health of our constituents.  The reality is, by allowing these plants to pollute more, we would be doing just that. It will result in greater harm to Americans living in States with waste coal plants as well as in their downwind neighboring States, such as my home State of New  EPA's MATS are achievable and provide considerable health benefits. Why shouldn't waste coal plants have to comply? The courts think they should. We shouldn't have to choose between a giveaway to a couple of special interests over clean air.

1806,topic-id,502,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.1917, the Blocking Regulatory Interference from Closing Kilns, or BRICK,  EPA issued the Brick and Clay MACT rule in 2015, which sets maximum achievable control technology based on what is already being achieved at similar facilities.  Section 2 of the BRICK Act seeks to delay compliance with the Brick and Clay MACT until ``judgment becomes final, and no longer subject to further appeal or review.''  This would incentivize frivolous litigation simply to put off having to comply with the rule.  Courts already have the ability to issue a stay of any compliance dates in a final rule. Congress should not insert itself into the judicial process.  The courts have regularly used this process. There is no reason for Congress to override it.  To date, no one has petitioned the court to stay the Brick and Clay MACT rule.  Section 3 of H.1917 incorporates another bill reported out of the Energy and Commerce Committee, H.453, the Relief from New Source Performance Standards  This section, Mr.Speaker, delays implementation of the EPA's step 2 emission standards for three categories of wood-fueled heaters.  EPA finalized the rule in 2015. Under the rule, manufacturers have until 2020 to comply with the new standards. This bill would delay the standards until 2023.  Much like the Brick MACT, these standards are achievable.  In a recent list of devices certified under the 2015 standard, 171 devices report certified emission levels that already meet the 2020 standards.  These 2020-compliant products are both cleaner and more efficient, generating more heat per unit of wood burned and making them less expensive to operate.  By delaying these standards, Congress is unfairly punishing companies that made investments to produce cleaner, more efficient products by the original deadline.  Since these appliances typically last for 25 years or more once installed, delaying this standard will result in decades of additional pollution in and around people's homes.  The original bill, H.453, was opposed by State attorneys general of New York, Maryland, Massachusetts, Oregon, Rhode Island, and the Puget Sound Clean Air  In a letter from December 12, these officials pointed out that EPA estimated the net benefits of implementing the rule at more than 100 times the costs.[[Page H1460]]  Wood smoke contains considerable amounts of fine particle pollution, carbon monoxide, and other toxic pollutants.  In my home State of New York, less than 2 percent of residents heat their homes with wood, but residential wood heating accounts for 41 percent of the State's particulate emissions.                              {time}  1400  Because the emissions are released close to ground level and homes, there is significant human exposure, which is why this bill is also opposed by a number of public health and medical organizations.  The BRICK Act gives special treatment to a couple of industries by shifting the health and financial burdens of pollution on to the public. I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill, Mr.Speaker, and I reserve the balance of my time.

1809,topic-id,313,"Mr.Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr.McNerney).  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend, the ranking member, and I thank the chairman for his work on this, but I am going to rise in opposition to H.1917, the BRICK  This bill will delay the implementation of the EPA's final Brick and Structural Clay Products rule and the final Clay Ceramic Manufacturing rule by extending all compliance deadlines based on pending judicial review.  So what does that mean? That means it will delay implementation until judgment becomes final and not subject to review or appeal. This is a blanket extension that could have lasting negative impacts on the public's health.  Brick and clay plants, if unregulated, can be major sources of toxic air pollutants like hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen chloride, and hazardous metals, pollutants that are associated with a variety of acute and chronic health effects, including cancer. It is estimated that the final Brick and Clay MACT rule will reduce nationwide air toxics by approximately 375 tons per year.  Last Friday, the OMB issued a report showing that regulations have high benefit and low cost. The aggregate benefits of Federal regulations is between $219 billion and $695 billion; whereas, the aggregate costs are $59 billion to $88 billion. Many regulations spur innovation that benefit the economy as well as human health.  Now, it is no surprise to me that this administration and the Republicans are targeting air pollution regulations. The OMB noted that EPA rules ``account for over 80 percent of the monetized benefits and over 70 percent of the monetized costs'' of Federal regulation between 2006 and 2016.  Since regulations protect human health and safety and have more benefits than costs for industry, I stand in opposition to bills like this one that seek to undermine these protections. I ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.1917.  ",CREC-2018-03-07-pt1-PgH1458.txt,1942,GUN SAFETY,2018.0,7.0,March

Mr.Mr.Speaker, every American--in fact, every human being--has the right to breathe clean air. If this Congress trammels that right in the name of corporate profits, that choice is not just an abstract moral failure, it is a concrete public health disaster, one that will cause needless suffering, especially for our most vulnerable friends and neighbors.  The regulations this bill seeks to impede are long overdue. The earliest form of the Brick and Clay rule dates back to 2003. That was more than 14 years ago, and now some of my friends in the majority are seeking even longer delays.  We have been putting pollutants into our air and we can never unring that bell, but we can do better moving forward, and we need to make those improvements sooner rather than later.  We all know that justice delayed is justice denied. Justice has already been delayed by more than a decade. We can measure that cost.  The Brick and Clay rule, in its current form, would reduce the amount of toxins in our air by hundreds of tons per year. If we delay the rule another[[Page H1461]]year, or 2 years or longer, all of our families, all of our constituents are going to be breathing dirtier and more dangerous air.

12,topic-id,1029,"Mr.President, last Wednesday, in Arizona, at the Grand Canyon, a number of us gathered to honor Mo Udall and John McCain and their friendship and partnership, which made America a lot better.  For months, John was looking forward to this gathering. He mentioned it to me several times last year. He was very excited. You could kind of see the sparkle in his eyes, but he was unable to attend because of the battle he is fighting. Looking back, the friendship between Mo and John was remarkable--how different they were but how well they got along.  In 1982, Arizona could not have elected two more different Members to the U.House of Mo Udall was elected to a 12th term. A third-generation Arizonan, Mo was a tall, lanky, Lincolnesque, one-eyed Mormon who tried to cheat his way into serving in World War II; self-effacing and humorous, a liberal Democrat in a conservative State who championed the environment and Native Americans and one of the most powerful and respected Members of the House, who chaired the Interior Committee critical to Arizona's welfare.  And John McCain, an easterner and newcomer to Phoenix, having arrived only 2 years before running for Congress; a carpetbagger, some said; a stocky, handsome son and grandson of four-star Navy admirals who easily made his way into the U.Naval Academy, only to graduate 894 out of 899 in his class, due to his extreme rebelliousness. John is a man self-described as a ``freshman right-wing Nazi'' when he entered Congress but as a naval officer who could have been freed from imprisonment as a POW in Vietnam, yet refused to leave his men behind and instead suffered unimaginable torture and pain for over 5 years.  Despite his novice as an Arizona politician, John McCain knew enough to beg to secure a place on the Interior At that point, Mo's decency and John's courage met. While John was new to Arizona politics and, by his own admission, could not tell a copper mine from a cotton field, he had promise, being elected president of his minority Republican class.  Mo graciously, and with no political gain in sight that Mo could see, took John under his generous, broad wing. Mo taught John the power of consensus and bipartisanship, and, in turn, John had the guts to buck his own party. Together, they forged a remarkable partnership.  Mo is marked by graciousness, humility, and humor; John by bombasity, independence, and courage. They were a perfect match. They sided together to protect the Grand They sided together to protect Arizona wilderness. They sided together to improve the lives of our first They sided together to upend the campaign finance system, to try to make sure politicians are beholden to their constituents, not to special interests.  John took these positions in sharp contrast to his party. After Mo retired from the House and John had entered the Senate, John continued to take fearless positions. He championed immigration reform. He supports curbing methane emissions.  Many Americans will never forget--and I was standing right about here when this happened--when, on July 28, 2017, John McCain stepped into the well of the Senate and gave an unexpected thumbs down to his party's desperate attempt to repeal the Affordable Care  In 1982, Mo and John appeared to be worlds apart--Arizona politicians representing liberal Tucson and conservative Phoenix, who would necessarily be at odds, yet they shared so much. Both stood by their principles, but both believed in working across the aisle to get things done for the American people. Both put country over personal ambition, fame, and fortune. Both were men of integrity, and both were courageous. All of us can learn from their duty to country over selves, their commitment to working for all Americans, and their dedication to working with the party across the aisle to reach consensus.  Morris King Udall and John Sidney McCain III were unlikely political allies and even more unlikely friends, but they were both, and both are true American heroes.  Heroism is not born of words and bravado and bragging; heroism is born of silent deeds that help others. Mo and John accomplished much by deed. Both are true Arizonans, true Americans, and true heroes.  I am privileged to have known both men--to have grown up with Uncle Mo, to have campaigned with him, and to have shared his stories and stolen his jokes and to have served in the Senate and to serve with John  John and I have worked together on many issues. We have traveled internationally.

His wonderful wife Cindy, a strong and talented woman in her own right, was at his side and working to make sure things were shipshape at the ranch. What a unique and loving partnership.

1416,topic-id,1604,"I thank the Presiding Officer for recognizing me.  Mr.President, I know the Presiding Officer hasn't been here the whole time, but many Senators have been speaking about climate change. We see in the Presiding Officer's State, in Glacier National Park--which I think kind of tells it all--a national park created around glaciers, and they are disappearing rapidly.  I come to the floor, first of all, to thank Sheldon Whitehouse for his remarkable leadership on the issue of climate change. His weekly wake-up call speeches have inspired a lot of us. Articles have covered his effort on this. This one is titled, ``A Climate `Wake Up' for the 200th Time.'' He has been down here religiously taking on this issue.  In this article, a major leader in the environmental movement said about Sheldon's speeches, ``[His] speeches have been critically important in drawing attention to the need for climate action.'' She also said, ``Demand for climate action is only growing, and certainly we give him credit for his leadership in that effort.'' Very true.  I remember traveling with Sheldon Whitehouse to Paris, when all of us were very much enthused to see the world come together and sign the Paris climate agreement. We were all very excited. This effort had been going on for 40 years, and here the countries in the world were finally getting together. I watched Sheldon making those arguments over there. He argued his case persuasively, and he wins converts easily. So we all are here to thank him for his leadership.  In particular, I would also like to talk about climate change, its impact on the Southwest, and where we are headed in my home State of New Mexico and the Greater Climate change is here and now. I want to talk about that impact in the Southwest, which is severe. My home State of New Mexico is right in the bull's-eye.  Our Nation and our Earth cannot afford for us to sit back and do nothing for the next 3 years, but this is precisely what is happening under this administration and this Our executive and legislative branches are not only sitting on their hands in the face of climate change disruption and devastation; they are aggressively halting all progress we are making.  I was so discouraged when I saw the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency take down a climate change website that had gone from a Republican administration to a Democratic administration. I think it had been going on for almost 10 years. This was covered in the Washington Administrator Pruitt, on taking office, took it down and said: We are going to update it. Here we are, more than a year, and if you try to look at that website, it just says: We are in the process of updating it. I don't think we are ever going to see it again, would be my guess.  Let's look at some of the reasons and how the progress is being halted here. There are a number of reasons for this, but I think the biggest and most insidious is money--billions of dollars in campaign contributions.  The President and congressional majority are delaying, suspending, and stopping policies and programs that combat climate change because of the dark money in politics. Oil and gas, coal, power companies, and other special interests feed their campaign and PAC coffers while the clear public interest is ignored. We must reform our campaign finance system or our climate and the American people will pay a greater and greater price.  Sheldon Whitehouse has made a contribution there with his book, ``Captured,'' where he talks about this dark money indepth. That is another piece of scholarship that really adds to what is happening on this campaign finance front.  While the President, his EPA Administrator, and his Interior Secretary are openly hostile to climate change science, career government scientists and professionals are still hard at work doing their jobs evaluating climate impacts.  Last November, the U.Global Change Research Program, consisting of 13 Federal agencies, issued volume I of the ``Fourth National Climate Assessment.'' It is the most authoritative Federal Government resource on climate change.  It concludes, ``This period is now the warmest in the history of modern civilization'' with ``record-breaking, climate-related weather extremes,'' and human activities--especially greenhouse gas emissions--are the ``extremely likely'' ``dominant cause.'' A pretty strong statement from the scientists.[[Page S1678]]  With climate change, the Southwest is expected to get hotter and much drier, especially in the southern half of the region. In the last 18 years, New Mexico has seen one reprieve from drought, and the trend is unmistakable. We are seeing less snowpack, earlier melting, and less runoff. Even when we do get snow, new research shows we are getting less runoff from it. Our scarce water resources are even more strained.  Here is a drought map of New Mexico from just last week, March 6. Virtually the entire State faces drier conditions. We can see it here, talking about the northern part of the State with extreme drought, most of the middle and northern part of the State in severe drought, and then the southern part of the State in moderate drought. Virtually, the entire State of New Mexico is in a very serious drought situation.  Some experts are saying we need to stop thinking about this phenomenon as a drought but instead as a dry region becoming permanently drier. This is a direct threat to our way of life in New Mexico and the  Elephant Butte Reservoir is our biggest reservoir in New It was built close to 100 years ago for flood control and irrigation. Its supply comes from the Rio Grande, our largest river in New Mexico and, as we know, a 1,900-mile river that flows through several It is a border for close to 1,000 miles or more, and it flows into the Gulf of Mexico, but for the decade ending 2010, on the Rio Grande, flows in the Rio Grande decreased 23 percent--almost one-quarter--from the 20th century average.  Here are photos of Elephant Butte Reservoir from 1994 and 2013. These photos were taken from a satellite. This top photo is from 1994, and we can see a remarkable reservoir and how deep and extended that reservoir is. Now we jump forward about 20 years, and here is Elephant Butte Reservoir in 2013. The picture says a thousand words: The reservoir is rapidly, rapidly disappearing. We can see the dramatic decrease in supply over that short time. Our farmers and ranchers depend on this supply, and they are struggling. This year, the snowpack in the Upper Rio Grande is half of what it should be, and that will force the reservoir even lower.  Across the Southwest, the average annual temperature has increased about 1.5 degrees The last decade, from 2001 to 2010, was the warmest in over a century. Now, New Mexico is really feeling the heat. We are the sixth fastest warming State in the Since 1970, our average annual temperature increased about 0.6 degrees per decade--or about 2.7 degrees over 45 years--and it is not over. Average annual temperatures are projected to rise 3.5 to 8.5 degrees by 2100.  Difficult-to-control wildfires have multiplied because of dry conditions killing trees and other vegetation, threatening lives, destroying homes, and costing billions of dollars. New Mexico experienced its largest wildfire in 2012--the Whitewater-Baldy Complex fire--that burned almost 290,000 acres. The fire burned in the southwestern part of the State but caused air pollution hundreds of miles away in Las Cruces to the east and Santa Fe to the northeast.  Agriculture is a mainstay for the Southwest's economy. We produce more than half of the Nation's high-value specialty crops, and crop development is threatened by warming and extreme weather events.  Likewise, another key economic sector--tourism and recreation--is threatened by reduced streamflow and a shorter snow season. Ski Santa Fe used to always open Thanksgiving weekend. That hardly ever happens anymore. Reduced snow and higher temperatures have been an economic disaster for the slopes all over New  The Southwest's 182 federally recognized Tribes are particularly vulnerable to climate changes such as high temperatures, drought, and severe storms. Tribes may lose traditional foods, medicines, and water supplies.  Similarly, our border communities are in greater jeopardy because they don't have the financial resources to protect against climate change impacts. They are vulnerable to health and safety risks like air pollution, erosion, and flooding.  The President and his administration have taken aim at Federal programs that would address all these impacts to my State and the The President unilaterally withdrew from the Paris EPA put the Clean Power Plan on hold. Secretary Zinke has done all he can to halt BLM's methane waste prevention rule. Public lands are open for coal and oil and gas drilling. The President's budget slashed climate science funding. The list goes on and on. This is not what the American people want. They believe science, they understand that human activity is causing climate change, and they want robust policies in response.  Climate change presents the greatest threat our Nation and world now confront. It is the moral test of our age. We will be judged by future generations by how we respond now. We owe it to our children, our grandchildren, and beyond to meet this challenge head-on. I call upon my colleagues across the aisle to listen to the science and the American people and to work with us to take action.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

1076,topic-id,838,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman and my good friend for yielding and for hosting this hour tonight. I look forward to the comments by all my colleagues from Michigan and  Let me just start out by saying a couple of things. I had a great ninth grade teacher, Mr.We learned about how the government worked. You pass a bill in the House and you pass a bill in the I learned later on that the House bill is always better than the But in this case,  John Shimkus and I--and he is going to be a speaker from Illinois a little bit later on this evening--were two conferees on this bill.  I have got to say that, as we debated this bill, there were some elements that were not so good. But at the end of the day, as this bill meshed together, we took the best elements of both the House and the Senate bill and we got a bill that the President was able to sign.  I can remember being trashed left and right back in November and December about what this bill was going to do or not going to do: it wasn't going to provide real tax relief to the working class; companies weren't really going to give bonuses; this was all just going to be bogus arguments.  Now, at the end of the day, 2-plus months since the bill was signed and became enacted, my constituents are finding out good things about the bill. Yes, they are getting real take-home pay increases from the jobs that they do. Yes, they are getting bonuses.  I was at a small, little almost farmers market, multigenerational market down in Niles, Michigan, just north of Notre Dame, Shelton's Farm They have 83 employees. The owners gave every employee there a bonus. I talked to one of them who literally stocks the shelves. He got $600.  He said: You know, Mr.Upton . . .  I said: Call me  He said: This wasn't just crumbs. This made a real difference.  I said: What are you going to do with that $600?  He said: You know, my wife has cancer, and I bought her a new dress.  He was so excited that that increase in the take-home pay was actually going to do some real benefit for him and his family.  I was at a groundbreaking at Pfizer, my largest employer, in Portage, Not only did they announce that they are going to, in the next couple of years, invest $6 billion--that is B as in ``big''--in new facilities here in North America, they also announced that they are going to give $100 million in bonuses for all of their nonexecutive employees. That is real money, and that is thanks to tax reform.  Mr.Walberg talked a little bit about some of the utilities in A little bit earlier today, I was with the chair of Consumers Energy, a very important player; and the chair of DTE Energy as well. Yes, because of the reduction in the corporate tax rates, they are going to pass on those savings, as they want to, to the consumers. In the case of Consumers Energy, they are going to give back $200 million in rate relief to virtually every one of their customers that they serve across the board. That is good news. It has to be approved by the Public Service Commission, but, in fact, that money is going to be there.  So whether it is a small business who is now goin to get a lower rate in that passthrough rate, which means a lot, keeping your deductions on healthcare, seeing the highest corporate rate being reduced to 21 percent--and I remember well that debate that we had between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama back in 2012. In September of 2012, the question was on tax reform, and even Barack Obama said that he would support lowering that corporate tax rate to 25 percent, because we were already at the highest corporate tax rate in the world. That is what this bill did, and thank goodness.  The last point I would make is I was tired of economic growth being at .7 percent or 1 percent. We can do better than that. This bill is now starting to lead the way to see that happen. In fact, the report even this week, I think, is predicting a 3.5 percent growth rate for calendar year 2018.  That is a far cry from where we were just a few years ago. I dare say, in large part, it is due because workers are, in fact, getting more money from their paychecks. We have reduced the corporate rates so companies, instead of having an incentive to go overseas, as they did with my largest employer in one of my counties a few years ago, they now have a reason to come home and invest that money here.  So, Mr.Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman for hosting this hour. I look forward to the other folks' comments tonight.

1074,topic-id,611,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I appreciate the opportunity to talk about the truth.  We heard so much dismissal of the tax cut plan before we passed it. Now that we passed it, not only did we read it beforehand, but rereading it again we are seeing the truth is working out.  As I travel around, Mr.Speaker, the Seventh District of Michigan, optimism about the new tax cuts is hard to miss.  I have people coming up to me at the grocery store, at gas stations, even in church, saying: You know, Congressman, we heard a lot of reports that this wasn't for middle class people, but I saw my paycheck in February and, it is true, I got a raise because the government is taking less out of it.  I have heard from a number of workers excited about their bonuses and pay raises and from businesses that are looking to expand their operations.  Just last week, I toured Lowe's home center in Adrian, Michigan, to visit with their team. Because of the new tax law, their employees are receiving $1,000 bonuses and expanded maternity and parental leave.  I toured Cintas' Lansing operations. The tax cut afforded their employees $1,000 bonuses, and they reported to me that day that they jumped now on a plan that they were holding off, but now they are going to build a $17 million facility to add on to their operations.  We already heard about Fiat Chrysler giving out $2,000 bonuses to all of their workers. They are also moving production of the Ram heavy-duty truck plant back from Mexico to Michigan--I wanted to reiterate that--that is coming home and creating 2,500 new good-paying jobs.  We have also seen announcements from DTE Energy and Consumers Energy, utilities in Michigan and in other States, that their customers can expect to see lower utility bills, thanks to the tax cuts. In fact, they have submitted a request to the PSC for almost $400 million in rate reductions. That is real money.  As Vice President Pence said last week when we welcomed him to the Motor City, tax reform is working for  Here is even more good news: the benefits are just beginning to kick in.  This tax season is the last time taxpayers will have to file under the old and broken Tax  Under the updated Code, individuals and families at every income level will see tax relief.  The standard deduction is nearly doubled to protect more of people's hard-earned income from taxation.                              {time}  1715  The child tax credit is expanded from $1,000 to $2,000 to help with the cost of raising kids.  With these new reforms, the typical middle-income family of four will receive a tax cut of more than $2,000.  On top of that, the law will help small businesses thrive, boost job creation here at home, and make our economy stronger and more competitive, like it ought to be, in the United States and in  For families across Michigan, the new tax cut law means bigger paychecks and more money in their pockets, not in the Federal Government's pockets. And that is where it belongs.  Mr.Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity at any time to put forward truth, but, more importantly, truth that is optimistic, that builds on our people, that builds on letting them do for themselves with the resources they have earned.  Mr.Speaker, I express appreciation to my colleague for holding this ``truth squad'' opportunity again tonight because people need more of that. They need more optimism that comes from truth that impacts them in a growing and positive way, and I am glad to be part of it.

344,topic-id,741,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the patients, the patients who face terminal diagnoses but have exhausted all available known treatment options.  Before us today we have legislation that received 260 bipartisan votes last week; that was nearly 260 votes to increase patient access to investigational drugs through a new pathway.  I want to thank Burgess for his incredible work on our Energy and Commerce Committee to do our due diligence, to take an issue that is important to our citizens and our colleagues and make sure that it has been properly vetted, reviewed, and improved upon from what we got from the  Mr.Speaker, 38 States have right-to-try laws, including my own State of This is something that people want and deserve. Wisconsin will make it number 39 once the bill they have passed gets across Governor Scott Walker's desk.  While the State policies vary, they have a common goal, and that is helping vulnerable patients. President Trump praised the movement during[[Page H1743]]the State of the Union, saying: ``People who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure--I want them to have a chance right here at home.''  I have spoken to the President directly about what we are doing here, and he gave me a shout-out when he was up in New Hampshire the other day about moving this bill forward. We worked closely with the Vice President and his team and with Scott Gottlieb, who is the doctor who heads the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration, to get a really good, thoughtful product before this House, and they support what we are doing here. President Trump also highlighted this bill, as I said, when he was in New  It is important to note that this isn't the first time we have considered this bill. As you may know, last week, we tried to move this on the suspension calendar, never imaging that the Democrats would actually whip against giving dying patients the right to try one of these drugs. We had 32 Democrats support this legislation, and that is why we brought it back under regular order in a rule today.  Now, today, there is an existing process, and you have heard about it--and we looked at this in the committee--for patients to access unapproved drugs. The FDA oversees expanded access, commonly known as compassionate use. This program has been critical in helping patients access experimental drugs. It does work.  Commissioner Gottlieb and the agency should be commended for their continued work to improve the expanded access program for patients. As you have heard from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, this program works, and works effectively, but it doesn't do it all, and that is why this legislation is before us.  To improve upon this successful program, the bill before us today provides liability protections for manufacturers, sponsors, physicians, clinical investigators, and hospitals that participate in the existing expanded access program and the new alternative pathway that we create under this legislation.  This was a very big issue for those who needed to be brought into participation who otherwise might have sat on the sidelines and never made these drugs available. This provision removes one of the biggest hurdles that patients face and that was identified by the Government Accountability Office; it is the biggest hurdle they face in getting access to experimental therapies: manufacturers' hesitancy to participate. That is the hurdle we are trying to overcome today in a safe way.  The bill also creates a new alternative pathway for patients who do not qualify for a clinical trial. This legislation strengthens patient protections with clearer informed consent and adverse event reporting. The bill also ensures the FDA is notified when a patient receives an unapproved drug through the new alternative pathway to ensure proper oversight.  Mr.Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues in the House, and especially Burgess on the Health Subcommittee, but also Representative Brian Fitzpatrick;  Andy Biggs, who is behind me; Morgan Griffith; and our Vice President, Mike I am grateful for their work and for their understanding that our job here in the House is to do our work: to hear from people who are affected or might be affected, to improve upon products, to go through regular order, and to bring this bill to you today.

881,topic-id,311,"Mr.Speaker, ask anyone who lives in or near communities with waste coal piles from abandoned mines and they will tell you that they can be a significant environmental hazard. They can leak acidic water into rivers and streams. They can sometimes catch fire, burn uncontrollably for months and result in both damage and heavy emissions. And they can be an economic drag on any community that has to deal with them.  The good news is that a process exists that can take this byproduct and use it to produce electricity. The result of that process is an environmentally-safe ash that can be used to remediate the land from which the waste coal was taken. It has worked well, and there are numerous examples of contaminated lands and streams being restored because of these coal refuse-to-energy plants.  Given the substantial environmental benefits of coal refuse-to-energy plants, I believe we have an obligation to work to keep them open. That is why I urge support for H.1119, the SENSE  Unfortunately, these plants are at risk of being tripped up by EPA regulations aimed at conventional coal-fired power plants. Specifically, EPA's Mercury and Air Toxics standards did not distinguish between conventional coal-fired plants and these coal refuse-to-energy plants that operate very differently. The EPA's standard as written for one of the targeted compounds, hydrogen chloride, or HCL, would be difficult for these facilities to consistently meet.  The bill before us today, H.1119, the SENSE Act, addresses these concerns and provides an alternative compliance mechanism for HCL that still requires substantial emissions reductions, but one that is achievable for these facilities.  By finding a use for potentially dangerous and damaging coal refuse piles, coal refuse-to-energy plants provide affordable energy and a tremendous environmental benefit. The SENSE Act is commonsense, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill that benefits both consumers and the environment.

1764,topic-id,1237,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I am pleased today that the House of Representatives is taking up an important bill from the House Energy and Commerce It is titled the Repack Airwaves Yielding Better Access for Users of Modern Services Act of 2018, or RAY BAUM'S  I thank our subcommittee chairman, Marsha Blackburn, for her hard work in introducing and moving this legislation forward.  Before I get into the policy side, I want to touch on the meaning behind this bill's title.[[Page H1409]]  H.4986 is a nod to our dear friend, and mine of 30 years, the former staff director of our Energy and Commerce Committee, who recently lost his battle with cancer.  It is a testament of not just Ray's dedication to telecom policy--as you know, he served as public utility commissioner, he chaired the Joint Board with the FCC on communications issues, and was such a policy brain for our committee--but also his ability to work across the aisle and with all levels of government officials. He got good things done for  Years ago, when I became chairman of what was then called the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet, Ray, at my invitation, finally agreed to come back to Washington and work on the committee.  He had served as a State representative and as majority leader of the Oregon He had been chairman of the public utility commission in Oregon and brought a lot to our process as senior policy adviser.  In the years that followed, these issues remained both a priority and a passion for Ray, and I believe and I hope our bipartisan work today reflects admirably the kind of commitment he wanted all of us to share in making good public policy.  By the way, that is Ray right there, for those who didn't know.  The RAY BAUM'S Act reauthorizes the Federal Communications It includes efficiency and transparency reforms for the FCC, and it spurs the development of next generation 5G technologies.  It is good for consumers, and it is good for our Nation's critical telecommunications services.  Importantly, the bill before us today is the product of a bipartisan and bicameral agreement, House and Senate, Republicans and Democrats, including my friend from New Jersey (Mr.Pallone), Senate Commerce Committee chairman Mr.Thune, and the ranking member in the Senate, Bill  Mr.Speaker, we bring you a good product today of sound policy named for a wonderful individual, and I reserve the balance of my time.         Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of            Representatives,                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 2018.     Greg Walden,     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington,       Dear Chairman Walden: I write concerning H.4986, RAY      BAUM'S Act of 2018. This legislation includes matters that      fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on      Transportation and       I recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this      legislation before the House of Representatives in an      expeditious manner, and accordingly, the Committee on      Transportation and Infrastructure will forego action on the      bill. However, this is conditional on our mutual      understanding that foregoing consideration of the bill does      not prejudice the Committee with respect to the appointment      of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the      subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation      that fall within the Committee's Rule X jurisdiction.      Further, this is conditional on our understanding that      mutually agreed upon changes to the legislation will be      incorporated into the bill prior to floor consideration.      Lastly, should a conference on the bill be necessary, I      request your support for the appointment of conferees from      the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure during any      House-Senate conference convened on this or related      legislation.

1796,topic-id,604,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I want to thank my friend from New Jersey for his good work on this legislation and his kind words in memory of our mutual friend, Ray  I think it would be appropriate, as well, to thank the staff who put so much work into this, including Robin Colwell, Tim Kurth, Sean Farrell, Lauren McCarty, Evan Viau, and Elena Hernandez on the Republican side, and David Goldman, Gerald Leverich, and Dan Miller on the minority side. We thank all of them for working both here and on the Senate side.  Mr.Speaker, I just want to quickly go through the provisions again, because this really is important.  For more than a quarter of a century, the FCC has not been reauthorized. We do that here, thanks to Chairwoman Blackburn's legislation.  Second, we take care of our broadcasters, both public and private, and their translators, including FM translators as well as public broadcasting.  Mr.Pallone has been a long champion of the repack effort and, of course, his SANDy legislation.  You heard from Mr.Scalise on the legislation to consolidate redundant and outdated FCC reports: get rid of the ones we don't need, streamline the rest, and bring efficiency.  Mr.Johnson's legislation to establish an independent inspector general at the FCC, this is just good government we can all embrace.  Congresswoman Mimi Walters' legislation gives the chief information officer of the FCC the authority to play a significant role in planning, budgeting, and programming.  Congresswoman Grace Meng's bill to prohibit spoofing calls or texts originating outside the U.S., plus an 18-month shot clock, is put on the FCC to[[Page H1414]]conduct rulemaking in this matter. I think we are all kind of getting tired of those spoofs we get on our phones. It looks like they are coming from our hometowns, and it turns out they are not. We are going to try to get to the bottom of this and have the FCC work to do that.  Congressman Guthrie and Congresswoman Matsui's bill to include a spectrum auction deposit fix, this will actually allow future actions to go forward legally. They couldn't do that under existing law because of an interpretation, and so we fixed that. That was very, very important.  Congressmen McNerney and Kinzinger's legislation to require the FCC to report to Congress on promoting internet excess for veterans, we all know how important that is, especially those low-income veterans in our rural communities.  Congressman Loebsack's legislation to improve mapping methodology for mobile coverage, we need to know where we have service in America and where we don't and have numbers we can trust.  Representative Ruiz's legislation is very, very important, dealing with broadband in Tribal areas and carrying out rulemaking to address unserved Tribal areas. We have lots of Tribal areas in our country that lack service.  Anna Eshoo's legislation to provide further improvements on 911 caller information that builds on Kari's Law that we have already approved, that is really, really important.  And, again, Eliot Engel's legislation requires the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the NTIA, to study and consider how the agency can best coordinate the interagency process following cybersecurity incidents.  It just goes on and on, including Senator Thune's MOBILE NOW Act that will help us move forward on 5 So, as you can see, this is comprehensive, thoughtful, well-written legislation on telecommunications, moves our country forward, reauthorizes the FCC, and is a fitting tribute to my friend and our policy leader, Mr.Ray Baum from  Mr.Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.

1826,topic-id,379,"Mr.Speaker, the bill before us today, the BRICK Act, makes commonsense adjustments to preserve small businesses and American jobs while still protecting the environment. This bill addresses the impact of regulations and policies aimed at brickmakers, and--particularly important to many in my home state, wood stoves.  In many parts of Oregon, we're surrounded by forests and affordable wood, so wood stoves are often the most economical way to heat a home or a ranch shop. Oregonians also know what a real air pollution crisis looks like, as we have recently dealt with the thick smoke from several very bad wildfires across the state. Compared to that, wood stove emissions are far from a crisis, especially now that[[Page H1463]]they all must comply with EPA's 2015 emissions standards. There is no reason to threaten wood heater affordability as well as industry jobs by insisting on the unworkable 2020 deadline for the next round of standards. This bill takes the sensible step of extending the deadline to 2023, thus preserving wood heater choice and affordability.  Opponents of these bills have claimed that H.1917 is harmful to the environment and public health protections, but I think we need to maintain a sense of perspective.  Neither brickmakers nor wood heaters are a significant source of emissions, and both industries have already reduced emissions significantly due to earlier regulations that are not affected under this bill. For example, according to the U.Chamber of Commerce, the brick industry has already committed millions of dollars to install and operate controls to reduce emissions by nearly 95 percent in order to comply with previous regulations.  Perhaps most importantly, this bill does not repeal any health-based regulation--it simply makes minimal, temporal adjustments to reduce the risk of plant shutdowns, layoffs, and higher prices for consumers. We should be looking at ways to get people working, not imposing unnecessary and tough to meet regulatory timeframes that take away people's livelihoods.  We need a balanced approach. These brickmakers and wood heater manufacturers are important employers in the small communities where many are located. The data shows that there is little environmental justification for inflicting economic harm on these small businesses and their communities, and thus there is every reason to pass this bill to ensure that any such harm is avoided.

Mr.Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the patients who face terminal diagnoses but have exhausted all available treatment options. These are patients like Jordan McLinn, who is with us today.  Jordan is a tireless fighter who self-advocates for others living with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. He is a namesake of this bill we are considering, like Matt Bellina, who testified before the Health Subcommittee last year. Because of folks like Jordan and Matt, we have a chance to increase patient access to experimental therapies.  Thirty-eight States across our great land have right-to-try laws, including my home State of Wisconsin, with a bill on its way to Governor Scott Walker's desk, will soon make it 39. While the State policies vary, they have a common goal: helping vulnerable patients.  President Trump praised the movement during the State of the Union, saying: ``People who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure. I want to give them a chance here at home.''  Now, today, there is an existing process for patients to access unapproved drugs. The FDA oversees expanded access, commonly known as compassionate use. This program has been critical in helping patients access experimental drugs.  Commissioner Scott Gottlieb and the Agency, the FDA, should be commended for their continued work to improve the expanded access program for patients.  To improve this successful program, the bill before us today also provides liability protections for manufacturers, sponsors, physicians, clinical investigators, and hospitals that participate in the existing expanded access program and the new alternative pathway created under this legislation.  This provision removes one of the biggest hurdles that patients have faced in getting access to these medicines, in gaining access to experimental therapies, as identified by the Government Accountability Office: manufacturer hesitancy to participate. That is the big hurdle. We seek to overcome it with this legislation.  The bill also creates a new alternative pathway for patients who do not qualify for a clinical trial. This legislation strengthens patient protections with clearer informed consent and adverse event reporting.  The bill also ensures the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration, is notified when a patient receives an unapproved drug through the new alternative pathway to ensure there is proper oversight.

1879,topic-id,404,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from Tennessee for his compassionate words on the tragic loss of three dedicated, selfless servants in care of our veterans. I very much appreciate that, and it is a challenging time.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of 324, the State Veterans Home Adult Day Health Care Improvement I want to thank Senator Hatch for introducing this innovative and bipartisan bill.  324 directs the VA to enter into an agreement with each State home to pay for medical supervision model adult healthcare for a veteran for whom the home is not receiving VA nursing home payments.  Ensuring that veterans have access to appropriate affordable geriatric and long-term care is becoming increasingly important. In 2017, approximately 9.8 million veterans, or 46 percent, were 65 years or older.  In addition, VA's own Enrollee Health Care Projection Model indicates a further demand on long-term care and support services is coming as the Vietnam-era cohort ages, with most having gone beyond age 75 by 2026.  At present, VA is required to cover the cost of nursing home care in the[[Page H1514]]State Veterans Home for any veteran in need of such care due to a service-connected disability or with a service-connected disability rated 70 percent or more. However, there is increasing demand for VA to offer geriatric and long-term programs for veterans in noninstitutional settings that would allow them to receive the services and support they need to remain in their homes--their preferred venue.  Adult day healthcare programs provide veterans in need of supportive services with companionship, peer support, recreation, and certain healthcare services, while allowing them to stay and maintain their independence.  In testimony before the Subcommittee on Health last year, the National Association of State Veterans Homes claimed that there are a number of State homes across the country interested in providing medical model ADHC services; however, the current basic ADHC per diem paid to the State Veterans Home by the VA is not sufficient for most homes to cover the cost of this program. As a result, only 3 State Veterans Homes out of 153, nationwide, provide this program.  This legislation would correct that imbalance, allowing veterans who would otherwise qualify for more costly VA nursing home care the ability to stay in their home longer, at a reduced cost.

1229,topic-id,1955,"I thank the distinguished chair.  Mr.President, first of all, let me thank my good friend, the Senator Indiana, for his great work on this and actually getting rid of half of my speech. I think he started to go through, in very good detail, a number of the new consumer protections that are put into this legislation, and a lot of that is due to his good work.  The truth is, in a few days, we may actually do something that hasn't been seen in a really long time--the Senate producing a meaningful piece of legislation with a strong bipartisan coalition.  Now, neither side got everything they wanted. I compliment the chairman for his good work, but as my friend from Indiana--you should have seen the original list of wants of the Senator from The truth is, we are only here because, at the end of the day, we all went back and recognized the people we work for--our constituents in our respective States and, for that matter, Americans at large--one, they want to see the Senate work; and, two, they want to see it work in a meaningful way to protect people's lives. What this legislation will do is, bottom line, make sure there is more access to capital on Main Street by cutting some of the excessive regulations on community banks and credit unions, as well as a number of the consumer protection items and others that have been put forward. It also provides some relief for regional banks and, as mentioned, major expansion of consumer protections.  Let me also step back. As somebody who got to the Senate right after the financial crisis, we all know the system needed stronger financial reform a decade ago, and I am very proud of the role I played, in some small way, on drafting Dodd-Title I and title II were areas that then-Chairman Dodd gave me a great deal of responsibility.  Let me be clear that I will do nothing and support no legislation that seriously undermines or cuts back on the provisions and the systemic protections that were put in place by title I and title II and, for that matter, for all of Dodd-Frank, but 8 years later--2 years it took us to do the bill--there is widespread agreement that some of the standards we set in Dodd-Frank needed time for review.  One of those was the standard we put in place at the $50 billion threshold for enhanced prudential standards. We know, 8 years later, that number is just too low. There is a legitimate debate about where that standard should be reset, but recognizing that this standard was set 8 years ago at $50 billion, if you just take inflation and growth in the economy, it would be dramatically different. That is a view shared by Federal Reserve Dan Tarullo, who is the architect of much of the legislation implementing Dodd-It is also the view of former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and current Reserve Chair Jay  The fact is, there is an awful lot of difference even between some of these regional banks and some of the largest six banks in our country. At this point, they still control about 60 percent of all total assets.  If we don't do this legislation, what we will see--and this is where, again, I have to disagree with some of my Democratic colleagues--is there will be more pressure on consolidation, not only for community banks and credit unions but, for that matter, more consolidation among regional banks, which will place more and more power in those largest of institutions, where I think we have pretty good protections and protections that we don't want back at all in this legislation, but I don't think we ought to encourage that greater consolidation. So, again, we focus not only on community banks and credit unions but also on some of these regional banks.  I want to make clear, what we have done is make no changes to the applicability of enhanced prudential standards for the big banks with assets above $250 billion. These are both the largest and, in many ways, because of some of their products, the riskiest financial institutions, and the full set of postcrisis regulations should apply to[[Page S1360]]them, but we have required the Fed to tailor those standards appropriately for banks with total assets between $100 billion and $250 billion. I want to highlight that the bill actually sets a very low bar for the Fed to apply enhanced standards to regional banks.  Under the bill, the Fed can apply enhanced prudential standards to a bank with assets larger than $100 billion for financial stability reasons or to promote the safety and soundness of the bank--part of their traditional prudential regulations as they stand, but I don't think every enhanced prudential standard should apply to every bank with assets larger than $100 billion. There is a broad agreement that standards should be tailored for this group.  Again, let me cite someone whom most of the folks on this side of the aisle, myself included, have a great deal of respect for: former Fed Chair Janet She called this bill ``a move in a direction that we think would be good.''  More recently, Chairman Powell testified that the Fed will implement standards over the next 18 months for banks with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion. Chairman Powell also testified that the regional banks will continue to be subject to the most important enhanced prudential standard: meaningful, strong, and frequent stress tests. Those are his words, not mine. He called himself a strong believer in stress testing. Again, let me say, so am  Critically, again, this bill does not change the existing requirement that the Fed conduct annual stress tests on banks with assets larger than $250 billion. I know I am getting into a lot of details, but details in banking regulations are important. Again, unfortunately, I don't think some of my colleagues who are in opposition to the bill are setting out what this bill truly does or doesn't do.  Again, let me point out another thing on stress tests. The bill also does not alter the comprehensive capital analysis and review or what banking regulators call the CCAR process. The Fed capital planning process is actually not part of Dodd-Frank, but it is another core pillar of the Fed's supervisory regime. We believe it should continue to apply as much as it does today.  So for banks within this $100 billion to $250 billion range, you have not only CCAR, but you have the chairman himself saying he will put in place--somewhat similar to the existing DFAST stress test--meaningful, strong, and frequent stress tests. As has been mentioned as well, banks with assets above $250 billion should expect to have the annual stress test.  Let me touch on another subject, foreign banks. Another thing this bill does not do is change the enhanced prudential standards applied to the largest foreign banks' U.operations. This gets pretty technical, but I think for the record it is important that it is reflected.  All foreign G-SIBs that have total consolidated assets greater than $250 billion have enhanced prudential standards, and those enhanced prudential standards will continue to apply to these largest and systemic important foreign banks, and the Fed will continue to have the authority to apply these enhanced prudential standards on foreign banks with total consolidated assets of more than $100 billion.  So a large foreign bank--let's say Deutsche Bank, for example, that had problems recently--that may have only $100 billion or less than $250 billion of American assets, but the fact that their consolidated balance sheet has greater than $250 billion will mean that the Fed will continue to enhance the full G-SIB regulation.  Again, let's move to Chairman He was approved by 84 Senators to this post--40 He made clear in his Banking Committee testimony that the Fed requires establishment of intermediate holding companies by certain foreign banking organizations independently of Dodd-Chair Powell made clear that nothing in this bill requires any change to the IHC requirement. This is by design, as we believe the IHC requirement is an important innovation that greatly helps international holding companies. For those keeping track of these comments, it is an important innovation that greatly helps the Federal Reserve supervise and apply enhanced prudential standards to the U.operations of foreign banks.  As explained by the Federal Reserve in its final rule, in applying enhanced prudential standards to foreign banking organizations, there were unique financial stability issues associated with some of the large foreign banks' operations in the United States during the crisis.  We remember that it was some of the foreign banks and operations in the United States that were part of causing the crisis back in 2008, and those enhanced standards need to stay in place.  In that final rule and in other rules implementing prudential requirements for the intermediate holding companies of foreign banks, the Federal Reserve has distinguished between which standards should apply to U.banks and the IHCs of foreign banks and how they should apply it.  The Federal Reserve remains fully capable of assessing the unique risks associated with large foreign banks' U.operations and applying appropriate enhanced prudential standards on these institutions and their IHCs, giving due regard to the principle of competitive equality, while remaining focused on the mandate under this bill and under section 165 of Dodd-Frank to protect financial stability and safety and soundness.  This is the final point I want to make. I also want to make clear that my support for section 402 in this bill--again, which deals with a technical issue but a very important issue, the supplemental leverage issue, which excludes deposits from the calculation of supplemental leverage ratio for custody banks--this exclusion for custody banks, those assets deposited within a central bank, such as the Fed, while we are carving out this one exclusion, it does not mean that I support removing other assets from the calculation of that leverage ratio.  Again, there is widespread agreement from former Governor Tarullo to current Chair Powell that the leverage ratio should not be the binding capital constraint on custody banks because of a unique business model that relies on less risky business.  When the leverage ratio is the binding constraint on a business, it encourages actually riskier activity and rewards making bets that tend to decrease, rather than increase, safety and soundness. That gives the wrong incentive. This bill will fix the narrow problem that exists for custody banks and goes no further.  I personally say that I would have no support for any movement further than what is narrowly carved out in this bill.  I know my friend the Senator from Vermont is here, and he will have a different opinion on some of these issues, but I want to again thank Senator As well, I do hope we will have a chance to enter into further colloquy on this debate and to further make clear for the record both his and my support for strong capital, that our system is stronger and, particularly for the largest institutions, that nothing we are doing will reverse keeping American banks the strongest in the world.  I know there are strong opinions on the other side. I look forward to the continued debate. I look forward to a managers' package that I believe will actually continue to expand certain areas around consumer protections and other areas where there is broad-based general agreement. I look forward to the conclusion of this debate and an amendment process that again allows other issues to be vetted.  With that, I thank the chairman, and I look forward to further discussions.

The failure of Bear Stearns in March of 2008 was the first major signal of a coming financial crisis that would cost 9 million people their jobs and millions more people their homes or their savings. Lives and plans and dreams would be crushed--and even after the economy began to recover its footing, millions of American families would have to spend years just to get back to where they started before 2008. A lot of those families have given up the dream of home ownership forever, and many are still struggling today.  But in the next few days, with broad support among Republicans and far too much support among Democrats, the Senate is on the verge of passing a bill that puts American families in danger of that same devastation all over again.  Over the last few days, I have talked about what this bill will do. I have explained how it strips consumer protections for American families who are trying to buy a home, particularly in low-income communities and communities of color. I have talked about how this bill will peel away vital safeguards we put on large banks after the financial crisis to make sure they can't crash the economy all over again.  Now, as the bill is on the verge of passing the Senate, I want to stop and just ask a basic question: Why? Who exactly is asking us to do this?  Our constituents hate it. A recent poll showed that an overwhelming majority of Americans oppose this bill. So why is it that the only thing Washington can agree to do on a bipartisan basis in this Congress is to help out giant banks?  I will tell you why. Washington's amnesia is legendary. We go through the same cycle like clockwork. When the economy is looking good, lobbyists flood Congress and tell politicians it is perfectly safe to roll back the rules on the big banks. It is always the same set of arguments: America needs more lending for more economic growth. Our country is losing ground to its competitors. Banks have learned their lesson and don't need rules to behave responsibly. And here is the kicker question: What could possibly go wrong? Every time, it works.  It works even though the lessons of history are clear. Strong financial rules help create a strong economy that works for everyone, and when we weaken the rules, it sets the stage for another financial crisis--a crisis that, every time, hits America's working families the hardest.  Let's go back to the beginning of the 20th century. A lot of our financial regulations in the United States come from the Great Before then, Washington ignored the booms and busts that rocked the country every few years. But after the unemployment rate topped 20 percent in the 1930s and the U.economy shrunk by about 30 percent, Washington--this Congress--finally got its act together to pass some laws.  Here is what they did. First, they looked at all of the places where people put their money--banks, home, markets--and then they built regulators for all of those different kinds of investments. Congress did something really smart. It put a law in place called the Glass-Steagall It broke up the biggest banks, and it separated the banks that take deposits and make mortgages from high-risk institutions like investment banks.  This worked reasonably well for about half a century. There wasn't a single major financial crisis. But then, starting in the late 1970s and early 1980s, bankers, looking for higher profits and bigger paychecks, set their sights on government rules. They wanted less regulation and more freedom to trick their customers, to trap their customers, and to cheat their customers.  It started in the savings and loan industry. These institutions, which specialized in home mortgages, started to become insolvent because of the rising inflation and flaws in their business model. So the bank lobbyists had a solution: Deregulate them. They said: Instead of just safe mortgages, why don't we let these institutions put out some riskier stuff in hopes that some of these gambles will pay off big. The Reagan administration agreed, but the plan failed. Over the next decade, taxpayers spent $132 billion to bail out these institutions. That was in the 1980s.  But why stop there? Deregulating the thrifts, as disastrous as it was, was just small ball. Thrifts were allowed to gamble only with a chunk of their own money. The lobbyists wanted to tear down all of the barriers, throwing savings accounts and risky, complicated securities into one big institution and then letting that bank gamble with all of it.  They dreamt of a Wall Street where banks could take the money in grandma's checking account and use it to gamble in the markets. They wanted to tear down the wall Glass-Steagall had created between boring banking and high-risk trading.  In 1999, the conditions were perfect to rip up the rules. Why? The economy was cruising. Unemployment was down to 4.2 percent. The markets were on fire. The Dow, the S&P 500, and the NASDAQ smashed every record in their paths. In fact, the NASDAQ grew at 85.6 percent in 1999, the biggest annual jump for a major index in U.history. One respected finance professor gushed:       It's amazing. Every year we say it can't be another year of      20 percent-plus (gain)--and then every year it's a 20      percent-plus gain.  It was the prime time for the bank lobbyists to strike. They swarmed Capitol Hill pushing, pulling, cajoling, running from the House to the Senate and back again, and most of this was happening behind closed doors. But on a clear, cold day in February of 1999, eight bankers and two lobbyists testified in front of the Senate Banking Committee, and the knives were out for Glass-The euphemism people used then was ``modernization.'' When lobbyists start talking about modernization and clarification, it is time to buy a parachute.  Let me tell you about KeyCorp, one of the banks that would be taken off the watch list in the bill we are going to be voting on in the coming days. Back in 1999, the CEO of that company testified that the ``financial law modernization that strengthens our financial institutions in and of itself will enhance safety and soundness.'' Think about what that means. Behind the buzzwords, that CEO was making the amazing claim that if banks were just allowed to take more risks and make more short-term profits, it would actually make the financial system safer. In other words, if we just deregulate the banks, they will become safer.  He wasn't the only one to make a claim like that. The vice chairman of JPMorgan said: ``There is a consensus shared by most financial firms and their customers, as well as policymakers, that these rules restrict competition, reduce consumer choice, and are not necessary to protect consumers or insured financial institutions.'' In other words, rules are the problem--if banks could just do whatever they wanted, everything would be great.  Guess what. The pitch worked. Nine months later, in late 1999, a bill to repeal key parts of Glass-Steagall and roll back other financial rules passed both Houses of Congress overwhelmingly. Ninety Senators voted yes. Senator after Senator, including quite a few who are still here today, came to the Senate floor and praised the bill for modernizing our financial rules and getting rid of unnecessary and outdated requirements.  But not everyone was fooled. Some Senators knew better. Senator Paul Wellstone from Minnesota warned that Congress ``seem[s] determined to unlearn the lessons from our past mistakes . . . [and] is about to repeal [Glass-Steagall] without putting any comparable safeguard in its place.''  Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota was especially prescient. He said:       I think we will look back in 10 years' time and say we      should not have done this but we did because we forgot the      lessons of the past, and that that which is true in the      1930's is true in 2010. . . . We now have decided in the name      of modernization to forget the lessons of the past, of safety      and of soundness.  But Congress ignored their warnings. For the bargain price of $300 million in lobbyist bills, the big banks saw their wildest dreams come true. With the repeal of Glass-Steagall, too-big-to-fail megabanks were born. Citibank became J.Morgan became[[Page S1567]]JPMorgan The banks got bigger and bigger and bigger.  But the lobbyists weren't done yet. Over the next decade, they tried over and over to expand the loopholes that they had punched until both the regulators and the regulations gave way. By the middle of the decade, the conditions were right. Markets broke records. The unemployment rate was below 5 percent. It was time for the lobbyists to go at it again. Hand-tailored suits and Gucci loafers swarmed Capitol Meetings were scheduled. So were fundraisers. Their efforts again occasionally spilled out into the public hearing rooms.  This pitch might sound familiar. In 2006, the head of risk at Citigroup, on behalf of the Financial Services Roundtable, told the House Financial Services Committee: ``The U.needs to modernize its capital regulations, and there are a variety of new approaches that all represent a significant improvement over the current system.'' In other words, the regulations are outdated.  Steve Bartlett, a former Congressman who was a lobbyist for the 50 biggest banks, told the Senate Banking Committee in 2005: ``Outdated laws and regulations impose significant, and unnecessary, burdens on financial services firms, and these burdens not only make our firms less efficient, but also increase the cost of financial products and services to consumers.'' In other words, set the banks free, and let them do whatever they want. What could possibly go wrong?  In 2005, the head of the American Bankers Association told the committee: ``The cost of unnecessary paperwork and red tape is a serious long-term problem that will continue to erode the ability of banks to serve our customers and support the economic growth of our communities.'' In other words, in the end, these rules hurt consumers. Let the banks do whatever they want to consumers.  Then, just as the lobbyists were gaining momentum, the economy they created crashed. It was 2008, and millions of families lost their homes, millions lost their savings, and millions lost their jobs. But the lobbyists didn't lose their jobs. They peddled myths about the economy and the financial system, and they kept right on working for the big banks. All during the efforts to pass financial regulations to get our economy out of the ditch, the bank lobbyists were there. They pulled in more than $1 million a day lobbying against financial reform.  When the American people started to demand action in the wake of the 2008 crash, the reforms passed anyway. But the lobbyists didn't give up. They didn't go away. Before the ink was dry on Dodd-Frank, they jumped right back in and started lobbying to roll back the new rules.  So here we are again. It took years, but the economy is humming again. In 2016, the unemployment rate dipped below 5 percent for the first time since before the 2008 crisis. In 2017, the Dow jumped 25 percent, and the NASDAQ grew by 28 percent. And you know what that means--it means the bank lobbyists have once again taken center stage, insisting that it is safe to deregulate their clients again, all in the name of economic growth and empowering consumers. It is the same argument as before.  Last spring, bank lobbyist Greg Baer said:       After nearly a decade of fundamental and continuing changes      to financial regulation, now is an opportune time to review      the efficacy of our current bank regulatory framework. My      testimony will focus on reforms that could directly and      immediately enhance economic growth.  In other words, turn the big banks loose, and let's see what they can do.  Harris Simmons, the CEO of Zions Bank, which will be kicked off the watch list under the bill that is now under consideration, recently testified that ``the uncertainty surrounding [Dodd-Frank reforms] can cause banks to withdraw or limit certain kinds of lending.'' To put it another way: Get out of the way and let the big banks cheat their customers again. It is good for bank profits.  Here we go again. I get it. Our financial regulations need work. There are things we could do to reduce the load on community banks, and there are still big dangers to consumers that we should take up. But this bill isn't about the unfinished business of the last financial crisis; this bill is about laying the groundwork for the next financial crisis.  I will make a prediction. This bill will pass, and if the banks get their way, in the next 10 years or so, there will be another financial crisis. Of course, when the crash comes, the big banks will throw up their hands and say that it is not their fault, that nobody could have seen it coming. Then they will run to Congress and beg for bailout money, and--let's be blunt--they will probably get it. But just like in 2008, there will be no bailout for working families. Jobs will be lost, and lives will be destroyed. The American people, not the banks, will once again bear the burden.  Then, caught in a fog of amnesia, the lobbyists and regulators and elected officials in Washington will scratch their heads and wonder how in the world it could have possibly happened again. But the American people won't be confused about it at all. They never are. They are much smarter than the people around here give them credit for. They won't wonder why it happened; they will know why it happened. They will know it was because the people in Washington ignored working people in order to do the bidding of the guys in fancy suits and the handmade shoes who write the fat campaign checks. Look at the numbers. Seventy-eight percent of Americans think big banks have too much control over Members of That includes 68 percent of people who voted for Donald Everyone knows that Congress sold them out last time, and everyone expects it to happen again this time.  As we prepare to vote on this bill, I ask my colleagues one more time, do the job you were sent here to do. Stand up for the people who sent us here. Stop doing the bidding of big bank lobbyists, and start working on the things that can make a difference in the lives of working people around this country. The American people need it. The American people deserve it. The American people will demand it. If you refuse to do it, don't be surprised when they hold you responsible.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

1235,topic-id,2742,"Mr.President, this week we are considering a bill to roll back the rules on some of the biggest banks in the country. Over the course of this week, I am going to be spending a lot of time on the Senate floor talking about the problems with this bill and how it threatens working families and American taxpayers, but I want to start by looking back to 2008 and the reason we have these rules in the first place.  Ten years ago next week, Americans started holding our breaths. For years, financial institutions had been riding high, selling dangerous products to consumers, and making risky bets. All the while, Washington looked the other way, cozying up to big banks, loosening rules left and right, and shrugging off rules they couldn't get rid of. And no wonder--the revolving door was spinning like crazy. Bank officials became regulators and then went back to the banks, getting richer and richer. Bank profits were sky high and getting higher.  But business built on scams and hype can't grow forever. Ten years ago this month, Bear Stearns, an 85-year-old institution on Wall Street, went belly up because of $46 billion in scam mortgages and other questionable investments on its books. The failure gave the rest of the world a glimpse of Wall Street's addiction to risky bets. The disease spread. It turned out that a lot of other banks had invested heavily in scam mortgages too. Investors panicked, sending the markets into a nosedive.  When the American economy fell off a cliff in 2008, American families got crushed. Almost 9 million people lost their jobs. Workers lost $2.6 trillion from their retirement accounts--about 25 percent of their savings for someone who had been working for 20 years. In 2008 alone, foreclosures spiked 81 percent, and 3.1 million notices went out to homeowners across the country telling them they would lose their homes. In a single year, 1 out of 54 homes in the United States was in foreclosure.  Behind those enormous numbers were real people and real families whose lives were shaken up and turned upside down, little kids who worried about where they were going to live, and bigger kids who worried about whether they would lose their chance to go to college.  I know that feeling. I lived in Oklahoma City, and my folks had picked out our house because it was right inside the boundary line of what my mother believed was the best school district in the county. Our lives seemed to be on track right up until the day my daddy had a heart attack, and then it all started sliding sideways. He was out of work for a very long time.  My mother usually picked me up from school in our bronze, two-toned station wagon, and one day she showed up driving the old, off-white Studebaker that daddy had been driving back and forth to work. As I climbed into the car, I asked where our station wagon was.  It is gone.  Gone where?   I just kept pushing. My mother was staring straight ahead, fingers tight on the steering wheel, and after one more ``Where?'' from me, she answered in a low voice: We couldn't pay. They took it.  The house was next in line. My family was right on the brink of foreclosure when my mom put on her best dress, walked into the Sears, and landed a minimum-wage job. But that feeling--the feeling of being on the brink, the feeling of no security, nothing under your feet--is a feeling no family in this country should have, especially not have it because Congress decided it was OK to let the big banks gamble with the economy again. Yet here we are, on the verge of making the same mistake Congress has made so many times before.  The banks don't want you to know what is in this bill because if you did know, you would fight back. It was written by Senators in back rooms and jammed through the Banking Committee, where its authors voted down every single amendment, every single idea to make the bill even one smidgen better or protect consumers just one tiny bit more. They voted against every amendment, even if they agreed with it, because Republicans and Democrats had locked arms to do the bidding of the big banks.  There is a lot of dangerous stuff in this bill. Today I want to focus on the harm it will do to America's consumers, but I will start with what is not in the bill because what is not in the bill should make Congress ashamed. Strong consumer protections--that is what is not in this bill. Banks get their wish list, but consumers get next to nothing. This bill is called the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, but in all 148 pages, there are only a few watered-down provisions to help consumers.  Equifax loses data for nearly half of all adults in America, lies about it, and this Congress, these Senators, still can't manage to pass a bill with some teeth in it to hold the company accountable. That says it all.  This bill was written by big banks to help big banks. It is not a bill to help American families who are still getting cheated by the companies that make huge profits off them.  What is actually in this bill? Start with the first part of the bill, section 101, ``Improving Consumer Access to Mortgage Credit.'' When you get a mortgage, usually your lender spends some time combing through your financial records to make sure you can repay the loan. That is good. American families don't want to take out loans they can't afford, and banks don't want to make loans that can't be repaid.  Before the financial crisis, that whole process went haywire. Lenders were making crazy loans with balloon payments and exotic features that consumers didn't understand. Lenders didn't care if their customers could repay. Why? Because they got their fees up front and then sold the loans to distant investors, and the original lender was long gone before the homeowner got in trouble. But the families were stuck. Eventually, the payments skyrocketed, and homeowners who couldn't keep up defaulted and lost their homes.  After the crisis, Congress changed the rules. They told lenders that they had to start underwriting their loans again to protect consumers and the economy. But that takes time and money, so Congress told the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to write a rule that says that there is no need to investigate if the lender knows that it is issuing a super-safe, boring, plain-vanilla loan. That sounds reasonable. But section 101 of this bill is not reasonable. It takes the CFPB rule and stretches it in all directions, tearing open big, dangerous loopholes. This bill that is on the floor says: Banks, have some fun out there. It says: Bring back the greatest hits of the financial crisis housing scams. Scoop up profits on the front end, and leave families holding the bag on the back end.  I understand breaks for banks that make straightforward loans, but these loans in this bill are too risky and they come at a bad time. Rising interest rates mean that exotic products like adjustable rate mortgages are starting to make a comeback. Bank lobbyists are dragging us back to the bad old days when banks had free reign to scam their customers.  Here is another section. Section 104 makes it harder to enforce anti-discrimination laws by telling loads of institutions that they don't have to comply with a law called the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, or HMDA requires most financial institutions to tell the public and the CFPB who they are lending to and at what rates and what terms. Regulators and law enforcement then use that data to make sure that American families don't have a harder time getting one of those loans because of who they are or where they come from.  This bill takes a sledgehammer to HMDA by exempting 85 percent of banks from reporting HMDA data. If this bill passes, there will be entire communities in America where there will be no data whatsoever, which means there will be no ability to monitor whether people are getting cheated because of their race or their gender.  Once again, this couldn't come at a worse time. Lending discrimination is real. A new, comprehensive report that[[Page S1364]]looked at housing markets all across the country just came out from the Center for Investigative Reporting and Reveal, and its findings should make us all sick to our stomachs.  In 2015 and 2016, nearly two-thirds of mortgage lenders denied loans to people of color at higher rates than for White people. According to Reveal, in the Washington metro area, ``in 2016, Native American applicants were 2.3 times as likely to be denied a conventional home mortgage as white applicants. For black applicants, it was 2.2 times as likely. For Latino applicants, it was 1.9 times as likely. For Asian applicants, it was 1.6 times as likely.  The Reveal report showed that this problem happens in giant banks and also in small banks.  Here is the thing: None of that analysis--none of it--would have been possible without HMDA data from big institutions and small ones. Without the data, we would all be sitting in the dark, wondering if maybe some mortgage lenders discriminated against African Americans or women or Native Americans, but we wouldn't have any way to know. That means we wouldn't have any way to change it if it was happening. Gutting HMDA allows us--actually forces us--to look the other way when discrimination happens, and that is disgraceful.  There is one more section in this bill that really hurts consumers; that is, section 107, ``Protecting Access to Manufactured Homes.'' Eighteen million Americans live in manufactured homes. Many are low-income, elderly, or disabled. It is a good option for many Americans, especially in rural areas, but it is very important to make sure buyers don't get scammed.  Under today's law, mortgage lenders cannot steer a borrower toward a higher cost loan so the lender can get a kickback. That is the law today but not if this bill passes. Instead, the rules for mobile home lenders will be weaker rules, and that means it will be much easier to cheat buyers of mobile homes.  Congress imposed strict requirements on loan originators because Congress knew most of us don't buy a lot of homes in our lifetime, and we rely on the people helping us through the process to tell it straight. Owners of mobile homes deserve the same protection as people who buy brick-and-mortar homes. They need that protection.  Abusive lending practices are rampant in the manufactured housing industry. In 2015, the Seattle Times wrote about Kirk and Patricia Ackley in Ephrata, Kirk worked construction, and Patricia worked at They had already bought the foundation for their new mobile home when they sat down to close on their mortgage. What happened at closing? The interest rate was higher than they had been told, and the payments were larger than they could afford. The mortgage broker then convinced them to go ahead and sign up anyway, promising that they could refinance that loan later on.  You can probably guess the end of the story. The Ackleys signed, the lender wouldn't refinance, they lost all the money they had put in up front, and they lost their home. It turns out that the homebuilder, the dealer, and the mortgage lender--all three of them--were owned by one company, Clayton All the incentives were to push the Ackleys into a loan they couldn't afford because Clayton got the purchase price, the commissions, and the fees, and they got the mobile home back again. No one was looking out for the  The backers of this bill say that this provision will help small lenders, but the truth is that manufactured home lending is mostly done by giant lenders like In fact, in 2013, Clayton alone--one company--provided 39 percent of mobile home loans. Savings from rolling back these consumer protections would go right out of the pockets of working families like the Ackleys and right into the pockets of dealers like  The Ackleys' story is not unique. I wish it were. These same problems happen all over the country, and they are exacerbated by the special characteristics of mobile homes. The lifespan of a manufactured home is shorter than a traditional home. That means the purchaser may not be able to take out equity by reselling it.  A woman from Oklahoma told the CFPB:       I was given a loan for a single width mobile home through      [a mortgage company]. They switched it to Green Tree and next      to The home started deteriorating in 10 years and is      now unsafe to live in, as I have had electrical problems and      many of the pipes are broken where the bathtub and faucets in      the master bathroom are not functioning. The floor under the      shower has completely caved in, windows are crooked and allow      flies to get into the house in warm weather. Most of the      floors have buckled under the legs of furniture, and the rain      has caused the areas around the windows to buckle. Walls are      little more than cardboard. I believe the flooring is      waferboard and unfit for floor foundation.       When I tried to trade this [model], the dealer [] told me      he couldn't because the house is worth much less than what I      owe and that this sounded like a Predatory Mortgage He      said that mobile homes do not have 30 year mortgages because      they don't last that long. He said my loan should have been a      15 year loan at the most. Also, right before Ditech took the      predatory loan over, they added about {$100.00} to my monthly      payments, which went from {$360.00} to {$460.00} a month.      Ditech claims the {$100.00} is for insurance; however, as of      yet they have repaired nothing, although I have made several      claims.       I was also told I should complain because when they put the      mobile home on my property, they did not put it on a cement      foundation and instead put it on the ground, which has caused      the home to sink.  This bill is designed to make it easier for the lender/dealer to squeeze people like this woman from  This bill is a punch in the gut to American consumers. If it passes, it will be harder to police banks that sell abusive mortgages, harder to police lenders who discriminate against their customers, and harder to police giant monopolies that build, sell, and offer financing to mobile home buyers. Only a bunch of bank lobbyists and their friends in Washington would call this a consumer protection bill.  American families weren't in the back room when this bill was written. They don't have millions of dollars in campaign cash to get Senators' attention. They don't keep an army of lobbyists on their payroll. American families are busy going to work, helping the kids with homework, and trying to catch up on a thousand things. They are trying to pay off student loans or maybe save a little for their own kids to go to college. Some are trying to put aside a few bucks for a mortgage so they can buy a home. They trust us to stand up for them and make sure they have a fair shot at home ownership, at the American dream. They trust us to make sure we are not turning over the keys to our economy to the same people who crashed it 10 years ago and ran over a bunch of American families on the way.  I know we are outnumbered, but this fight isn't over. Make no mistake--I am going to do whatever I can to convince enough other Senators that this is a bad deal for American families and a dangerous one. I will push and I will tug and I will talk to anyone who will listen about how this bill will hurt the people we were sent here to represent. And maybe, just maybe, for once, the Senate will start listening to voters instead of donors.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

1377,topic-id,1329,"Thank you, Mr. I have come to the floor of the Senate five times over the past week to talk about how the bank lobbyist act puts American families in danger of getting punched in the gut in another financial crisis. I have talked about how it rolls back consumer protections and how, if it passes, 25 of the 40 largest banks in this country--banks that sucked down, collectively, almost $50 billion in bailout money during the crisis, and nobody went to jail--can be regulated like tiny, little community banks.  I talked about how the bill will roll back the rules on the very biggest banks in this country--JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and the rest of them--banks that broke our economy in 2008, banks where no one went to jail, banks where taxpayers coughed up $180 billion to bail them out. I talked about how Washington is poised to make the same mistake it has made many times before deregulating giant banks while the economy is cruising, only to set the stage for another financial crisis.  Now, I am not the only one who has talked about problems with this bill. The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, the FDIC, the Congressional Budget Office, the NAACP, the Urban League have all talked about parts of this bill that cause problems and would cause problems in our economy.  Today, I want to talk about another part of the bill that keeps me awake at night--the part that guts our ability to find and go after mortgage discrimination by exempting 85 percent of banks from reporting data about the loans they make under a law called the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act or  There is a long and shameful history in this country of discriminating against communities of color when they try to buy homes. From 1934 to 1968, the Federal Housing Administration led the charge, actively discriminating by refusing to insure loans to qualified buyers while helping White families finance their plans to achieve the American dream. This policy was not a secret. It was not the product of a handful of racist government officials. It was the official policy of the U.Government until 1968--in my lifetime and the lifetime of 90 Senators who serve today. The official policy of this government was to help White people buy homes and to deny that help to Black people. Because the Federal Government had set this standard, private lenders enthusiastically followed Washington's lead.  Homes are the way that millions of working families built some economic security. They pay down a mortgage and own an asset that over time often appreciates. A home serves as security to fund other ventures--to start a small business or to send a youngster to college. If Grandma and Grandpa could hang on to the home and get it paid off, they can often pass along an asset that boosts the finances of the next generation and the one after that.  That is exactly what White people have done for generations--but not Black people. Systematically, over many decades, government policies that encouraged mortgage companies to lend only to White borrowers cut the legs out from under minority families trying to build some family wealth, and the result has been exactly what you would predict. It has contributed to a staggering gap of wealth between White communities and communities of color today. One statistic from Massachusetts, according to the Boston Globe, states that the median net worth of White families living in Boston is $247,500, and the median net worth for a Black family is $8. That is something all Americans, regardless of race, should be ashamed of.  When I was traveling around the country in the aftermath of the financial crisis, it became clear to me that the crash had made the problem worse. Subprime lenders that had peddled mortgages full of tricks and traps had specifically targeted minority borrowers. That meant that during the great recession, a huge number of minority borrowers lost their homes. When rising home prices helped White Americans regain some financial security, communities of color, with their lower homeownership rates and their higher foreclosure rates, were often left behind.  Again, this is just one example. According to Pew, between 2010 and 2013, the median wealth of White households grew by 2.4 percent, but the wealth of Hispanic households in that same time fell by 14.3 percent, and the wealth of African-American households fell by 33.7 percent.  Mortgage discrimination didn't end in the 1960s when formal redlining policies were abolished. It didn't end with the tightening of mortgage rules following the financial crisis. Lending discrimination is still alive and well in America in 2018.  According to a new report that just came out from the Center for Investigative Reporting and Reveal, in 2015 and 2016, nearly two-thirds of mortgage lenders denied loans for people of color[[Page S1660]]at higher rates than for White people. This problem affects both big and small lenders, and it is nationwide. Minority borrowers were more likely to be denied a mortgage than White borrowers with the same income in 61 different cities across  How do we know that? Because of HMDA data. That is how we can see how much Black families were charged for a mortgage or how often Latino families were denied a chance to take out a mortgage--and we can compare those numbers with White borrowers who have the same income and same credit scores, but we can't do that if the data is missing. It is impossible to detect and fight mortgage discrimination without HMDA data.  The banking bill on the floor of the Senate says that 85 percent of the banks will no longer be required to report HMDA data, including the borrower's credit score and age; the loan's points, fees, and interest rates, and the property value. Eighty-five percent. This data is essential to figuring out whether the borrower got a fair deal.  If this bill passes, there will be entire communities where there will not be enough data to figure out whether borrowers are getting ripped off, entire communities where it will be impossible to monitor whether people are getting cheated because of their race or gender, entire communities where Federal and State regulators will not be able to bring cases, and independent groups like Reveal will not be able to hold these groups accountable.  Sure, banks will save a little money by not having to fill out the HMDA data, but when communities of color are once again left behind, there will be no way to prove it. That is why civil rights groups around the country have spoken up against this bill. The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights said ``[e]xempting the overwhelming majority of our Nation's banks and credit unions from an expanded HMDA requirement that would better enable Federal regulators, State attorneys general, fair housing advocates, and others to identify and address discriminatory and predatory mortgage practices is unwise.''  The Urban League and the National Community Reinvestment Coalition wrote in a newspaper column that the bill ``would be a giant step backwards for the public and national groups who use this data to ensure banks treat all borrowers equally.'' According to the NAACP, the bill ``would devastate our attempts to determine--and potentially rectify--racially discriminatory lending or loan approval patterns at play.''  This is about basic fairness. HMDA data is an investment we should be making to make sure that all qualified Americans have the same chance to buy a home. Throughout our history, Washington has always fallen short of that goal. Gutting HMDA allows our country and our government to ignore discrimination, letting history repeat itself.  Communities of color will pay the price if this Congress makes this same mistake again. It isn't too late. We can stop this bill from becoming law.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

1406,topic-id,849,"Mr.President, I rise today to join the citizens of Massachusetts who are making their voices heard and sending a clear message to President Trump: The Commonwealth of Massachusetts stands strong in opposition to his reckless proposal to expand offshore drilling. We stand strong in opposition to yet another handout to Big Oil executives who are willing to put corporate profits ahead of the health of our coastal families. We stand strong in opposition to this administration's willful ignorance of climate change and the world's ongoing clean energy revolution.  President Trump may say that his drilling plan is about growing jobs, but the truth is that this offshore drilling proposal is a slap in the face to every hard-working coastal family. President Trump is willing to put corporate profits for his Big Oil buddies ahead of shipping crews in Boston, ahead of the fishermen from Gloucester to New Bedford, ahead of the mom-and-pop diners all along the Cape, ahead of every tourism industry worker, and ahead of the families of all of these workers. President Trump is willing to gamble with the livelihoods of over 600,000 North Atlantic coastal and ocean workers. The people of Massachusetts and the people who depend on a clean coast are not willing to take that gamble.  Our coastal communities remember when the BP Deepwater Horizon oilspill happened in 2010. One offshore oil well blew and caused Deepwater Horizon's drilling rig to explode. It killed 11 workers, injured 17 others, and unleashed one of the worst environmental disasters in human history. Nearly 5 million barrels of oil gushed into the ocean, contaminating more than 1,300 miles of coastline and nearly 70,000 square miles of surface water. Millions of birds and marine animals died, suffocated by thick coatings of oil and poisoned by other toxic chemicals. The gulf fishing industry lost thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. The spill devastated the gulf's coastal tourism economy. The environmental and economic devastation hit working families and small businesses across the region.  But the Trump administration insists on padding the pockets of Big Oil while small coastal towns bear all the risks that something will go wrong. The local towns bear the risk of a devastating oilspill. The local towns bear the risk of climate change impact, including increased coastal habitat destruction, fisheries threatened by ocean acidification, and rising sea levels. President Trump and this Republican Congress want to bury their heads in the sand or bury their heads in the big pile of Big Oil money, but the reality is this: Climate change has happened, and the evidence is all around us. The consequences are worsening with every single day of inaction.  Make no mistake. We are in the most critical fight of our generation and we are running out of time. We are in a fight to save our coastal towns, a fight to save our farmers, a fight to save our fishermen, a fight to save good-paying clean energy jobs, and a fight for our children's future.  Will winning the fight against climate change be tough? You bet it will. We will need to retool to install offshore wind turbines instead of offshore drilling rigs. We will need to invest in faster clean energy deployment, modernize the electric grid, build sea walls to protect our coastal towns, and much, much more. It is a big job ahead, but there is no country and no workforce in the world that is more willing and more able to tackle the challenges of climate change head-on than the United States of Yes, it is hard, but it is what we do. It is who we are.  We are a nation of unrelenting workers who clawed our way out of the Great Depression, who fought two world wars, who put a man on the moon, and who electrified the Nation with 20th century fuels. With a level playing field, we are a nation of workers who can electrify the world all over again with the 21st century fuels of wind, solar, and other clean energy sources.  The American people deserve leadership that understands just how innovative and persistent we are--leadership that knows the fearless strength of the American people; leadership that believes in the innovative, get-it-done attitude of the American worker; leadership that will stand up to Big Oil executives hell-bent on protecting their profits at our expense; and leadership that knows that our best days are ahead of us. But we have to fight for them. They deserve leadership that will not ignore the challenges of climate change; leadership that will not chain our economy to the fossil fuels of yesterday and, instead, will support the good-paying, clean energy jobs of tomorrow; and leadership that refuses to put our coastal families at risk of another devastating oil spill.  The American people deserve leadership that doesn't work for Big The American people deserve leadership that works for them.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

1653,topic-id,1731,"Thank you, Madam  Ten years ago today, at breakfast tables all around the country, Americans read a shocking headline: ``Fed assumes the role of lender of last resort.'' The biggest investment banks on Wall Street were getting their first taxpayer bailout, but some of the banks were so addicted to poisonous scam mortgages that even that bailout wasn't enough. Within a week, Bear Stearns--an 85-year-old fixture on Wall Street--would fall, and the financial crisis would begin.  Within a year, American workers' retirement accounts had lost $2.7 trillion, almost one-third of their value. No one bailed them out. Within 2 years, 8.8 million Americans had lost their jobs. No one bailed them out. Within 3 years, more than 4 million homes had been lost to foreclosures, and millions more were in danger. No one bailed the homeowners out. Now, to mark the 10th anniversary of that devastating crisis, the Senate is on the verge of rolling back the rules on the big banks again.  Last week I talked about how this bill guts important consumer protections, how it weakens the oversight of banks with up to a quarter of a trillion dollars in assets, and how it could set the stage for another financial crisis, just like past bipartisan bills to roll back the financial rules. But the bill will also roll back the rules on the very biggest banks in the country, the true Wall Street banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and the rest--banks that taxpayers spent $180 billion bailing out in 2008. And no matter what the supporters of this bill say, there are three glaring parts of this bill that without question help the very biggest Wall Street banks.  First, this bill opens the door to easing up on big banks' stress tests. Right now, about 40 of the biggest banks go through stress tests every year, simulating a financial crisis and making sure that if it happened, they could survive. This bill says that 25 of them can just skip the hard test from now on, and the remaining 15 or so--well, they don't necessarily have to do those tests every single year. For the banks that are still going to be doing stress tests, they can now be done, under this bill, ``periodically.'' Who decides what ``periodically'' means--the former investment bankers Donald Trump has nominated to lead the Fed and to head up the Fed's supervisory work? Does that make you feel safe?  Second, the bill gives the biggest banks a new legal tool to fight for weaker rules. Right now, the law says that the Fed ``may'' tailor capital and other rules for the biggest banks. This bill says the Fed ``shall'' tailor the rules for the banks with more than $250 billion in assets--the very biggest banks in this country. That one word--the switch from ``may'' to ``shall''--may not seem like much, but it means everything to the high-priced lawyers who represent these banks.  Here is what Jeffrey Gordon, a professor at Columbia Law School, had to say about that one-word change:       This apparently minor change is likely to produce      significant degradation of financial stability, especially      over the long run. The change would expose the Fed to      litigation challenges to its enhanced standards, in      particular whether they are already adequately tailored. . .      . The statute thus empowers the largest firms which pose the      biggest risks to bargain with the Fed for laxer standards      with the threat of a well-resourced litigation challenge in      the background. Over time this bargaining for laxity will      produce a race-to-the-bottom dynamic that will dramatically      increase the chance of another financial crisis.  Professor Gordon of Columbia Law School says that will dramatically increase the chance of another financial crisis.  If you think the one-word change from ``may'' to ``shall'' won't change much, consider this: Opponents to the bill have been pointing out this problem loudly and publicly, but the bill's sponsors won't change it. They won't change that one word. Why? Because the giant banks want the change.  The third bank giveaway in this bill undercuts capital requirements for the biggest banks. The best way to stop another taxpayer bailout of the big banks is to make sure they have enough capital on hand to withstand a crisis. That is why Congress and the regulators established tougher capital requirements for the big banks after the last financial crisis. This bill reverses direction, opening the door to big banks like JPMorgan and Citigroup facing much lower capital requirements than they do now. In fact, the independent Congressional Budget Office says there is a 50-percent chance that JPMorgan and Citigroup can take advantage of a provision in the bill to reduce their capital requirements.  The Wall Street Journal editorial board--no fan of tough regulation--wrote that the change proposed in the banking bill is dangerous and ``will make the financial system more vulnerable in a panic.'' The Bloomberg editorial board says the bill ``chip[s] away at the bedrock of financial resilience--the equity capital that allows[[Page S1622]]banks to absorb losses and keep on lending in bad times.'' And the consequences could be huge. According to the FDIC, this provision could lower capital requirements for JPMorgan by $21.4 billion and for Citigroup by $8.6 billion.  At the end of last week, the supporters of the bill introduced a new amendment that they claimed would address the problems in this bill, but that amendment did nothing to address these three glaring big-bank giveaways: The stress test provision is unchanged, the litigation provision is unchanged, and the capital requirements provision is unchanged. Victories for the big banks have been preserved 100 percent.  But it is not just the big-bank giveaways that remain unaddressed in this new amendment. Over the last week, we have heard a lot of criticism about this bill from experts and from civil rights groups and from consumer advocates and from former regulators, and, most importantly, from our constituents back home. They don't like it. This banking bill undermines civil rights laws. It weakens consumers protections on mortgages and mobile home purchases. It rolls back rules on 25 of the 40 largest banks in the country. It does almost nothing to protect consumers. Let me be perfectly clear about this. The new amendment does not address a single one of these legitimate criticisms. It is a bunch of fig leaves designed to let supporters of the bill pretend that they have addressed those criticisms without actually addressing them. In some cases, these little fig leaves actually make things worse.  Let's start with the fake fixes--first, mortgage discrimination. Mortgage discrimination is real in Some banks charge African Americans more for loans than they charge Whites with similar credit. Some deny loans to Latinos or to single women. How do we know that? Because banks have to disclose information about the loans they provide under something called the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, or Using HMDA data, a new report shows that in 61 different cities around the country, minority borrowers were more likely to be denied a mortgage than White borrowers with the same income. But this bill--the bill that is pending on the floor of the Senate--now exempts 85 percent of banks from reporting any HMDA data, making it much harder to discover and stamp out discrimination.  Senator Cortez Masto had a great idea for fixing this: Take the HMDA provision out of the pending bill. Leave HMDA alone. If the authors of this bill really wanted to fix this problem, they would support her amendment and insist that without that amendment, they would withdraw their support for the bill. But now the bill's supporters have a fig leaf. They say that of the 85 percent of banks that no longer will have to report information about discrimination, if one of those banks flunks two consecutive examinations under the Community Reinvestment Act, those banks will have to start reporting discrimination data. If that looks like a tiny little fig leaf, consider this: Banks get tested at most every 3 years, which means it would take 6 years of discrimination to flunk twice. This fig leaf is so small, it is basically invisible.  Now, for some of these so-called consumer protection fig leaves--the problems are real; it is just the solutions that are fake. For example, there is a provision to deal with private student loans from banks. It says that if a student loan borrower dies, then the bank can't go after the cosigner of the loan for the full balance. That sounds really good--at least until you read the fine print. It turns out that spouses don't count. So the bank will still be free to hound widows and widowers for the balances of their deceased spouses. And the loan isn't actually forgiven. That means the bank can still go after the dead borrower's estate for the loan, maybe take half of the house or take whatever is in the checking account or savings account. It is a nightmare for a grieving family--and it is also perfectly OK under this fig leaf amendment.  In some places, it isn't even a fig leaf that pretends to address problems with the bill; it is just new provisions to create new problems--like a section that blows a hole in regulators' ability to require banks to hold capital for commercial real estate. Does anyone remember that risky commercial real estate investments were a factor in Bear Stearns' failure 10 years ago this week? Does anyone remember that 6 months later, commercial real estate losses would help blow up Lehman Brothers? I guess not--at least not right here in Congress, because 10 years later--right now, this week--Congress wants to let banks take one more commercial real estate fix with less oversight.  Banks of all sizes are making record profits. Only in Washington would people think it is time to scrap the protections that have kept us safe for a decade, all so that these same profitable banks can make even more money. It is the same mindset that set the stage for the savings and loan crisis in the late 1980s and the financial crisis of 2008.  America's working families will pay the price if we make the same mistakes again. It isn't too late. We should stop this bill from becoming law.  Thank you, Madam  I yield the floor.

1901,topic-id,659,"Mr.President, I want to commend Senator Brown for leading the fight to oppose rollbacks for Wall Street banks. He has been tireless in the fight on behalf of Ohio families and on behalf of families all across this country, and I thank him very much for his work.  This is a tough fight. This week, nearly 10 years to the day after we first discovered that big banks crashed our economy, Washington is about to take many of those same giant banks off the government watch list. I doubt that this makes any sense to any of the millions of Americans who experienced firsthand the economic horrors of the financial collapse. Oh, but it makes perfect sense in Washington, where swarms of lobbyists seem to have the power to erase politicians' memories.  The Senate is debating a bill that would roll back the rules designed to protect consumers and prevent another economic meltdown. Yesterday I talked about how this bill scraps a lot of important consumer protections for American families buying homes. In addition to squeezing consumers, this bill also loosens our hold on some of the very same giant banks that wrecked our economy.  Ten years ago, a bunch of enormous banks got giant bailouts, while American consumers got a punch in the gut. The excuse in Washington was, well, these banks were so interconnected with one another and with the overall economy that the failure of one could bring down the rest of the system too. Too bad, they said, we have to bail them out. Individual families, however, could be crushed underfoot; they weren't big enough to be worth saving by  Congress passed a huge bailout, but to keep this from ever happening again, Congress decided to put the small number of American banks that control more than $50 billion in assets--this is about 40 of the largest banks in the country--on a watch list. Those banks would be subject to tougher Federal oversight and would be subject to some stronger rules to stop them from bringing down the economy again. A small bank in Adams, MA, would be regulated one way, and a giant bank, with offices around the country and around the globe, would get a much closer look. That makes real sense.  If this bill passes, Washington will scrap those rules for 25 of those enormous banks. Under this bill, a bank that controls up to a quarter of a trillion dollars in assets and has offices around the country and around the globe will follow the same rules and regulations and have the same oversight as a tiny little bank in Adams, That is great if you are a quarter-of-a-trillion-dollar bank but not so great for anyone else.  This bill isn't about restrictions on asset measures and investments. It is not about appropriate leverage ratios and proprietary trading. It is about keeping hard-working American families from getting crushed by another financial crisis. It is about a Congress that isn't here to do the bidding of quarter-trillion-dollar banks. It is about a Congress that is supposed to be working for the American people.  Right after the financial crisis, before I ever thought about running for the Senate, Congress put me in charge of an independent panel that was supposed to police the bailout money. We held hearings around the country to talk to people who had been punched in the gut by the financial crisis.  I will never forget one witness I met at a hearing in Las His name was Mr.He was a father of two little girls, and he wore a jacket over his T-shirt. He had on a red U.Marine Corps baseball cap. He and his wife both worked. They stretched their budget to buy a home that would get their girls into a good school, and the house was right across the street from their school.

1242,topic-id,1647,"Mr.President, I will be joined by a series of my colleagues who are coming to the floor this afternoon to talk about the November 2018 elections coming up and the steps we need to take to make sure that the Russian influence effort that bedeviled our 2016 election is not replicated in the 2018 election.  I guess the first question to answer is, Is this a realistic prospect? Is this something we should concern ourselves with--that the Russians would come back again in 2018 and try to meddle in our elections?  Everyone in the Trump administration who has been asked about this, perhaps outside of the Oval Office itself, has said: Yes, absolutely. They are coming. The Director of the CIA, the Director of National Intelligence, the head of the FBI, the Attorney General, the Department of Justice--there is no contest. There is no disagreement. There is no doubt, even among the President's senior national security and law enforcement team that they are coming back, that they are going to do this again. That leads us to the question of what we are doing about it.  It seems that the silence from the Oval Office on this subject is deafening. The White House doesn't ever want to talk about doing anything about this. To the extent that we get signals from tweets and things like that, they are usually nonfactual and highly politicized challenges to the basic facts that all of the President's senior Cabinet staff seem to agree with.  I don't know why they haven't sorted out why the President says one thing and all of his Cabinet officials say something else, but that is for them. What is for us is to review this in Congress, to do oversight, and to do what legislation might be necessary to raise our defenses to make sure that we can effectively counter what we have been warned is coming at us.  We have no proposal from the administration. One would think with something like this, where we have an election that has been attacked by a hostile foreign country--one would think that would be the kind of thing that would bring our country together and would get the President's attention. He swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution, and last I heard, the elections are a part of our Yet there is nothing--crickets.  Where is the proposal? Where are the congressional hearings on our proposals? Where are the markups? Where are the bills? We are seeing an extraordinary lack of interest and initiative in something about which we have been very forcefully warned.  The failure at the White House is very profound. Over and over again, we have heard senior Trump officials say that they have not been instructed by the President to take this seriously. My senior colleague, Senator Jack Reed, asked Director Chris Wray of the FBI about whether the FBI had taken specific actions to confront and blunt Russian influence and disinformation activities. On February 13, in the Senate Intelligence Committee, he said, ``not as specifically directed by the President, no.''  To read the transcript more completely, Senator Reed asked:       So let me begin with Mr.Wray and say, has the President      directed you and your agency to take specific actions to      confront and blunt Russian influence activities that are      ongoing?       Wray: We're taking a lot of specific efforts to blunt      Russian . . .       Reed: . . . directed by the President?       Wray: Not--not as specifically directed by the President,      no.  Similarly, 2 weeks later, February 27, in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, the NSA's Director, ADM Mike Rogers, said that he had not been granted the authority nor directed specifically by the President to take action to disrupt Russian election hacking operations.  Again, Senator Reed asked:       So, you would need, basically, to be directed by the      President, through the Secretary of Defense, to get--  Rogers interrupts:       Yes, sir, as I--I mentioned that in my statement.       Reed: Have you been directed to do so, given the strategic      threat that faces the United States and the significant      consequences you recognize already?       Rogers: No, I have not.  There is a lot of room for improvement here. You can also add to this list the failures of activity at the State Department, which was allocated $120 million to counter foreign efforts to meddle in elections to sow distrust in democracy. According to the March 4 story in the New York Times:       Not one of the 23 analysts working in the department's      Global Engagement Center--which has been tasked with      countering Moscow's disinformation campaign--speaks Russian,      and a department hiring freeze has hindered efforts to      recruit the computer experts needed to track the Russian      efforts.  So when Congress provides $120 million to the State Department to take steps to protect against Russian election interference, what we get back is that none of that money gets spent, and a hiring freeze prevents the people with the necessary qualifications from even coming in to do the job. That is not taking the problem seriously--not at the FBI, not at the NSA, and not at the State  As far as I can tell, there actually is no formal executive branch interagency process that is designed to examine what the Russians did and put together legislative recommendations for Congress to follow up on. In national security matters, that is the President's role; that is the executive branch's role. We have the authority to make the laws, but because they are doing the day-to-day work, we count on the executive branch to put the proposals together for us. And again, there is nothing.  There is one thing that we did do. We wanted to send a strong signal to Vladimir Putin that there was a price to be paid for this kind of misbehavior--manipulating our elections. We voted, virtually unanimously, in this Chamber, 98 to 2. I don't know the numbers on the House side, but it was equally virtually unanimous on the House side.  It was 98 to 2 here in the We passed tough sanctions to hit Vladimir Putin where it hurts, which is right in the oligarchs. That is what he cares about, the oligarchs who support him, the oligarchs whose corrupt enterprises he has corruptly engaged with. That whole racketeering enterprise that runs the Russian Government is what the sanctions would go after.  Well, the administration has refused to implement them. The State Department has said that they are not needed. Not needed? We are hearing from all of the Trump administration's own senior executive agencies that they are going to come and do this again in 2018. How are they not needed if this is no deterrence for what they did in 2016? It would be one thing to say they are not needed if the evidence was: OK, they got the message. They are not going to do this again. We are fine in 2018.  But that is not what Trump's own Cabinet officials and national intelligence leaders are telling us. They are telling us that they are needed because they are coming at us again. So this added bit of deterrence would be very important.  When it came to something as simple as putting together the list of targeted oligarchs to put maximum pressure on President Putin, they didn't even put a list together on their own; they went to Forbes magazine and took the list out of a public magazine. That doesn't look like a serious or conscientious effort.  So right up and down the administration, you see failure to take this seriously traceable directly to the White House, and that is very, very regrettable.  The other thing that we don't know is what the White House has been up to with respect to There was a lot of talk early on about how we needed to have an independent committee to take a look at this, to be independent, to put together a package of reforms, observations, and recommendations, and we have had no[[Page S1369]]support for doing that. What we were told was: Don't worry. Work through the committees.  Well, the committees aren't doing much, to tell you the truth. It is like the gavels are made out of foam rubber around here. We could do a lot better, and there is no independent commission.  It raises the question, what was the role of the White House? What was the role of the President in stopping an independent commission? How active were they in doing that? Those are questions that need answers, but obviously, if there aren't serious investigative processes going on in our committees, it is hard to get those answers.  Here is another question: What was the role of the White House in coordinating or colluding with the House Intelligence Committee--with Representative Nunez and/or his staff--in preparation for the so-called Nunez memo?  We have learned a lot about that memo since it came out. We have learned that it was essentially phony. It had a couple of basic accusations. One was that the FBI had misled the FISA They were misled that one of the sources that supported the affidavit that got the FISA warrant for the surveillance of Carter Page--that one of those sources had been in touch with or had been funded by a political campaign; that this was a phony effort cooked up on behalf of the Clinton campaign and run before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance  Well, as it turns out, the FISA application stated specifically the FBI's speculation that the source, Steele, had been hired to ``find information that could be used to discredit Candidate #1's campaign''--Trump's campaign. As somebody who has pursued affidavits for search warrants and for surveillance warrants before, I can tell you that it is common and standard FBI and Department of Justice practice to leave out unnecessary names.

1419,topic-id,416,"Mr.President, let me thank the Senator from  Like Wisconsin, Rhode Island has a one-word motto as well. Hers is ``Forward.'' Ours is ``Hope.'' Together, they point in the right direction.  Americans are dissatisfied. Opinion surveys tell us that only 35 percent of Americans believe our country is headed in the right direction. Why this alarming dissatisfaction? We don't have to guess. Popular opinion tells us quite plainly. In a survey taken after the 2016 election, 85 percent of voters agreed that the wealthy and big corporations were the ones really running the country. That includes 80 percent of voters who supported It is not just opinion. Academic studies have looked at Congress and confirmed that the views of the general public have statistically near zero influence here--that we listen to big, corporate special interests and their various front groups.  Even our Supreme Court is not immune. In a 2014 poll, more respondents believed, by 9 to 1, that our Supreme[[Page S1680]]Court favors corporations over individuals rather than vice versa. Even among self-identified conservative Republicans, it was still a 4-to-1 margin.  So hold that thought: The wealthy and powerful corporations control Congress, and people know it.  As I give my 200th ``Time to Wake Up'' speech, the most obvious fact standing plainly before me is not the measured sea level rise at Naval Station Newport; it is not the 400 parts per million carbon dioxide barrier we have broken through in the atmosphere; it is not the new flooding maps that coastal communities like Rhode Island's must face; it is not the West aflame; it is not even the uniform consensus about climate change across universities, National Laboratories, scientific societies, and even across our military and intelligence services, which warn us, as Senator Reed indicated, that climate change is fueling economic and social disruption around the world.  The fact that stands out for me, here at 200, is the persistent failure of Congress to even take up the issue of climate change. One party will not even talk about it. One party in the executive branch is even gagging America's scientists and civil servants and striking the term ``climate change'' off of government websites. In the real world, in actual reality, we are long past any question as to the reality of climate change. The fact of that forces us to confront the questions: What stymies Congress from legislating or from even having hearings about climate change? What impels certain executive agencies to forbid even the words?  ",CREC-2018-03-13-pt1-PgS1656-2.txt,1823,REPACK AIRWAVES YIELDING BETTER ACCESS FOR USERS OF MODERN SERVICES ACT,2018.0,13.0,March
1421,topic-id,2375,"I intend to give my remarks, but I appreciate the Senator's intervention.  Before the Citizens United decision was delivered up by the five Republican appointees on the Supreme Court--a decision, by the way, that deserves a place on the trash heap of judicial history--we were actually doing quite a lot about climate change in the There were bipartisan hearings. There were bipartisan bills. There were bipartisan negotiations. Senator McCain campaigned for President under the Republican banner on a strong climate platform.  What happened? Here is what I saw happen: The fossil fuel industry went over and importuned the Supreme Court for the Citizens United decision; the five Republican-appointed judges on the Court delivered the Citizens United decision; and the fossil fuel industry was ready and set at the mark when that decision came down.  Since the moment of that decision, not one Republican in this body has joined one serious piece of legislation to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Our Senate heartbeat of bipartisan activity was killed dead by the political weaponry unleashed for big special interests by those five judges.  The fossil fuel industry then made a clever play. It determined to control one party on this question. It determined to silence or punish or remove any dissent in one political party. This created for the fossil fuel industry two advantages.  First, it got to use that party as its tool to stop climate legislation, and it has. Remember the movie ``Men in Black''? I would make the analogy that today's Republican Party bears the same relation to the fossil fuel industry as to climate change that the unfortunate farmer in ``Men in Black'' bore to the alien who killed him and occupied his skin for the rest of the movie--complete occupation with nothing left but the skin.  The second advantage for the fossil fuel industry is that it could camouflage its own special interest special pleading as partisanship and not just the muscle and greed of one very big industry that wanted to have its way.  That is why we are where we are. That is why one's talking to Republicans about climate change resembles one's talking to prisoners about escape. They may want out, but they can't have their fossil fuel wardens find out.  Climate change is a prime example of how our institutions are failing in plain view of the American people. It is a small wonder the public holds Congress in low esteem and thinks we don't listen to them. Frankly, it is amazing that there is any shred of esteem remaining given our behavior.  Congress remains a democratic body on the surface with all the procedural veneer and trappings of democracy as we hold votes and as there are caucuses and hearings. Yet, on issues like climate change, which most concern the biggest special interests, Congress no longer provides America a truly functioning democracy.  Underneath the illusory democratic surface runs subterranean rivers of dark money. Massive infrastructures have been erected to hide that dark money flow from the sunlight of public scrutiny to carve out subterranean caverns through which the dark money flows.  If you want to understand why we do nothing on climate, you have to look down into those subterranean chambers, understand the dark money, and not be fooled by the surface spectacle. Of course, it is not just the spending of dark money that is the problem. When you let unlimited money loose in politics, particularly once you let unlimited dark money loose in politics, you empower something even more sinister than massive anonymous political expenditures; you empower the threat of massive anonymous political expenditures--the sinister whispered threat. Once you let a special interest spend unlimited dark money, you necessarily let it threaten or promise to spend that money.  Those sinister threats and promises will be harder to detect even than the most obscured dark money expenditures. You may not know who is behind a big dark money expenditure, but at least you will see it. You will see the smear ads. You may not know what is up, but you will know something is up. But a threat? A couple of people, a back room, and a silent handshake are enough. If you give a thug a big enough club, he doesn't even have to use it to get his way. This is the great, insidious evil of Citizens United, and this, I believe, is why we are where we are.  In the Gilded Age, the Senate was described as having Senators who didn't actually represent States but ``principalities and powers in business.'' One Senator represents the Union Pacific Railway system, another the New York Central, still another the insurance interests of New York and New We cannot pretend it is impossible for the United States to be disabled and corrupted by special interests. Our history refutes that thought. So, as Americans, we need to keep our guard up against corrupting forces, and this unlimited dark flow of money into our politics is a corrupting force.  Congress's embarrassing and culpable failure to act on climate change is one face of a coin. Turn it over, and the obverse of that coin is corruption exactly as the Founding Fathers knew it--the public good ignored for special interests' wielding power. In this case, it is the power of money--climate failure, dark money; dark money, climate failure. They are two sides of the same evil coin. If that thought is not cheerful enough, wait. There is more.  There is the phony science operation that gives rhetorical cover to the dark money political muscle operation. This phony science operation is a big effort, with dozens of well-funded front groups that participate that are supported by bogus think tanks, well described as the ``think tank as the disguised political weapon.''  Today's phony science operation has a history. It grew out of the early phony science operation run by the tobacco industry, which was set up to create doubt among the public that cigarettes were bad for you. How did that work out? I will tell you how. That effort was so false and so evil that it was determined in court to be fraud--a massive corporate-led fraud.  After the tobacco fraud apparatus was exposed, it didn't disappear. It morphed into an even more complex apparatus to create false doubt about climate science. The goal, exactly like the tobacco companies' fraud, is to create something that looks enough like science to confuse the public but which has the perverse purpose of defeating and neutralizing real science. It is a science denial apparatus. By the way, this fossil fuel-funded science denial apparatus has some big advantages over real science.  First, the science denial apparatus has unlimited money behind it. The IMF has put the subsidy of the fossil fuel industry at $700 billion per year in the United States alone. To defend a $700 billion annual subsidy, you can spend enormous amounts of money, so money is no object.[[Page S1681]]  Second, the science denial apparatus doesn't waste time with peer review--the touchstone of real science. Slap a lab coat on a hack, and send him to the talk shows. That is enough. The science denial apparatus is public relations dressed up as science so it behaves like public relations and goes straight to its market--an inexpert public--to work its mischief.  Third, it has the advantage of Madison Avenue tacticians to shape its phony message into appealing sound bites for the public. Have you read a scientific journal lately? The Madison Avenue message gets through a lot more sharply.  Fourth, the science denial apparatus doesn't need to stop lying when it is caught. As long as it is getting its propaganda out, the truth doesn't matter. This is not a contest for truth; it is a contest for public opinion. So debunked, zombie arguments constantly rise from the Earth and walk again.  Finally, it doesn't have to win the argument. It just has to create the illusion, the false illusion, that there is a legitimate argument. Then the political muscle those five Justices gave this industry can go to work.  I suggest, 200 speeches in, that it is time we stopped listening to the industry that comes to us bearing one of the most flagrant conflicts of interest in history. It is time we stopped listening to their fraudulent science denial operation. It is time we put the light of day on this creepy dark money operation and stopped listening to its threats and promises.  If we are going to stop listening to all of that, whom should we listen to? How about Pope Francis, who called climate change ``one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day.'' How about the scientists--we pay hundreds of them across our government--whose salaries our appropriators are funding right now and who, under President Trump, released this report? This report reads that there is ``no convincing alternative explanation'' for what it calls ``global, long-term, and unambiguous warming'' and ``record-breaking, climate-related weather extremes.'' It is our human activity.  How about listening to our intelligence services, whose ``Worldwide Threat Assessment,'' issued under President Trump and signed by our former colleague, the Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, actually has a chapter titled ``Environment and Climate Change.'' Here are the identified consequences in that report: ``humanitarian disasters, conflict, water and food shortages, population migration, labor shortfalls, price shocks, and power outages,'' and most dangerously, the prospect of--and I quote the ``Worldwide Threat Assessment'' here--``tipping points in climate-linked earth systems'' that can create ``abrupt climate change.''  Or how about listening to Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Jr., and Ivanka Trump, Eric Trump, and the Trump organization in 2009, when they took out this full-page ad in the New York Times saying that the science of climate change was ``irrefutable,'' and its consequences would be ``catastrophic and irreversible.'' Donald Trump, chairman and president--where did that guy go?  How about listening to our own home State universities. Every one of us can go home to Old Miss or Ohio State, to the University of Alaska or LSU, to Utah State or West Virginia University or Texas A&We can each go home to our home State's State university. They don't just accept climate change; they teach it. They teach it.  If you can listen quietly, you can listen to the oceans. They speak to us, the oceans do. They speak to us through thermometers, and they say: We are warming. They speak to us through tide gauges, and they say: We are rising along your shores. They speak to us through the howl of hurricanes powered up by their warmer sea surfaces. They speak to us through the quiet flight of fish species from their traditional grounds as the seawater warms beyond their tolerance.  If we know how to listen, through simple pH tests, the oceans will tell us that they are acidifying. The oceans will tell us that they are beginning to kill their own corals and oysters and pteropods. We can go out and check and see the corals and the oysters and the pteropods corrode and die before our eyes. It is happening.  The fishermen who plow the oceans' surface can speak for the oceans. As one Rhode Islander said to me: ``Sheldon, it's getting weird out there.''  ``This is not my grandfather's ocean,'' said another. He had grown up trawling with his granddad on those oceans.  It is not just oceans. I went on Lake Erie with seasoned, professional fishermen who told me that everything they had learned in a lifetime on the lake was useless because the lake was changing on them so unknowably fast.  We choose here in Congress to whom we are going to listen, and it is time we started to listen to the honest voices and the true voices. If you don't like environmentalists or scientists, listen to your ski industry. Listen to your fishermen and lumbermen. Listen to your gardeners and birders and hunters. Listen to those who know the Earth and the oceans and who can speak for the Earth and the oceans.  It is an evil mess we are in, and if there is any justice in this world, there will one day be a terrible price to pay if we keep listening to evil voices.  The climate change problems we are causing by failing to act are a sin, as Pope Francis has flatly declared, but that is not the only sin. To jam Congress up, fossil fuel interests are interfering with and corrupting American democracy, and to corrupt American democracy is a second and a grave sin.  The science denial apparatus--to mount a fraudulent challenge to the very enterprise of science, that is a third grave sin.  Perhaps worst of all is that the world is watching. It is watching us as the fossil fuel industry, its creepy billionaires, its front groups, its bogus think tanks all gang up and debauch our democracy.  From John Winthrop to Ronald Reagan, we have held America up as a city on a hill, with the eyes of the world upon us. From  Daniel Webster to Bill Clinton, we have spoken of the power of our American example as greater in the world than any example of our power. Lady Liberty in New York Harbor holds her lamp up to the world, representing our American beacon of truth, justice, and democracy.  I have a distinct memory, traveling with our friend John McCain to Manila and waking up early in the morning to go visit our American military cemetery, the Sun coming up over the rows of white gravestones standing over our dead, the massive, gleaming marble arcade of names, carved on walls stretching high over my head, of the Americans whose bodies were never recovered--over 17,000 in all, remembered in that cemetery.  After their sacrifice, after the accomplishments of the ``greatest generation,'' can we not do better than to sell our democracy to the fossil fuel industry? What do you suppose a monument to that would look like? I wonder.  America deserves better, and the world is watching us; we, this city on a hill.

1716,topic-id,1295,"Mr.President, it has been the Senator from Idaho whose leadership has driven this bill forward more than anything else, and I express my great appreciation to him for the opportunity to work with him to accomplish this success.  Like Senator Crapo, I want to recognize our colleagues in this effort, Senators Risch, Booker, Durbin, and I particularly thank Senator Murkowski because she is the chair of the Senate Energy Committee, and she and Senator Cantwell together cleared this bill, so we could bring it to the floor, and gave it the blessing of their committee.  I also thank Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma, who has been a strong supporter of our efforts at nuclear modernization, and I ask unanimous consent that a U.News & World Report editorial, which Senator Crapo wrote with Senator Inhofe, Senator Booker, and me, be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  I thank Senator Alexander from Tennessee--the home of Oak Ridge, the other National Lab that focuses so much in this area--who has been a constant advocate and has been very interested in all things nuclear for a very long time.  This bill, the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act, has been so well summarized by Senator Crapo that I will not go back and resummarize it, but I will emphasize that it is our intention that it provide an opening for nuclear innovation into next-generation, third-generation, even fourth-generation nuclear technologies, with the goal that we can compete effectively internationally to be the producers of clean and safe nuclear energy, with the hope--and at this point I think it is somewhere between a hope and a prospect--that this technology will develop to the point where we can begin to look at our existing nuclear waste stockpile and use these new technologies to turn hazardous and dangerous nuclear waste, for which we have no present plan, into something that is valuable and can help create energy. We need to work on how to price that because, at present, there is no mechanism that provides any value to someone who might have a solution to that problem for lifting this cost off of our books. But that is something Senator Crapo, Senator Alexander, Senator Inhofe, Senator Booker, Senator Murkowski, and I can continue to work on. That, I think, is a really valuable prospect in all of this, and it is one of the things that moves me to do this.  Let me close by thanking Senator Crapo for also working with me on NEIMA, the Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act, which we are still working to get passed but which we hope will get passed. It parallels very nicely with this legislation because what that would do is get the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to update its permitting process to accommodate new technologies.  When I am asked what I mean by that, I use a very rough example, which is that the current light water reactor permitting process makes about as much sense as the test for these new technologies as taking a Tesla and having it pass the DMV carburetor requirements. It is a new technology; it requires a different testing regime. Our other bill would authorize and require the NRC to update and work with the innovation community to make sure that when these things are ready for permitting, permitting is, in fact, ready for them.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From U.News & World Report, July 11, 2016]                      The New Nuclear Renaissance    (By Jim Inhofe, Sheldon Whitehouse, Mike Crapo and Cory Booker)       There has been a groundswell of activity and investment in      recent years surrounding advanced nuclear reactors. A dynamic      group of nuclear engineers and scientists are chasing the      future--and racing against China and Russia--to develop      innovative reactor designs. These technologies hold enormous      promise to provide clean, safe, affordable, and reliable      energy, not just for our country, but for the world. These      innovators have a vision for the future, and they charge      ahead backed by more than $1 billion in private capital. The      future of nuclear energy is bright.       Some would argue that we have been here before. In 2005,      Congress passed incentives to encourage a ``nuclear      renaissance'' amid high natural gas prices. The industry      stood ready to build a large number of modern light-water      reactors, improved versions of existing nuclear technology.       But reality fell short of expectations and the result was      only five new nuclear plants, with a price tag of $8 billion      to $10 billion each. Now, in an age of low-cost natural gas,      it is becoming harder for the nearly 100 existing reactors to      compete. The Energy Information Administration calculates      that electricity generation from a new nuclear plant would      cost about 25 percent more than electricity from a new gas-     fired combined-[[Page S1423]]     cycle power plant. This is causing some nuclear energy      companies to scale back their operations. For instance,      Chicago-based Exelon Corporation announced just a few weeks      ago that it would shutter two of its nuclear plants in      Illinois in the coming years, citing pressure from natural      gas as a major factor.       So this begs the question: Will this new wave of innovative      reactors live up to its promise? Investors think so, and so      do we. For starters, these advanced reactors differ      significantly from their predecessors. Rather than water,      they use materials like molten salt or noble gasses as      coolants. Most are considered ``walk away safe,'' since they      are designed to use the laws of physics, rather than      equipment, to prevent accidents. If a natural disaster      strikes, for instance, these reactors would simply shut down,      substantially reducing the threat of a a meltdown. Many are      designed to be small and modular, so they could be built in      factories with construction costs that are a fraction of      their big, custom-built forerunners. Small reactors could      also be plugged into future micro-grid systems without      requiring extensive transmission infrastructure. Some of      these new reactor technologies could actually help to reduce      the amount of nuclear waste we've accumulated through the      years by using that waste as fuel. That could alleviate a      major challenge facing the industry. And of course, all of      this would be achieved without any air pollution.       Nuclear energy used to be just another partisan issue.      Thankfully, that is changing. The four of us represent      opposite ends of the political spectrum in the Senate, but we      are all pulling in the same direction, backing various pieces      of legislation to promote advanced nuclear innovation and      development. One bill would open the doors of our national      laboratories to entrepreneurs and their innovative new      companies to develop public-private partnerships with the      potential to bring new ideas to market. Another bill looks to      build a sensible regulatory framework to allow diverse      advanced reactor concepts to go from the drawing board to      reality.       These bills have been moving through Congress and are      garnering broad bipartisan support. The Nuclear Energy      Innovation Capabilities Act recently passed the Senate as      part of a bipartisan energy bill, on an 87-4 vote. The      Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act was approved      by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on a 17-     3 vote.       Though we may come to this issue for different reasons, our      end goal is the same. We want to promote new technologies      that provide cleaner energy and get them built by and for      We can't take a back seat as China and Russia      build test reactors and lure away American innovators. This      new nuclear renaissance is primed for success. It has broad      bipartisan support in Congress, serious private capital      investment and the ability to help address environmental      challenges--all while encouraging American innovation. The      world is heading into a new age of nuclear energy, and the      United States must lead the way.  ",CREC-2018-03-07-pt1-PgS1419.txt,1823,"LINN, AND MATTHEW BELLINA",2018.0,7.0,March

1903,topic-id,2276,"Mr.President, the reason ``I came to speak on the floor [right now is to talk] about an issue that many in Washington would prefer to ignore; that is, [the] climate changes that are being caused by our carbon pollution.''  That is how I began these speeches, with that sentence, on April 18, 2012, from this desk. I have returned week after week to try to make sure there would not be silence in the Senate on the climate crisis. This is my 199th weekly foray; next week will make it an even 200.  Back on that April Wednesday in 2012, debate about climate change had all but died in Just a few years prior, the House of Representatives had passed the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill, led by our colleague, now the Senator from In this body, Republican colleagues had openly acknowledged the existence of climate change and called for legislative action to cut carbon emissions. Since John Chafee, climate change had been a bipartisan concern.  In 2010, came the Supreme Court's disastrous Citizens United decision, which allowed the fossil fuel industry to unleash limitless dark money on our elections. The polluters' money and threats cast a shadow across any Republican who might work on carbon pollution, and it ended that bipartisanship.  When I gave that first speech, even the White House had thrown in the towel on climate change, after letting Waxman-Markey die on the vine. You couldn't get them to put the words ``climate'' and ``change'' in the same paragraph, at least not until the President engaged on this issue in his speech in June of 2013. Washington had gone dark on climate.  I knew I couldn't match the financial muscle of the big polluters, but I believed if anything was going to change around here, we would need to shine a little light on the facts and on the sophisticated scheme of denial being perpetrated by the polluters. I decided to put at least my little light to work, and I started these speeches.  The last 6 years, unfortunately, have offered no shortage of bad climate news and dubious milestones. This chart shows the 4 hottest years ever recorded have occurred since I began giving these speeches. Global warming is, of course, driven by the buildup of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.  When I gave the first ``Time to Wake Up'' speech in April 2012, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere was 396 parts per million. Today, it is at 408. It has never been so high in the history of the human species. It is not just the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that has been rising. So has the sea, as warming seawater expands and glaciers melt, making our coasts--particularly in my Ocean State--ever more vulnerable to flooding and storms. The oceans are becoming more acid, as ocean water reacts chemically with the heightened carbon concentration in the atmosphere.  During the 6 years I have been giving these speeches, the United States has experienced more and more extreme weather events, many of which scientists tell us are linked to climate change: from deadly storms, including 2012's Hurricane Sandy and 2017's Harvey, Irma, and Maria, to California's record drought and wildfires, to temperatures so warm in the Alaskan Arctic that the computer algorithms thought the thermometer had broken.  In 2017 alone, the string of U.extreme weather disasters--six major hurricanes, wildfires in the West, catastrophic mudslides, temperature records breaking all over the country--caused well north of $300 billion in damage and killed more than 300 people. The last 6 years provide us with a menacing preview of things to come.  Scientists, including scientists at all of our home State universities, say these changes are driven by carbon pollution. Our national security leaders warn of the increasing danger of international strife caused by climate change, as well as the threat to U.military facilities and force readiness.  Faith leaders urge us to protect creation and those less fortunate than we are, led by Pope Francis, who, on this, has been magnificent. The insurance and credit rating industries, whose business models depend on accurate and responsible assessment of risk, warn us, as do major American corporations and leading investors--folks who can't let climate politics interfere with their bottom lines. I have spoken about them all.  I also visited States across the country to see for myself and to talk to people firsthand--folks who know climate change is real because they see it[[Page S1430]]where they live, because they study it. In North Carolina, business leaders were organizing to protect the local coastal economy from climate change and associated sea level rise. In South Carolina, tide gauges in Charleston were up over 10 inches since the 1920s. In Georgia, I went out on the water with a clammer who showed me how changes in climate are hurting his livelihood. In Florida, the Army Corps of Engineers officials in Jacksonville gave a dire presentation of what the sea level rise portends for the Sunshine In Ohio, I saw the ice cores from faraway glaciers that record our looming climate catastrophe.  In Utah, the ski resorts fear climate change will ruin their ``greatest snow on Earth.'' I know the Presiding Officer takes pride in Utah's greatest snow on In Pennsylvania, child health specialists from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia see climate change worsening children's asthma. In Iowa, Des Moines Water Works was busy preparing the city for more frequent and severe climate-driven flooding. In Arizona, they are changing the staffing for emergency responders facing summer temperatures the human body cannot sustain. New Hampshire is forecasting that its State bird may no longer be seen as its range moves ever northward out of New Hampshire on our warming planet.  I traveled on to Texas, Iowa, Nebraska, Delaware, and more. I brought stories to this floor from every corner of the country, hoping colleagues would heed the warnings from their own home States, to match what I was hearing from Rhode Island, from Rhode Island's coastal towns and scientists and fishermen: ``Sheldon, it's getting weird out there,'' I was told. ``It's not my grandfather's ocean.''  Many Democratic colleagues joined me to discuss the changes they see in their home States, including 30 colleagues who held the floor all night long in 2014.  In July of 2016, 18 Senators and I took to the Senate floor for days to expose the fossil fuel-funded front groups that were behind the campaign to deny climate science and stymie legislative action. There is a whole carefully built apparatus: phony-baloney front groups that are designed to look and sound like they are real; messages honed by public relations experts to sound like they are truthful; scientists on the fossil fuel payroll whom polluters can trot out as needed.  This industry-fueled misinformation campaign has been a theme of these speeches. I relayed the findings of researchers who study the flow of money through the climate denial network and the journalists who uncovered Exxon's coverup of what they knew of the climate dangers. I compared the fossil fuel polluter playbook to the fraudulent tactics of the tobacco industry to bury the truth about the health effects of cigarettes.  I listened to conservative economists and offered market-based solutions. Back in March 2013, I described the market failure of carbon pollution's not being baked into the price of the product. Market economics doesn't work when corporations can just offload their costs onto the general public. It is called a negative externality in economics jargon, and we see it all around us in storm-damaged homes and flooded cities, in drought-stricken farms and raging wildfires. The big oil companies and the coal barons have offloaded those costs onto society.  Virtually every Republican who has thought the climate change problem through to a solution comes to the same place: put a price on carbon emissions; let the market work; and return the revenues to the American public. This concept is supported by a who's who of former Republican Cabinet officials and Presidential economic advisers. I listened, and, in November 2014, I introduced with Senator Schatz the American Opportunity Carbon Fee Act to establish an economywide fee on carbon dioxide, return all of the revenue to the American public, correct the market failure, promote energy innovation, and, of course, dramatically reduce carbon pollution.  I have seen over the years of these speeches that the landscape is shifting. The Senate has actually held votes that show that a majority here believes climate change is real, not a hoax, and is driven by human activity. It took years, but I guess that counts for progress around here.  Outside of Congress, the Paris Agreement in 2015 committed the nations of the world to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius by reducing carbon emissions. America's part was the Clean Power Plan--to reduce carbon emissions from the power sector by one-third by 2030 from 2005 levels.  Automakers adopted new fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks in 2012. Vehicles would get nearly 55 miles per gallon by 2025, saving consumers billions of dollars while eliminating billions of tons of carbon emissions.  The EPA issued new rules in 2016 to limit the flaring of methane--a much more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide--at oil and gas wells, and the Obama administration helped negotiate the Kigali Amendment to phase out the use of hydrofluorocarbons, which have powerful greenhouse gas heat-trapping properties in the atmosphere. Secretary Kerry convened wildly successful international oceans conferences, which are still ongoing and are scheduled for years ahead, to address the warming and the acidification of the seas.  In sum, up through 2016, even if Congress had been trapped in fossil fuel muck, the United States had still been making slow but steady progress on climate policy. Then Trump was elected President, and he decided to see if he could reverse all of this.  He announced that he would withdraw the United States from the Paris He put the three stooges of fossil fuel--Scott Pruitt, Ryan Zinke, and Rick Perry--in charge of climate policy. Trump completely forgot his and his family's own words from a full-page New York Times advertisement in 2009, calling climate change ``irrefutable'' and portending ``catastrophic and irreversible consequences.'' That was Donald Trump and his family in 2009.  As bad as the news became coming out of Washington, we saw action around the country to give us some reason for optimism. The leadership void left by the Trump administration was filled by State and local governments, businesses, academic institutions, and faith organizations which pledged to honor the Paris California and Washington State joined with Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Mexico to announce a plan to put a price on carbon that would reach virtually up and down the entire west coast of the  Over management opposition, BlackRock, the great investment firm, helped force ExxonMobil to report its climate risk to its shareholders. Moody's announced it will start using climate risk in rating the bonds of coastal communities. Companies like Microsoft and Unilever adopted an internal carbon price to help them reduce the carbon intensity of their operations.  At heart, this is a battle of truth versus lies, and courts are a good forum for the truth. California municipalities as well as New York City have sued fossil fuel companies, under State law, over the huge adaptation costs they will have to bear from sea level rise and extreme weather. The State attorneys general in Massachusetts and New York are pursuing a fraud investigation into what ExxonMobil has been covering up about its fossil fuels.  So there you have it. Over the last 6 years, we are ever more aware of the accelerating pace of climate change and ever more aware of the terrible threat that rising seas, increased temperatures, and more frequent extreme weather events pose. It has become harder and harder for the fossil fuel industry and the web of front groups and Trump administration officials who do its bidding to claim there is nothing to see here, folks, that it is all a hoax, and to move along.  Yet, despite all of the information and all of the evidence, this great institution--the U.Senate--continues to sit silent, paralyzed by the threats of retribution that come from the fossil fuel lobby. When this started, I had hoped we would never get to 100--let alone 199--of these speeches. We ought to have solved this years ago. It is a disgrace that we haven't, and it is a disgrace as to why we haven't. If we remain as ineffective as we have been during the last 6 years, we will have failed ourselves and all future generations.  America deserves better than this. A city on a hill, with the eyes of the[[Page S1431]]world upon it, can ill afford to ignore such a problem--worse still when the reason is one all-powerful industry that demands obedience. America deserves better. The countries and people around the world who rely on and look to American leadership deserve better. At long last, it is time for us to wake up here and meet our responsibilities.

While she is here, may I thank her for her work in clearing the nuclear innovation bill that Senator Crapo and I passed into law this afternoon by unanimous consent.

Signed by Phyllis Anderson, Tribal  Back in December of 1937, Thad Cochran was born in the little town of Pontotoc, MS, population 1,832. He was born in the delivery room of the Rayburn Some 13\1/2\ years later, I was born in the delivery room of the Rayburn Clinic in Pontotoc,  During the campaign, some years later in 1994, when I was first trying to be a Member of the House of Representatives, Senator Thad Cochran and I went around the northern part of the State and told many people that he and I were born not only in the same town and not only in the same clinic but born in the same room, the delivery room of the Rayburn We thought that was the truth. As it turned out, we found out later from our moms, the Rayburn Clinic had moved down the street; so while we were both born in the delivery room of Rayburn Clinic, that clinic itself had moved. It just points out how long Senator Thad Cochran and I have been friends and how long our families have been friends and how well associated we have been down through the years.  Senator Alexander mentioned that campaign in 1968, and then he mentioned that he was a candidate for Congress successfully in 1972. I was honored, as a college student, to go door-to-door for Senator Cochran during that 1972 campaign.  Yesterday was National Poetry Perhaps it is appropriate for me, today, to quote a couple of poets, the first being Henry Wadsworth Longfellow who said:     Lives of great men all remind us     We can make our lives sublime;     And departing, leave behind us     Footprints on the sands of time.  As Thad Cochran departs the Senate in a few days, I think it is appropriate for us to reflect, as my friend from Tennessee and my friend from Texas have already done, and as others will do, about the great footprints Senator Thad Cochran will have left in the sands of time for our  Because of Thad Cochran, our Nation's defense is stronger today.  Because of the efforts of our colleague from Mississippi, my senior Senator, Americans are healthier today and will continue to be healthier.  American agriculture is stronger today because of the efforts of this ``quiet persuader'' in the field of agriculture; and our economy, as a whole, is stronger because of the many efforts of Senator Thad Cochran and before that, Representative Thad Cochran in the U. I am just very grateful. We are all grateful for all he has done.  Senator Cochran acknowledged in his statement about his impending retirement that health had become an issue for him, and it was time to move on.  I told reporters and I told Members who asked me--I said it is a bittersweet moment, it is a poignant moment for me to hear such things. These sorts of things happen, and we all face health issues at some point.  Alfred Lord Tennyson, in his magnificent poem ``Ulysses,'' said:     Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho'     We are not now that strength which in old days     Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;     One equal temper of heroic hearts,     Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will     To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.  I say to my friend Thad that we appreciate the fact that he has been strong in will and, though time and fate have happened to Thad Cochran and will happen to me and to all of us, what abides is the legacy he has left of being a ``quiet persuader,'' of being a person of accomplishment, of being a gentleman who has made this country and its citizens better off, and I thank him.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Sullivan). The majority leader.  Mr.Mr.President, when I learned that our distinguished colleague from Mississippi would be retiring this month, I found it difficult to imagine the Senate without him.  That is for good reason. Thad Cochran arrived here in 1978. Two hundred and fifty-four Senators have since followed in his footsteps. Of those currently serving, 97 of us are newer at this than Thad is, and every single one of us has been treated to a first-rate example of honorable service, a master class in the art of legislation, and living proof that unwavering principle[[Page S1894]]and unflappable collegiality can and should coexist.  We all know Thad has a knack for making things look easy. So many graces and talents seem second nature to him, but appearances can be deceiving.  Take the start of his political career. When we think about it, it is only natural that Senator Cochran liked to work on conservation issues. I expect his adventures as a Mississippi Republican in the early 1970s helped him understand just what it feels like to be an endangered species.  In 1972, Thad was a rising-star attorney when he was asked to try and become just the second GOP Congressman from his State since The possibility seemed so remote that when he asked Rose how she would like being married to a Congressman, she replied, ``I don't know--which one?''  Long odds, indeed.  But true to form, Thad won in the end--and again and again--and then he became the first Republican Senator from Mississippi in a century.  It is safe to say service is in Thad's Both his parents were devoted educators. His father, W.H., served as superintendent of a large, rural public school district. His mother Emma was a pioneering mathematics teacher who wrote new curricula.  In Pontotoc, MS, their two boys grew up with a healthy appreciation for the power of good schooling.  Thad graduated as high school valedictorian, then came a naval commission, and then law school, where he graduated at the top of his class, but no amount of success can take the kindness and courtesy out of this quintessentially southern gentleman. A deep respect for others is Thad's calling card.  Just a few weeks after he arrived in Washington, he brought his staff together and he said:       We're going to treat everyone the same. We're here to find      answers for everyone, even if they disagree with us. We're      here to serve the people of  Even at a time when the wounds of segregation were still raw, he made it clear this meant all--all--In fact, he hired the first African-American congressional staffer to work in a Mississippi office since reconstruction--Nehemiah And for all his staff, Thad took the time to pen a detailed memo laying out high expectations for serving constituents and treating everyone with dignity. That temperament led to a litany of accomplishments.  Mississippians knew that in Thad they had a quiet persuader, a steady workhorse, and a dogged advocate who almost never made a fuss but almost always made a difference. Indeed, the policy achievements of this mighty Appropriations chairman are so numerous as to defy easy summary.  I know this schoolteacher's son is particularly proud of his work on education. Senator Cochran carried the banner for research partnerships that raised the profile of historically Black colleges and universities. He delivered critical funding to expand scholarship access. He spearheaded the Delta Education He inspired the Cochran Fellowship Program, which has changed the lives of more than 17,000 agriculture professionals from around the world.  It is no exaggeration to say that Thad Cochran's work has broadened the horizons of millions, but it didn't stop there. There were the landmark bipartisan bills, like the Cochran-Inouye National Missile Defense There is his partnership with his dear friend, Senator Leahy, on the Farm to School The list just keeps growing.  When he first ran for the Senate in 1978, Thad's stump speech included a line that Mississippians deserved a Senator who would work full-time for them. They certainly got one. Thad didn't come to Washington to curry favor, win praise, or hog the limelight. When I say he preferred making a difference to making a fuss, I really mean it. This man served in the Senate for seven terms and only appeared on Meet the Press twice.  No, Thad had other business to attend to. He spent his 39 years in this body working full-time for students and educators, full-time for farmers and ranchers, full-time to deliver funding for our brave servicemembers and our veterans who returned home.  It is rare, even in the halls of Government, to meet someone as influential as Senator Thad It is even rarer to meet someone as kind, as even tempered, and as concerned for the welfare of others. It is almost unheard of that this same man would be both. That is just who Thad is.  He wrote the book on composure under pressure. He served as the careful custodian of billions of taxpayer dollars without losing an ounce of humility. On the Senate floor and in committee, he tackled heated debates and complicated legislative challenges with true servant leadership. On the tennis court, by all accounts, he offered his colleagues a different and altogether less hospitable sort of service. But true to form, I hear Thad always combined winning and graciousness. He has certainly had enough practice at both.  From Pontotoc, MS, to the Senate floor, Thad Cochran's story has grown but it hasn't changed. It is a story about putting others first. It is about doing the right thing every step of the way. It is a story that will continue to teach and inspire those of us who now must carry on our work without him.  I know that Thad's devoted staff are sorry to see him go. Their allegiance to him, famous throughout the Senate, is further testimony to his own principled professionalism. This is exemplified by nobody quite so well as Doris Wagley, Senator Cochran's personal secretary, who has served Thad ever since 1973, when he was first sworn in as a She planned to take the job for just a year or so and then reassess--enough said. She, along with all of Senator Cochran's excellent staff, has our admiration and our gratitude.  I would particularly like to thank two men who have led teams in service to Mississippi and Senator Cochran so well--Brad White, his chief of staff, and Bruce Evans, his longtime staff director on the Appropriations I am grateful for their hard work on behalf of the I know the early mornings and late nights were many, including just these last few weeks.  Thad's friends know that retirement will allow him more happy times with his wife Kay, his beloved children, Clayton and Kate, and the three grandchildren he adores. He departs with our warmest wishes.  We will miss our great persuader. We will miss our loyal friend.

1322,topic-id,671,"Mr.President, I filed an amendment yesterday that, I hope, will be included in this banking bill that the Senate is considering today and tomorrow.  My amendment was inspired by a bill I introduced last July, which is a simple bill, bipartisan, and should be noncontroversial. Here is what the amendment would do: It would exempt trust-preferred securities from a bank's capital requirements.  Now, you ask: What is a trust-preferred security?  It is an investment vehicle that looks a little bit like equity and, at the same time, looks a little bit like debt.  How did these come about?  Actually, the FDIC asked many banks to invest in such securities in previous decades. A company creates trust-preferred securities by creating a trust, issuing debt to it, and then having it issue preferred stock to investors--trust, debt, and preferred stock to investors. The FDIC used to like trust-preferred securities. It considered them sound investments before 2010. May I repeat: The FDIC asked many banks to invest in these securities. However, through its interpretation of the Basel III regulations, the FDIC is now counting these securities against the banks' capital holdings.  Who is affected by this?  It happens to be 20 small banks in the heartland of  My amendment would exempt these banks from having to consider trust-preferred securities as part of their capital requirements; therefore, it would promote growth in rural communities around the country as well as provide regulatory relief for our small banks.  That is really what this bill is about. The Dodd-Frank legislation took a broad-brush approach and punished many medium and small banks when they had nothing to do with the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008. Dodd-Frank has done harm to Main My amendment would alleviate some of that harm. If we want to help banks grow the economy, we need to be mindful of the ways in which Dodd-Frank's excessive regulations are hurting small banks. This goes right in hand with the major thrust of this overwhelmingly bipartisan bill on which we are about to proceed today or tomorrow.  These 20 small banks nationwide inject needed capital and access to credit in our communities--capital and credit to launch new local businesses or create jobs. When these small banks struggle, communities struggle. For one to comply with the one-size-fits-all Dodd-Frank regulations demands resources that some of our community banks do not have. Here I am arguing for my amendment and for the entire bill. Unlike big banks, these small banks in rural communities might be forced to close because of the demands that are too high or they might have to pass along extra costs to consumers. Neither option helps our local communities and the people who live there.  These 20 small rural banks were not in the least bit responsible for the financial crisis. So my amendment, based on a bipartisan bill, recognizes, along with the base bill, the fact that the small banks are not part of the problem and never were part of the problem. It would alleviate the burdens that these banks have shouldered since Dodd-Frank has become law.  I commend the chairman of the Banking Committee and the overwhelming bipartisan majority on the Banking Committee for working on this legislation. This is a red-letter achievement in a body that has become overly partisan, regrettably so, in the last few years, but we can work together to offer relief to our small credit unions and small community banks. In doing so, we need to take the added step of relieving these 20 smalltown banks from an onerous requirement.  I urge the chairman and the ranking member and Members of the Democratic and Republican leadership to consider making this part of an overall managers' amendment or accepting this amendment and moving forward because it has everything to do with following the thrust of this entire bill.  I thank the Presiding  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Sasse). The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

Mr.Speaker, you know as well as anyone that it is hard to get things done around here. It is never made any easier by the recriminations that circulate so widely. I appreciate the Speaker's admonition about engaging in conflicts of personality. This is hard.  This isn't the bill I would have voted for. In fact, it is not the bill I voted for the first time around. When this House did its job 9 months ago, when it was supposed to do its job, we voted on a completely different bill. But as my friend from Massachusetts knows full well, Mr.Speaker, if Republicans had 60 votes in the Senate, we wouldn't be going through these machinations.  We go through these machinations for one reason and one reason only, and that is, after a Republican-led House gets its work done, the Senate can't. The Senate can't because they work in a much more bipartisan way. As bipartisan as this institution is, that institution is even more so by the Senate rules.  We talk about this as if it is a spending bill, Mr.I just want to be clear: this includes brownfields act reauthorization. That is the bill that lets us go into environmentally damaged areas and restore them. We haven't been able to get that done just in the normal course of doing business. So to get it across the Senate floor, it is now added into this bill.  The Child Protection Improvement Act, Mr.Speaker, is the bill that provides the database so that caregivers and parents can go and see who it is that is taking care of their children and make sure folks are properly vetted. We couldn't get that through in the normal process, so we had to add it into this bill.  Mr.Speaker, the CLOUD Act is the bill that allows law enforcement to go and access information stored on clouds in other countries so that you don't have to wait 9 months through bureaucracies so that you can identify those terrorists, those criminals, earlier and more often. We couldn't get that through the regular process, so we have got that in the bill.  E-Verify, Mr.Speaker, is the provision that allows any employer to dial in online to make sure that they are hiring American citizens.

307,topic-id,3032,"Mr.President, I stand on the Senate floor today in firm agreement with my colleagues that the Congress must do more to combat the scourge of sex trafficking. It is a profound and tragic failure of American institutions that trafficking continues to plague our country and, in fact, has actually increased.[[Page S1866]]  Federal law enforcement has failed to root out and prosecute the traffickers, even when they have been operating in plain sight. So, too, have the big internet companies failed when it comes to sex traffickers who operate on their platforms.  I fear that the legislation before the Senate now is going to be another failure. I fear that it is going to do more to take down ads than to take down traffickers. I that fear it will send these monsters, these evil people who traffic beyond the grasp of law enforcement to the shadowy corners of the dark web, a place where every day search engines don't go, and it is going to be even easier for criminals--these vicious traffickers--to find a safe haven for their extraordinarily evil acts.  In many respects, this debate mirrors one the Congress went through a little bit more than 20 years ago. Back then, I think it would be fair to say that not many Senators knew much about the internet. In 1995, this body had a laudable goal. The Senate said it wanted to protect kids from accessing pornography online, but the result of those good intentions was, unfortunately, a bad policy--a policy called the Communications Decency Act of 1996.  Behind that policy was a fundamental misunderstanding of both the architecture of the internet and the modern application of the First The law didn't just go after those targeting pornography to minors. It took speech that was legal in the real world and made it illegal online. And it produced a paradise for the legal trickster, creating new ways to sue over speech and adversely affecting scores of Americans, medical providers, artists, writers of literature, and more.  As should happen with poorly written policy, all but one part of the Communications Decency Act was struck down by the Supreme The one piece of the law left standing was section 230, which I coauthored with former Congressman Chris What section 230 was all about was laying out the legal rules of the road for the web. There were innovative new businesses sprouting up all over and novel forms of communication and media connecting and informing people in new ways. But it seemed clear that a quick way to strangle this promising set of developments in their infancy was for these new companies to be held legally liable for every piece of content that users posted on their platforms.  When section 230 was written, nobody could have foreseen all of the effects. Here is what we did know back then. First, we wanted small businesses to start out focusing on hiring engineers, developers, and designers rather than worrying about how they had to hire a team of lawyers.  Second, we wanted to make sure that internet companies could moderate their websites without getting clobbered by lawsuits. I think Democrats and Republicans would agree that this is a better scenario than the alternative, which means websites hiding their heads in the sand out of fear that they would be weighed down with liability.  Third, we wanted to guarantee that bad actors would still be subject to all of the Federal laws. Whether the criminals were operating on a street corner or online wasn't going to make a difference, and we were determined to state that explicitly.  Fourth, we wanted to protect the internet from the whims of State and local legislators. This body has the authority to regulate interstate commerce.  I would ask any of my colleagues to offer an example of how something could be more interstate than the internet.  It may not satisfy some publicity-seeking local official when we talk about the Federal Government's role here, but there is no question that the role of the Congress, in its leading on something that is clearly interstate in nature, is in the best interest of the American people.  For the most part, the framework worked better than I ever imagined it would. As a result of section 230, the small, gutsy entrepreneur--say an entrepreneur in North Carolina--who has a big dream of working out of his garage has a real shot at succeeding. Marginalized groups of vulnerable Americans have a better opportunity than ever to make their voices heard because of section 230, and small nonprofits have the ability to take their causes nationwide.  One scholar, David Post, even wrote that the 230 law created $1 trillion worth of economic value in the private economy. He said: ``It is impossible to imagine what the Internet ecosystem would look like today without it.''  My wife saw that article, looked at me and said: Well, dear, even a blind squirrel occasionally finds an acorn.  Setting aside spousal kidding, to illustrate why the protection that comes from section 230 is so important, I turn next to what things would be like without it.  Imagine if you are starting a forum site that is dedicated to discussing knitting. If ever there were a topic that sounded drama free, that would be it. Yet suppose somebody goes on the site and shares a pattern he didn't have the right to share. Suddenly, your website is facing a copyright infringement lawsuit. Maybe the controversy--knitting versus crocheting--gets overheated, and the users start trading barbs. Suddenly, you have people slinging defamation suits at your itty-bitty forum host. Then somebody is injured by an automatic needle threader he reads about in a comment thread. Suddenly, you are a codefendant in a liability suit--all because you didn't have the protection of section 230.  Imagine how hard it would be to launch a platform that would be open to the discussion of any topic when even the simplest, most narrowly focused website on the internet can become a magnet for lawsuits. There are not enough lawyers in the world to handle all of that litigation, and my sense is we will have a lot of constituents who will say: Thank  In the absence of section 230, the internet as we know it would shrivel. Only the platforms that are run by those with deep pockets and an even deeper bench of lawyers would be able to make it.  Moreover, section 230 is not just about hobbies and commerce. It protects the coordination of free speech, particularly among vulnerable groups of That is the reason organizations like the libertarian Cato Institute, the progressive Human Rights Campaign, and the ACLU have voiced serious concerns about the legislation before the You sure don't see those three groups lined up side by side very often, but they are here now. It is because, without the protections of section 230, civic organizations that exercise their right to free speech could be cowed by their more powerful political opponents.  For this example, imagine that a nonprofit organizes a campaign in support of a local ballot measure. It uses social media to build awareness and promote upcoming rallies and events with online discussion boards. Yet, without section 230, powerful interests that are opposed to its work can just swoop in and effectively silence that nonprofit with an onslaught of litigation. Hostile individuals could pose as supporters and make comments on the nonprofit's website that would expose the group to liability suits. I think it is pretty obvious that there would be an enormous, chilling effect on speech in  I ask unanimous consent that the statements from the Cato Institute and the ACLU that are in opposition to the legislation now before the Senate be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From CATO at Liberty, 27, 2018]                     The Death of an Open Internet                           (By John Samples)       Today the House votes on the Fight Online Sex Trafficking      Act (FOSTA), a piece of anti-sex trafficking legislation. It      follows and incorporates an earlier effort by the Senate, the      Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA). The bill at issue      today is actually a last minute amendment by Representative      Mimi Walters (CA) that brings the worst elements of SESTA      into FOSTA, creating a hybrid bill far worse than the sum of      its parts. This bill has grave consequences for an open,      competitive internet and for some people who use it.       Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act has long      shielded internet service providers from liability for user      generated content, facilitating the internet we know today.      FOSTA would likely reduce these protections. FOSTA creates a      new federal crime tied to the intent to promote sex      trafficking[[Page S1867]]     using the internet. Alone, this might be considered an      acceptable, narrowly tailored measure. However, the Walters      amendment incorporates SESTA's ``knowingly'' standard of      liability, which withholds CDA Section 230 protections from      sites ``knowingly assisting, supporting, or facilitating''      sex-trafficking. SESTA's standard requires no intent to      facilitate sex trafficking, relying upon the mere knowledge      that one's app or blog has been used by bad actors.       Preemptive action, driven by effective platform moderation      and cooperation with law enforcement, remains the most      efficient way to combat online sex trafficking.      Unfortunately, FOSTA's incorporation of SESTA's ``knowingly''      standard would stymie this collaboration. If a platform      attempts to prevent sex trafficking by removing and reporting      offending user generated content, it risks establishing that      it had knowledge of the content, rendering it liable for      anything that might slip through the moderation process.      Instead of encouraging platforms to combat sex trafficking,      SESTA's ``knowingly'' standard punishes private attempts to      prevent the problem, and cripples broader attempts at      effective content moderation.       A combined FOSTA/SESTA would benefit established social      media platforms and trial lawyers at the expense of an open      internet while doing little to prevent sex trafficking.      Facebook may be well resourced enough to cope with the      increased legal risk imposed on hosts of user generated      content, but their nascent competitors are not. Attempts to      avoid running afoul of the ``knowingly'' standard will likely      lead to greater reliance on automated filtering.       Other issues have not received the attention they merit.      Libertarians (and others) often distinguish law from      morality. What is immoral need not be illegal. American law      in many jurisdictions does not honor that distinction and      criminalizes exchanging sex for payment. Some members of      Congress seem pleased this bill will better enforce those      laws against people who voluntarily engage in such exchanges.       The consequence of doing so, however, should please no one.      Members believe this bill will likely drive women who sell      sex for a living off the internet. For them, that is a      feature not a bug of the bill. But those engaged in the sex      trade are unlikely to give up their work. Instead they will      end up on the streets. Why does this change of venue matter?      Between 2002 and 2010, Craigslist introduced an ``erotic      services'' section on its front page which was used almost      exclusively to advertise illegal sex services. Three      economists found that this section led to a 17.4 percent      reduction in the homicide rate of the women in the relevant      jurisdiction. They also noted ``modest evidence'' that the      Craigslist section reduced female rape offenses. The      economists concluded this reduction in violence came from the      women moving indoors and matching more efficiently with safer      clients. This potential increase in violence and murder      should give pause to even those who deem selling sex immoral.       Congress has worked on these bills for some time through      their committees. Now both bills have been thrown together,      brought to the House floor, and are expected to become law,      all in a week or so. Instead of this rush, the House      Judiciary Committee could have finished its work, and the      whole House debated and voted on the measure. The Senate and      House then could have conferred and perhaps produced a bill      acceptable to all. That would be ``regular order'' for      Congress in lawmaking. It has once again been ignored.                                  ____                               American Civil Liberties Union,                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 2018.     Re Oppose H.1865--The ``Allow States and Victims to Fight          Online Sex Trafficking Act''.     Mitch McConnell,     Majority Leader, U.Senate,     Washington,     Chuck Schumer,     Minority Leader, U.Senate,     Washington,       Dear Senators: The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)      writes to express its opposition to H.1865, the ``Allow      States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act,''      also referred to as FOSTA, which passed the House on February      27 and may be considered by the full Senate in the coming      days or weeks. The bill is a serious, yet unsuccessful,      attempt to stop the use of the Internet for sex trafficking      without hindering online freedom of expression and artistic      innovation. Tech experts say that a thriving Internet      requires retaining certain liability protections for online      platforms providers. Victims' rights advocates, on the other      hand, say the sex trafficking problem requires narrowing      those protections. The bill misses the achievable legislative      opportunity to do both, and in particular leaves the Internet      exposed to the uncertain impact of changed protocols on the      part of platform providers.       For nearly 100 years, the ACLU has been our nation's      guardian of liberty, working in courts, legislatures, and      communities to defend and preserve the individual rights and      liberties that the Constitution and the laws of the United      With more than 2 million members, activists, and      supporters, the ACLU is a nationwide organization that fights      tirelessly in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and Washington, DC      for the principle that every individual's rights must be      protected equally under the law, regardless of race,      religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or national      origin.       The risks to the Internet as the world's most significant      marketplace of ideas outweigh the uncertain benefit of the      bill to the fight against sex trafficking. Accordingly, ACLU      opposes the bill. While the language of H.1865 has been      improved to address some of the ambiguities creating the most      significant risks, ACLU remains concerned that the bill, if      enacted, will foster an atmosphere of uncertainty among      online platform providers. This uncertainty will inhibit the      continued growth of the Internet as a place of creativity and      innovation.       The ACLU has long supported maintaining the statutory      immunity provisions of section 230 of the Communications Act      of 1934 in order to promote freedom of speech and expression.      Section 230 became one of the key factors enabling the robust      expansion of Internet-based speech, communications, and      commerce. It is a critical factor in maintaining the      Internet's diverse ecosystem of speech and art and advancing      economic and political dialogue. The rationale for liability      protections for online providers is that they should not      suffer criminal or civil liability merely for creating online      fora to which others may post content, even when some of      those communications turn out to be offensive or even      unlawful. Any liability should be on those who create and      post that content.       We opposed FOSTA's predecessor bill, an onerous bill that      would have drastically curtailed protections for online      publishers. FOSTA was revised in the House through the      efforts of a broad cross-section of victim advocates, law      enforcement, and tech experts. The current version creates a      new federal facilitation of prostitution crime, but would      still impact liability protections for online providers. As      finally approved, it also incorporated key aspects of the      Senate version of the bill.       ACLU opposed the Senate version of the bill, the ``Stop      Enabling Sex Traffickers Act'' (1693, SESTA), but also      acknowledged improvements incorporated prior to final      committee approval. In particular, the modified version of      SESTA heightened the intent standard needed to establish a      criminal violation--a key distinction separating a typical      online platform provider from one that might inject itself      into the online content being posted to its platform. Also,      in authorizing state prosecutions notwithstanding the federal      liability protections for online platforms, the bill would      limit state prosecutions to those where the behavior violated      the federal law.       The changes to both the House FOSTA bill and the Senate      SESTA bill were the result of concerted advocacy efforts by      Internet and other tech experts who testified about the      critical importance played by section 230 protections. In the      days before the section 230 protections were adopted over two      decades ago, online providers were subject to lawsuits for      allowing the posting of content. The threats were so      financially significant that providers would simply bar the      posting of third party content, knowing they could never      fully insulate themselves from liability except by blocking      all content that might be offensive to some. Since the      adoption of section 230, online providers have been free to      curate their sites' content without fearing liability for      what others post.       Even with the improvements in both bills, ACLU continued to      oppose both measures because the risks to the vibrancy of the      Internet as a driver of political, artistic, and commercial      communication is real and significant. Moreover, there is      little to suggest that current law could not be used to find      and punish the bad actors who are truly facilitating online      sex traffickers. In fact there is at least one pending      federal court case that makes this very argument. There are a      host of state laws outlawing such behaviors and current      liability protections are intended to protect only those who      are simply providing a channel for others to use, not those      who are determining what is posted and who have a malicious      intent to do harm to others. Finally, ACLU is concerned that      the scope of the bill's language will encompass the actions      of sex workers who have no connection to trafficking      whatsoever within its enforcement, including effective harm      reduction and anti-violence tactics. Such an outcome is      directly contrary to the aims of bipartisan criminal justice      reformers who seek to limit the over-federalization of crime      where such crimes already exist at the state level.       For the foregoing reasons, the ACLU opposes H.1865 as      approved by the House of It poses a risk to      freedom of speech on the Internet as we have come to know it      while purporting to solve a problem that could be addressed      in other ways.

308,topic-id,785,"Mr.President, the fact is that section 230 was never about protecting the incumbents. I have spent my time in public service taking on a wide array of powerful, established interests. When I wrote this policy, I never envisioned a Facebook, but I did hope it would give the little guy and[[Page S1868]]his startup a chance to grow into something big. The bottom line--the central point here--is that it worked.  Despite the fact that section 230 undergirds the framework of the internet as we know it today, there is a significant effort underway to try to take it down, to collapse it. That is, largely, because the big internet companies--the biggest ones--have utterly failed to live up to the responsibility they were handed two decades ago. I am going to explain exactly what I mean.  For these big companies, section 230 is both a sword and a shield. It offers protection from liability, but it also gives companies the authority and, more importantly, the responsibility to foster the sort of internet Americans want to be proud of. In years of hiding behind their shields, these big technology companies have left their swords to rust. Too many companies have become bloated and uninterested in the larger good, and when they have taken positive steps, as Wikimedia has, for example, their practices haven't been adopted by their peers.  I will describe one case study that was reported last week by the tech news website  In 2012, the website Reddit, on which individuals form communities where they share and discuss content, cracked down on users who posted nonconsensual photos of women. These have come to be known as ``creepshots.'' The website Tumblr did not sufficiently police the same inappropriate content, so these reprehensible communities simply relocated from Reddit to Tumblr, and this creepshot problem lived on. That is how easy it is for the creators of vile content to move from one platform to another.  Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart famously observed that he couldn't define hardcore pornography, but he knew it when he saw it. Congressman Cox and I may not have known exactly what content we intended for sites to be able to take down when we wrote section 230, but I sure know it when I see it. Far too often, the big internet companies refuse to know it even when they see it.  A huge amount of that which populates social media networks each day is every bit as destructive and socially corrosive, if not more so, than the pornography at issue in that famed Supreme Court case. It is the creepshots, the sex trafficking ads, the conspiracy videos about school shootings, and anti-vax nonsense--nonsense that endangers the public health and more.  The tech giants state that no one could track the millions of posts or videos or tweets that cross their services every hour. Nobody is asking them to do that--nobody. Section 230 means they are not required to fact-check or scrub every single post or tweet or video, but there have been far too many alarming examples of algorithms that drive vile, hateful, or conspiratorial content to the top of the sites that millions of people click on every day. Companies seem to aid in the spread of this content as a direct function of their business models.  It is perfectly reasonable to expect some greater responsibility from these giant, multibillion-dollar corporations that were able to thrive as a result of protection that they were guaranteed by law. That was the idea behind section 230. That doesn't carry any obligation to suppress free speech, but it is definitely about being a responsible citizen, a responsible member of the community.  Sites like Facebook, YouTube, and Tumblr constitute the entire internet for millions of users who click through the same group of sites every single day. They have an undeniable role to play in fostering a civil environment. Their failure to do so could very well mean that the internet looks very different 10 years from now, not just for those who spread hateful and conspiracy-driven filth, but for the millions of decent people who use the internet to learn, to find entertainment, and to keep in touch with loved ones.  There was a time when the biggest internet companies had mottos like ``Don't be evil.'' Perhaps it is time for them to aspire to a more modest motto: ``Don't spread evil.''  With all of that said and done, it is not just the internet companies that fail to properly respond to the challenges of our times. When it comes to sex trafficking, which is the underlying issue the Senate is working on today, our country has failed the victims at almost every level.

309,topic-id,2157,"Mr.President, that is not the only problem when it comes to enforcing this law. The bill before the Senate is focused on taking down online advertisements, not on catching criminals or protecting victims. Taking down the ads doesn't mean the pimps and predators will stop and say: Oh, good; we see what the Senate is doing. We are now going to start following the rules. When the ads come down, colleagues, the criminals will go as fast as they can to the darkest corners of our society. Instead of stopping trafficking, the bill is going to push it to the dark web, the dark alleys, and overseas. You can't get to the dark web with traditional search engines.  Career Federal law enforcement officers, the expert investigators, are the people who know how to root out the traffickers under these circumstances. They have expertise that State and local law enforcers don't have. So my view is, by handing new authorities to local officials, the bill moves in the wrong direction.  In my view, the right approach is to make sure career, expert Federal law enforcement officers and investigators have the resources they need to get the job done. One of the amendments I will be offering today provides $20 million a year for 5 years to the Attorney General to spend in coordination with the FBI and Homeland Security to investigate and prosecute those who criminally facilitate sex trafficking. The bottom line, if Senators want law enforcement to do a better job of stopping those like backpage, my amendment gives the right people the resources they need to bring these monsters to justice.  I heard my colleague from Alaska, Senator Sullivan, a good friend, talk at some length about how important it was to have resources to fight the scourge of these traffickers who get more and more sophisticated. They are people who are very clever about staying out in front of the law. When they are on the dark web, it is going to take resources to fight them and put them behind bars. So our colleague from Alaska, Senator Sullivan, sure ought to be for this amendment because this amendment offers real money right now to prosecute these monsters and get them behind bars.  Finally, the bill before the Senate punches a hole in the legal framework of the open internet. I don't every single day quote the editors of the ``Wall Street Journal,'' but I have always had a motto that I will shout out anybody when they are right. The Journal recently summed up the impact of the bill. They said this is definitely going to be an online ``lawsuit bonanza.'' They predict any website that ``should have known'' criminal activity took place on its platform will be a target for lawsuits. Any message board or chat room where users interact with each other can become a new target for litigation.  Without specific protections for companies that make good-faith efforts to find and stop criminal behavior on their platforms, this legislation could actually punish companies that try to moderate their users' posts but let something slip through. Just by looking for illegal material, a website could be setting the table to be sued over anything they didn't find.  The second amendment I will be offering would clarify this issue. It is what is known as the Good Samaritan clause, and we felt strongly about it several decades ago. The companies decide, as a result of a poorly written bill, that their only option is to put their blinders on and ignore vile, illicit content. That is bad for everybody except for the criminals. So I want to eliminate that uncertainty, and I want particularly these small startup companies that are so important for our future to know, without a doubt, that they have the right to moderate the content users post.  So, in technical language, what this amendment says is, neither the presence nor the absence of an attempt to moderate content online can, by itself, trigger liability.[[Page S1870]]  The Journal raised more than the Good Samaritan issue. Just as bad, by passing this exception to section 230, courts might make it harder to prosecute websites for other crimes. Here is what the Wall Street Journal editor said: ``If Congress provides a carve-out for sex trafficking, courts might conclude that Section 230 was intended to be applied narrowly for other crimes and make it harder to prosecute websites [that are] complicit.''  I do fear this bill is going to set off a chain reaction that leads the Congress to cut away more categories of behavior from section 230, dismantle the legal framework that has given the United States the position as a tech economy superpower. This position did not happen by osmosis. It happened because 20 years ago there was an effort to try to lay out a sensible legal foundation, a sensible legal basis for the internet, and that is what is under attack today.  If this legislation that chips away at section 230 is a bad idea for the internet, if you are following this debate, you probably want to know why the biggest internet companies are big cheerleaders for it--the big companies like It is because it will pull up the ladder in the tech world, leaving the established giants alone at the top.  As I said, section 230, from the beginning, was all about giving the little guy the best possible chance to succeed. That is what this has always been about. The big guys can take care of themselves. We want to have a policy that encourages innovation for the startups. That has been a bedrock of my time in public service. Chipping away at the law that is going to curtail the culture of innovation and bare-knuckled competition that has been the defining characteristic of the internet for more than two decades doesn't make any sense to me.  The companies that have reached the top of the internet's economy are kind of worried about whether they are going to be able to keep their place at that altitude. Regulators once feared that Microsoft would dominate the way Americans interacted with the internet, but then a little company called Google appeared on the scene. Facebook, a half-trillion-dollar company got out of its infancy by displacing a competitor called  I think colleagues ought to know that these established companies would do just about anything to avoid being displaced themselves. Facebook is trying to make clear that they will do just about anything not to become another  Today, Facebook is under attack for allowing the Russians to interfere with our elections. They are under attack for giving hate groups a platform to spread their bile. They are under attack for giving conspiracy theorists, through their algorithms, a platform to lure in the unsuspecting. They are under attack for collecting, monetizing, and storing far more personal information than their users ever suspected. It is a great tool for connecting with family and friends, but it is also something a small team of well-caffeinated coders could duplicate and improve upon in terms of its functionality without a lot of difficulty and without some of the baggage Facebook has picked up over the last 6 months.  So how do they stay on top? One way is to acquire the competition. Young people always tell me that nobody under 30 uses The new generation certainly uses Instagram, so they might not even know that it is part of the same megacompany bought out by But you can't buy everybody, so then you go to the oldest trick in the book--make it harder for new companies to get in the game. You don't have to compete if there is no competition, and that is where this legislation comes in.  If internet startups are no longer protected by section 230 and they are exposed to the threat of near constant litigation, it is going to be a lot tougher for them to secure injections of funding and grow. Fewer venture capital firms will be willing to risk their deep pockets if their early-round investments are swallowed up by legal fees instead of paying for coders. But in the eyes of the giant, established corporations, a world without section 230 isn't seen as much of a threat. The $50 million a year in liability statements for these big companies is a drop in the bucket for them. It is the cost of doing business. And it is an added benefit if the cost is too high for new companies to be able to get in the game.  The biggest of these internet companies are trying to hold on to their position at the top with all their might, and they are certainly very interested in using the government to do it. That has been true of a lot of industries before them, and it should come as no surprise that it happens again in the technology area.  The Facebooks of the world will tell you how important section 230 was to the innovation of the last 20 years. Yet there are technology companies like IBM that haven't done a lot of innovating for the last 20 years that want to see section 230 done away with entirely for trumped-up reasons. So, for business, let's not mistake what this debate is all about for a lot of these big, multinational companies. It is not about right or wrong; it is about dollars and cents.  So what does the future hold? As the Wall Street Journal observed, a lawsuit bonanza is in the works. It is pretty ironic that a Republican Congress and a Republican President are going to create the biggest new source of opportunities for trial lawyers in decades.  For the technology business, this bill means bigger is better--not better for innovation, not better for consumers, but better for the profits of those lucky enough to have reached the top of the mountain first.  It is safe to expect a slew of proposed new exceptions to section 230. When somebody is injured, they and their families want recourse, but our legal system is woefully bad at delivering justice. It is unfortunately far better at facilitating deals--often unjust deals--because numbers are far easier than doing right. This failure means that a line of injured parties will be petitioning to seek the sort of recompense only their Member of Congress can provide.  For America, section 230 is very likely the reason we have a multitude of billion-dollar internet employers and the Europeans have exactly zero. Where countries aren't hiding behind the trade barrier of the great firewall or other artificial market forces, American innovation has won out over the rest of the world.  I think it is pretty hard to see our country thrive and prosper without the kind of legal foundation I have described today, without these 230 protections. And a whole host of scholars have pointed out that this is a unique law in the world. It is the case where the United States got the temperature right from the beginning, and it has led to our dominance in tech. But if the United States goes out and puts all those cracks--those potential cracks, the real cracks--into the foundation of section 230, I would wager that there are plenty of other countries that are going to change their laws to siphon away our companies and take the jobs they create.  The fact is--and I am not sure we in the Senate think about it every day--we are in a fight for the internet literally every day. Our internet companies aren't engaged in the fight. Their interest is currying favor with nations with which they wish to do business. The Chinese, the Iranians, the Russians, even our European allies are maneuvering to impose a more repressive view of speech and expression on individuals around the world, and unfortunately it has a lot of allies here at home.  Free speech has never been free, and it is often not popular. It was wrested from the grip of a dominating state, and it ought to be--it must be defended by every generation, lest the state reclaim control.  Today, in my view, the Senate is looking at taking a real step backward and down a path that this body will regret.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The majority leader.

409,topic-id,621,"Mr.President, I rise today in support of H.4547, the Strengthening Protections for Social Security Beneficiaries Act of 2018, a bipartisan bill developed by House Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee Chairman Sam Johnson and Ranking Member  John This bill updates the representative payee program by strengthening oversight and beneficiary protections, while improving payee selection and quality. As a true testament to Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Larson's bipartisan work, the bill passed both the House of Representatives and the Senate unanimously just before Congress adjourned in  Social Security's Representative Payment program provides financial management for the Social Security and Supplemental Security Income, SSI, payments of beneficiaries who are incapable of managing their Social Security or SSI payment. Today almost 6 million representative payees manage benefits on behalf of about 8 million Social Security beneficiaries and SSI recipients. Most often, the representative payee is a family member, like a spouse or a parent. When friends or family are not available to serve as payees, Social Security can use qualified organizations to be representative payees.  Most payees perform their duties responsibly and with care. Some do not, and stakeholders in this process have raised concerns. The Social Security Advisory Board, the National Academy of Sciences, the Government Accountability Office, and Social Security's inspector general have uncovered problems with current policy and ideas for improvement. It has been almost 15 years since the last significant change to the law in this area, and this bill makes several needed policy changes and common sense improvements.  The bill strengthens oversight of representative payees by requiring additional types of reviews of payee performance and draws on the expertise of the protection and advocacy system of each state to conduct the reviews. The bill reduces the burden on families by eliminating the requirement to file the annual accounting form for representative payees who are parents or spouses and are living with the beneficiary. The bill requires data exchanges between SSA and State foster care agencies to identify when there is a change in status of a beneficiary in foster care and reassess whether the payee is appropriate. The bill allows new beneficiaries to make an advance payee designation. Finally, the bill codifies current policy that bars felons from serving as a payee and requires SSA to recheck all existing payees.  In 2016, my office was contacted by Lexie Gruber, a former foster youth from Lexie's story brought a human face to this issue and showed where the system had gone wrong. This young woman had recently aged out of foster care, graduated college at the top of her class, and moved to Washington, DC, for a new job, a success story that is unfortunately all too rare for children who have grown up in foster care. Lexie was working hard, but still struggled to afford living expenses in an expensive city while trying to work hard to save for law school. That was before the IRS notified her that the value of outstanding SSI overpayments were going to be withheld from her tax returns. This was outstanding debt she didn't know she had for benefits she never even got. To me, this is the definition of unjust. She had to contact Congress for help and since then has worked tirelessly to help ensure that other former foster youth aren't forced through her experience. This bill fixes this flaw in the system to ensure that youth aging out of care, struggling to make it on their own, aren't held liable for the mistakes of or misinformation from foster care agencies.  I thank Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Larson, and their staff for putting together this bipartisan bill. It is another example of what can be accomplished when working together.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-04-09-pt1-PgS2010.txt,1247,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF THE SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 1625,",2018.0,9.0,March
1246,topic-id,1181,"Mr.President, as I was walking into the Chamber tonight, the press outside was telling me that they had just been told--and I hope to hear otherwise tomorrow--that the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, on which the distinguished Presiding Officer and I both serve, would not be holding any public hearings on the financial issues so central to holding the President of the United States accountable.  What I am going to describe for a few minutes is how the executive branch, particularly officials such as Secretary Mnuchin, are ducking these issues, and now it appears the President's Republican allies on the Hill are ducking the issues as well.  I especially believe it is a great mistake for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, on which the distinguished Presiding Officer and I both serve, to fail to follow up on the follow-the-money questions. Following the money, as the Presiding Officer knows, is counterintelligence 101. Right at the heart of our duties on the Intelligence Committee is our mandate to vigorously pursue issues relating to counterintelligence. The reason that is so extraordinarily important, it is money that is one of the best and easiest tools to compromise people, to take advantage of counterintelligence measures that, for example, would compromise American public officials.  I believe it is a great mistake for the executive branch, particularly Treasury Secretary Mnuchin--and as the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, we have jurisdiction over his agency--and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to just punt on these issues that are central to the question tonight, that Senator Whitehouse deserves great credit in terms of pursuing, which is holding the President accountable.  The public, in particular, deserves the full story about financial entanglements between Russia and the President and his associates. Obviously, the American people are constantly reading stories in the press about these connections. The special counsel's indictments of the Trump campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and the campaign aide, Richard Gates, contained voluminous information about money laundering and tax evasion intended to hide money from pro-Russian Ukrainian entities.  The distinguished Presiding Officer and I know a bit about money laundering because we have introduced bipartisan legislation to deal with shell companies and money laundering. It is clear that this is a serious matter because when you are talking about money laundering and tax evasion, particularly as it relates to national security and American sovereignty, it has great implications.  Donald Trump and his administration have consistently tried to prevent the American people from seeing not only his finances but the activities of Russian oligarchs. The President's allies, both here in the Senate and elsewhere in Washington, are just going along with it. Americans need to see both sides of this. They need to understand the corruption in both Russia and in the United States in order to determine how they may be connected.  That is why the Congress required the administration to provide--and I want to emphasize this--a public report on the Russian oligarchs, their relationship with President Putin, and indications of corruption. Secretary Mnuchin released nothing other than a list of rich Russians taken from public sources.  I have wanted to know if the intelligence community had warned the Secretary of Treasury against releasing what they saw as sensitive sources or methods. When I asked the leaders of the intelligence community whether they had weighed in, they all said no. What you have, in effect, is a whitewashing of the responsibilities of the Secretary of Treasury, possibly the White House, and possibly senior Republicans in the Congress on this issue.  I then asked Secretary Mnuchin why the Russian oligarch report was covered up. I have gotten no answer to that either. This is just part of the stonewalling that is preventing the public and the Congress from following the money. In addition, I have inquired of Secretary Mnuchin about Treasury documents associated with a suspicious real estate transaction in which a Russian oligarch bought an estate in Florida from Donald Trump for more than twice what the President paid for it. I have gotten no response from the Secretary on this matter either.  What you have is a period of time--and I just speak from popular news accounts--when President Trump bought this property, essentially did nothing with it. It was at a time when it was very hard in our country to get access to money, and the President sold it to a Russian oligarch for tens of millions of dollars beyond what he paid for it.  I was particularly concerned when I read the press accounts of Florida newspapers with accountants and lawyers and others in the Palm Beach area saying they thought this transaction smelled. They thought it was suspicious. They thought it was questionable. They couldn't see why anybody would pay that amount on top of the purchase price without there being some more sinister kind of motive.  In addition to getting no response from Secretary Mnuchin on that, I have also written to Secretary Mnuchin about press reports regarding connections between the National Rifle Association and yet another Russian oligarch. I wanted to know if there were records held by the Department of the Treasury that would shine a light on these reported connections.  As the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, we have jurisdiction over the Department of the Treasury and the work done by the Secretary and his associates. You would think that just as a matter of courtesy Secretary Mnuchin would respond. We have received no response on that matter as well.  I intend to pursue this matter until we get some answers. If the President, his associates, or powerful political entities, like the NRA, have been corrupted by Russian money, the Congress and the public need the full story. There needs to be open hearings, and they need to be in the Senate Intelligence  The President's associates have not been shy about releasing their side of the story, and they ought to face questions from Members of Secretary Mnuchin needs to testify about whether the Department of the Treasury knows about these financial entanglements.  I would like to close simply by saying that these questions of following the money, which I have made my top priority since the period in which the Intelligence Committee began to dig into these issues, are central to holding the President accountable. The executive branch and their allies in the Congress simply cannot justify ducking these questions, as apparently the press is about to report on the basis of conversations I had walking into the  The American people deserve to know the extent to which Russian money has corrupted their leaders and their democracy. It is long past time to open this up and, for the sake of American national security and sovereignty, get this information out.

This bill makes a number of improvements to our Nation's employer-provided retirement plans and is the result of several years of bipartisan work on the part of the Finance The Retirement Enhancement and Savings Act was unanimously reported out of the Finance Committee in the prior Congress, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  The bill that Senator Hatch and I have introduced is identical to the bill reported by the Finance Committee except for updating effective dates, omitting provisions that already have been enacted into law, and several technical modifications to the provisions impacting the United States Tax Court and to the safe harbor for employers for annuity provider selection.  The safe harbor for annuity provider selection is a critical change to current law that will encourage employers to offer annuities to employees in 401(k) and other defined contribution retirement plans. Many employers are reluctant to offer annuities in these types of plans because of uncertainty about their liability in the event that an insurer becomes insolvent and is unable to pay benefits under the annuity. This safe harbor provides certainty for employers who select insurers who are financially capable of meeting their commitments and are in good standing with State regulators. The technical modification to the safe harbor is a one-word change that clarifies that the safe harbor is solely for the selection of the insurer and the possibility that the insurer may not be able to make payments due under the contract and is not a safe harbor for the selection of the contract. As under existing law, the plan fiduciary remains required to prudently select the type of annuity that is best for participants and beneficiaries.

Terrified, she ran back inside, called 911, and deputies responded in an effort to catch the suspect with active warrants that included kidnapping and sexual assault.  Deputy Sheriff Chris Drake and K-9 Rous arrived, knowing full well that the suspect had not only stolen the victim's car with a gun inside earlier, but dug a hole and buried himself to elude a helicopter searchlight and a floor camera the night before. With that information, Chris and his dog, Rous, began to track the suspect.  Lifting K-9 Rous over some fences and cutting their way through others, Deputy Drake and others continued following the suspect's scent until, as Drake's report reads: ``Rous . . . still smelling human odor . . . ears forward, and staring intently . . . identified something lying in the water . . . the man stood up from the water . . . turned north into the woods and disappeared.''  Continuing their track, K-9 Rous and Deputy Drake again found the suspect hiding in a separate swamp, with only his back exposed. That is not a good thing with a catch dog.  When challenged, the felon fled again, and K-9 Rous was released to catch him. K-9 Rous ran into the water, swam briefly, and apprehended the suspect on the arm, enduring punches to the head and holding on until deputies could arrive and assist, placing the suspect in handcuffs for a trip to the hospital and then jail.  These deputies and their K-9 partners are on the road every day, working 12-hour shifts, 24 hours a day, supporting every local law enforcement patrol task and providing mutual aid to our neighboring jurisdictions when called upon.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.Abraham), another veterinarian.

1867,topic-id,185,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my good friend from Pennsylvania, Brigadier General Scott Perry, for sharing that story.  The attitude and loyalty of the dog is amazing, as well as the singularity of purpose in their drive and ambition.  Like I said, yesterday, we got to experience police K-9 dogs going after a victim. I was the victim. I had a glove on my arm. But we saw the intent and the way those dogs focus. They showed us a demonstration of sniffing out gunpowder. They hid it in a big room with all sorts of explosives. These dogs just go to task and don't complain. I think there is a lesson we all can learn from.  I thank the gentleman for his participation and for his story. I look forward to that movie. It is funny how people say dogs can't talk, but we know they do through their body language. That is why movies like that that highlight the actions of an animal, especially dogs, do so well. I know that will be a blockbuster.

What you touched on is the loyalty, the trust, the integrity of these working dogs--not only in the work they do, but when they come back to the home--of what they do. It is unconditional love and unconditional loyalty.  We should take a lesson from that as humans, shouldn't we?

1871,topic-id,336,"Mr.Speaker, at this time, I would like to tell a story from my district, and this deals with seizing the drugs and profits that arm criminals: As part of their regularly assigned duties with the Gainesville-Alachua County Drug Task Force, Sergeant Bryan Jones and K-9 Jerry responded to assist another agent with a traffic stop on Interstate 75. Despite a series of efforts by the suspect, like those seen on television to hide contraband in hidden compartments, K-9 Jerry couldn't be fooled--locating nearly $100,000 in cash and over a kilogram of narcotics. It is just amazing how these dogs know what to do and they are so good at it. They smell things that we can't even think about with their sensory perception.  Another story is rescuing those that need our help: In February 2018, the Florida Highway Patrol contacted the Alachua County Sheriff's Office after finding an abandoned vehicle along Interstate 75 near San Felasco Hammock Preserve State It appeared as though the driver, diagnosed with a mental illness and having fled his home in south Florida, may have wandered into the park and its over 7,000 acres of forest, sinkholes, rattle snakes, ponds, alligators, and trails.  Deputy Sheriff Lloyd O'Quinn and K-9 Eins began tracking the subject through the woods until becoming physically exhausted in the heat. Deputy Sheriff James Riley and K-9 Knight, Deputy Sheriff Esau Bright and K-9 Rosco, Deputy Sheriff Chris Drake and K-9 Rous, and Sergeant Michael Hurlocker and K-9 Havok all responded and relieved one another with tracking throughout the park.  After tracking and searching the wooded area for several hours, and with the help of the prison bloodhounds sent to assist from the Florida Department of Corrections, the driver was safely located and was provided the treatment he needed at an area hospital to the relief of his family and friends far away.  Mr.Speaker, at this time, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia, Tom Garrett, a good friend of mine that served in our military in the  ",CREC-2018-03-13-pt1-PgH1531-5.txt,2115,NATIONAL K-9 VETERANS DAY,2018.0,13.0,March
1873,topic-id,2030,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the good gentleman from The gentleman brought up some great things there, the dedication of the handlers. Here we have got the Clay County Sheriff's Department with Diesel, a bloodhound that these guys are so dedicated with the dogs that they work with. It is unbelievable, the good they do, the search and the rescue that they do. And you brought up on Maggie how she had--the 350th working call that Maggie had performed for the people of our country.  And this is something people don't realize, the amount of calls these dogs go on and the amount of work that they do. The average lifespan or service of these dogs is anywhere from 7 to 9 years, and people wonder about the cost of the dog, the cost of a program. Yeah, it is expensive to keep these dogs, but what we have found is so many people out there who are goodhearted who realize the benefit of the working K-9 that they donate the cost of the dog. Many times the cost of the dog can run from $5,000 to $9,000 by the time you get it trained, and $4,000 to $5,000 a year to maintain these. And there is a lot of community help to make sure this gets done.  Mr.Speaker, I will now talk about another dog at the Gainesville Police Department: Justice is a German Shepherd that worked for the Gainesville Police Department starting in September 2006. During his career, Justice was responsible for locating hundreds of--hundreds of offenders. He assisted several other agencies throughout his career to include the Florida Highway Patrol, the Alachua County Sheriff's Office, the Putnam County Sheriff's Office, the University of Florida Police Department, the City of Alachua Police Department, and the City of High Springs Police  Justice was credited with saving a life. The incident involved a suicidal person who had taken a deadly amount of prescription pills, left a suicide note, and walked off into the woods. After 2 hours of officers trying to locate the person, Officer Owens and Justice were called to the scene while off duty. Justice was able to track and locate the person who was passed out by the effects of the pill and clinging to life. EMS was called, and the person was taken to the hospital. Doctors stated that if the person was not located when they were, the medications taken would have, no doubt, ended in their death and another suicide.  Justice received a lifesaving award through the department. On the last night of his career, Justice was called to locate a suspect that fled from an officer who recognized him as a felony habitual traffic offender and a drug dealer. The officer tried to conduct a traffic stop on the vehicle being driven by the suspect. When the officer activated his overhead lights, the suspect turned off his headlights, accelerated to a high speed, fleeing through a neighborhood. The officer did not pursue the vehicle. Another officer located the abandoned vehicle minutes later. A perimeter search was established.  Office Charles Owens and Justice responded to the scene. Justice began a track from the driver's side door. The track led through several backyards and for several blocks. Justice's track led into a wooded area where the suspect was located by Justice trying to conceal himself under a fallen tree. If not for Justice, the suspect would have eluded capture. Justice was sent to retire at the end of the shift, which ended at 4 a.m. He captured his last suspect just in the nick of time at 3 a.m. Officer Owens took possession of Justice after his retirement, and they have been with each other since.  Justice turns 15 on March 15 of this year and is still as active as he can be in his seasoned age. And I think, again, that is a model for all of us to follow.  Another story, Mr.Speaker, K-9 deputy successfully talks down an armed suicidal subject: The Marion County Sheriff's Office deputies responded to the 17,800 block of County Road 25 in reference to a domestic altercation. It was learned that the suspect battered and strangled a female victim. The suspect fled the area, just prior to the deputy's arrival. K-9 Deputy Jeremie Nix and K-9 Drago tracked and located the suspect in a wooded area, at which time the suspect advised he was armed with a firearm and a knife and threatened suicide.[[Page H1536]]                                {time}  2000  Deputy Nix was able to create a dialogue with the suspect and persuaded him to surrender peacefully. He did not have a firearm, but he was armed with a knife. The suspect was arrested and charged with domestic battery by strangulation and is being held in the Marion County Jail on $10,000 bond.  During this standoff, Deputy Nix and K-9 Drago accidentally stepped into a yellow jacket nest and were stung over 20 times. K-9 Drago was taken to the veterinarian's office to be checked out after the call, and he and Deputy Nix recovered and are back to work. Great job for everyone.  The K-9 team locates burglar, recovers approximately $3,500 of stolen property: On the morning of Thursday, February 1, 2018, Marion County Sheriff's Office deputies responded to Ernie's Auction Center, located at 5305 South Pine, in reference to a burglary that just occurred.  As employees were opening the business, it was observed that the front door had been forcibly entered and suspects were observed running through the inside of the business.  Deputy Branden Donahue and his K-9 partner, Tipster, and Deputy Nickolas Frost immediately tracked the suspect and located him within 30 minutes. During the track, two different locations were found where the suspects were stashing stolen items from the business. The stolen property, valued at $3,500, was recovered and returned to the businessowner.  People just don't realize the acute sense that these dogs have and why they are so valuable.  Another story is about Deputy Brian On February 7, 2004, Deputy Brian Litz and another deputy responded to the Pine Run subdivision in reference to a well-being check on a 74-year-old individual.  When the deputies arrived at the house, the individual met them at the door with a handgun. Deputy Litz was attempting to pass under the front window of the home to get a better visual on the individual with the gun. Unknown to Deputy Litz, this person was watching from the window, and he then shot and killed  Today, a statue in honor of Deputy Litz and his K-9 stands proudly in Florida's capital. In a tragic twist, Deputy Litz' call sign was Today, visitors of this statue at the Florida capital can find the Batman emblem on the bottom of his K-9's foot.  Just an amazing story and, again, a great example of the ability of these dogs and their success in helping out with people, whether it is the person in need, the lost individual, search and rescue, the drug dealer, and just people who want to do other people harm in domestic violence.  I just want to briefly talk about dogs and handlers. The Putnam County Sheriff's Office has five dogs: Aries, handled by Sergeant Randy Hayes; Judo, handled by Blaine Moody; Zeke, handled by Jerry Gentry; Halo, handled by Josue Garriga; and Putnam, named after the county, handled by Emmett  Bradford County Sheriff's Office: Deputy Brandon Shoup and K-9  Ocala Police Department: Officer King and K-9 Zorba; Officer Burgos and K-9 Babbo; Officer Arnold and K-9  The Marion County Sheriff's Office, again, yesterday, we had the privilege of going down and presenting all the working dogs and their handlers with our Congressional Challenge As you can see, that dog looks rather well the way he is wearing that. At the Marion County Sheriff's Office, where we were yesterday, we got to have the demonstration on the catch dogs, or attack dogs, and we got a great demonstration. There are: Sergeant Daniel Trammell and K-9 Nitro; Deputy Alan Lee, who handles K-9 Zeus; Deputy Timothy Fretts with his dog, K-9 Robo; Deputy Colton Sullivan with his dog, K-9 Adelmo; Deputy Matt Bowers with K-9 Otow, which is named after a retirement village that donated the money for their dog; Deputy Jeremie Nix with his dog, K-9 Drago; Deputy Branden Donahue with his dog, K-9 Tipster; and as we just heard the story, Deputy Matt Hopper with K-9  The Gainesville Police Department: Corporal Jeff Kerkau with his dog, K-9 Roo; Corporal Dylan Hayes-Morrison and his K-9 Ares; Officer Rob Rogers and K-9 Nero; Officer Ed Ratliff and his dog, K-9 Ace; Officer Josh Meurer and his dog, K-9  And the Alachua County Sheriff's Office:  Deputy Sheriff Lloyd O'Quinn and K-9 We just heard a story about them. A Malinois working in patrol, narcotics, and tracking.  Deputy Sheriff Esau Bright and K-9 Deacon, a Malinois working in patrol, narcotics, and trafficking.  That is what a lot of people don't realize. These dogs are trained in multiple disciplines and just work their hearts out.  Deputy Sheriff Mikell McKoy and his dog, K-9 Kaos, a Malinois working in patrol, narcotics, and trafficking.  Deputy Sheriff Brian Ritter and his dog, K-9 Kolt, a Malinois working in patrol, narcotics, and trafficking.  Deputy Sheriff Chris Griseck and his dog, K-9 Mack, a Malinois working in patrol, bombing, and tracking.  Then there is Deputy Sheriff Bill Arnold and his dog, K-9 Wick, a Malinois working in patrol, narcotics, and trafficking.  I think we are getting the point here of how valuable these dogs are. I would recommend to people, if you want to see the value and why we want to spend money and allow these dogs to be in our law enforcement, military, DEA, then watch demonstrations of these dogs and the acuteness of them.  There is Deputy Sheriff Chris Drake and his dog, K-9 Rous, a Malinois working in patrol, bomb, and tracking.  Sergeant Michael Hurlocker, who we heard the story of, and his K-9 partner, Havok, a Malinois working in patrol, bomb, and tracking.  Deputy Sheriff Adam Diaz and his dog, K-9 Shiloh, a Labrador Retriever working with the Drug Task  Sergeant Bryan Jones and K-9 Jerry, a Malinois working with the Drug Task  And then there is Sergeant Nigel Lowe and K-9 Zoey, a mixed breed working narcotics detection in our schools; and K-9 Malzi, a Malinois just joining the sheriff's office as a gun detection dog in our schools.  It is interesting, after the Parkland shooting on February 14, we had a roundtable of law enforcement, county sheriffs, city police chiefs, superintendents, school resource officers, and one of the things that came out of there is how the resource officers in our schools act as a deterrent for a lot of the kids. They are there. They see a person of authority.  One of the sheriffs brought up what I thought was a great suggestion that a lot of people also thought was a great suggestion, and that is a dog that can detect gunpowder in our schools. Let them tour the schools, let them show what the policemen can do beneficially to all of us.  It is a shame that we are in a time in society where we have to worry about guns going off in school, but until we rectify the underlying cause of that, I think we need to do what we can to keep our schools safe so our kids feel safe going to school.  I just want to end with this picture. Again, this is the Clay County Sheriff's Office with their dog, Diesel, who proudly took our Congressional Challenge  Mr.Speaker, I want to give a shout-out to all the offices that participated and shared stories with us. We are proud of them. We are proud of their K-9s. I don't want to say we are more proud of the K-9s than we are of them, but we are proud of all of them for the work that they do to keep us safer as citizens of the Third Congressional District, but also around the country and around the world.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-13-pt1-PgH1531-5.txt,2115,NATIONAL K-9 VETERANS DAY,2018.0,13.0,April

Cities throughout America were erupting in riots, in many instances, as they learned of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination.

1882,topic-id,492,"Mr.Speaker, I am very excited to be here because I know just how many disabled veterans in our country are on wait lists for adult day healthcare and now will be getting a service that is just so important and overdue.  I certainly want to thank Chairman Roe and his great staff, the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, the ranking member and his team as well, everybody coming together working hard on behalf of our disabled veterans who need it most.  I rise in support of 324. It is the Senate companion to my bill, H.1005, which is a bill to provide adult day healthcare and save State Veterans Homes for veterans who are 70 percent or more service-connected disabled. This bill is an extension to the Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006, which currently provides no-cost nursing home care at any State Veterans Home to veterans who are 70 percent or more service-connected disabled.  Medical model adult day healthcare provides comprehensive medical nursing and personal care services combined with engaging social activities for physically or cognitively impaired adults. Medical model adult day healthcare offers a complete array of rehabilitative therapies, including physical, occupational, and speech therapies, hospice and palliative care, social work, spiritual, nutritional counseling, and therapeutic recreation.  The program is designed to promote socialization and stimulation and maximize the participant's independence, while enhancing their quality of life. The program is staffed by a great team of multidisciplinary healthcare professionals who evaluate each participant and customize an individualized plan of care specific to their health and social needs.  Adult day healthcare is an alternative care setting that can allow some veterans who require long-term care services to remain in their homes as opposed to being institutionalized in a nursing home. Such veterans typically require support from some, but not all, activities of assisted daily living--ADLs--such as bathing, dressing, or feeding.  In many cases, the spouse or their family member may provide the veteran with much of their care, but they require additional support for some of the veteran's By filling these gaps, adult day healthcare can allow these veterans to remain in their homes and communities for additional months, or even years, and thereby lower the financial cost of caring for these heroes.  Adult day healthcare also provides family caregivers support and relief to meet their other professional and family obligations and provides a well-deserved respite while their loved ones are participating in the program.  In addition to thanking Chairman Roe for his leadership and support on this important issue, I also want to thank Senator Hatch for carrying this effort in the Senate, as well as Fred Sganga and the Long Island State Veterans Home in Stony Brook for their great efforts. That is a State Veterans Home located in the First Congressional District of New York, one of three places currently offering adult day healthcare.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.
