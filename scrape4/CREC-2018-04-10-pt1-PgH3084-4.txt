                  HONORING THE LIFE OF CARLY KREIBAUM

  (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to remember the life of Carly 
Kreibaum. Carly attended the Route 91 Festival on October 1 in Las 
Vegas.
  Carly was a doting mother to her two children, Dalten and Cambri, and 
she was a loving wife to her husband, Chris.
  She worked at Walmart in Spencer, Iowa, as a department manager for 
12 years.
  As a kid, she loved playing in her high school band and singing in 
the choir. She enjoyed playing basketball, and threw shot put for the 
school track and field team.
  Carly went to Las Vegas with two of her friends for a fun getaway.
  She was very involved in her community and was known for being very 
kind and outgoing.
  I would like to extend my condolences to Carly's family and friends. 
Please note that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, and the 
whole country grieve with you.
