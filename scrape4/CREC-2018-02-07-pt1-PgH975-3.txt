           By Mrs. HARTZLER:
       H.R. 4960.
       Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       Article 1, Section 8, Clause 7, ``The Congress shall have 
     power to . . . establish Post Offices and Post Roads . . .''
       In the Constitution, the power possessed by Congress 
     embraces the regulation of the Postal System in the country. 
     Therefore, the proposed legislation in naming a post office 
     would fall under the powers granted to Congress in the 
     Constitution.
