                        THANK YOU, CANDACE RICH

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, it is with sincere 
gratitude and appreciation I have the opportunity to recognize Candace 
Rich, legislative assistant for South Carolina's Second Congressional 
District. I will always appreciate Candace for her years of service on 
behalf of the people of South Carolina.
  A native of Virginia, Candace is an esteemed alumna of the University 
of South Carolina, with degrees in history and political science. She 
also earned a master's of arts in instruction and curriculum from 
Angelo State University.
  She is truly dedicated to public service, beginning as an intern in 
the district office starting in 2010 before joining the staff in 2014.
  Candace's experience on healthcare, education, and workforce issues, 
combined with a genuine desire to serve constituents, has made a 
difference. Candace was crucial in helping Republicans pass and have 
signed a record number of bills this year.
  It is with mixed feelings but great happiness that I bid Candace 
farewell. She is moving on next week to a new role teaching social 
studies at Central High School in San Angelo, Texas. I know her 
parents, Tim and Angela, along with her brothers, Aaron and Adam, join 
me in recognizing her achievements.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
