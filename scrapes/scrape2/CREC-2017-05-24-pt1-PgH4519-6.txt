               HONORING REVEREND DR. WILLIAM J. BARBER II

  (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, Walter Lippmann once said that ``The final 
test of a leader is that he leaves behind him in other men the 
conviction and the will carry on.''
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a great leader, the Reverend Dr. 
William J. Barber II. As the president of North Carolina's chapter of 
the NAACP, Reverend Barber has become a national icon and a champion of 
moral leadership. He is the founder of Moral Mondays. He has traveled 
to more than 20 States to train others on tactics in civil 
disobedience.
  And under his leadership, the NAACP fiercely fought against 
discriminatory legislation such as North Carolina's HB2 and voter 
suppression tactics like voter ID laws.

  After 12 years as president of the North Carolina NAACP, Reverend 
Barber is retiring to lead a new campaign--a national call for a moral 
revival. This new coalition of spiritual leaders will push beyond 
politics to guide our Nation toward a path of increased equality and 
social justice.
  Reverend Barber's leadership of the NAACP will be sorely missed, but 
I look forward to witnessing the many ways in which he will continue to 
impact lives and make America a more just and fair place.
  Thank you, Reverend Barber. Godspeed.
