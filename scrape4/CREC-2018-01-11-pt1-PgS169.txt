                              S. Res. 372

       Whereas the North Dakota State University (referred to in 
     this preamble as ``NDSU'') Bison won the 2017 National 
     Collegiate Athletic Association (referred to in this preamble 
     as the ``NCAA'') Division I Football Championship Subdivision 
     (referred to in this preamble as the ``FCS'') title game in 
     Frisco, Texas, on January 6, 2018, in a victory over the 
     James Madison University Dukes by a score of 17 to 13;
       Whereas NDSU has now won 14 NCAA championships;
       Whereas NDSU has now won its sixth NCAA Division I FCS 
     championship in 7 years, an extraordinary achievement;
       Whereas NDSU has now tied the record for most NCAA Division 
     I FCS championships with 6 in only 10 years of eligibility;
       Whereas the NDSU Bison have displayed tremendous resilience 
     and skill over the past 7 seasons, with 97 wins to only 8 
     losses, including a streak of 33 consecutive wins;
       Whereas estimates state that more than 13,000 Bison fans 
     attended the championship game, reflecting the tremendous 
     spirit and dedication of Bison Nation that has helped propel 
     the success of the team; and
       Whereas the 2017 NCAA Division I FCS championship was a 
     victory not only for the NDSU football team, but also for the 
     entire State of North Dakota: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--

     academic excellence; and
       (3) recognizes the students, alumni, and loyal fans that 
     supported the Bison while the Bison sought to capture a sixth 
     Division I Football Championship Subdivision championship for 
     North Dakota State University.
