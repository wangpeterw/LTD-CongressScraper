  Ms. BALDWIN (for herself, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Brown, Ms. Hassan, Mr. 
Franken, Mr. Moran, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Sanders, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Young, 
and Mr. King) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to 
the Committee on the Judiciary:

                              S. Res. 295

       Whereas employee-owned companies give workers a voice in 
     corporate governance, and that voice helps the long-term 
     well-being of the company;
       Whereas employee-owned companies often outperform non-
     employee-owned companies and show greater resiliency during 
     challenging economic conditions;
       Whereas employee-owned companies face lower staff turnover, 
     and workers experience greater job security at those 
     companies;
       Whereas employee-owners feel better prepared to cover the 
     expenses of life and retire with a greater sense of financial 
     security; and
       Whereas employee-owned companies have a rich history in 
     communities across the United States: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) designates October 2017 as ``National Employee 
     Ownership Month'';
       (2) supports employee-owned businesses; and
       (3) acknowledges that employee-owned companies have a 
     positive impact on workers, businesses, and communities.
