AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    The Foreign Relations Committee will come to _x000D_
order._x000D_
    I want to welcome our witness. I understand there may be _x000D_
circumstances where you may need to depart. We are just glad _x000D_
you are here. If you need to leave in 2 minutes, leave. I _x000D_
understand that there may be something occurring that will _x000D_
cause that. So please, just whatever makes you comfortable._x000D_
    I am glad to be here with our outstanding ranking member, _x000D_
who I have enjoyed working with so much. And I am glad we are _x000D_
having this hearing today on something that is so important to _x000D_
people around the world._x000D_
    I do not normally read opening statements. I think I may do _x000D_
it. We have been sort of focused on another issue for a while, _x000D_
but I think people know that since 1954, U.S. international _x000D_
food aid programs have helped to feed over 3 billion people and _x000D_
promote food security in over 150 countries. Most U.S. food aid _x000D_
is provided through Food for Peace, which is currently funded, _x000D_
on average, at $1.6 billion annually. Over the past 5 years, _x000D_
U.S. food aid has helped 56 million people, on average, per _x000D_
year._x000D_
    Today's hearing will provide the committee with an update _x000D_
on the current operations of the program, including the _x000D_
challenges it faces while responding to increasingly dangerous _x000D_
emergencies._x000D_
    This increasingly challenging global environment has _x000D_
illustrated to Congress the need for greater flexibility in how _x000D_
Food for Peace operates. The law requires that 100 percent of _x000D_
the food aid to be delivered be U.S.-purchased commodities, and _x000D_
50 percent of that is to be shipped on U.S.-flagged vessels._x000D_
    While recent reforms in the farm bill provide some _x000D_
administrative funds to be used for such things as locally and _x000D_
regionally purchased food aid and/or food vouchers, this _x000D_
limited flexibility must be executed in tandem with U.S.-_x000D_
purchased commodities. The cargo and commodity preferences _x000D_
create inefficiencies that undermine our ability to get maximum _x000D_
impact in addressing poverty and suffering from our U.S. food _x000D_
aid dollars._x000D_
    In some cases, where U.S. national security interests are _x000D_
at stake, like in Syria and other regions in conflict, U.S. _x000D_
food aid plays an important role in U.S. policy and engagement. _x000D_
These interventions would not be possible if we relied on U.S.-_x000D_
purchased commodities._x000D_
    Increasing flexibility in the Food for Peace program would _x000D_
provide up to $444 million in savings, allowing the United _x000D_
States _x000D_
to reach as many as 12 million more starving people, up to 2\1/_x000D_
2\ months faster in some cases._x000D_
    Again, I think this just jumps out at us, that self-imposed _x000D_
limitations--I am tired, I have not had a lot of sleep. I will _x000D_
just say that the special interests that capture this program _x000D_
cause people around the world to starve._x000D_
    While the impact of reforming U.S. food aid overseas is _x000D_
profound, the domestic implications are minor, as food aid only _x000D_
contributes 1.41 percent to net farm income and 0.86 percent to _x000D_
agriculture exports._x000D_
    I have joined forces with my friend and colleague, Senator _x000D_
Coons, by authorizing with him the Food for Peace Reform Act. _x000D_
We are seeking to increase the flexibility of our food aid _x000D_
programs and are looking to our witnesses today to illustrate _x000D_
why reform to the program matters._x000D_
    For many around the globe we are not yet reaching but _x000D_
could, it is a matter of life and death._x000D_
    Again, we thank you for being here. I look forward to _x000D_
turning to Senator Cardin and maybe Senator Coons, who has been _x000D_
such a champion._x000D_
    But I hope that out of this hearing, something is going to _x000D_
occur where we will do the things necessary to make sure that _x000D_
our U.S. dollars help those people that today, as we sit here _x000D_
in this comfort, are starving because of special interests here _x000D_
in our own Nation._x000D_
    With that, Senator Cardin.",corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    Without objection._x000D_
_x000D_
the ``Additional Material Submitted for the Record'' section at ",corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    I am glad that these entities that have so _x000D_
much to do with this program will have a chance. I know we _x000D_
tried to accommodate additional witnesses. But anyway, I am _x000D_
glad you made that statement._x000D_
    I wonder if Senator Coons would like to make an opening _x000D_
comment.",corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    Thank you. And I think people should know, _x000D_
for the record, one of the reasons that we are having this _x000D_
hearing today is a commitment that was made to Senator Coons, _x000D_
as we closed out last year, that we would deal with this issue. _x000D_
So I thank him for his leadership._x000D_
    Our first witness is director Dina Esposito, as long as she _x000D_
is here, from the USAID Office of Food for Peace. Director _x000D_
Esposito manages the Food for Peace program, which responds to _x000D_
acute food insecurity by providing in-kind food aid locally and _x000D_
regionally procured food aid, food vouchers, and cash transfers _x000D_
to millions of people affected by conflict and natural _x000D_
disasters annually._x000D_
    In addition, it also supports interventions in critical _x000D_
areas such as nutrition, health, agriculture, and livelihood to _x000D_
address the underlying causes of poverty and hunger among the _x000D_
poorest of the poor with development food aid._x000D_
    Thank you for being here and sharing your thoughts. Please _x000D_
take however long you wish to share those thoughts. Then we _x000D_
will have questions. Thank you very much.",corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    Thank you. Thank you very much for what you _x000D_
and your staff do on behalf of our country. It is deeply _x000D_
appreciated._x000D_
    Just to begin, what would be the implications for U.S. _x000D_
national security if you did not have the flexibility that you _x000D_
now have in Syria and in the region in delivering aid, and you _x000D_
had to rely solely on U.S. commodities?",corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    So, critics of us not purchasing food created _x000D_
in the United States say that it increases the chance of using _x000D_
unsafe food._x000D_
    In the places where we have been able to use local and _x000D_
regional food, has this been a problem?",corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    So if I hear you correctly, that allegation _x000D_
is a hoax.",corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    Okay._x000D_
    Critics of reform also claim that cash-based programs _x000D_
transfer cash from the United States to corrupt governments, _x000D_
but we know that the aid is being provided directly to _x000D_
beneficiaries. So can you discuss this issue for us?",corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    So generally speaking, that criticism is a _x000D_
hoax. [Laughter.]",corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    I am sure there are examples, minor examples. _x000D_
But generally speaking, that is not the case.",corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    So we are the only major developed country in _x000D_
the world that still provides the bulk of our food aid through _x000D_
domestic commodities.",corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    I think that kind of speaks for itself._x000D_
    I just would like to know, does this make it more difficult _x000D_
for us to coordinate with other multilateral agencies and other _x000D_
donors in really hard-hit areas like Haiti, for example, in _x000D_
dealing with making sure that people have food when they need _x000D_
it?",corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    So the other developed countries like us that _x000D_
care deeply about making sure that people have food, they have _x000D_
more flexibility. We are sort of locked in.",corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    So as the perceived most innovative free _x000D_
nation in the world, we are really behind the rest of the world _x000D_
when it comes to feeding the poor. Is that correct?",corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    Listen, thank you for being here, and I look _x000D_
forward to the questions from our distinguished ranking member.",corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    Thank you, Senator._x000D_
    Senator Gardner.",corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    Thank you._x000D_
    I know you were not feeling particularly well when you came _x000D_
in. I hope the response you got today makes you feel a little _x000D_
bit better. We, certainly, thank you for being here._x000D_
    I do want to make a comment, which may generate the need _x000D_
for a response from others, but it is not USAID's job to ensure _x000D_
that our military policy and sealift capacity is met, is it?",corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    That is sort of a DOD problem, is it not?",corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    I would just say, look, I realize we have _x000D_
some sensibilities that will have to be dealt with. I would _x000D_
hope that the reason Americans, whether they are in the _x000D_
agriculture business or the maritime business or whatever, or _x000D_
the NGO business, especially the NGO business, would support us _x000D_
making changes because other people will not starve._x000D_
    I would hope that people would support this because it is _x000D_
an important American value. And I hope that as we move through _x000D_
this, in spite of the fact that, let us face it, people make a _x000D_
living off U.S. programs, in some cases to the adversity of _x000D_
people who are starving, I would hope we would figure out a way _x000D_
to first prioritize the great work that you are doing and this _x000D_
American value that exists for this program. So thank you._x000D_
    I think there may be a response.",corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    And, as you mentioned, coming in, I am sure, _x000D_
that based on what has happened over the last week, we, _x000D_
certainly, should be able to deal with this._x000D_
    I would say that one of the things that would hit a chord, _x000D_
I think with every American, is using even the same dollars _x000D_
that we are spending--the same dollars that we are spending--to _x000D_
reach millions more to make sure they are not starving. And _x000D_
with the passage of this legislation, we, certainly, could make _x000D_
that happen.",corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    Very good. Thank you._x000D_
    Thank you. Goodbye. [Laughter.]_x000D_
    Okay, we will now turn to our witnesses on the second _x000D_
panel. Our first witness is Mr. David Ray, vice president for _x000D_
policy and advocacy at CARE USA. Mr. Ray has over 20 years of _x000D_
experience working at CARE USA. Founded in 1945, it is one of _x000D_
the largest and oldest humanitarian aid organizations focused _x000D_
on fighting global poverty._x000D_
    CARE USA is an important implementing partner of the Food _x000D_
for Peace program and was an early adopter of some of the food _x000D_
aid programs we are discussing today._x000D_
    I thank you for allowing my daughter to intern with you in _x000D_
Tanzania years ago. It had a huge impact on her life. I thank _x000D_
you._x000D_
    Our second witness is Dr. Vincent Smith, professor of _x000D_
economics at the Montana State University and visiting scholar _x000D_
at the American Enterprise Institute. Dr. Smith's research _x000D_
includes an examination of agricultural science policy, _x000D_
domestic and world commodity markets, risk management, and _x000D_
agricultural trade policy. He has authored nine books and _x000D_
monographs, and published over 100 articles on agriculture and _x000D_
other policy and economic issues._x000D_
    Our third witness is Dr. Stephanie Mercier, a senior policy _x000D_
adviser at the Farm Journal Foundation. Prior to that, Dr. _x000D_
Mercier--am I pronouncing it correctly?--was a chief economist _x000D_
at the Senate Agriculture Committee from 1997 to 2011. Thank _x000D_
you for your service here. She was involved in several reform _x000D_
efforts made to the Food for Peace program._x000D_
    With that, I will recognize Dr. Ray._x000D_
    Thank you all for being here. We look forward to your _x000D_
testimony and your assistance in helping us navigate these _x000D_
issues. Thank you.",corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    Thank you very much._x000D_
    Dr. Smith.",corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    Thank you, Doctor._x000D_
    Dr. Mercier.",corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    Thank you all for your testimony. I think you _x000D_
have all been most helpful. There are not many Americans, I _x000D_
realize, who watch these kinds of panels, but this panel is _x000D_
selected jointly by Republicans and Democrats, and it is _x000D_
amazing to me that the message is exactly the same by the _x000D_
panelists._x000D_
    I want to ask a few questions and then make a statement, _x000D_
and then turn to our ranking member._x000D_
    Dr. Smith, it is my understanding, if I heard you _x000D_
correctly, that 70 percent to 75 percent of the ships moving _x000D_
food aid are not militarily useful. Is that correct?",corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    It is my understanding that that number _x000D_
actually could be as much as 40 percent foreign-owned. Is that _x000D_
correct?",corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    Yes. So to go down the same path we did with _x000D_
our former witness, first of all, food aid certainly is not _x000D_
designed for national security. But the fact that this actually _x000D_
has significant effect on our national security again is a _x000D_
total hoax. Is that correct? Let me say, mostly a hoax, okay? ",corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    I have not seen House of Cards, but I _x000D_
understand they say those kinds of things.",corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    Well, based on the amount of money we are _x000D_
blowing, I think you said we are spending more on shipping than _x000D_
on food.",corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    These 450 folks could be sent to Tahiti and _x000D_
supported for the rest of their lives better than any of us, _x000D_
and we would still be saving huge amounts of money. So I think _x000D_
we can figure out a way to deal with that.",corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    Very good._x000D_
    This is for everybody. In recent years, some countries in _x000D_
Africa have received U.S. food aid in the form of U.S. _x000D_
commodities for several years in a row. Do you think this has _x000D_
hampered some recipients' ability to recover from the shock of _x000D_
the initial disaster that they faced? This is for all of you, _x000D_
briefly.",corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    Listen, again, I want to thank Senator _x000D_
Cardin, Senator Coons, Senator Kaine, Senator Gardner, who was _x000D_
here earlier. I think that we have an opportunity here to work _x000D_
together to solve this problem._x000D_
    I will say that I wish every American could have seen this _x000D_
testimony today. What is happening in food aid in our Nation, _x000D_
for a few special interests that benefit only marginally, is a _x000D_
national disgrace--a national disgrace. I am going to do _x000D_
everything in my power to make sure that every American I come _x000D_
in contact with is aware that a few special interests that have _x000D_
negligible impact, really, on them, but they have this Nation _x000D_
in their grip, people are dying and starving--dying and _x000D_
starving--because of this national disgrace of corporate _x000D_
welfare that is totally unnecessary, totally unnecessary to the _x000D_
beneficiaries._x000D_
    So I thank you for being here. I look forward to working _x000D_
constructively with people on this committee, as we have so _x000D_
much recently, to ensure that our focus here is on making sure _x000D_
that people who are hungry have the basic food elements that _x000D_
they need to survive._x000D_
    Thank you very much._x000D_
    Ranking Member Cardin.",corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    Thank you. Thank you so much for your input _x000D_
and just tremendous successes we have had recently._x000D_

AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    Senator Coons, if I could, could I add a _x000D_
minute or 2 to your time, and for people who are just watching _x000D_
this, ask your witness to explain how monetization works?",corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    I think it would be helpful to everyone and _x000D_
help build a case for what you are trying to----",corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,    Sure.,corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Senator Coons, thank you for asking the great question _x000D_
about what if food aid were focused on food aid. That would be _x000D_
a good thing._x000D_
    I would just say, editorially, I doubt there are other aid _x000D_
programs that we participate in that have such a small amount _x000D_
of corporate welfare interests that cause us to waste as much _x000D_
money. I just cannot believe 450 sailors are generating the _x000D_
support for this aid program. And I just hope that we will _x000D_
figure out a way to deal appropriately with it._x000D_
    Senator Shaheen.",corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,    Sure.,corker
AMERICAN FOOD AID: WHY REFORM MATTERS,4/15/2015,"    Anybody else have any closing questions or _x000D_
comments?_x000D_
    I want to thank all of you for being here. I think this _x000D_
testimony has been outstanding, as has the hearing._x000D_
    My guess is, to follow up on Dr. Smith's comments, I would _x000D_
bet that while there are associations and entities that lobby _x000D_
on behalf of various industries, if you will, I would bet if _x000D_
the members themselves were aware of the negative impact this _x000D_
lobbying was having on people who were starving, I do not _x000D_
believe there would be as much lobbying taking place._x000D_
    I do not think they have any idea that there are paid _x000D_
lobbyists up here that are causing people around the world to _x000D_
starve. I just have greater faith in the American people, _x000D_
greater faith that if these groups they are representing, if _x000D_
the individuals actually knew what was happening, they would be _x000D_
ashamed and they would cause it to stop._x000D_
    So I thank you all for being here._x000D_
    Mr. Ray, thank you for the example your organization is _x000D_
setting._x000D_
    Dr. Mercier, thank you for all your efforts through the _x000D_
years to cause reforms to happen._x000D_
    The meeting will be adjourned, although for questions, the _x000D_
record will remain open through the end of the day Friday._x000D_
    Thank you all for being here.",corker
THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN,12/16/2015,"    The Foreign Relations Committee will come to _x000D_
order. We want to thank our witnesses for being here and, _x000D_
certainly, all of our committee members._x000D_
    I think in lieu of reading my normal opening statement, I _x000D_
just want to make a general statement, and that is that _x000D_
yesterday we had a classified briefing. What we hear in _x000D_
classified briefings about the direction and the signals and _x000D_
all of the things that are occurring in Afghanistan directly _x000D_
contradict some of the rosy public statements that are made _x000D_
about what is happening within the country._x000D_
    I think it is actually alarming to go to a classified _x000D_
session and then to hear reports about those discussions in the _x000D_
Armed Services Committee itself._x000D_
    So with that backdrop, I just want to say to each of you, _x000D_
all of us obviously want our Nation to be successful in its _x000D_
efforts in Afghanistan. I know there has been a debate about _x000D_
the number of troops on the ground. There have been some _x000D_
arbitrary numbers that have been thrown out. I know today we _x000D_
have 9,800 troops there. Yet, from what I can tell yet, we are _x000D_
continuing to lose territory, lose momentum. The status in _x000D_
Afghanistan is today that we are moving in a very negative _x000D_
direction on the ground._x000D_
    So obviously, that is concerning. We know that President _x000D_
Ghani has a vast amount of experience, even though he is _x000D_
somewhat of a technocrat. He knows there are issues that need _x000D_
to be dealt with appropriately within the country._x000D_
    But when you look at all of these security issues that are _x000D_
being dealt with, certainly it takes away from his ability to _x000D_
implement those._x000D_
    So we are concerned about security. I think we are _x000D_
concerned about any type of reconciliation that is taking _x000D_
place. We understand the concerns that exist relative to _x000D_
Pakistan. And let us face it, it is them, to a degree, hedging _x000D_
their bets. But from the outside, as you watch what is _x000D_
happening there, the Taliban is gaining ground, and that is _x000D_
just a fact._x000D_
    So I hope this hearing today, which will obviously be the _x000D_
first public hearing we have had in some time on this topic, _x000D_
will help us be illuminated._x000D_
    We thank both of you very, very much for your service and _x000D_
for being here. And we thank you for your willingness to help _x000D_
us with understanding as to what is actually happening there on _x000D_
the ground._x000D_
    With that, I will turn to Senator Cardin.",corker
THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN,12/16/2015,"    Thank you, sir._x000D_
    We will now turn to our witnesses on the first panel. We _x000D_
will hear from two administration witnesses representing the _x000D_
State Department and USAID whose portfolios include both _x000D_
Afghanistan and Pakistan. Our second panel includes three _x000D_
informed experts on Afghanistan and the region. We thank them _x000D_
for being here._x000D_
    So our first witness is the respected Ambassador Richard _x000D_
Olson, the United States Special Representative for Afghanistan _x000D_
and Pakistan, and recently returned as our Ambassador from _x000D_
Islamabad._x000D_
    We thank you very much for a career in public service and _x000D_
Foreign Service, and for being here today._x000D_
    Our second witness is Donald L. Sampler Jr., assistant to _x000D_
the administrator for Pakistan and Afghanistan for USAID. We _x000D_
thank you for what you and your cohorts do around the world to _x000D_
further U.S. interests._x000D_
    So with that, Ambassador Olson, if you would begin, we _x000D_
would appreciate it._x000D_
    I would just say, as a courtesy to my fellow panelists _x000D_
here, the deadline on a couple of issues is 21 minutes relative _x000D_
to the other thing we are working on. I may step in and out a _x000D_
little bit and miss a little bit, not out of disrespect. Thank _x000D_
you.",corker
THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN,12/16/2015,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Mr. Sampler.",corker
THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN,12/16/2015,"    Thank you very much for that testimony. I am _x000D_
going to do some interaction along the way and turn at present _x000D_
to Senator Cardin for questions.",corker

    Senator Isakson?",corker
THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN,12/16/2015,"    Thank you very much._x000D_
    I know we are about to close out and we have another panel._x000D_
    Just out of curiosity, to follow up a little bit on Senator _x000D_
Kaine's comments about the diverging views, I will say, for _x000D_
what it is worth--I had a private meeting with you, Ambassador _x000D_
Olson. We had the classified briefing. For what it is worth, _x000D_
while you obviously speak in a more statesmanlike manner, the _x000D_
views of what is happening in Afghanistan were very aligned. I _x000D_
mean, the meeting we had in our office, the classified briefing _x000D_
yesterday, was very much aligned. I mean, we have some issues _x000D_
we need to deal with._x000D_
    Why do you think there is that divergent view on the other _x000D_
side that takes place? I know that you work closely with our _x000D_
armed services. How could it be, as involved as you are there, _x000D_
both of you, that we have an alignment over here at the State _x000D_
Department with our intelligence, but a disalignment, if you _x000D_
will, over on the other sectors?",corker
THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN,12/16/2015,"    I actually found alignments we had yesterday _x000D_
to be very good._x000D_
    The Taliban issue, now obviously we came into Afghanistan _x000D_
in 2001. The issue was to end the Taliban's existence and _x000D_
dominion over government at the time. Now they are changing the _x000D_
facts on the ground. Is that fair?",corker
THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN,12/16/2015,"    And there are discussions about, over time, _x000D_
we have made some accommodating comments publicly, our _x000D_
government has, relative to their potential involvement in the _x000D_
government down the road. Is that fair to say?",corker
THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN,12/16/2015,"    And I know that I was stepping in and out, _x000D_
and I greatly apologize for that. My understanding is a _x000D_
statement was made that, at present, they are not exhibiting _x000D_
the characteristics that would be appropriate for them to be a _x000D_
part of that. Is that correct?",corker
THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN,12/16/2015,"    So that is the end state that the Afghan _x000D_
Government is working toward. I think it is good that we have _x000D_
not established preconditions ourselves._x000D_
    What would be, though, the characteristics, the Taliban _x000D_
would need to exhibit from your standpoint to be a legitimate _x000D_
entity for the Afghan Government to begin negotiations with?",corker
THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN,12/16/2015,    Yes. Your observation would be?,corker
THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN,12/16/2015,"    And do you think, based on what you know, the _x000D_
Taliban has the capacity to reject terrorism and violence?",corker
THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN,12/16/2015,"    A couple more just brief questions._x000D_
    We had a decent meeting with the Prime Minister of Pakistan _x000D_
and their military leadership. They gave us strongly worded _x000D_
statements about the ISI involvement and how 1,000 percent they _x000D_
are committed to dealing with the Taliban, dealing with other _x000D_
groups that are housed in the FATA region and, certainly, _x000D_
ensuring that they did everything they could to make sure that _x000D_
Afghanistan was stabilized._x000D_
    On the other hand, I get a strong sense that is maybe not _x000D_
100 percent accurate. They are watching what is happening on _x000D_
the ground. They want to have the proper relationship, if you _x000D_
will, with the ultimate leadership group that exists in _x000D_
Afghanistan. What they are seeing right now is a situation _x000D_
where they are not sure what that outcome is going to be._x000D_
    My sense is that instead of them actually carrying out what _x000D_
they said here in our presence, that they are hedging their _x000D_
bets. They are trying to calculate, if you will, what _x000D_
Afghanistan is going to be over time._x000D_
    Right now, we have 9,800 troops ourselves in Afghanistan. _x000D_
There has been a sort of arbitrary date of numbers of troops _x000D_
that will be there over the course of this next year, I think _x000D_
dropping down to about 5,000._x000D_
    But it seems to me that we have our hands full as is, that _x000D_
it is incredibly difficult for us to keep violence down and _x000D_
stability in place at present._x000D_
    Just out of curiosity, does that raise questions to you as _x000D_
to when we need to be deciding ultimately what our security _x000D_
force totals are going to be in Afghanistan?",corker
THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN,12/16/2015,    What about the second part of the question?,corker
THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN,12/16/2015,"    I have no desire, out of respect to you--you _x000D_
and I may have traveled together to the Waziristans, if I _x000D_
remember correctly.",corker
THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN,12/16/2015,"    I do not want in any way try to create a _x000D_
divergence between you and the administration. But let us just _x000D_
say at present, things could change, certainly, between now and _x000D_
the end of the year._x000D_
    Our security forces have their hands full in working with _x000D_
the Afghan military to try to create a secure environment. Is _x000D_
that correct?",corker
THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN,12/16/2015,"    At the moment._x000D_
    Listen, I certainly appreciate your service. I appreciated _x000D_
your candor yesterday in our office. I appreciate the service _x000D_
you provided in multiple settings._x000D_
    Certainly, you all have been helpful to us today. I do _x000D_
think that it would be fair to say, based on the entirety of _x000D_
yesterday, today, just other interactions we have, we should _x000D_
all be very concerned about outcomes in Afghanistan and _x000D_
understand that tremendous diligence and effort is still _x000D_
necessary, and leadership on their part, to cause a successful _x000D_
outcome to occur._x000D_
    Would you agree?",corker
THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN,12/16/2015,"    Thank you, both. I appreciate it._x000D_
    We will now ask the second panel to take their place. We _x000D_
thank all of you for being here._x000D_
    Our first witness today will be the former U.S. Ambassador _x000D_
to Afghanistan, James Cunningham, someone we all know well, now _x000D_
a senior fellow and the Khalilzad Chair on Afghanistan at the _x000D_
South Asia Center of the Atlantic Council._x000D_
    We thank you for being here._x000D_
    The second witness will be former Afghan Minister Mr. Ali _x000D_
Jalali._x000D_
    Thank you so much for being here. We all know you also._x000D_
    He is now a distinguished professor at the Near East and _x000D_
South Asia Center for Strategic Studies at the National Defense _x000D_
University._x000D_
    Our third witness will be Jodi Vittori, a senior policy _x000D_
adviser at Global Witness, who has also served in the U.S. _x000D_
military in Afghanistan--we thank you for that service--and in _x000D_
countering corruption in the defense and security sector, which _x000D_
I know there is a big job._x000D_
    So we thank you all for being here. We think this is a very _x000D_
distinguished panel. If you could keep your comments to around _x000D_
5 minutes, without objection, your written testimony will be _x000D_
entered into the record._x000D_
    If we could, we can go in the order of introduction, _x000D_
starting with you, Ambassador Cunningham.",corker
THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN,12/16/2015,"    Thank you very much._x000D_
    I want to apologize to all of you. We have an omni bill _x000D_
that was just produced last night about 12 o'clock. Today, _x000D_
there are still discussions that are underway. As I step in and _x000D_
out, it is not out of lack of interest on this topic. We are _x000D_
going to be out of here this week with a massive piece of _x000D_
legislation that is passed, and we apologize for attending to _x000D_
that, which, by the way, parts of affect Afghanistan, too.",corker
THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN,12/16/2015,    That is a secret we are keeping. [Laughter.],corker
THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN,12/16/2015,"    Mr. Jalali, thank you.",corker

   STATEMENT OF JODI VITTORI, SENIOR POLICY ADVISER, GLOBAL _x000D_
                   WITNESS, WASHINGTON, D.",corker
THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN,12/16/2015,"    I thank all three of you. We appreciate it. _x000D_
We are privileged to have the opportunity to have people like _x000D_
you before us. Again, we thank you for your time and _x000D_
preparation in being here._x000D_
    Ambassador Cunningham, I think people would say you worked _x000D_
for one of the most difficult people ever when you were working _x000D_
with President Karzai. We ended up with the Ghani government, _x000D_
which I think most people believe is a pretty good outcome for _x000D_
Afghanistan._x000D_
    I know there are a number of things that he needs to put in _x000D_
place. I know he is a technocrat, probably not quite as much of _x000D_
a politician as Karzai was, but understands things about good _x000D_
governance and corruption and those kinds of issues._x000D_
    But at the same time, it is going to be very difficult for _x000D_
him to be successful, is it not, unless there is a secure _x000D_
environment there? I mean, I think, at the end of the day, that _x000D_
is the number one thing that will inhibit his ability to be _x000D_
successful._x000D_
    I would like you to speak to that, but also, are there _x000D_
additional diplomatic and/or other tools that you think we as a _x000D_
Nation in current times are not utilizing properly?",corker
THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN,12/16/2015,"    Mr. Jalali, I do not know what numbers are _x000D_
public and what numbers are not public, so, like Senator Kaine, _x000D_
I want to be very careful. But at a minimum, there is a massive _x000D_
turnover rate in the military. I do not even want to speak to _x000D_
what the official numbers are, but they were very large, at a _x000D_
minimum._x000D_
    I know that you have discussed the need for us to be there _x000D_
under this same arrangement for 5 years. Is that correct, in _x000D_
your written testimony? I think all of us, whenever we go to _x000D_
Afghanistan, we are taken to where the Afghan military is being _x000D_
trained, and we are seeing the maneuvers they are going _x000D_
through. While we appreciate the fact that people in _x000D_
Afghanistan are good fighters, it is hard to detect a real _x000D_
commitment and professionalism in that regard._x000D_
    I am just wondering if you could speak to the turnover rate _x000D_
and also the things we need to do over the next 5 years to _x000D_
ensure that Ghani is able to be successful and/or his _x000D_
successor.",corker
THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN,12/16/2015,"    I know my time is up, and I obviously want to _x000D_
be courteous to the other members._x000D_
    Culturally, what is happening within the Afghan military _x000D_
where we have such a high percentage of people who leave each _x000D_
year, that then cause us--again to keep the numbers that we _x000D_
have in mind, we have a massive amount of training that we have _x000D_
each year. Therefore, you lack the experience on the ground _x000D_
that otherwise would be the case.",corker
THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN,12/16/2015,    Ninety percent of the forces.,corker
THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN,12/16/2015,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Dr. Vittori, I know others will ask you questions, I am _x000D_
sure, about corruption. We know that is a massive issue in the _x000D_
country. And, obviously, it cannot go forward productively _x000D_
without dealing with that. Thank you for being here._x000D_
    Senator Cardin?",corker
THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN,12/16/2015,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Senator Kaine?",corker
THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN,12/16/2015,"    I was going to say, they learned well.",corker
THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN,12/16/2015,    Sure.,corker
THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN,12/16/2015,"    We are about at that time, but I just want to _x000D_
follow up a little bit on that. I know when we go into a _x000D_
culture, and we want to make things happen quickly, we _x000D_
obviously are dealing with a culture where they are at that _x000D_
moment. We hope to have things put in place over time that _x000D_
cause corruption and other kinds of things to dissipate and go _x000D_
away. But when we begin, we are dealing with a culture as it _x000D_
is._x000D_
    I am just wondering if there are any lessons learned that _x000D_
you might be willing to share with us. When we enter a country _x000D_
like this on the front, do we sometimes send mixed signals _x000D_
relative to our actions in trying to generate immediate _x000D_
outcomes and our rhetoric as to what we want to see them do _x000D_
over time?_x000D_
    That is you, Doctor.",corker
THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN,12/16/2015,"    Well, you gave the answer that I thought you _x000D_
would give._x000D_
    When we go in, we go in to a crisis mode. We want things to _x000D_
happen quickly. I think, again, we establish on the front end _x000D_
that--and I understand this may be out of necessity--but we _x000D_
start building on the existing culture of corruption, _x000D_
especially when you are dealing with people like we had in _x000D_
leadership there up until recent times._x000D_
    It just perpetuates that. It is almost I guess a joke. We _x000D_
hear the stories of our guys going in to meet with a former _x000D_
leader there about corruption, and then right behind him would _x000D_
be somebody coming in with suitcases, as you were talking _x000D_
about._x000D_
    So I think it is real challenge for us._x000D_
    On that note, moving back to the Ambassador, since you are _x000D_
on the private-sector side now and utilizing your experiences _x000D_
around the world to help look at things in a new way, just _x000D_
briefly, at 30,000 feet, do you have any advice for those of us _x000D_
who still are here on the inside as it relates to going into _x000D_
countries like Afghanistan, like Iraq, potentially portions of _x000D_
Syria, if you will? Any advice to us as we look at trying to _x000D_
reconfigure those, if you will, in our own image?",corker
THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN,12/16/2015,"    Just to refresh our memory, those time spans, _x000D_
the years were?",corker
THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN,12/16/2015,    Damaging to their society.,corker
THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN,12/16/2015,"    Listen, you all have been very, very helpful. _x000D_
We thank you for the service you have provided our Nation and _x000D_
the service you are providing now on the outside. Hopefully, _x000D_
you will be back up to help us again in the future._x000D_
    If you would, we would like to leave the record open until _x000D_
the close of business Monday. And if questions come in, _x000D_
hopefully you will answer those fairly promptly.",corker
THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN,12/16/2015,"    With that, without further ado, unless you _x000D_
would like to close with any kind of comments, and I see no _x000D_
nods, the meeting is adjourned. Thank you so much.",corker
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM,12/9/2015,"    The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will _x000D_
come to order._x000D_
    I want to thank our witness. I know she has significant _x000D_
responsibilities right now at the U.N. Security Council. Ben _x000D_
and I had a chance this week to meet with her and all the _x000D_
members. Quite educational, I hope on both sides. But we _x000D_
certainly appreciate you being here, and I will introduce you _x000D_
in just a moment._x000D_
    Today's hearing will review the United Nations peacekeeping _x000D_
operations and explore opportunities for reform to make U.N. _x000D_
peacekeeping work better in U.S. national interests._x000D_
    As a permanent member of the Security Council and the _x000D_
largest contributor by far to the U.N. peacekeeping budget, the _x000D_
U.S. has a particular interest in how U.N. peacekeeping _x000D_
mandates are set and operations are carried out. The United _x000D_
States cannot be everywhere all the time. There is an important _x000D_
role for U.N. peacekeeping in supporting U.S. interests for _x000D_
security and stability around the world._x000D_
    Today's U.N. peacekeeping is evolving in many ways. _x000D_
Traditionally, missions have focused primarily on negotiating _x000D_
peace agreements, inserting blue helmets to separate _x000D_
conflicting parties to implement these agreements, and _x000D_
generally monitoring and keeping the peace._x000D_
    U.N. peacekeepers now are being asked to take on new and _x000D_
difficult responsibilities, such as civilian protection, _x000D_
disarming active combatants, or developing the capacity to _x000D_
engage on the antiterrorism front. These new missions and _x000D_
mandates raise many questions, which we certainly will be _x000D_
exploring today._x000D_
    What are the risks when U.N. peacekeepers actively engage _x000D_
combatants in a warzone? Do U.N. peacekeepers forgo their _x000D_
neutrality in these instances? And if so, what are the _x000D_
implications for our interests?_x000D_
    If U.N. peacekeepers are asked to provide logistics support _x000D_
in humanitarian crises such as the Ebola fight in West Africa, _x000D_
what challenges does that raise?_x000D_
    I am particularly concerned with recent disturbing reports _x000D_
of sexual exploitation and abuse by certain U.N. peacekeeping _x000D_
troops. The current U.N. policy is zero tolerance, but such _x000D_
abuses continue with disturbing regularity._x000D_
    So it is our hope to find some common sense ways to address _x000D_
these issues and explore these and other topics, such as the _x000D_
U.S. peacekeeping assessment._x000D_
    We again want to thank our distinguished witness for being _x000D_
here, and I will turn it over to our ranking member for his _x000D_
comments.",corker
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM,12/9/2015,"    Thank you, Senator Cardin._x000D_
    We have two distinguished panels today, and we want to _x000D_
thank all who are here to share their wisdom._x000D_
    Our first witness is the Permanent Representative to the _x000D_
U.S. Mission to the United Nations, Samantha Power. We thank _x000D_
you for being here today with a very tight schedule._x000D_

   STATEMENT OF HON. SAMANTHA POWER, UNITED STATES PERMANENT _x000D_
REPRESENTATIVE TO THE UNITED NATIONS, UNITED STATES MISSION TO _x000D_
             THE UNITED NATIONS, NEW YORK, NEW YORK_x000D_
_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, Ranking _x000D_
Member Cardin, for convening this hearing. And thank you all, _x000D_
distinguished members of the committee, for making time to be _x000D_
here to discuss peacekeeping._x000D_
    This committee is acutely aware of the extent to which _x000D_
conflicts on the other side of the globe can come back and _x000D_
threaten American security. We have seen time and again how _x000D_
conflicts can displace millions of people, upend markets, and _x000D_
destabilize entire regions._x000D_
    All too recently and all too frequently, we have seen how _x000D_
such instability can attract and enable violent extremist _x000D_
groups, who exploit the vacuum of authority to terrorize _x000D_
civilians; recruit new members; and plan, launch, or inspire _x000D_
attacks._x000D_
    U.N. peacekeepers play a vital role in the international _x000D_
community's efforts to address war, violence, and instability. _x000D_
As President Obama said in September, ``We know that peace _x000D_
operations are not the solution to every problem, but they do _x000D_
remain one of the world's most important tools to address armed _x000D_
conflict.''_x000D_
    Peacekeepers can help resolve conflict, shore up stability, _x000D_
deny safe harbor to extremists, and protect civilians from _x000D_
atrocities, all of which serve core American interests and _x000D_
reflect deep American values, while ensuring greater burden-_x000D_
sharing by the international community._x000D_
    This administration has consequently been working _x000D_
aggressively to ensure that U.N. peacekeeping operations are _x000D_
better able to meet the demands of international peace and _x000D_
security, which, as has been noted by both the chairman and the _x000D_
ranking member, those requirements have changed considerably _x000D_
over just the last 20 years._x000D_
    Peacekeepers today are undertaking more missions. The _x000D_
number of uniformed personnel has risen from fewer than 20,000 _x000D_
15 years ago to over 100,000 today._x000D_
    They are assuming greater risk. Two-thirds of peacekeepers _x000D_
are operating in active conflicts, the highest percentage in _x000D_
history._x000D_
    And they are assigned broad and increasingly complex _x000D_
responsibilities, ranging from disarming armed groups to _x000D_
facilitating the safe delivery of humanitarian aid to _x000D_
protecting civilians from those who wish them harm._x000D_
    Today, 98 percent of uniformed personnel in U.N. missions _x000D_
around the world are under orders to protect civilians as part _x000D_
of their mandate. This is not your mother's peacekeeping, your _x000D_
father's peacekeeping, your grandfather's peacekeeping. It has _x000D_
evolved significantly._x000D_
    While peacekeeping has never been more important to _x000D_
American interests, it has also never been more demanding. And _x000D_
that is why, in September, President Obama issued the first _x000D_
presidential memorandum on multilateral peace operations in _x000D_
more than 20 years, directing a wide range of actions to _x000D_
strengthen and modernize U.N. operations, including by building _x000D_
partner capacity, providing U.S. support, and leading reform of _x000D_
U.N. peacekeeping._x000D_
    I just want to briefly, Mr. Chairman, touch on a few key _x000D_
lines of effort that we have pursued. These are described in _x000D_
greater detail in my written submission._x000D_
    First, we are working to ensure that countries with the _x000D_
will to perform 21st century peacekeeping, that they have the _x000D_
capacity to do so. One way we are doing this is through the _x000D_
African Peacekeeping Rapid Response Partnership, or APRRP, _x000D_
which President Obama announced in August 2014._x000D_
    Through APRRP, the United States is investing in the _x000D_
capacity of six African countries that have proven themselves _x000D_
leaders in peacekeeping. In exchange, these countries have _x000D_
committed to maintain the forces and equipment necessary to _x000D_
deploy rapidly._x000D_
    This initiative builds upon the Global Peace Operations _x000D_
Initiative launched under President George W. Bush, which is _x000D_
our primary tool for building partner-nation peacekeeping _x000D_
capacity, and it will help ensure that more soldiers deployed _x000D_
for peacekeeping missions will be fully prepared._x000D_
    I hope that the Senate and House will fully fund this _x000D_
important initiative in future years._x000D_
    Second, we are expanding the pool of troop- and police-_x000D_
contributing countries, and bringing advanced militaries back _x000D_
into peacekeeping. In September, President Obama convened a _x000D_
historic high-level summit, the first of its kind, at the U.N. _x000D_
to rally new commitments to peacekeeping, marking the _x000D_
culmination of a yearlong effort initiated by Vice President _x000D_
Biden at the previous U.N. General Assembly. Forty-nine _x000D_
countries participated and pledged nearly 50,000 additional _x000D_
troops and police._x000D_
    Not only that, more of these troops will now come from _x000D_
advanced militaries, who bring with them equipment and _x000D_
expertise that is critically needed on the ground. We saw this _x000D_
in Mali in January this year, when Dutch attack helicopters _x000D_
helped Bangladeshi infantry repel rebels who had opened fire on _x000D_
their camp, where civilians were taking refuge._x000D_
    The United States is making contributions in this respect _x000D_
as well as one part of our unrivaled contribution to global _x000D_
peace and security, looking specifically for ways to leverage _x000D_
our military's unique capabilities to support peacekeeping _x000D_
operations, including by enabling faster deployment by others._x000D_
    Third, we are working to ensure a higher standard of _x000D_
performance and conduct once peacekeeping contingents are _x000D_
deployed, specifically in two critical areas: the complete _x000D_
fulfillment of their mandates and the combating of sexual _x000D_
exploitation and abuse._x000D_
    The additional troops generated by the President's _x000D_
September summit will prove invaluable to both goals, by _x000D_
allowing the U.N. to be more selective as to which troops it _x000D_
deploys, and now giving it the leverage to repatriate poorly _x000D_
performing troops and police when necessary, and especially, of _x000D_
course, in instances where there are credible allegations of _x000D_
sexual abuse._x000D_
    With respect to mandate, when peacekeepers deploy in _x000D_
volatile situations, they have to be prepared to use force to _x000D_
defend themselves, to protect civilians, and to otherwise carry _x000D_
out their mandated tasks._x000D_
    Too often in the past, peacekeepers have shied away, even _x000D_
when atrocities are being perpetrated. A report by the U.N.'s _x000D_
internal oversight office in March last year found that in 507 _x000D_
attacks against civilians from 2010 to 2013, peacekeepers _x000D_
virtually never used force to protect those coming under _x000D_
attack. Thousands of civilians likely lost their lives as a _x000D_
result. This cannot continue, and a growing number of leading _x000D_
troop contributors agree. The 50,000 additional troops and _x000D_
police should enable more capable, more willing troops and _x000D_
police to staff these missions._x000D_
    The same is true on sexual exploitation and violence. And _x000D_
let me just state the obvious here. We share the outrage of _x000D_
everyone on this committee, all the American people who are _x000D_
focused on this issue. Peacekeepers must not abuse civilians. _x000D_
Sexual abuse and exploitation have no place, it goes without _x000D_
saying, again, in any society. It is especially abhorrent when _x000D_
committed by those who take advantage of the trust that _x000D_
communities are placing in the United Nations, and those _x000D_
responsible must be held accountable._x000D_
    Addressing this scourge will require continuing the _x000D_
important efforts begun by Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to _x000D_
strengthen the implementation of a zero-tolerance policy, _x000D_
including bolstering reporting and accountability measures, and _x000D_
pledging to set up an immediate response team to investigate _x000D_
certain cases. It will also require more vigilance and follow-_x000D_
through from troop-contributing countries._x000D_
    There must also be far more transparency in these _x000D_
investigations, to track cases and ensure that justice is _x000D_
served._x000D_
    The U.N. should be able to take advantage now of its newly _x000D_
expanded pool of soldiers and police by suspending from _x000D_
peacekeeping any country that does not take seriously the _x000D_
responsibility to investigate and, if necessary, prosecute _x000D_
credible allegations._x000D_
    The fourth and final priority, Mr. Chairman, is to press _x000D_
for bold institutional reforms within the U.N. itself. We have _x000D_
seen the U.N. secretariat make profound changes to _x000D_
peacekeeping, from improved logistics and sustainment to a more _x000D_
comprehensive approach to crisis situations that integrates _x000D_
military, police, and civilian tools. But much, much more needs _x000D_
to be done, and we have spearheaded efforts to enact further _x000D_
reforms, including longer troop rotations to preserve _x000D_
institutional memory, penalties for troops who show up without _x000D_
the necessary equipment to perform their duties._x000D_
    And we will continue to work aggressively to cut costs. The _x000D_
U.N. has already, thanks to U.S. leadership, cut the per-_x000D_
peacekeeper costs by roughly 17 percent since 2008. We are also _x000D_
working to advance the reforms proposed by the Secretary _x000D_
General's High-Level Independent Panel on U.N. Peace _x000D_
Operations, which are intended to address inadequate planning, _x000D_
slow troop deployment, uneven mission leadership, breakdowns in _x000D_
command-and-control, and a current set of rules around human _x000D_
resources and procurement designed for the conference rooms of _x000D_
New York and not the streets of Bangui._x000D_
    Let me conclude. In all of the areas I have just described, _x000D_
we have seen improvements, and the United States has played an _x000D_
instrumental role in making them possible. But there is much _x000D_
more to be done._x000D_
    We are not satisfied with peacekeepers fulfilling only _x000D_
parts, but not all, of their mandates; with peacekeepers _x000D_
standing up to protect civilians in some, but not all, _x000D_
situations; or with soldiers being held accountable for crimes _x000D_
or misconduct some, but not all, of the time._x000D_
    The role played by peacekeepers today is too important. For _x000D_
the sake of our own interests and security, as well as the _x000D_
millions of innocent people around the world whose lives may _x000D_
depend on peacekeepers, we will continue working to strengthen _x000D_
peacekeeping so that it is tailored for the 21st century _x000D_
threats peacekeepers face._x000D_
    We appreciate your interest and support and continued _x000D_
dialogue on these matters. Thank you.",corker
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM,12/9/2015,"    Well, thank you very much for those comments._x000D_
    Senator Isakson and I were in Darfur years ago and just _x000D_
infuriated by the caveats that the U.N. peacekeepers had. They _x000D_
could only fire at people when they were fired upon. You had _x000D_
women going out and collecting wood from their villages being _x000D_
raped, abused, people being murdered by the Janjaweed. Yet _x000D_
those caveats remained._x000D_
    So we have evolved, as you mentioned. This is not our _x000D_
father's peacekeeping mission anymore._x000D_
    As we have evolved these missions, though, and people now _x000D_
are placing themselves as peacekeepers more in the center of _x000D_
conflicts, in some cases taking sides, how has this changed the _x000D_
way the U.N. is viewed in these peacekeeping missions? I assume _x000D_
you believe this is in our national interests for us to be in _x000D_
these missions certainly, I do. But how has this changed the _x000D_
way these blue hats are viewed in these areas?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Thank you, Senator Corker. It is an _x000D_
excellent question._x000D_
    I think one of the lines that the U.N. struggles to walk is _x000D_
that it has, on the one hand, peacekeepers that are charged _x000D_
with an aggressive enforcement of mandates, which entail _x000D_
protecting civilians, not just protecting peacekeepers _x000D_
themselves, as was once the case. You have that on one hand. _x000D_
Then you have U.N. country programs that often look _x000D_
indistinguishable. They are all driving around in white _x000D_
vehicles, unarmed, passing out food, providing shelter, trying _x000D_
to provide counseling to those who have been victimized by _x000D_
sexual abuse._x000D_
    So it has been challenging, the blurring of functions _x000D_
across these missions. But the only thing worse than _x000D_
confronting that challenge of having people in society _x000D_
distinguish who does what, is actually people in these _x000D_
societies rely on peacekeepers, know that the mandate says _x000D_
protect civilians, and have those peacekeepers bunkered and _x000D_
more interested, again, in collecting a paycheck and then going _x000D_
home than actually being out and about and delivering on the _x000D_
promise of that blue flag._x000D_
    So, again, it varies per conflict area. I think we have _x000D_
come a long way. But as I noted, the statistics are not _x000D_
inspiring. I mean, there are still many troop-contributing _x000D_
countries who send their troops in without the very strict _x000D_
guidance that you will be sent home if you do not enforce the _x000D_
mandate you are given.",corker
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM,12/9/2015,"    Yes. I appreciate the comment Senator Cardin _x000D_
made about the cost. But, as I understand it, for some of these _x000D_
countries, even though the cost to us is far less than having _x000D_
U.S. soldiers there, the pay for these soldiers is far greater _x000D_
than they would otherwise receive in their own countries. And, _x000D_
actually, if I understand correctly, that money goes to the _x000D_
national governments of those countries. And so these countries _x000D_
are benefiting financially in sending troops there._x000D_
    Is that correct, in some cases, in some of the lower income _x000D_
countries? And is that feeding this situation of actually _x000D_
having troops there that are not, if you will, carrying out _x000D_
their mandates in an appropriate way, with soldiers not _x000D_
qualified or trained and not properly equipped? Talk to us a _x000D_
little bit about what is driving having folks within the _x000D_
peacekeeping missions that are that are certainly not _x000D_
conducting themselves in a professional manner._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, again. It _x000D_
reflects a real understanding of the dynamics in some of these _x000D_
missions._x000D_
    Again, the performance is uneven. The motivation is uneven. _x000D_
The incentive for troops is uneven. If you take, for instance, _x000D_
Rwandan peacekeepers, who do get a more substantial stipend by _x000D_
serving in peacekeeping missions than they might if they were _x000D_
at home, but they are totally driven by what happened in their _x000D_
country 21 years ago and actually view protecting civilians as _x000D_
a way of showing the world what should have been done when the _x000D_
genocide unfolded in Rwanda._x000D_
    Contrast that with other troops, again, who institutionally _x000D_
are not given the guidance from capital that they need to be _x000D_
out and about, that, yes, there are risks entailed with _x000D_
patrolling, but there are risks also that are entailed by being _x000D_
bunkered._x000D_
    I think on the question, the very specific question of the _x000D_
stipend, as Senator Cardin said, this is a very good deal for _x000D_
the American taxpayer. These are extremely difficult _x000D_
environments, not only because of the risks of militia and _x000D_
government forces targeting peacekeepers as they are out and _x000D_
about, but also just the conditions in terms of logistics, _x000D_
access to water. I mean, these are missions that are not _x000D_
expending resources in the manner that our missions do when _x000D_
they deploy internationally. The logistic tail is not nearly as _x000D_
fulsome._x000D_
    So I think it is important to incentivize their _x000D_
participation. Some countries are doing it because they are _x000D_
able, again, to secure additional resources that they are _x000D_
investing in ways that sometimes we do not have full visibility _x000D_
into, sometimes in professionalizing their militaries, _x000D_
sometimes in other parts of their government._x000D_
    But I think Senator Cardin's point is very, very important. _x000D_
We are getting a lot out of the 100,000-plus troops who are _x000D_
active in these conflict areas. These are places where, in some _x000D_
instances, if you look at Mali or Lebanon, places that are _x000D_
really cutting-edge theaters in terms of terrorism and _x000D_
extremism, and if it weren't for U.N. peacekeepers who were _x000D_
there putting their lives at risk, it may come to the United _x000D_
States at some point in order for us to advance our security.",corker
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM,12/9/2015,"    As it relates to the issues of the abuse that _x000D_
has taken place that is, obviously, abhorrent, in fairness, I _x000D_
think people on both sides of the aisle have concerns about the _x000D_
U.N.'s ability to actually put reforms in place. And we _x000D_
understand how the U.N. operates, and I know you talked about _x000D_
the leader's desire to create reforms. We sent a letter _x000D_
suggesting that we have onsite court marshals by the countries _x000D_
to handle peacekeeping soldiers accused of crimes be tried, by _x000D_
the way, under their own country military preocedures to reduce _x000D_
impunity. We also made some other suggestions._x000D_
    What is your sense that those types of reforms can be _x000D_
implemented, relative to peacekeeping?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Well, as Ambassador Negroponte behind me _x000D_
I think will attest, through the life of the U.N. you have a _x000D_
challenge, always, on reform, in the sense that there are two _x000D_
places you have to secure--will and follow-through._x000D_
    The first is with the countries that comprise the U.N. So _x000D_
every troop-contributing country to peacekeeping has to be _x000D_
prepared to look at the kinds of ideas that you put in your _x000D_
letter that we have been pushing in new York and implement in _x000D_
their own military changes to ensure follow-though, oversight _x000D_
in the first instance, follow-through on investigation, and _x000D_
accountability, whether a court martial or some kind of _x000D_
prosecution in civilian court._x000D_
    And again, there is probably no one-size-fits-all solution, _x000D_
because every country has its own set of procedures, again, for _x000D_
following up on abuse of any kind._x000D_
    Then there is the U.N. itself, which has to be much _x000D_
aggressive in shining a spotlight on those countries that are _x000D_
not taking the steps that are needed._x000D_
    I think that we have seen improvements. This is, again, not _x000D_
something one should cite as an improvement. It should never _x000D_
have been the case that it was otherwise. But those individuals _x000D_
who were alleged to be involved in sexual abuse now are not _x000D_
being paid by the U.N. They are being recalled to their _x000D_
capital. Training and vetting now is changing, so that there is _x000D_
training on preventing sexual abuse and exploitation._x000D_
    You had an idea, I believe, in your letter about a claims _x000D_
kind of commission. I think the U.N. is looking at creating a _x000D_
victim support trust fund, which is something, of course, we _x000D_
would wish to support as well. It is going to require going _x000D_
back to member states and getting resources to put into that, _x000D_
but maybe some of the docked pay of those against whom there _x000D_
are allegations could be used in service of such a fund. And _x000D_
then I think having more aggressive onsite investigative _x000D_
capacity, so that less time passes between an allegation and an _x000D_
actual follow-through._x000D_
    Lastly, the two aspects of reform come together. In order _x000D_
to secure meaningful reform that actually matters for potential _x000D_
victims or people who have already been victimized, there has _x000D_
to be more transparency between what is actually going on in _x000D_
the field and then what we are made aware of in New York._x000D_
    Too often, we hear from NGOs or from journalists about _x000D_
sexual abuse and exploitation, rather than from the U.N. _x000D_
itself. And if we are to go to a developing country and try to _x000D_
enhance their capacity, their training on the front end, their _x000D_
capacity to investigate on the backend of an allegation, we _x000D_
have to know who has been accused of doing what at what period, _x000D_
and be in a position to offer support._x000D_
    If there are countries who are shirking their obligation to _x000D_
carry out investigations, we have to know so that we can look _x000D_
at our bilateral leverage and whether we might suspend some _x000D_
forms of assistance, if, in fact, there is a recurrent pattern _x000D_
of not actually taking seriously the zero-tolerance policy.",corker
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM,12/9/2015,"    Well, thank you. My time is up. And as a _x000D_
courtesy, I want to move on._x000D_
    I do hope through questioning at some point and--I know the _x000D_
President has made additional pledges to the U.N. beyond our _x000D_
normal peacekeeping budgeting. I hope at some point it will _x000D_
come to light as to where those resources are planned to come _x000D_
from. But thank you again for being here._x000D_
    Senator Cardin?",corker
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM,12/9/2015,"    Before turning to Senator Perdue, I just want _x000D_
to thank the ranking member for bringing up an issue that is _x000D_
brought up consistently, certainly, on our side of the aisle. I _x000D_
want to thank him for that._x000D_
    I do want to just emphasize that with NATO, which I know is _x000D_
not in your jurisdiction, we have become the provider of _x000D_
security services. Our NATO allies, generally speaking, are the _x000D_
consumer of security services._x000D_
    And the same thing is happening with peacekeeping at the _x000D_
U.N. I know it is a different set of actors._x000D_
    But the very people that stymie our efforts to pursue our _x000D_
interests--China, for instance--are taking advantage of us with _x000D_
respect to sharing the peacekeeping costs. So yes, it is in our _x000D_
U.S. national interests that we have peacekeeping missions and _x000D_
that we have stability and security around the world. But I _x000D_
think we continue to be not as good as we should be at forcing _x000D_
other nations to also be responsible._x000D_
    So I want to thank Senator Cardin for bringing this _x000D_
important issue up. It is infuriating--infuriating--to have the _x000D_
lack of transparency that exists at the U.N. I think, over _x000D_
time, it will erode support. Such support is already not _x000D_
particularly high because of the many issues we see going _x000D_
unattended, like not dealing with the ballistic missiles that _x000D_
are being fired by Iran in violation of UNSCR 1929._x000D_
    So I would just say, I am glad there is bipartisan concern. _x000D_
I hope that you can address it._x000D_
    With that, Senator Perdue.",corker
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM,12/9/2015,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Senator Cardin and I both emphasized with the Security _x000D_
Council 2 days ago that, look, let us face it. The possible _x000D_
military dimensions piece, we thought they might get a D-. They _x000D_
got an F. A total hoax. A total hoax._x000D_
    Non-action here is just going to empower them to continue _x000D_
to violate. And I think what the Ambassador just said is the _x000D_
U.N. is going to do nothing--nothing--because China and Russia _x000D_
will block that from occurring._x000D_
    So I do hope they are preparing their bilateral efforts._x000D_
    It is disappointing that, again, we provide the resources _x000D_
that we do, and yet we have countries that will not cause other _x000D_
countries to live up to their obligations and block that. So it _x000D_
is very disappointing._x000D_

    Senator Gardner?",corker
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM,12/9/2015,"    Before going on to Senator Kaine, I just want _x000D_
to reiterate, I think what Ben and I did the other day with you _x000D_
and the other members. I think regardless of how people may _x000D_
have voted on the Iran agreement, we understand that it is what _x000D_
is governing our actions right now with Iran. And I think on _x000D_
both sides of the aisle, regardless of how people voted, we _x000D_
want to make sure the agreement is implemented in the way that _x000D_
it was laid out._x000D_
    And I think there has been a concern on both sides of the _x000D_
aisle that there is an air of permissiveness that is developing _x000D_
that will cause the likelihood of any pushback on Iranian _x000D_
violations over time to become less real. And I think that is _x000D_
what he's getting at and I think what people on both sides of _x000D_
aisle have been concerned about._x000D_
    U.N. Security Council Resolution 1929 says they shall not _x000D_
undertake any ballistic activity. Unfortunately, JPOA says ``is _x000D_
called upon.'' I do not know whether Iran views that as _x000D_
permissive language._x000D_
    But this is an issue that I think many people on both sides _x000D_
of the aisle are concerned about. I cannot speak for everyone._x000D_

being taken, and it is setting a precedent for the future._x000D_

UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM,12/9/2015,"    But----_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. We have brought the issue to the _x000D_
Council. This is what we did----",corker
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM,12/9/2015,"    But I am talking about as far as sanctions, _x000D_
penalties._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. I would not assess that----",corker
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM,12/9/2015,"    It is not likely that Russia or China will go _x000D_
along with----_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. I share your assessment on Russia and _x000D_
China.",corker
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM,12/9/2015,"    Okay, so let me just say this._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Yes.",corker
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM,12/9/2015,"    When you say that it is untrue what I said, _x000D_
relative to----_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. That the administration was being more _x000D_
permissive in terms of sanctions violations. That was what I _x000D_
heard you say.",corker
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM,12/9/2015,"    Well, we will see. Nothing has happened yet._x000D_
    What I said was that the leverage shifts to Iran. They are _x000D_
at breakneck speed dismantling so that they get the sanctions _x000D_
relief they are after, which we would expect. Now people _x000D_
believe that in January or February, they will get all of the _x000D_
sanctions relief they are after._x000D_
    And for you to say that snapback is a real tool when it is _x000D_
contingent upon the countries that are participating _x000D_
implementing back those sanctions, and we have countries like _x000D_
Russia and China, which probably, likely, we know, are not _x000D_
going to push back against this issue._x000D_
    If there are incremental violations, all of the leverage is _x000D_
with Iran. That is a fact. It is not incorrect. It is with Iran _x000D_
because there is no way that this administration is going to _x000D_
consider challenging an incremental violation because they know _x000D_
all Iran has to do is step out. And they know that Russia and _x000D_
China and, candidly, probably our Western friends in Europe are _x000D_
not really going to force them to comply._x000D_
    So it is a true statement, not an untrue statement, that _x000D_
the leverage ends up with Iran because they have what they _x000D_
want. We have given it up, and we have partners at the U.N. _x000D_
Security Council that are not going to cooperate with us._x000D_
    Senator Markey?",corker
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM,12/9/2015,"    No, I understand that. I understand they are _x000D_
dismantling antique centrifuges, and we are allowing them to _x000D_
continue development of IR-2s, IR-4s, IR-6s, IR-8s. I _x000D_
understand that._x000D_
    And look, again, I do not want to re-debate the agreement. _x000D_
What I think we are focused on right now is that the _x000D_
international community knows that they violated UNSCR 1929, _x000D_
and in essence, they are violating the spirit of JPOA, where _x000D_
they are called upon not to do this. And we all know that the _x000D_
U.N. Security Council is not going to take action._x000D_
    That is what is important to us, because we believe that _x000D_
after they get the sanctions relief, after they dismantle these _x000D_
antiques that they are using right now, these IR-1s, that they _x000D_
are going to push the envelope._x000D_
    And we believe that you and others there, by not taking _x000D_
even bilateral action yet, are helping create an air of _x000D_
permissiveness._x000D_
    Even though we like you and respect you, we have a policy _x000D_
difference here. This is not directed at you. It is directed at _x000D_
the U.N. Security Council._x000D_
    Senator Markey?",corker
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM,12/9/2015,"    Well, thank you for being with us. I think _x000D_
you can see that that we are getting close to the end here._x000D_
    I do want to chase just for a moment, if I could, the _x000D_
conversation you had with Senator Kaine._x000D_
    Do your colleagues at the United Nations think that somehow _x000D_
Congress and the American people do not want to defeat ISIS?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. I do not think they would have that _x000D_
impression. My response was that they are puzzled as to why we _x000D_
cannot come up with an authorization here together----",corker
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM,12/9/2015,"    And are they puzzled by the fact that the _x000D_
administration has told us over and over and over again here at _x000D_
this committee--Secretary Kerry, Secretary Carter, the White _x000D_
House sending over notes--that they have all the authorities _x000D_
they need to continue the fight against terrorism that was _x000D_
authorized in 2001? Is that confusing to them?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. I think, again, I was not speaking----",corker
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM,12/9/2015,"    That is your----_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. If I may, I was not speaking to the _x000D_
legal authorities question. I do not think anybody questions _x000D_
whether or not the United States has the authority to carry out _x000D_
the campaign that we are carrying out._x000D_
    I think the question is, as a political symbol and as _x000D_
reinforcement of the effort that we are making, that there _x000D_
should be an ability to get consensus here.",corker
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM,12/9/2015,"    Well, there is consensus. I mean, the _x000D_
President has the authority----_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. I am sorry. My response was on an AUMF, _x000D_
consensus on an AUMF.",corker
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM,12/9/2015,"    It is a little game that is being played. It _x000D_
is difficult for me to understand. I mean, on one hand, witness _x000D_
after witness after witness comes up here and tells us they _x000D_
have all the authorities they need. And then people like you _x000D_
and others come up and talk about how it would be nice._x000D_
    I guess I do not get it. I voted for an authorization in _x000D_
2013. I helped craft it to go against Assad. And we turned away _x000D_
from that._x000D_
    So certainly, this committee is willing to take up tough _x000D_
issues when a declaration of war is occurring._x000D_
    And has the President declared war on ISIS? Has he declared _x000D_
war on ISIS? Has he laid out a strategy publicly to defeat _x000D_
ISIS?_x000D_
    So I just want to say, I am sorry this cutesy thing that _x000D_
has been occurring recently, especially over the last 2 weeks. _x000D_
I am having difficulty understanding when I agree with the _x000D_
administration. They have every authority that they need to _x000D_
defeat and destroy ISIS._x000D_
    So I do not know what is up. Maybe the President is _x000D_
receiving criticism, and he is trying to deflect that to _x000D_
Congress somehow. I do not know what is occurring._x000D_
    But all I can say with you, I am in full agreement with the _x000D_
administration that the 2001 authorization, while certainly on _x000D_
the edges, gives them the authority to do everything they could _x000D_
possibly want to do to destroy ISIS. And I believe that _x000D_
everyone in the world, everyone in the world, understands that _x000D_
Congress wants to see that happen._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Let me be clear. The President has _x000D_
himself, as you know, made clear that he has the authority to _x000D_
prosecute this campaign effectively. I was responding to _x000D_
Senator Kaine's comment that a number of the other countries in _x000D_
the coalition have gone through a domestic legislative process _x000D_
of----",corker
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM,12/9/2015,"    They did not have the authorities to do what _x000D_
they were doing. They did not have the authorities. Is that _x000D_
correct?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. I would have to go case by case, and I _x000D_
am not familiar with the domestic legal machinations in these _x000D_
countries.",corker
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM,12/9/2015,"    Well, certainly, Great Britain's or U.K.'s _x000D_
unwillingness----_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Yes, I think in parliamentary systems, _x000D_
they need to go through the exercise that they have gone _x000D_
through._x000D_
    I think this is a reason though that the question is a _x000D_
little bit more in the air than it has been over the last 6 _x000D_
months up in New York.",corker
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM,12/9/2015,"    I think it is in the air for----_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. But the President has said he has the _x000D_
authorities he needs. There is no resurrecting or surfacing _x000D_
this issue for any other reason.",corker
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM,12/9/2015,"    So you agree 100 percent that the President _x000D_
has the authority._x000D_
     Ambassador Power. Absolutely.",corker
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM,12/9/2015,"    Has the President declared war on ISIS, by _x000D_
the way?_x000D_
     Ambassador Power. I believe he has said we are going to _x000D_
defeat and destroy ISIS, ISIL.",corker
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM,12/9/2015,"    Look, we thank you for being here today and _x000D_
certainly respect the job that you have. You are very bright _x000D_
and intelligent. Sometimes I take issue with you when I feel _x000D_
like you are carrying too much the administration's line. But I _x000D_
understand sometimes you feel compelled to do so._x000D_
    I thank you for being here, and we wish you well as you _x000D_
take demonstrative action against UNSCR 1929 being violated _x000D_
over the next week or so. Thank you._x000D_
    So our next panel will consist of two more outstanding _x000D_
witnesses. The first witness is the Honorable John Negroponte, _x000D_
vice chairman of McLarty and Associates and former United _x000D_
States Permanent Representative to the U.S. Mission to the _x000D_
United Nations, the same job our former witness is occupying._x000D_
    Our second witness will be Dr. Bruce Jones, vice president _x000D_
of the Foreign Policy Program at the Brookings Institute._x000D_
    Again, we thank Ambassador Power for being here. Both of _x000D_
you have witnessed what just happened. We hope you can _x000D_
summarize your thoughts in about 5 minutes. And we look forward _x000D_
to questions._x000D_
    Again, thank you for being here._x000D_
    John, why don't you start?_x000D_
_x000D_
   STATEMENT OF HON.",corker
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM,12/9/2015,"    Thank you so much._x000D_
    Dr. Jones?_x000D_
_x000D_
  STATEMENT OF DR.",corker
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM,12/9/2015,"    Well, thank you both. I know we got off on a _x000D_
lot of different topics in the last panel that were a little _x000D_
different than the main subject, but it is rare we have the _x000D_
opportunity to talk to the Ambassador._x000D_
    We thank you both. We know you are both friends. And _x000D_
obviously, with just Ben and I here, even though this will all _x000D_
be part of the record, which is appreciated, this is more of a _x000D_
conversation._x000D_
    You both have experienced the frustration of seeing _x000D_
peacekeeping operations where people were being abused and _x000D_
brutalized, and yet the caveats that existed kept peacekeepers _x000D_
from really being able to intervene. So we have moved in a more _x000D_
forward manner, which from my standpoint is welcomed as we have _x000D_
seen helpless people be brutalized in certain areas._x000D_
    What are, though, some of the challenges that, from your _x000D_
perspective, we most need to think about relative to that? I _x000D_
mean, in essence, it is an extension in some cases of actually _x000D_
carrying out semi-kinetic activities, right? So what are some _x000D_
of the things that we as a body ought to be thinking about as _x000D_
we progress down that path?",corker
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM,12/9/2015,"    Dr. Jones, you mentioned that you do not _x000D_
think it is appropriate for the U.S. to have ground troops, if _x000D_
you will, involved. As it relates to our NATO efforts, we _x000D_
obviously have everything involved, money, equipment, _x000D_
personnel. Again, we are the provider of security services. _x000D_
Unfortunately, most of the members of NATO are consumers of _x000D_
security services._x000D_
    Here, we are the largest provider of monetary resources, _x000D_
and, as I understand it, we have committed 42 officers to be _x000D_
part of peacekeeping._x000D_
    But just for the record, could you tease out why it is you _x000D_
said what you just said? You say we should not be involved with _x000D_
ground troops because?",corker
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM,12/9/2015,"    It is generally the same approach, as has _x000D_
been discussed by most, and that is in Syria we would like to _x000D_
have Arab faces on the ground more predominantly than Western _x000D_
faces, right? It just helps ensure that there is a more _x000D_
cohesive nature, if you will, relative to what is happening on _x000D_
the ground._x000D_
    Typically, we have had a policy, have we not, that U.S. _x000D_
troops are not going to be commanded by people other than U.S. _x000D_
officers, too? Is that correct?",corker
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM,12/9/2015,"    Ambassador, you have had this role. You have _x000D_
been at the United Nations. Senator Cardin, which I appreciate _x000D_
deeply, raised the issue of just our payments. We have 22 _x000D_
percent of the world's gross domestic product and yet we _x000D_
contribute 28.5 percent of the budget here._x000D_
    Our other ``associates,'' if you will, at the United _x000D_
Nations obviously are not doing their part, otherwise our _x000D_
amount would not be 28.5 percent._x000D_
    We find this same to be the case--I have referred to it now _x000D_
three times--at NATO. It is where we desire for things to _x000D_
happen, it seems more so than others, and, therefore, we end up _x000D_
being financially exposed more than others._x000D_
    You have been in this role. Tell us from your perspective _x000D_
what we as a country can do to seek equilibrium and to cause _x000D_
other countries to play their appropriate roles.",corker
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM,12/9/2015,    Senator Cardin?,corker
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM,12/9/2015,"    Thank you._x000D_
    One of the great privileges that we have around here is the _x000D_
access to people like you who are so respected and have the _x000D_
ability to share wisdom with us and experiences. We know that _x000D_
every day when we come to work, so we want to thank you for _x000D_
your continued involvement in issues of importance to our _x000D_
country. Thank you for being here today._x000D_
    As you will see, a lot of our members make themselves _x000D_
present by asking questions later. So without objection, first _x000D_
of all, the record will be open until the close of business _x000D_
Friday. But if you could respond in a fairly timely manner, _x000D_
that would also be appreciated.",corker
UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM,12/9/2015,"    We thank you for your service to our country, _x000D_
and we thank you for being here today._x000D_
    And with that, the meeting is adjourned.",corker
THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS: BUILDING THE COALITION AND ENSURING MILITARY EFFECTIVENESS,2/25/2015,"    I call this meeting of the Foreign Relations _x000D_
Committee to order, and I want to thank General Allen for being _x000D_
here. I know he has a hard stop today at 3:30, and that he has _x000D_
meetings with CENTCOM later that he is traveling to. But I want _x000D_
to thank him for being here, and I will properly introduce him _x000D_
in just a moment._x000D_
    The President has sent forward a request for the _x000D_
authorization for the use of military force. Because of the _x000D_
nature and the way that this happened in that the conflict has _x000D_
been ongoing for about 6 months now, I think one of the things _x000D_
that most people here are concerned about is that there is a _x000D_
level of confidence in what we are doing, and that it is going _x000D_
to achieve the stated goals that the President has laid out. _x000D_
And I do not know of anybody more equipped to come before us _x000D_
today than General Allen, who has served our country with great _x000D_
distinction._x000D_
    I think many people feel decently well about what is _x000D_
happening in Iraq. I think there are a lot of questions _x000D_
relative to Syria. My sense is today you will have a number of _x000D_
questions regarding that. And we hope that what you will do, _x000D_
General Allen, is give us an honest assessment as to the end _x000D_
state that we would like to see happen in Iraq and Syria when _x000D_
we complete the activities that we are involved in, and _x000D_
understand the political and military strategy that we have _x000D_
underway, and to give us a little sense of timeframe relative _x000D_
to the various activities that are necessary._x000D_
    I was just in Iraq last week in both Baghdad and Erbil with _x000D_
our Kurdish friends, and then over in Ankara with our Turkish _x000D_
friends, and I will say that the Shia militias are everywhere _x000D_
in Iraq, as people know. General Suleimani, who is head of the _x000D_
Quds Force for Iran, has now become a celebrity in Iraq. And I _x000D_
have to say it feels very strange to be there knowing that much _x000D_
of the activity that we have underway, while it is necessary, _x000D_
is really to Iran's benefit. And I know there are a lot of _x000D_
concerns that after this activity is completed if we are _x000D_
successful with ISIS, which I know we will be, in essence, the _x000D_
next issue is going to be dealing with security of forces there _x000D_
with the Shia militias._x000D_
    I was happy to see that Turkey has gone ahead and signed an _x000D_
agreement, train and equip agreement. I am sure that is _x000D_
something that you have made happen, and thank you for that. At _x000D_
the same time, I know there are a lot of concerns right now _x000D_
about how we deal with Assad's barrel bombs as we train and _x000D_
equip these individuals. How do we protect them from the barrel _x000D_
bombs, which cause them to diminish in a greater number than _x000D_
they can be trained? And I am sure that you are going to talk _x000D_
about that._x000D_
    There is a lot of discussion, as you know, on the ground _x000D_
there about an air exclusion zone--I know you will have some _x000D_
questions about that--and just no-fly discussions. It may be _x000D_
taking place to draw Turkey more into what is happening in _x000D_
Syria itself, which I think most of it--most of us believe is _x000D_
very important._x000D_
    So as we--as I close, I just want to say we owe it to our _x000D_
nation as we consider this to know that the full range of _x000D_
America's elements of national power, diplomatic, economic, and _x000D_
military means are aligned in such a way to get to the _x000D_
administration's stated goals. Because of the nature of this _x000D_
decision, one, again, this being made after the fact, all of us _x000D_
need to have confidence that the administration is truly _x000D_
committed to achieving the stated goals that they have laid _x000D_
out. And I think your testimony here is going to be very _x000D_
valuable to us._x000D_
    And with that, I would like to turn to our distinguished _x000D_
ranking member, Senator Menendez, who has been a great partner _x000D_
on all of these issues.",corker
THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS: BUILDING THE COALITION AND ENSURING MILITARY EFFECTIVENESS,2/25/2015,"    Our distinguished witness today is Gen. John _x000D_
Allen, the Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition _x000D_
to Counter ISIS. General Allen is a retired U.S. Marine four-_x000D_
star general, former commander of ISAF and U.S. forces in _x000D_
Afghanistan. Upon his retirement from the Marine Corps, he was _x000D_
appointed as the senior advisor to the Secretary of Defense on _x000D_

    We thank you for your frankness. We thank you for your _x000D_
service to our country. We thank you for being here today. I _x000D_
know you are going to have an unusually long opening comment, _x000D_
which we appreciate, and then we will turn to questions._x000D_

       STATEMENT OF GEN. JOHN R. ALLEN, USMC (RETIRED), _x000D_
           SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL ENVOY FOR THE GLOBAL _x000D_
     COALITION TO COUNTER ISIL, U.",corker
THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS: BUILDING THE COALITION AND ENSURING MILITARY EFFECTIVENESS,2/25/2015,"    We thank you for the testimony and for your _x000D_
great service to our country._x000D_
    Yesterday Senator Kerry testified that he felt like that _x000D_
today the administration already has, because of the 2001 AUMF _x000D_
and the 2002 AUMF, the authority to conduct the operations that _x000D_
are being conducted in Iraq and Syria. Do you agree with that _x000D_
assessment?",corker
THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS: BUILDING THE COALITION AND ENSURING MILITARY EFFECTIVENESS,2/25/2015,"    Okay. So it is an interesting place that we _x000D_
find ourselves where 6 months after conflicts have begun, a new _x000D_
AUMF is being offered. And I know that in order to pursue one _x000D_
properly through Congress, it is standard process to submit _x000D_
one, which I appreciate. But it is an interesting place that _x000D_
those authorities already exist._x000D_
    The train and equip program that you have been able to _x000D_
negotiate, many concerns have been raised about the fact that _x000D_
most of the free Syrian opposition initially was targeting _x000D_
Assad. That was the reason for their being. Now we are _x000D_
organizing these against ISIS, and my understanding is we are _x000D_
going against an entirely different recruitment group to do _x000D_
that. Are we finding that to be an easy recruitment process?",corker
THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS: BUILDING THE COALITION AND ENSURING MILITARY EFFECTIVENESS,2/25/2015,"    So my sense is there are, based on my _x000D_
experiences last week, there are larger groups of people that _x000D_
are willing to go against ISIS initially in this train and _x000D_
equip than some initially thought. Is that correct?",corker
THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS: BUILDING THE COALITION AND ENSURING MILITARY EFFECTIVENESS,2/25/2015,"    So let me ask you this question. One of the _x000D_
big moral dilemmas I think is that as we train and equip these _x000D_
folks, we know that Assad is, in fact, barrel bombing other _x000D_
members of the Free Syrian Army today. I know that is a loose _x000D_
description of who it is that is opposing him. But my _x000D_
understanding is there have been significant discussions with _x000D_
Turkey over an air exclusion zone in the northwestern Aleppo _x000D_
area and a no-fly zone along the border. And that has been the _x000D_
issue that has hindered them actually getting more involved in _x000D_
the conflict even though they are working with us more fully _x000D_
than they have in multiple areas, some of which I will not _x000D_
mention here. That has been the issue that has kept them from _x000D_
actually getting more involved._x000D_
    It is also my understanding that that decision, the _x000D_
decision to do that, is at the President's desk. It is at the _x000D_
White House, and he has not made a decision yet as to whether _x000D_
to engage. Can you update us on that or tell us the effect of _x000D_
that decision not being made on Turkey getting more involved in _x000D_
the conflict, and helping us with those ground operations you _x000D_
were talking about earlier?",corker
THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS: BUILDING THE COALITION AND ENSURING MILITARY EFFECTIVENESS,2/25/2015,"    But it is fair to say that there are some _x000D_
significant decisions that our government needs to make _x000D_
relative to those protections. And if they are made, could _x000D_
break a little bit of a logjam relative to greater involvement _x000D_
by Turkey. That would be a fair assessment. Is that correct?",corker
THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS: BUILDING THE COALITION AND ENSURING MILITARY EFFECTIVENESS,2/25/2015,    That is right.,corker
THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS: BUILDING THE COALITION AND ENSURING MILITARY EFFECTIVENESS,2/25/2015,"    And one final question, and then I will stop _x000D_
and turn it over to Senator Menendez. In the event that we _x000D_
needed to protect those that we are training and equipping and _x000D_
other members of the Free Syrian Army, in the event we needed _x000D_
to protect them against Assad barrel bombing them, do you _x000D_
believe that is something that needs an additional authority _x000D_
other than what is now being requested?",corker
THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS: BUILDING THE COALITION AND ENSURING MILITARY EFFECTIVENESS,2/25/2015,"    You would want to make sure that we knew that _x000D_
that type of authorization was a part of anything we may do.",corker

a followup.",corker
THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS: BUILDING THE COALITION AND ENSURING MILITARY EFFECTIVENESS,2/25/2015,"    And that would be in the form of some type of _x000D_
no-fly zone----",corker
THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS: BUILDING THE COALITION AND ENSURING MILITARY EFFECTIVENESS,2/25/2015,"    Very good. Well, General, I know you have got _x000D_
a hard stop in 20 minutes, and I think we have--you have _x000D_
certainly helped us in the way that we wanted you to help us. _x000D_
We appreciate your testimony._x000D_
    I would have one question, and that is you, in response to _x000D_
Senator Flake, talked about the need for Congress to be behind _x000D_
the effort that is taking place with ISIL. There have been _x000D_
differing discussions about the length of time from an AUMF _x000D_
standpoint. And is there anything about the timeframe--I know _x000D_
the President has asked for three--whether it is longer, _x000D_
shorter? Is there anything about that that you think matters at _x000D_
all relative to those that you are talking about appealing to _x000D_
our enemies and allies together?",corker
THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS: BUILDING THE COALITION AND ENSURING MILITARY EFFECTIVENESS,2/25/2015,"    And if it was shorter than that, it would _x000D_
trouble you either.",corker
THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS: BUILDING THE COALITION AND ENSURING MILITARY EFFECTIVENESS,2/25/2015,"    No, no, no, it would not trouble us either. _x000D_
Thank you. Does the length of time really particularly matter _x000D_
to you from the standpoint of the allies and those that we are _x000D_
defeating, or is it just more Congress getting behind the _x000D_
effort in a bipartisan way?",corker
THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS: BUILDING THE COALITION AND ENSURING MILITARY EFFECTIVENESS,2/25/2015,"    Yes. Well, listen, I called you over the _x000D_
weekend when I knew you were on your way to Kuwait. I know you _x000D_
are your way to CENTCOM now. I think you can tell by the _x000D_
respect that everyone has shown you today we all view you as _x000D_
someone who is an outstanding public servant. We appreciate the _x000D_
way you have gone about your work._x000D_
    I know it is difficult. I know that decisions do not always _x000D_
get made in the manner or in the timeframe that someone like _x000D_
you that wants to seek this--get this done in the appropriate _x000D_
way. But I think your demeanor, the way you talk with all of us _x000D_
is certainly very, very well received. We wish you well in what _x000D_
you are doing, and hope you will be before us again soon to _x000D_
update us.",corker
THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS: BUILDING THE COALITION AND ENSURING MILITARY EFFECTIVENESS,2/25/2015,    Thank you.,corker
THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS: BUILDING THE COALITION AND ENSURING MILITARY EFFECTIVENESS,2/25/2015,    Thank you.,corker
THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS: BUILDING THE COALITION AND ENSURING MILITARY EFFECTIVENESS,2/25/2015,"    And with that, the record will be open until _x000D_
Friday for any questions.",corker
THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS: BUILDING THE COALITION AND ENSURING MILITARY EFFECTIVENESS,2/25/2015,"    We would ask that you and your staff respond _x000D_
to those in a fairly timely fashion._x000D_
    And the meeting is adjourned.",corker
ENDING MODERN SLAVERY: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD?,2/4/2015,"    The Foreign Relations Committee will now come _x000D_
to order. We have convened this hearing to examine modern _x000D_
slavery and what is being done about it. We recognize that the _x000D_
United States Congress and our executive agencies have worked _x000D_
hard to draw attention to and address modern slavery, but I _x000D_
believe we have come to a point where we can do more. We need _x000D_
to take these efforts to the next level._x000D_
    I think most Americans would be stunned to know that _x000D_
slavery still exists in this world. Let me pause to state that _x000D_
again. It is difficult to imagine that in this modern day, more _x000D_
than 27 million around the world are forced to live as slaves. _x000D_
At this hearing, in addition to our expert witnesses, we will _x000D_
hear from two individuals who suffered and ultimately escaped _x000D_
this experience, and went on to help others. And we thank them _x000D_
for being with us today._x000D_
    Modern forms of slavery thrive where the rule of law is _x000D_
weakest. Corruption, crime, and cultural attitudes contribute _x000D_
to a climate of low risk and impunity for those who profit from _x000D_
modern slavery. In many instances, modern slavery is a crime of _x000D_
opportunity for perpetrators. It is often practiced quite _x000D_
openly, for example, in brick or rug manufacturing or in bars _x000D_
or brothels._x000D_
    Under U.S. law, such conditions are defined as the most _x000D_
severe forms of trafficking in persons, including forced sexual _x000D_
servitude of minors and adults and persons in bonded and other _x000D_
forced labor conditions. Women, children, and men alike are _x000D_
subjected to involuntary labor or sexual exploitation. _x000D_
According to a leading nongovernmental organization, forced _x000D_
labor accounts for 74 percent of victims, and forced sexual _x000D_
servitude accounts for 26 percent of victims. Women and girls _x000D_
are especially vulnerable, accounting for 54 percent of _x000D_
victims. Children under the age of 18 account for 26 percent of _x000D_
victims._x000D_
    We have been to countries and met with people who have _x000D_
survived this horrific experience, and heard from people who _x000D_
work to end modern slavery. U.S. Government and private _x000D_
philanthropic funding are spurring increasingly sophisticated _x000D_
efforts to combat modern slavery. There is a growing consensus _x000D_
that in order to end the practice of modern slavery, reliable _x000D_
baseline data and consistent and effective monitoring and _x000D_
evaluation are needed to deal with this issue. Leveraging and _x000D_
coordinating private and government funding are also seen as _x000D_
key challenges by many in the antimodern slavery community._x000D_
    Today we will explore these questions to help inform our _x000D_
thinking on how we can maximize our efforts and take them to _x000D_
the next level, and to find the best way forward to begin the _x000D_
process in earnest of putting an end to modern slavery. With _x000D_
that, I turn to our distinguished ranking member, Bob Menendez.",corker
ENDING MODERN SLAVERY: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD?,2/4/2015,"    Thank you, and I want to thank others for _x000D_
being here. We will now turn to our witnesses, and we _x000D_
appreciate the tremendous commitment that they have shown in _x000D_
this effort._x000D_
    Our first witness is Gary Haugen, the founder and president _x000D_
of International Justice Mission, IJM, a global organization _x000D_
that protects the poor from violence by partnering with local _x000D_
authorities to rescue victims, bring criminals to justice, _x000D_
restore survivors, and strengthen justice systems. IJM combats _x000D_
modern slavery, sex trafficking, rape, police brutality, _x000D_
property grabbing, and other forms of violence in Africa, Latin _x000D_
America, South Asia, Southeast Asia._x000D_
    Before founding IJM, he served as the director of the U.N. _x000D_
investigation of the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide, and as _x000D_
a human rights attorney for the U.S. Department of Justice. He _x000D_
has been recognized by the U.S. State Department as a _x000D_
trafficking in persons hero. I have gotten to know him _x000D_
personally, and he certainly deserves that recognition._x000D_
    Our second witness is Shawna Bader-Blau. I am going to call _x000D_
you ``Shawna'' if that is okay. [Laughter.]_x000D_
    Shawna is the executive director of the Solidarity Center _x000D_
in Washington, DC, the largest global worker rights _x000D_
organization in the United States. Solidarity Center works with _x000D_
partners and allies from more than 400 unions, nongovernmental _x000D_
organizations, legal aid groups, and human rights defenders _x000D_
from around the world to help workers exercise their rights and _x000D_
improve their working conditions._x000D_
    Prior to her appointment as executive director, she served _x000D_
as the Solidarity Center's regional program director for the _x000D_
Middle East and North Africa, where she worked directly with _x000D_
victims of forced labor and human trafficking, and with labor _x000D_
activists and human rights defenders._x000D_
    Thank you for being here and for sharing your thoughts and _x000D_
viewpoints today. We would like to remind you that your full _x000D_
testimony, full statements will be included in the record _x000D_
without objection. So if you could please keep your remarks to _x000D_
about 5 minutes, we would appreciate it so members can engage _x000D_
you in questions. And with that, Mr. Haugen, if you would _x000D_
begin, we would appreciate it.",corker

STATEMENT OF SHAWNA BADER-BLAU, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, SOLIDARITY _x000D_
                     CENTER, WASHINGTON, DC",corker
ENDING MODERN SLAVERY: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD?,2/4/2015,"    Well, thank you both. Great testimony and we _x000D_
really appreciate your efforts in being here and your efforts _x000D_
regarding this issue._x000D_
    I have come to believe that through Congress, we can create _x000D_
and lead a vision to end modern day slavery. I really believe _x000D_
that. And we have had conversations with both the private _x000D_
sector and public sector--some partners around the world. I _x000D_
really believe that, undoubtedly, with the United States behind _x000D_
it, we can lead, we can solve this, and we can bring others to _x000D_
the table._x000D_
    One of the things that I have learned is that many _x000D_
organizations are adopting best practices, okay? And, Gary, if _x000D_
I could, my staff has prepared a number of questions, but I was _x000D_
able to go to the Philippines and see your work there. And I _x000D_
would just say to the audience and the people here that seeing _x000D_
the 22 young women that we saw that day, you would have to be _x000D_
not a human being to sit through that with dry eyes._x000D_
    I would just like, with my time, if you could just walk _x000D_
through how you go into a jurisdiction and build from the _x000D_
ground up the type of effort that you just talked about so that _x000D_
others might hear.",corker
ENDING MODERN SLAVERY: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD?,2/4/2015,"    So, the question is, I mean, as we begin to _x000D_
look at doing something, mobilizing on a global scale, is what _x000D_
you have done there, in your opinion, something that can be _x000D_
replicated around the world where slavery is just a part of the _x000D_
culture there?",corker
ENDING MODERN SLAVERY: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD?,2/4/2015,"    You know, you compared this to malaria. We _x000D_
have had some of the same results in PEPFAR because we have _x000D_
continued to focus on treatment, although there is always a _x000D_
push, as you mentioned earlier, to sort of move out into other _x000D_
areas. But if you focus on treatment, then you have the kind of _x000D_
results, and we have been able to do that. This committee has _x000D_
been able to make sure that the focus is on treatment._x000D_
    One of the things that I think people would be concerned _x000D_
about is how do you know you are achieving the results that are _x000D_
laid out with an issue like this? Could you talk to us a little _x000D_
bit about how you set the base and how we can actually measure _x000D_
the results in a way that if we were to lead an effort like _x000D_
this, we would know that we were actually achieving results?",corker
ENDING MODERN SLAVERY: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD?,2/4/2015,"    And in closing, Shawna, in listening to that, _x000D_
I know you have had a tremendous amount of experience in supply _x000D_
chains and efforts in that regard. Do you think we are at a _x000D_
point in time where we can measure success and that these types _x000D_
of best practices can be multiplied in other places around the _x000D_
world?",corker
ENDING MODERN SLAVERY: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD?,2/4/2015,"    Thank you for that full answer, and I am _x000D_
sorry I went over just a little bit. As we turn to our _x000D_
distinguished ranking member--thank you both again--Senator _x000D_
Menendez.",corker

    Senator Rubio.",corker
ENDING MODERN SLAVERY: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD?,2/4/2015,"    Thank you. You all have been outstanding _x000D_
witnesses. In my opening comments I mentioned the role Congress _x000D_
has played. But, I think because of your efforts and so many _x000D_
advocates from around our country, the administration, too, I _x000D_
think is very focused on this. I know Secretary Kerry recently _x000D_
referred to a much more robust effort. So I think this is _x000D_
something that we can all work on together in a very positive _x000D_
way, and I want to thank you both for a lifetime of effort in _x000D_
this regard, for being here today, for sharing your _x000D_
experiences, and for working with us in the future. Thank you _x000D_
very much._x000D_
    And now we will have the second panel. Do we have our _x000D_
second panel?",corker
ENDING MODERN SLAVERY: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD?,2/4/2015,"    They get mentioned enough, thank you.",corker
ENDING MODERN SLAVERY: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD?,2/4/2015,"    We will now turn to our witnesses for the _x000D_
second panel. Thank you for being here. Our first witness is _x000D_
Mr. James Kofi Annan. In 2013, he was awarded the World's _x000D_
Children Prize for his work to stop child slavery. He himself _x000D_
was a fishing slave as a child for 7 years. He managed to _x000D_
escape, get an education, and become a bank manager. In 2007 he _x000D_
left the bank to work solely to stop child slavery. By that _x000D_
time, he had already started an organization called Challenging _x000D_
Heights in 2003, which has liberated over 500 children from _x000D_
slavery._x000D_
    Liberated slave children come first through Challenging _x000D_
Heights' safe home for 65 children. Challenging Heights also _x000D_
runs a school for 700 pupils of different ages. They offer _x000D_
training to poor mothers so that they can support their _x000D_
families and do not just sell their children into slavery. He _x000D_
has supported over 10,000 children who have been slaves or at _x000D_
risk for slavery. Thank you for being here._x000D_
    Our second witness is Shandra Woworuntu, the founder of a _x000D_
nonprofit organization dedicated to empowering human _x000D_
trafficking survivors through mentorship and job training. She _x000D_
graduated from college with a major in finance and bank _x000D_
management in her native Indonesia. After graduation, she _x000D_
became the manager of the Treasury Department of the Korea _x000D_
Exchange Bank in Indonesia, specializing in money market _x000D_
trading._x000D_
    When political turbulence erupted, she lost her job because _x000D_
of economic, religious, and racial persecution. She applied for _x000D_
a job that promised a 6-month position in the hotel industry in _x000D_
Chicago, which led her to become--and to survive being--a _x000D_
victim of a criminal human trafficking organization. Thank you _x000D_
again for being here today._x000D_
    Our next witness is David Abramowitz. He is vice president _x000D_
of policy in government relations at Humanity United, a _x000D_
foundation that focuses on advancing human freedom by combating _x000D_
human trafficking and modern slavery, among other human rights _x000D_
issues. Previously he served as Department of State's Office of _x000D_
Legal Advisor._x000D_
    In 1999, he joined the staff of the Committee on Foreign _x000D_
Affairs for the House of Representatives, and served as chief _x000D_
counsel. Over the next year 10 years, he worked on such _x000D_
legislation as the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Act of _x000D_
2000 and the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection _x000D_
Reauthorization Act of 2008._x000D_
    And with that, we will recognize James Kofi Annan. If you _x000D_
would begin and just go in order. Thank you all for being here.",corker

ENDING MODERN SLAVERY: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD?,2/4/2015,"    Well, thank you for your testimony, and your _x000D_
entire statement will be made a part of the record. And thank _x000D_
you each for what you have said today and for sharing your _x000D_
experiences._x000D_
    Mr. Kofi Annan, how aware are the people of Ghana that this _x000D_
slavery issue exists, and what is it that would motivate _x000D_
parents to allow their children to become a part of this?",corker
ENDING MODERN SLAVERY: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD?,2/4/2015,"    And the parents, though they are obviously _x000D_
aware in many of the cases that their children are being _x000D_
victims of slavery, are they not?",corker
ENDING MODERN SLAVERY: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD?,2/4/2015,"    Thank you very much. Ms. Woworuntu, you are _x000D_
obviously incredibly well educated, had a great job in _x000D_
Indonesia, and yet ended up in a situation here in the United _x000D_
States through a recruiter where you were in obviously a very _x000D_
terrible situation, fortunately escaped, and are helping _x000D_
others. Could you tell me a little bit about how that occurred, _x000D_
what the experience was with the recruiter? And then post that, _x000D_
how the prosecution worked with you here in the United States?",corker
ENDING MODERN SLAVERY: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD?,2/4/2015,"    Very impactful. Thank you both. And in order _x000D_
to be courteous to my colleagues, I will press on. I may want _x000D_
to come back, if it all right, and ask you a question._x000D_
    Senator Menendez.",corker

ENDING MODERN SLAVERY: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD?,2/4/2015,    Senator Kaine.,corker
ENDING MODERN SLAVERY: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD?,2/4/2015,"    Thank you, Senator Kaine. I want to thank you _x000D_
for being here. I think this has been most impactful. I want to _x000D_
thank our ranking member for his shared interest in this topic _x000D_
and for allowing this hearing to go forward today as it has, _x000D_
and hopefully it will produce results here._x000D_
    To the two witnesses who have been victims, I want to thank _x000D_
you for the courage to be here, but also taking your _x000D_
experiences and using it to help other people, and to help us _x000D_
today, first, to understand some of the cultural issues and the _x000D_
lack of awareness. I mean, it seems to me that one of the easy _x000D_
to produce outcomes is to make sure people are more fully _x000D_
aware, and that parents understand what is happening in various _x000D_
countries with their young ones._x000D_
    And to understand the tremendous plight of victims, who, in _x000D_
many cases, are not dealt with as victims. That is an _x000D_
experience that we heard from others. And, again, just creating _x000D_
more awareness with the law enforcement agencies, but also _x000D_
making sure that we use best practices, and your efforts to _x000D_
work through public policy to deal with this effectively. All _x000D_
three of you have been outstanding witnesses. Our first panel _x000D_
certainly was a very good panel. And as Senator Kaine _x000D_
mentioned, I cannot imagine a better time for us to be focused _x000D_
on this._x000D_
    The issue regarding foreign officials, we do have a meeting _x000D_
today with a Foreign Minister, and, candidly, the topic is _x000D_
ISIS. And a lot of times we do get caught up, as we should, in _x000D_
important issues of national security. But to be aware of this _x000D_
issue also, and to be able to push this as we meet with other _x000D_
officials, but also to produce some public policy hopefully _x000D_
that will deal with this on a far grander scale with a much _x000D_
bigger vision._x000D_
    So thank you all for being here. Your testimony was _x000D_
outstanding._x000D_
    And for the information of the members, the record will _x000D_

6th, including for members to submit questions for the record. _x000D_
We ask, if you will, to respond as promptly as you can to _x000D_
those. Your responses will also be made a part of the record._x000D_
    And with the thanks of the committee, this hearing is now _x000D_
adjourned. Thank you.",corker

ENDING MODERN SLAVERY: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD?,2/4/2015,"    This hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations _x000D_
Committee will come to order._x000D_
    And thank you so much for being here. I will introduce you _x000D_
in one moment._x000D_
    I want to thank the other committee members for their _x000D_
interest._x000D_
    We have convened this hearing to understand how U.S. _x000D_
leadership can best be deployed to deal a mortal wound to _x000D_
modern slavery. Last week, the committee heard from two panels _x000D_
of private witnesses. We received testimony from leaders in the _x000D_
effort to combat modern slavery. We also heard from brave _x000D_
individuals who escaped from modern slavery and went on to help _x000D_
others._x000D_
    Today we welcome Dr. Sarah Sewall. I have heard many good _x000D_
things about the Under Secretary of State for Civilian _x000D_
Security, Democracy, and Human Rights at the U.S. Department of _x000D_
State. The State Department's office to monitor and combat _x000D_
trafficking in persons falls under your purview, and we _x000D_
appreciate your efforts._x000D_
    Conflict exposes vulnerable people, especially women and _x000D_
children, to being enslaved and exploited. The horrifying _x000D_
examples set by ISIL and Boko Haram could not be starker._x000D_
    But even in countries with laws and institutions, insidious _x000D_
forms of modern slavery exists. Perversely labor recruiters _x000D_
extract money from impoverished people with empty promises and _x000D_
deliver them into bondage and sexual exploitation._x000D_
    For 14 years, as defined and authorized by Congress, the _x000D_
State Department has issued an annual report on trafficking in _x000D_
persons. This report, as Secretary Kerry has said, sets the _x000D_
gold standard. The report reviews the efforts of countries to _x000D_
address trafficking in persons especially in the most severe _x000D_
forms. Its findings are not always welcome, but we know they _x000D_
have made a difference._x000D_
    Under Secretary Sewall has said that almost every issue she _x000D_
touches has implications for human trafficking. Whether working _x000D_
with the Bureau of Counterterrorism, Democracy, Human Rights, _x000D_
and Labor, Population Migration and Refugees, International _x000D_
Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, Conflict and _x000D_
Stabilization Operations, often there is a trafficking angle._x000D_
    Today we hope to learn how U.S. leadership is already _x000D_
making a difference and how, working in partnership with the _x000D_
State Department and reaching out to like-minded governments, _x000D_
we can take our efforts to the next level to find the best way _x000D_
forward to begin the process in earnest of putting an end to _x000D_
modern slavery._x000D_
    Thank you._x000D_
    And with that, I will turn to our distinguished ranking _x000D_
member, Bob Menendez.",corker
ENDING MODERN SLAVERY: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD?,2/4/2015,"    Thank you, Senator Menendez, and thank you _x000D_
for your shared interest in this issue and your comments._x000D_
    And now we will turn to our witness. Our witness today is _x000D_
Dr. Sarah Sewall, the Under Secretary of State for Civilian _x000D_
Security, Democracy, and Human Rights. She was sworn in as _x000D_
Under Secretary on February 20, 2014, and serves concurrently _x000D_
as the Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues._x000D_
    Over the previous decade, Dr. Sewall taught at Harvard _x000D_
Kennedy School of Government, where she also served as director _x000D_
of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy, launched the MARO _x000D_
Project, Mass Atrocities Response Operations. In 2012, she was _x000D_
Minerva Chair at the Naval War College. During the Clinton _x000D_
administration, Dr. Sewall served as the inaugural Deputy _x000D_
Assistant Secretary of Defense for Peacekeeping and _x000D_
Humanitarian Assistance. Prior to joining the executive branch, _x000D_
she served 6 years as the senior foreign policy advisor to U.S. _x000D_
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell._x000D_
    I want to thank you for being here. You have had a very _x000D_
distinguished career. You are either really, really qualified _x000D_
or cannot keep a job. [Laughter.]_x000D_
    But you have done a lot of different things. But I think it _x000D_
is the first._x000D_
    Thank you for being here and sharing your testimony. And we _x000D_
will remind you that your full statement will be entered into _x000D_
the record. Thank you.",corker
ENDING MODERN SLAVERY: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD?,2/4/2015,"    Thank you for that great testimony._x000D_
    And the bulk of the State Department's activities, _x000D_
programmatic and funding, actually falls under your purview, _x000D_
and I know there are a number of different entities that are _x000D_
dealing with this. Could you share with us how they are working _x000D_
with each other, and is there anything that might be done to _x000D_
enhance their ability to do so?",corker
ENDING MODERN SLAVERY: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD?,2/4/2015,"    I know that entities like Daesh, or ISIL, _x000D_
enslave people, and I realize this is a minor part of the 27 _x000D_
million we know are affected by this. But could you tell us: do _x000D_
these types of entities help further their efforts through _x000D_
human trafficking? Are they taking advantage of this same kind _x000D_
of thing? I do not want to spend a lot of time on it. Because _x000D_
of its currency though, I thought I would just ask.",corker
ENDING MODERN SLAVERY: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD?,2/4/2015,"    Now, are they doing that to fund their _x000D_
activities?",corker
ENDING MODERN SLAVERY: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD?,2/4/2015,"    One of the things we have seen in the field _x000D_
is that rule of law is one of the best ways, if not the best _x000D_
way, to combat this where you hold perpetrators accountable. Do _x000D_
you agree that that is one of the best ways to deal with this _x000D_
issue and to curtail the activity?",corker
ENDING MODERN SLAVERY: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD?,2/4/2015,"    Last week, when we had a hearing, Senator _x000D_
Menendez and I happened to be meeting with a public official _x000D_
from a country where we knew this was an issue. And so Senator _x000D_
Menendez actually brought it up in that meeting. I guess one of _x000D_
my questions is--obviously there are ways of leveraging this. I _x000D_
mean, just awareness. I know as we meet with people where we _x000D_
know in their own countries this is happening a great deal, it _x000D_
makes a difference._x000D_
    How are we leveraging through our diplomatic efforts around _x000D_
the world awareness and actually implementation of policies to _x000D_
really cause this to be lessened?",corker
ENDING MODERN SLAVERY: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD?,2/4/2015,"    And I know right now--this is my last point I _x000D_
guess--this Trafficking in Persons Office really does not have _x000D_
anybody who is the Ambassador at Large, if you will. I assume _x000D_
that you have taken on those responsibilities and we can count _x000D_
on you, in spite of not having someone there, to continue _x000D_
pursuing it heavily.",corker

testimony today._x000D_

    I know Senator Menendez had a closing question and comment.",corker
ENDING MODERN SLAVERY: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD?,2/4/2015,"    Well, listen, I want to thank you for your _x000D_
efforts. I think you have been an excellent witness. I _x000D_
appreciate what you are doing at the State Department. _x000D_
Obviously, we want to see things move along even more quickly, _x000D_
and I think we are going to be working toward an end here very _x000D_
soon that will be very complementary to what you are doing. And _x000D_
we thank you again for your service to our country, for being _x000D_
here today, for being an outstanding witness, and we look _x000D_
forward to working with you on a continual basis.",corker

IRAN NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS: STATUS OF TALKS AND THE ROLE OF CONGRESS,1/21/2015,"    So I am going to call the--call the meeting _x000D_
to order. And I would say to people in the audience that we _x000D_
would appreciate you refraining. We understand people have _x000D_
strong emotions about much of what happens in this committee _x000D_
and others, and we hope you will respect the work of the _x000D_
committee._x000D_
    I have never operated a gavel. I learned as a young man how _x000D_
to operate a hammer. I understand my staff told me to be a _x000D_
little more gentle with this, but I want to welcome--I want to _x000D_
welcome everybody to the committee._x000D_
    We switched sides. That was not symbolic. I understand just _x000D_
because of the number of seats, it works better this way._x000D_
    I do want to welcome the new members to the committee and _x000D_
say that under Senator Menendez's leadership, I really believe _x000D_
that this committee has caused its profile to rise._x000D_
    We have passed a number of very important pieces of _x000D_
legislation out of this committee, and I think it is because of _x000D_
his leadership that that has happened. And I want to thank him _x000D_
for that._x000D_
    I want to say to all of the committee members that we plan _x000D_
certainly to build upon that. We have a number of very _x000D_
important issues to deal with. The Nation has put its trust in _x000D_
us to deal with these issues in a sober way, and I think that _x000D_
the issue today that we will be talking about really reminds us _x000D_
of the indispensable nature of U.S. leadership._x000D_
    I think the committee has, like any committee, we have _x000D_
important things to deal with, and we have urgent things to _x000D_
deal with. And we need to do both. Important is for us to _x000D_
continue as a committee to show that the importance of _x000D_
strategic U.S. engagement and how that improves our economy and _x000D_
makes us safer here at home._x000D_
    At the same time, we need to make sure that our taxpayer _x000D_
dollars are spent wisely. And so, while it will take some time _x000D_
to build, I would like for us to work toward a State Department _x000D_
authorization. I think all of us know that we have not passed _x000D_
one since 2002._x000D_
    So what that means is the State Department is basically _x000D_
operating off of policies that we passed 13 years ago. And if _x000D_
we really want to leverage our efforts, what would make sense--_x000D_
and I look forward to working with Ranking Member Menendez in _x000D_
this way--would be for us to ensure that what the State _x000D_
Department is doing is leveraging those kind of things that we _x000D_
would like to see happen._x000D_
    I do not want to shy away from difficult issues. This first _x000D_
hearing certainly is evidence of that. I want to make sure that _x000D_
the views of all committee members are heard. I want to make _x000D_
sure that we strengthen our Nation in the process._x000D_
    Today, we are here to talk about Iran. And I want to say to _x000D_
our witnesses thank you for being here. I think there are _x000D_
legitimate concerns by almost everybody on this committee, and _x000D_
it is not in any way disloyal. It is not an infringement upon _x000D_
anybody else to say that we have legitimate concerns._x000D_
    And when you think about where we are in the Iran _x000D_
negotiations, so we had six U.S. security resolutions--U.N. _x000D_
security resolutions that called for full suspension of _x000D_
enrichment. We then moved to this standard called practical _x000D_
needs. In other words, if you are in Iran and you have--if you _x000D_
want to do enrichment, even though that is in violation of the _x000D_
U.N. Security Council resolutions, what are the practical needs _x000D_
of the country?_x000D_
    And by all estimation, that is maybe 500 centrifuges. And _x000D_
yet we know the negotiations have moved way beyond that. We _x000D_
know that._x000D_
    We talked about dismantlement, and we have concerns of what _x000D_
dismantlement now means. Some people are saying that means _x000D_
simply unplugging or disconnecting the plumbing, to use very _x000D_
coarse terms._x000D_
    People are concerned about research and development. We _x000D_
spend a lot of time talking about IR-1s and IR-2s, and yet we _x000D_
know the Iranians are way beyond that--we are talking about IR-_x000D_
6, IR-7--way beyond that in research and development. The _x000D_
agreement itself does not speak at all to ballistic missile _x000D_
development. Significant concerns for all of us._x000D_
    And we believe that--although I am not sure this is the _x000D_
case. I had a meeting last night, and maybe this is not true, _x000D_
and I know that some of you can enlighten us here today. But we _x000D_
are concerned about what we are really going to cause Iran to _x000D_
do relative to their past military dimensions. I think most of _x000D_
us think they were way down the road in their military _x000D_
development up until 2003, and I think we would like to _x000D_
understand the type of technology that they have developed._x000D_
    And I know this, and you all have shared this with us in _x000D_
all kinds of meetings, they still are stiff-arming the IAEA _x000D_
relative to access to many of their facilities, which obviously _x000D_
continues to cause us to have great concerns about their _x000D_
trustworthiness._x000D_
    I think all of us know they are destabilizing the region. _x000D_
We watch what is happening in Yemen. We watch what is happening _x000D_
with Hezbollah and Iran. We watch what is happening with Hamas. _x000D_
We know that they are--even with the minor amounts of money _x000D_
that has been lessened from the sanctions regime that Senator _x000D_
Menendez and Senator Kirk and all of us worked together to put _x000D_
in place, even with that minor amount of money, we know that _x000D_
that has enhanced their ability to destabilize the region. We _x000D_
know that._x000D_
    And you can imagine if we end up with a really bad deal _x000D_
that ends up creating a nuclear arms race in the region and _x000D_
makes the world less safe and yet much more money is released, _x000D_
they can destabilize the region more. So, obviously, there are _x000D_
significant concerns._x000D_
    I am proposing some legislation--and I look forward to _x000D_
hearing from you all today, and we are vetting it with people _x000D_
on this committee--that builds off the 123 agreements that we _x000D_
have in place right now. Senator Markey is very familiar with _x000D_
this._x000D_
    But we--27 times this Nation has approved a 123 agreement _x000D_
with another nation under a civil nuclear arrangement where _x000D_
we--you all reach an agreement with a country, and we approve _x000D_
it. Secretary Kerry came in and said that he wants to make sure _x000D_
that any agreement that happens passes muster with Congress. I _x000D_
would like to understand today how you would like to see us _x000D_
pass muster._x000D_
    One way to do it is an up-or-down vote. I know there have _x000D_
been a lot of discussions, and I do not know if Senator _x000D_
Menendez will speak to this, a lot of discussions about what we _x000D_
might do, what we might not do. I have talked to Prime Minister _x000D_
Cameron. I talked to the U.K.--excuse me, European Union _x000D_
negotiator last night in my office. Some of us were in Israel _x000D_
this weekend over this very same issue._x000D_
    We have heard no one, no one say that if Congress were to _x000D_
weigh in on the final agreement it would have anything--it _x000D_
would in any way destabilize the negotiations. And as a matter _x000D_
of fact, we understand that Iran's Parliament may have to _x000D_
approve their agreement._x000D_
    So I hope today you will share with us the appropriate role _x000D_
for us to play. We obviously have our own thoughts. We thank _x000D_
you for being here._x000D_
    And with that--I am sorry to give such a long opening _x000D_
comment--to the Ranking Member Menendez.",corker
IRAN NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS: STATUS OF TALKS AND THE ROLE OF CONGRESS,1/21/2015,"    Thank you, Mr. Ranking Member. I am not used _x000D_
to calling you that yet._x000D_
    And to the other members, I want to say we do not normally _x000D_
give those long comments on the front end. They are usually a _x000D_
little shorter. This is obviously one that evokes a lot of _x000D_
concern._x000D_
    We are going to be having--the committee will operate by _x000D_
early bird rule. If you are here when the gavel goes down, you _x000D_
will know what order you are in. We have watched people come in _x000D_
and sit and wait as other people come in and out._x000D_
    But in order to show we are not going to be totally rigid, _x000D_
I know that Senator Boxer has a meeting. We do not normally _x000D_
have other opening comments. She is not going to ask questions _x000D_
later. But since she has to go to another meeting, she wanted _x000D_
to say a couple of words on the front end, and I am going to _x000D_
allow her to do that._x000D_
    Thank you.",corker
IRAN NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS: STATUS OF TALKS AND THE ROLE OF CONGRESS,1/21/2015,"    Thank you. Thank you._x000D_
    Just to be clear before we move to the witnesses, there has _x000D_
been a lot of confusion about what this committee does and what _x000D_
the Banking Committee does. Any sanctions legislation it has _x000D_
been determined will be dealt with in the Banking Committee----",corker
IRAN NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS: STATUS OF TALKS AND THE ROLE OF CONGRESS,1/21/2015,"    [continuing]. Because of the Treasury _x000D_
functions. So this committee, I think, will be looking at ways _x000D_
for Congress to weigh in. And one of those is just for us to _x000D_
approve, up or down, the final deal, which is what we do on _x000D_
every civil nuclear deal that comes our way. Certainly, this is _x000D_
of greater importance._x000D_
    But with that, I want to thank everyone for their comments. _x000D_
I want to move to the witnesses. Thank you for your patience._x000D_
    Our first witness is Tony Blinken, the Deputy Secretary of _x000D_
State. Mr. Blinken assumed his post after being confirmed by _x000D_
the Senate in December. He is a former Deputy National Security _x000D_
Adviser to the President and has previously served as the _x000D_
Democratic staff director of this committee from 2002 to 2008. _x000D_
Welcome back._x000D_
    Our second witness today is David Cohen, the Under _x000D_
Secretary of Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. _x000D_
Mr. Cohen has been in his position since 2011 and has recently _x000D_
been appointed Deputy Director of the CIA. He has previously _x000D_
served as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorist _x000D_
Financing, where I think he has done an outstanding job._x000D_
    I want to thank you both for being here and sharing your _x000D_
thoughts and viewpoints with us today. We would remind you that _x000D_
your full statements, without objection, will be included in _x000D_
the record. If you could keep your remarks to around 5 minutes, _x000D_
we would appreciate it. I know there will be numbers of _x000D_
questions._x000D_
    So thank you again for being here. We look forward to your _x000D_
testimony.",corker
IRAN NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS: STATUS OF TALKS AND THE ROLE OF CONGRESS,1/21/2015,"    Thank you._x000D_
    Mr. Cohen, Mr. Blinken was very fulsome in his comments, _x000D_
about double over. If you could sort of keep it to 5, it would _x000D_
be good._x000D_
    Thank you.",corker
IRAN NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS: STATUS OF TALKS AND THE ROLE OF CONGRESS,1/21/2015,"    Thank you both._x000D_
    And again, I just want to make sure everybody understands _x000D_
this committee is not the committee that deals with sanctions. _x000D_
And I know that the witnesses certainly have the opportunity to _x000D_
say anything they wish in testimony._x000D_
    That is not the issue that is before us._x000D_
    I am sure you may get some questions about things other _x000D_
than Iran today, and people will use this venue for that. But I _x000D_
would just like to ask this question of Mr. Blinken. Do you _x000D_
believe Congress has any role at all to play in these _x000D_
negotiations? And with a short answer, if you would?",corker
IRAN NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS: STATUS OF TALKS AND THE ROLE OF CONGRESS,1/21/2015,"    Well, thank you._x000D_
    I think one of the things that we all know is when the _x000D_
sanctions were put in place, we gave the administration some _x000D_
national security waivers, and you have utilized those. I think _x000D_
all of us also know that once you suspend these in more depth _x000D_
and you agree to do that with the P1+5, in essence, what is _x000D_
going to happen is the entire regime is going to fall apart._x000D_
    And so, I sent you some legislation--I am very disappointed _x000D_
you did not address that today in your opening comments--that _x000D_
would just allow us--we do not want to do something that _x000D_
infringes upon getting to a good deal. And so, we have sought _x000D_
to figure out some way for Congress to be able to weigh in _x000D_
before you dismantle, before you dismantle over a longer period _x000D_
of time with this national security waiver the entire regime._x000D_
    We have asked is it appropriate for us to at least be able _x000D_
to weigh in since we did, in fact, put those sanctions in _x000D_
place? So I will just ask you this. Do you believe that _x000D_
Congress should have the ability to vote up or down on any _x000D_
agreement in the same framework that we do with 123 agreements, _x000D_
which we have done 27 times on our civil deals? Do you not _x000D_
think this rises to that level of importance to our Nation? And _x000D_
would you oppose this body taking up legislation to deal with _x000D_
that in an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor?",corker
IRAN NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS: STATUS OF TALKS AND THE ROLE OF CONGRESS,1/21/2015,"    So if I could, I think the answer is ``No.'' _x000D_
So let me--you know, we could easily deal with this by just _x000D_
passing legislation that does away with national security _x000D_
waivers. So----",corker
IRAN NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS: STATUS OF TALKS AND THE ROLE OF CONGRESS,1/21/2015,"    So I do not understand. You know, you have _x000D_
talked about the sanctions piece. I have talked to our French _x000D_
negotiators directly. I talked to our U.K. negotiators _x000D_
directly. I talked to Prime Minister Cameron directly. I talked _x000D_
last night at length in my office to the negotiator on behalf _x000D_
of the European Union._x000D_
    I was in Israel this weekend, talked to the intelligence _x000D_
agencies there. I talked to the Prime Minister. I have met no _x000D_
one who believes that us weighing in would do anything to _x000D_
destabilize these negotiations. As a matter of fact, many have _x000D_
said knowing that Congress has to approve the deal would be a _x000D_
great backstop for the administration to strengthen their hand, _x000D_
just as the negotiators in Iran continue to refer to the _x000D_
hardliners and to Khamenei, the spiritual--the leader, the _x000D_
Supreme Leader._x000D_
    And I do not understand why--I mean, again, we could just _x000D_
do away. We were generous in the passage of these sanctions _x000D_
giving you a security waiver. We could actually just do away _x000D_
with that, and you would have to come to us._x000D_
    So why would you oppose Congress weighing in on an issue of _x000D_
this importance? And is it hollow for you to say that you want _x000D_
this to pass muster or Secretary Kerry to say this should pass _x000D_
muster and yet continue to stiff-arm, every effort to be pushed _x000D_
away. Congress, who represents more fully this Nation than the _x000D_
negotiators, not having the ability to weigh in on this deal.",corker
IRAN NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS: STATUS OF TALKS AND THE ROLE OF CONGRESS,1/21/2015,"    Does the Iranian Parliament not need to weigh _x000D_
in on some of the agreements that Iran is putting in place?",corker
IRAN NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS: STATUS OF TALKS AND THE ROLE OF CONGRESS,1/21/2015,"    Okay. So, so on one hand, we would negotiate _x000D_
in such a way as we know that the Supreme Leader could try to _x000D_
influence the Iranian Parliament to go against what they may _x000D_
agree to, and yet you would say here it is not important for _x000D_
the greatest deliberative body in the world to be able to weigh _x000D_
in on this issue._x000D_
    Matter of fact, the body that actually put together this _x000D_
regime that the entire international community is building _x000D_
these negotiations off of.",corker
IRAN NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS: STATUS OF TALKS AND THE ROLE OF CONGRESS,1/21/2015,"    Well, my time is up. But I would support a _x000D_
series of votes, if that is what you are saying. I would _x000D_
support an initial vote on the deal as a whole, and I think _x000D_
Congress would be more than glad to work with you on a series _x000D_
of votes as you move along._x000D_
    I will say, Mr. Blinken, after having served on this _x000D_
committee, and after you all spending incredible amounts of _x000D_
time dissing the sanctions regime, which we are not focused on, _x000D_
we are trying to find a constructive way for Congress to play _x000D_
its rightful role in these negotiations. And I am very _x000D_
disappointed that, in essence, what the administration is _x000D_
saying is we really do not want--even though Congress put us in _x000D_
this place, we really do not want Congress to play a role in _x000D_
one of the most important geopolitical agreements that may take _x000D_
place during this administration._x000D_
    With that, Ranking Member Menendez.",corker

willingness to look at some legislation that would give us an _x000D_
up-or-down vote on this issue. And I would say in response to _x000D_
Mr. Blinken's comments, I have talked with our international _x000D_
partners. Not a single one of them has any concerns whatsoever _x000D_
with Congress having the ability to vote up or down on a final _x000D_

a red herring that keeps being thrown out. But we are asking, _x000D_

have been so involved in making happen._x000D_
    Senator Risch.",corker
IRAN NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS: STATUS OF TALKS AND THE ROLE OF CONGRESS,1/21/2015,"    Thank you, Senator._x000D_
    Senator Menendez.",corker
IRAN NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS: STATUS OF TALKS AND THE ROLE OF CONGRESS,1/21/2015,"    Thank you, sir. Again, thanks for all your _x000D_
efforts to bring us to this point. I look forward, over the _x000D_
next few days, to see if there is some common ground to address _x000D_
the consultation and Congress' role, ultimately, in this._x000D_
    I do want to say one thing. I know there have been a lot of _x000D_
discussions about Bibi Netanyahu's whatever you might have _x000D_
called his prop at the U.N. I think it is fair to note that _x000D_
with the additional research and development that Iran has _x000D_
done, and they are moving way up the food chain from the _x000D_
standpoint of the centrifuge development, they can move so much _x000D_
more quickly from 0 to 90 percent now that that is almost an _x000D_
old adage. I think you all are very aware of that._x000D_
    And I think that is the concern that we have. It is on the _x000D_
research and development component, and the things they are _x000D_
doing to move rapidly--rapidly--toward being able to get to 90 _x000D_
percent very, very quickly._x000D_
    But let me just give a few closing comments. I, too, want _x000D_
you to be successful. I wake up every day wanting our Nation to _x000D_
be successful in every endeavor. And I think I have shown to _x000D_
this administration my desire to work toward common ground and _x000D_
to try to solve problems. So I want these negotiations to be _x000D_
successful._x000D_
    And I had one of the most impactful meetings, along with a _x000D_
number of people here on the committee, in Israel just in the _x000D_
last couple days._x000D_
    But I think the concerns are, as you look back over the _x000D_
history over the last 10 years that some people have alluded _x000D_
to, Iran has stayed here and the P5 began here, and as the _x000D_
negotiations have progressed, what has happened is the P5 and _x000D_
us, being the major driving force, have continued to move _x000D_
toward their position._x000D_
    And I would just argue that, again, having Congress as a _x000D_
backstop as you enter these final steps, having Congress as a _x000D_
backstop, someone that you do, in fact, not only have to _x000D_
consult with but you have to seek their approval, would be _x000D_
somewhat of an anchor to keep us from continuing to move toward _x000D_
their position._x000D_
    I think it would be very difficult for you to say that _x000D_
there has not been a continual movement toward their position. _x000D_
I mean, you look at where we began with the U.N. security _x000D_
resolutions, you look at where we began with us potentially _x000D_
agreeing to them having enough centrifuges to serve their, _x000D_
quote, ``practical needs,'' which, as I understand it, every _x000D_
scientist has said was about 500 centrifuges, and I think you _x000D_
would tell me today we have moved way beyond that._x000D_
    So I would just say to you, Congress can be an excellent _x000D_
backstop to you as you are moving down the road._x000D_
    I thought Senator Kaine probably expressed it better than _x000D_
any of us here. When we entered into these agreements that _x000D_
Senator Menendez was so much a part of, meaning the sanctions, _x000D_
I do not think anyone in giving you the national security _x000D_
waivers ever thought the President was going to suspend them, _x000D_
in all likelihood, until the end of his term. I do not think _x000D_
anybody ever thought that._x000D_
    So the fact that we know that if you do that, the entire _x000D_
sanctions regime falls apart. I have tremendous respect for _x000D_
Secretary Cohen. But the fact is, these take a long time to put _x000D_
together. And so, again, to have to come to us on the front end _x000D_
of a deal, before you dismantle the entire regime, to me, is an _x000D_
incredibly important step that I hope you with will consult _x000D_
with us on._x000D_
    We laid out a proposal. We hope you will consult. And we _x000D_
hope you will come to an agreement that takes into account some _x000D_
of the nuance that you pointed out earlier, that you would like _x000D_
us to discuss._x000D_
    But just stiff-arming, and saying after the role that we _x000D_
have played, to basically put the international community at _x000D_
the table just to stiff-arm, say, ``No, we really do not want _x000D_
you to play a role. You want you just to trust us,'' is totally _x000D_
unacceptable, from my standpoint._x000D_
    So look, the Supreme Leader, we keep referring to him._x000D_
    And apparently as we negotiate, we seem to be more _x000D_
concerned about the Supreme lLader's position than anyone _x000D_
else's. I just want to lay out one thing. The Supreme Leader _x000D_
has said publicly that one of his major concerns is that Iran _x000D_
enters into an agreement and somehow, over time, Congress _x000D_
changes its mind._x000D_
    We have a presidential race that is coming up. I assure you _x000D_
that the Iran component will be a major part of the next _x000D_
Presidential race. I believe that to be the case. And so, since _x000D_
there is so much concern about the supreme leader and him _x000D_
walking away or doing whatever, I would just say that Congress' _x000D_
approval of a deal to me would be reassuring that whatever deal _x000D_
that you have done will stand the test of time._x000D_
    So I would encourage you to sit down, to walk through with _x000D_
us some of the concerns you have about timing. But I would say _x000D_
that general movement today is toward Congress playing a role. _x000D_
I think, again, just stiff-arming does not take us to a place _x000D_
that probably meets the test that both of us need to meet. And _x000D_
I would encourage you again to sit down and talk with us._x000D_
    We thank you for being here today. We thank you both, in _x000D_
spite of our concerns, for your service to our country._x000D_
    Let me just give some formalities._x000D_
    For the information of the members, the record will remain _x000D_
open until the close of business Friday, including for members _x000D_
to submit questions for the record._x000D_
    We ask the witnesses to respond as promptly as possible. _x000D_
Your responses will also be made a part of the record.",corker

SAFEGUARDING AMERICAN INTERESTS IN THE EAST AND SOUTH CHINA SEAS,5/13/2015,"    I will call the meeting to order._x000D_
    In June 2014, this committee held a hearing on the future _x000D_
of United States-China relations. At that time, I raised _x000D_
concerns over the lack of a coherent China policy, including _x000D_
the absence of sustained high-level engagement from senior _x000D_
administration officials despite the consistent rhetoric that _x000D_
the United States-China relationship is one of the most _x000D_
consequential relationships for United States political, _x000D_
security, and economic interests._x000D_
    I left that hearing scratching my head. And after nearly a _x000D_
year later, I am even more troubled._x000D_
    Yesterday, this committee convened to discuss a new nuclear _x000D_
cooperation agreement with China. We heard troubling _x000D_
information about the Chinese intent to divert U.S. technology _x000D_
for military purposes. In addition, we were told that China has _x000D_
not taken adequate steps to end proliferation of sensitive _x000D_
technologies by Chinese entities and individuals to countries _x000D_
of concern, including Iran and North Korea._x000D_
    Despite these concerns, administration officials testified _x000D_
in support of a new nuclear cooperation agreement, noting the _x000D_
mutual benefits for the bilateral relationship, including _x000D_
commercial interests._x000D_
    This afternoon, the absence of a genuine China policy will _x000D_
be on display as we discuss the situation in the East and South _x000D_
China Seas where China continues to engage in provocative and _x000D_
destabilizing behavior._x000D_
    As you can see from these pictures on display, China _x000D_
continues to engage in land reclamation and construction _x000D_
activities, the scope and scale of which are unprecedented in _x000D_
the South China Sea._x000D_
    Figure 1 shows Fiery Cross Reef, in the Spratly Islands, as _x000D_
it appeared on May 2014. Figure 2 shows that same reef less _x000D_
than a year later with over 1,300 meters of runway already _x000D_
completed and analyst assessments that it could be expanded up _x000D_
to 3,100 meters._x000D_
    Clearly, these activities are not simply limited to _x000D_
dredging and piling sand. China is deliberately constructing _x000D_
facilities on these reefs and islets that could be used for _x000D_
military purposes, including airstrips and ports, as you can _x000D_
see in Figure 3, which shows Fiery Cross Reef just a few weeks _x000D_
ago. Again, in Figure 4, you can see large, multistory _x000D_
buildings with additional military capabilities._x000D_
    Moreover, Beijing has publicly confirmed that there are _x000D_
military uses for these facilities, with China's foreign _x000D_
ministry spokesperson stating on March 9 that this construction _x000D_
was undertaken in part to satisfy the necessary military _x000D_
defense needs._x000D_
    It is worth noting that all of these activities are _x000D_
occurring against the backdrop of China's massive military _x000D_
buildup, including significant investments in the antiaccess/_x000D_
area-denial capabilities._x000D_
    Most China watchers believe that Beijing does not want to _x000D_
start a conflict in either the East or South China Seas. Yet _x000D_
many of the same experts concede that Beijing may do everything _x000D_
short of engaging in a military conflict to solidify its _x000D_
claims._x000D_
    That is why I recently joined Senators McCain, Reed, and _x000D_
Menendez in a bipartisan letter to Secretary Kerry and _x000D_
Secretary Carter to highlight our growing concerns with China's _x000D_
efforts to alter the status quo through ongoing land _x000D_
reclamation and construction activities in the South China Sea._x000D_
    According to the most recent statistics, some $5 trillion _x000D_
in global ship-borne trade passes through the South China Sea _x000D_
annually. As you can see from Figure 5, all of the major trade _x000D_
routes through the South China Sea pass near disputed areas in _x000D_
both the Spratlys and Paracels. And you can see those circled _x000D_
on this display._x000D_
    I hope we will be able to have a thoughtful discussion _x000D_
today that outlines U.S. interests in the Indo-Pacific and how _x000D_
Chinese actions in the East and South China Seas affect, if at _x000D_
all, the balance of the United States-China bilateral _x000D_
relationship._x000D_
    In addition, I hope we will explore various options _x000D_
available to the United States to ensure that the situation in _x000D_
the East and South China Seas does not result in a conflict. I _x000D_
support efforts to constructively engage with China, including _x000D_
strengthening economic and trade ties._x000D_
    Yet simply defaulting to an approach that maintains _x000D_
cooperation while managing differences with China is not a _x000D_
successful formula, particularly when such management cedes _x000D_
United States influence and places American interests at risk _x000D_
in the Indo-Pacific._x000D_
    I am concerned that absent a course correction, _x000D_
specifically high-level and dedicated engagement from the _x000D_
United States Government to articulate a coherent China policy, _x000D_
our credibility will continue to suffer throughout the region, _x000D_
whether it is in regards to nonproliferation or preserving _x000D_
freedom of navigation in the East and South China Seas._x000D_
    I look forward to hearing from the witnesses and thank them _x000D_
for being here._x000D_

THE REEMERGENCE OF VACCINE-PREVENTABLE DISEASES: EXPLORING THE PUBLIC HEALTH SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES,2/10/2015,"    The Senate Committee on Health, Education, _x000D_
Labor, and Pensions will please come to order._x000D_
    This morning, we're holding a hearing about the reemergence _x000D_
of vaccine-preventable diseases. Senator Murray and I will each _x000D_
have an opening statement. Then we'll introduce our panel of _x000D_
witnesses. After our witness testimony, Senators will each have _x000D_
5 minutes of questions._x000D_
    We have two panels today and 2 hours for the hearing. We're _x000D_
going to end about noon. We'll have an hour for each panel, and _x000D_
I will end the first panel at 11 o'clock._x000D_
    From smallpox to polio, we have learned in the United _x000D_
States that vaccines save lives. Yet a troubling number of _x000D_
parents are not vaccinating their children. Last September, _x000D_
this committee held a hearing about the Ebola virus. Our _x000D_
witnesses included a brave physician, Dr. Kent Brantly, who _x000D_
worked in Liberia and who contracted Ebola, and a brave father _x000D_
in Sierra Leone who came to warn us about how rapidly the virus _x000D_
was spreading there._x000D_
    The number of people being infected with Ebola was doubling _x000D_
every 3 weeks, and many of those infected were dying, because _x000D_
for Ebola there was and is no cure, and there was and is no _x000D_
vaccine. This produced a near panic in the United States. It _x000D_
changed procedures in nearly every hospital and clinic. I _x000D_
remember one Chattanooga public health officer saying it's all _x000D_
Ebola all the time every day._x000D_
    In response, Congress appropriated more than $5 billion to _x000D_
fight the spread of the virus. The impact of efforts to fight _x000D_
Ebola is that the number of Ebola cases is declining. At the _x000D_
same time, here in the United States we are now experiencing a _x000D_
large outbreak of a disease for which we do have a vaccine._x000D_
    Measles used to sicken up to 4 million Americans each year. _x000D_
Many believed that it was an unpreventable childhood illness. _x000D_
But the introduction of a vaccine in 1963 changed everything. _x000D_
Measles was declared eliminated, meaning absence of continuous _x000D_
disease transmission for greater than 12 months from the United _x000D_
States in 2000._x000D_
    Then from 2001 to 2012, the median yearly number of measles _x000D_
cases reported in all of our country was 60. Today is February _x000D_
10, 2015. It is the 41st day of the year, and already we have _x000D_
seen more cases of measles than we would in a typical year._x000D_
    One measles outbreak in Palatine, IL, a suburb about a half _x000D_
hour from Chicago, has affected at least five babies, all less _x000D_
than 1 year old. Infants and individuals who are _x000D_
immunocompromised are traditionally protected by what is called _x000D_
herd immunity, meaning when more than 9 out of 10 of the people _x000D_
around them are vaccinated, so they don't get sick, and that _x000D_
keeps the babies and others who can't get vaccinated from _x000D_
getting sick. That herd immunity is incredibly important. _x000D_
Measles can cause life threatening complications in children, _x000D_
such as pneumonia or swelling of the brain._x000D_
    Our witnesses today will talk more not just about what is _x000D_
causing this outbreak, but why some parents are choosing not to _x000D_
vaccinate their children. Measles is only one example. This _x000D_
hearing, which was planned before the measles outbreak, reminds _x000D_
us of the importance of vaccines._x000D_
    An analysis of immunization rates across 13 States _x000D_
performed by USA Today found the following: Hundreds of _x000D_
thousands of students attend schools, ranging from small _x000D_
private academies in New York City to large public elementary _x000D_
schools outside Boston to Native American reservation schools _x000D_
in Idaho, where vaccination rates have dropped precipitously _x000D_
low, sometimes under 50 percent._x000D_
    California is 1 of the 20 States that allow parents to _x000D_
claim personal belief exemptions from vaccination requirements. _x000D_
In some areas of Los Angeles, 60 percent to 70 percent of _x000D_
parents at certain schools have filed a personal belief _x000D_
exemption. In those elementary schools, vaccination rates are _x000D_
as low as those in Chad or in South Sudan._x000D_
    The purpose of this hearing is to examine what is standing _x000D_
between healthy children and deadly diseases. It ought to be _x000D_
vaccinations. Too many parents are turning away from sound _x000D_
science. Sound science is this: Vaccines save lives._x000D_
    They save the lives of the people who are vaccinated. They _x000D_
protect the lives of the vulnerable around them, like infants _x000D_
and those who are ill. Vaccines save lives._x000D_
    They protect us from the ravages of awful diseases like _x000D_
polio, which invades the nervous system and can cause _x000D_
paralysis. I can remember as a child how parents were _x000D_
frightened by the prospect of polio for their child. I had _x000D_
classmates who lived in iron lungs. Our majority leader, _x000D_
Senator McConnell, contracted polio as a child._x000D_
    Whooping cough is another example, which causes thick mucus _x000D_
to accumulate in the airways and can make it difficult for _x000D_
babies to breathe; or diphtheria, a bacterial infection that _x000D_
affects the mucous membranes of your nose and throat and can, _x000D_
in advanced stages, damage your heart, kidneys, and nervous _x000D_
system._x000D_
    We have learned that vaccines save lives. They take deadly, _x000D_
awful, ravaging diseases from horror to history._x000D_
    It is troubling to hear that before we've even reached _x000D_
Valentine's Day this year, 121 Americans are sick with measles, _x000D_
a disease eliminated in the United States 15 years ago. It is _x000D_
troubling that a growing number of parents are not following _x000D_
the recommendations of doctors and public health professionals _x000D_
who have been making those recommendations for decades._x000D_
    At a time when we are standing on the cusp of medical _x000D_
breakthroughs never imagined--cutting-edge personalized _x000D_
medicine tailored to an individual's genome, for example--we _x000D_
find ourselves retreading old ground._x000D_

you and your staff for working with us to jointly invite the _x000D_
witnesses today. That always produces a better hearing and a _x000D_
good variety of views._x000D_
    Each witness will have up to 5 minutes._x000D_
    We'll ask you, Dr. Schuchat, if you'll summarize your views _x000D_
in 5 minutes so Senators can have a chance to ask questions._x000D_
    Then we'll take an hour. I said before some of the Senators _x000D_
came in that we'll have to end the first panel at 11 so we can _x000D_
get to the second panel, which will go on to 12. I hope all of _x000D_
us can get questions in to the first panel. If not, you'll be _x000D_
first in line on the second panel._x000D_
    Dr. Schuchat is the Director of the National Center for _x000D_
Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for _x000D_
Disease Control and Prevention. She has worked at CDC since _x000D_
1998 on immunization, respiratory, and other infectious _x000D_

THE REEMERGENCE OF VACCINE-PREVENTABLE DISEASES: EXPLORING THE PUBLIC HEALTH SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES,2/10/2015,"    Thanks, Dr. Schuchat. About 10 years ago, _x000D_
Senator Frist, our Senate majority leader, who was also a _x000D_
physician, led a group of us to South Africa, where we found _x000D_
the president of South Africa had rejected the science on HIV/_x000D_
AIDS. He decided it wasn't caused by a virus, and that the cure _x000D_
was the elimination of poverty, setting back South Africa for _x000D_
years in terms of its ability to deal with HIV/AIDS._x000D_
    Now, today, there's information that's on the internet, _x000D_
which is where we were told the South African president had _x000D_
found his information some years ago, that says there was a _x000D_
study published in The Lancet in 1998 by Andrew Wakefield _x000D_
alleging a connection between the measles, mumps, and rubella _x000D_
vaccine, MMR, and autism._x000D_
    Let's say you're a physician or pediatrician, and a parent _x000D_
comes in and says, ``I've been on the internet, and I'm _x000D_
concerned, because I found that according to this medical _x000D_
journal, there is a relationship between the measles and mumps _x000D_
vaccine and autism.'' What would you say to that parent?",corker

was just flat wrong.",corker

THE REEMERGENCE OF VACCINE-PREVENTABLE DISEASES: EXPLORING THE PUBLIC HEALTH SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES,2/10/2015,"    Because of the fraudulent behavior. We've _x000D_
been talking about a variety of vaccines. It struck me, as we _x000D_
were so worried about Ebola last fall--and we're still worried _x000D_
about it--that many of the public health people from Tennessee _x000D_
would point out to me that we had the flu season coming up. How _x000D_
many Americans die each year from the flu?",corker
THE REEMERGENCE OF VACCINE-PREVENTABLE DISEASES: EXPLORING THE PUBLIC HEALTH SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES,2/10/2015,"    Three-thousand to fifty-thousand could die _x000D_
from flu. Is there a vaccine for flu?",corker
THE REEMERGENCE OF VACCINE-PREVENTABLE DISEASES: EXPLORING THE PUBLIC HEALTH SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES,2/10/2015,"    Let's go back to measles for a minute. _x000D_
Measles is not just a runny nose, is it? It is a serious _x000D_
disease. What would you say to a parent who comes in and says, _x000D_
``I'm going to opt not to get the measles vaccine?'' What are _x000D_
the risks of that? How many children who contract measles die?",corker
THE REEMERGENCE OF VACCINE-PREVENTABLE DISEASES: EXPLORING THE PUBLIC HEALTH SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES,2/10/2015,"    Would it be accurate to say that if your _x000D_
child contracted measles in the United States, the chances of a _x000D_
death would be about 1 in 1,000?",corker

Department website says that U.S. immigration law requires _x000D_

THE REEMERGENCE OF VACCINE-PREVENTABLE DISEASES: EXPLORING THE PUBLIC HEALTH SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES,2/10/2015,"    Dr. Schuchat, thank you so much for your _x000D_
time. There are a couple of Senators who haven't had a chance _x000D_
to ask questions. I hope they will understand that we want to _x000D_
invite the second panel to come up now, and they will be the _x000D_
first ones up after the next 15 minutes of testimony._x000D_
    I'll now move ahead and introduce the second panel to save _x000D_
time, if I may. First, we'll hear from Dr. Kelly Moore. Dr. _x000D_
Moore is director of the Immunization Program at the Tennessee _x000D_
Department of Health. In this role, she is responsible for _x000D_
promoting proper use of recommended vaccines, as well as _x000D_
overseeing the response to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable _x000D_
disease._x000D_
    She has her undergraduate and medical degrees from _x000D_
Vanderbilt, and a master's of public health from Harvard School _x000D_
of Public Health. I'm completely objective, but the Tennessee _x000D_
Department of Public Health is one of the finest in the _x000D_
country._x000D_
    Dr. Mark Sawyer is professor of Clinical Pediatrics and a _x000D_
pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of _x000D_
California San Diego and Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego. _x000D_
He's also the medical director at San Diego Immunization _x000D_
Partnership and involved in a variety of immunization projects._x000D_
    Dr. Tim Jacks is a pediatrician and the father of two _x000D_

THE REEMERGENCE OF VACCINE-PREVENTABLE DISEASES: EXPLORING THE PUBLIC HEALTH SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES,2/10/2015,"    We have time, and I'm sure all of us would _x000D_
probably like to have a second round of questions._x000D_
    Dr. Moore, I believe you said that the case of measles in _x000D_
Tennessee was in Memphis, an adult in Memphis. Is that correct?",corker
THE REEMERGENCE OF VACCINE-PREVENTABLE DISEASES: EXPLORING THE PUBLIC HEALTH SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES,2/10/2015,    In west Tennessee.,corker
THE REEMERGENCE OF VACCINE-PREVENTABLE DISEASES: EXPLORING THE PUBLIC HEALTH SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES,2/10/2015,"    You described how you moved in quickly, and _x000D_
the number of people for just that one case that you had to be _x000D_
in touch with was how many?",corker
THE REEMERGENCE OF VACCINE-PREVENTABLE DISEASES: EXPLORING THE PUBLIC HEALTH SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES,2/10/2015,"    This is an area where the vaccination rate _x000D_
for measles is what?",corker
THE REEMERGENCE OF VACCINE-PREVENTABLE DISEASES: EXPLORING THE PUBLIC HEALTH SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES,2/10/2015,"    So it was high. Well, as Dr. Sawyer was _x000D_
talking earlier, I was thinking about the phrase, going viral, _x000D_
and then Dr. Jacks used it. This generation understands the _x000D_
idea of going viral._x000D_
    You're talking about measles flying through the air. That's _x000D_
unlike Ebola, that threw the country into a near--well, a _x000D_
complete panic, actually,--last fall, when Congress _x000D_
appropriated over $5 billion for Ebola-related efforts, and _x000D_
hospitals changed procedures. Ebola dominated what was going on _x000D_
in all the public health departments, yet it can only be spread _x000D_
through contact with bodily fluids. Measles flies through the _x000D_
air. This goes viral. This is a disease that goes viral._x000D_
    We Senators, in a bipartisan way, understand the problem of _x000D_
dealing with highly educated people who get bad information on _x000D_
the internet. That happens to us every day. We deal with that. _x000D_
We know what it is._x000D_
    Let's go back to the going viral. What if this person in _x000D_
west Tennessee, who Dr. Moore acted on quickly--what if that _x000D_
person had been discovered in a part of Los Angeles where 60 to _x000D_
70 percent of parents at certain schools have filed a personal _x000D_
belief exemption from immunization requirements. Describe the _x000D_
number of people and the multiplying of people that would have _x000D_
to be contacted to make certain that the disease didn't spread.",corker
THE REEMERGENCE OF VACCINE-PREVENTABLE DISEASES: EXPLORING THE PUBLIC HEALTH SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES,2/10/2015,"    You had 800 people, but then each of them _x000D_
might have infected someone else, right?",corker
THE REEMERGENCE OF VACCINE-PREVENTABLE DISEASES: EXPLORING THE PUBLIC HEALTH SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES,2/10/2015,"    So when you say ``flies through the air,'' we _x000D_
have an example of going viral in modern parlance, I suppose._x000D_
    Dr. Jacks, this may not be an exact comparison, but people _x000D_
ask me why I continued to play the piano when I was young, and _x000D_
I remember responding that I didn't remember my mother giving _x000D_
me a choice about it. I guess I had a choice. We're not talking _x000D_
about taking choices away today from parents._x000D_
    We are talking about a conversation between a pediatrician _x000D_
and a parent. How strongly do you recommend to parents that _x000D_
they vaccinate their children? I suppose the most persuasive _x000D_
thing you can do is tell them the story of your own children. _x000D_
Do you just make a neutral observation about it, or do you come _x000D_
to a conclusion and say, ``I think you should do it?''",corker
THE REEMERGENCE OF VACCINE-PREVENTABLE DISEASES: EXPLORING THE PUBLIC HEALTH SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES,2/10/2015,"    I'm out of time. I know in our State, years _x000D_
ago, my wife led an effort to establish a medical home for _x000D_
every child about to be born--prenatal healthcare. I assume _x000D_
anything in prenatal healthcare that allows a parent to know _x000D_
more about the value of vaccinations before the child is born _x000D_
is a very effective way to keep the vaccination rate high._x000D_

    Senator Murray, do you have closing remarks?",corker
THE REEMERGENCE OF VACCINE-PREVENTABLE DISEASES: EXPLORING THE PUBLIC HEALTH SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES,2/10/2015,"    I thank Senator Murray for her work and her _x000D_
staff's work in putting together such an extraordinary group of _x000D_
witnesses today. This has been very, very helpful, and not just _x000D_
to us, but to anyone who has been listening._x000D_
    Dr. Moore, we're, again, so proud of our public health _x000D_
department in Tennessee. I think back, not just on this, but on _x000D_
the quick reaction to the fungal meningitis episode, where your _x000D_
department saved lots of lives._x000D_
    Dr. Sawyer and Dr. Jacks, thank you for your leadership in _x000D_
your field and your testimony. The hope we have is that Dr. _x000D_
Jacks' message goes viral more rapidly than measles does, and _x000D_
that it goes fast._x000D_
    I have a hard time keeping my old Governor's hat off, and _x000D_
it makes me think of the importance of our State organizations. _x000D_
CDC really works through the States. The medical associations _x000D_
work through their legislatures and associations, and they're _x000D_
in touch with parents every day._x000D_
    We would like to take some step to solve this problem. The _x000D_
truth is, in my view, most of that reaction has to be with _x000D_
those who are closest to the parents and who see them _x000D_
regularly. The idea of a medical home for every child who is _x000D_
about to be born is probably the surest and best way for States _x000D_
to approach this, because parents who are talking to their _x000D_
pediatricians are going to make sure their children are _x000D_
vaccinated._x000D_
    I have some closing remarks I'm supposed to make._x000D_
    The hearing record will remain open for 10 days. Members _x000D_
may submit additional information and questions for the record _x000D_

REAUTHORIZING THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT: OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE STUDENT SUCCESS,8/5/2015,"    The Senate Committee on Health, Education, _x000D_
Labor, and Pensions will please come to order. This is our _x000D_
eighth hearing during this Congress on the reauthorization of _x000D_
the Higher Education Act._x000D_
    Senator Murray and I will each have an opening statement. _x000D_
Then we'll introduce our panel of witnesses. After our _x000D_
witnesses' testimony, Senators will have 5 minutes of questions _x000D_
each._x000D_
    We expect to have a vote at 10:30. We won't be deterred by _x000D_
that. We'll take turns with the gavel, so as long as Senators _x000D_
are here, we'll continue the line of questions so we don't slow _x000D_
things down._x000D_
    Today's hearing is really about finding out if there is a _x000D_
way the Federal Government can help more students finish _x000D_
college. Few students can afford to be stuck with debt and no _x000D_
degree, but that is what's happening to far too many college _x000D_
students. Federal aid programs are designed to help people _x000D_
working to earn a degree or a certificate in 1-, 2-, or 4-year _x000D_
programs._x000D_
    According to the National Student Clearinghouse, only 55 _x000D_
percent of any students complete a degree or certificate within _x000D_
6 years. The problem is even worse for low-income students: 8.6 _x000D_
million low-income students received Pell Grants from the _x000D_
Federal Government last year. Department of Education data says _x000D_
that only 45 percent of these students achieve a degree or _x000D_
certificate within 6 years._x000D_
    There are 7 million borrowers in default on their Federal _x000D_
student loans, and the Department of Education says that _x000D_
borrowers are three times more likely to be in this situation _x000D_
if they did not finish any degree or credential._x000D_
    We know that students who do not finish their program are _x000D_
less likely to benefit with a better job or salary._x000D_
    I'd like to briefly address today: Why are so many American _x000D_
college students leaving before they graduate? What role can _x000D_
the Federal Government play in, No. 1, encouraging students, _x000D_
particularly those receiving Pell Grants and other Federal _x000D_
financial aid, to finish what they've started; and, No. 2, _x000D_
encouraging colleges and universities to help their students _x000D_
make progress and graduate?_x000D_
    I'm going to submit my entire statement to the record, but _x000D_
let me summarize what it says._x000D_
    Why students aren't graduating seems to focus on these _x000D_
things:_x000D_
    Part-time enrollment and slow progress. Students with a _x000D_
full-time course load, meaning 15 credits per semester, who _x000D_
consistently enroll full-time are most likely to graduate. _x000D_
However, a 2013 survey of institutions showed the majority of _x000D_
so-called full-time college students aren't taking the credits _x000D_
needed to finish a 4-year degree for a bachelor's or in 2 years _x000D_
for an associate degree._x000D_
    Inadequate high school education. According to the _x000D_
Community College Research Center, most remedial students never _x000D_
get past remediation._x000D_
    Financial difficulties. Students from low-income _x000D_
backgrounds face pressures, making them more likely to drop _x000D_
out._x000D_
    What can the government do? Senator Bennet and I have _x000D_
offered a proposal to simplify the student aid application _x000D_
form, the FAFSA. Testimony before our committee said that it _x000D_
discourages as many as 2 million students from applying for _x000D_
Federal financial aid. Many students continue working or have _x000D_
to get a job while they're in school._x000D_
    Two years ago, Austin Peay State University in Clarksville _x000D_
testified at this committee about the success it has had with _x000D_
remedial education. Half of Austin Peay students need to take _x000D_
remedial courses once they're enrolled. The university _x000D_
redesigned its remedial education so that students who lack _x000D_
some skills in math, reading, or writing enroll in credit-_x000D_
bearing college courses with additional required workshops to _x000D_
help them catch up._x000D_
    Before using this approach, only 10 percent of the remedial _x000D_
math students ever completed a college-level math class. _x000D_
Seventy percent do now._x000D_
    A maximum Pell is often awarded to a student who is really _x000D_
not attending full-time. That's one reason. Federal aid does _x000D_
not encourage students to complete their degree as quickly as _x000D_
they can._x000D_
    Second--and your testimony reflects this--Federal aid _x000D_
progress requirements seem to lack teeth._x000D_
    Third, Federal aid today can be used to subsidize studies _x000D_
unfocused toward the degree. A student can use the Pell grant _x000D_
to take 90 credits, as many as 90, for a 60-credit associate's _x000D_
degree. The longer a student takes, the less likely they are to _x000D_
finish. Taking classes that get students off course from their _x000D_
goal could be detrimental to completion._x000D_
    Federal policy has emphasized access rather than _x000D_
completion. We are looking to see whether we need to find ways _x000D_
to encourage over 6,000 higher education institutions to _x000D_
prioritize and encourage student success without throwing a _x000D_
big, wet blanket of a Federal mandate that smothers _x000D_
universities, that might work at Austin Peay but might not work _x000D_
at the University of Maryland, that might be good at Yeshiva _x000D_
but might not be good at Harvard._x000D_

thank you for coming.",corker

    The vote was changed to 2 o'clock. So we won't have that _x000D_
interruption this morning due to the vote on the Senate floor._x000D_
    Our first witness today is Stan Jones, president and _x000D_
founder of Complete College America. His organization partners _x000D_
with States with a goal of substantially increasing the number _x000D_
of Americans with a postsecondary credential. Prior to founding _x000D_
Complete College America, he served 16 years in the Indiana _x000D_
legislature, was a senior advisor to Governor Bayh, and was _x000D_
Indiana Commissioner for Higher Education for a decade._x000D_
    Dr. Scott Ralls, president of North Carolina Community _x000D_
College System, is our next witness. This system serves almost _x000D_
830,000 people annually. During the last 10 years, over 40 _x000D_
percent of North Carolina's wage earners have been students at _x000D_
one of the State's 58 community colleges. Next month, Dr. Ralls _x000D_
will assume the presidency of Northern Virginia Community _x000D_
College System._x000D_
    Our next witness is Dr. Timothy Renick, vice provost, _x000D_
professor, and vice president for Enrollment Management and _x000D_
Student Success at Georgia State University. Over the past _x000D_
decade, Georgia State has doubled the number of at-risk _x000D_
students enrolled, but, more importantly, improved graduation _x000D_
rates by 22 percentage points and closed achievement gaps based _x000D_
on race and income._x000D_
    Both Senator Burr and Senator Isakson had hoped to be here _x000D_
and may still be here. They're in a Finance Committee meeting _x000D_
and wanted me to say that to both of you._x000D_
    Our final witness is Dr. Lashawn Richburg-Hayes, director _x000D_
for Young Adults and Postsecondary Education at MDRC, a _x000D_
nonprofit, nonpartisan policy research organization in New York _x000D_
City. Dr. Richburg-Hayes focuses her work on academic _x000D_
achievement and persistence for low-income students at _x000D_
community colleges and less selected 4-year colleges. She has _x000D_
overseen some of the most rigorous experiments on how financial _x000D_
aid can be provided to students in ways that cause them to _x000D_
change their behaviors in order to succeed in school._x000D_
    I look forward to everyone's testimony. If each of you _x000D_
would summarize your comments in about 5 minutes, that'll leave _x000D_
more time for us to have a conversation with you in our _x000D_

_x000D_
 STATEMENT OF LASHAWN RICHBURG-HAYES, Ph.",corker
REAUTHORIZING THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT: OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE STUDENT SUCCESS,8/5/2015,"    Thank you. We'll begin those questions now _x000D_
with a round of 5-minute questions for Senators._x000D_
    One of the tempting things to do when you hear great _x000D_
stories of success like this is to say, ``OK. That sounds good. _x000D_
Let's just make everybody do it.'' That usually isn't the right _x000D_
thing to do, even as impressive as Georgia State's progress has _x000D_
been._x000D_
    One question might be: Should we require, should we _x000D_
encourage, should we change something about the Federal _x000D_
requirement that you've got to take 12 hours to qualify for a _x000D_
student grant or a student loan when there's so much evidence _x000D_
that if you take--if that puts you on a track to taking more _x000D_
time than 4 years or 2 years or 1 year to get your certificate, _x000D_
is there something wrong with requiring Federal student aid to _x000D_
be based upon 15 credits instead of 12?_x000D_
    Or if there's something wrong with that, is there some way _x000D_
we could encourage colleges to do that? Why aren't more _x000D_
colleges and institutions doing that? I know in Tennessee, once _x000D_
they focused on student success, they were wise enough to let _x000D_
different campuses do it different ways. Austin Peay focused on _x000D_
remediation, as you talked about. UT Knoxville told its _x000D_
students that you may take 12 hours if you want to, but you're _x000D_
going to pay for 15, and they began to see an immediate _x000D_
increase in the number of students who took 15 hours._x000D_
    What should we do about that, and what should we not do _x000D_
about it?_x000D_
    Mr. Jones.",corker
REAUTHORIZING THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT: OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE STUDENT SUCCESS,8/5/2015,"    You're right. We spend $130 billion a year in _x000D_
grants and loans. If we make a single change like that, it _x000D_
affects millions of students and 6,000 institutions. What's the _x000D_
down side of that?",corker
REAUTHORIZING THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT: OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE STUDENT SUCCESS,8/5/2015,    Let me ask Mr. Ralls.,corker
REAUTHORIZING THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT: OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE STUDENT SUCCESS,8/5/2015,"    So you'd leave that to the State system, for _x000D_
example, to make judgments about that?",corker
REAUTHORIZING THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT: OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE STUDENT SUCCESS,8/5/2015,"    Let me ask about remediation. There's been a _x000D_
shift in that over the last 30 years, at least, that I've seen. _x000D_
In our State, we thought we'd made great progress to say, ``You _x000D_
may come to the community college, but if you're not prepared _x000D_
for it, you don't get credit for the courses you take.''_x000D_
    Based upon your testimony, Mr. Jones, that's sort of a _x000D_
bridge to nowhere. Only 1 in 10 remedial students will ever _x000D_
graduate._x000D_
    The Austin Peay experience took a different approach, as I _x000D_
understand it, and said, ``Come on in if you need remedial _x000D_
help, and we'll just find other ways to help you succeed,'' and _x000D_
they had a great success story from that._x000D_
    Dr. Renick, what's your advice about how we deal with _x000D_
remediation? Are there any changes in Federal policy or _x000D_
incentives that we should include in the Higher Education Act?",corker

    Senator Murray, do you have any further thoughts?",corker
REAUTHORIZING THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT: OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE STUDENT SUCCESS,8/5/2015,"    This has been a very helpful hearing and a _x000D_
reminder about how big and complex and diverse our system of _x000D_
higher education is. It makes me think, with all these really _x000D_
good ideas, 75 percent, 76 percent of our students go to public _x000D_
2-year schools, 4-year schools, and they have legislators and _x000D_
Governors and Higher Education Commission members and _x000D_
university presidents and board of trustees all rushing around _x000D_
to meet with one another to find out what North Carolina is _x000D_
doing._x000D_
    I know I used to--when I was Governor, I'd go see Bill _x000D_
Friday, and I'd try to learn everything I could about North _x000D_
Carolina's higher education system. I'm sure that Dr. Renick _x000D_
has seen a great many of our other institutions work to adopt _x000D_
his progress._x000D_
    Senator Warren is right. We spend a lot of money here, and _x000D_
we have a chance here in the next few months to make sure we _x000D_
spend it wisely to create an environment in which you can do _x000D_
more of what you're doing without imposing on you what might be _x000D_
a very good idea that works here but doesn't necessarily work _x000D_
there and not to tar you with predatory practices that might _x000D_
exist in other places._x000D_
    As you followup this hearing, if you have thoughts that _x000D_
you'd like to suggest to us about ways to adjust our system of _x000D_
financial aid so that we can encourage the kind of student _x000D_
success that so many States have been adopting over the last _x000D_
few years really on their own, if there's an appropriate way _x000D_
for us to do that, we certainly ought to consider it. If there _x000D_
are things that you think we should definitely not do that _x000D_
would get in the way of letting that happen, I'd like to hear _x000D_
that as well._x000D_
    The hearing record will remain open for 10 days to submit _x000D_
additional comments and any questions for the record that _x000D_
Senators may have. We plan to hold the next HELP hearing in _x000D_

REAUTHORIZING THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT: COMBATING CAMPUS SEXUAL ASSAULT,7/29/2015,"    Senator Murray, do you have additional _x000D_
questions and comments?",corker
REAUTHORIZING THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT: COMBATING CAMPUS SEXUAL ASSAULT,7/29/2015,"    Thank you, Senator Murray. I should add that _x000D_
this has been a priority of Senator Murray's from the day we _x000D_
started working together, and she's going to continue to focus _x000D_
on campus safety. We're thinking about a hearing coming up soon _x000D_
on that._x000D_
    I have three questions I'd like to ask the panel, and the _x000D_
answers can come later. If you have something you'd like to say _x000D_
about it now, I'd welcome it._x000D_
    Question No. 1 goes back to what I said a little earlier. _x000D_
Government has a way of expressing its concern in laws, rules, _x000D_
and regulations that aren't as efficient as the concern is _x000D_
real. In other words, we sometimes duplicate, and we sometimes _x000D_
cause campuses to spend more time filling out forms than _x000D_
working with students to, for example, have a session informing _x000D_
incoming freshmen about what their responsibilities are._x000D_
    Let me ask this. Would each of you be willing to give us _x000D_
specific suggestions about how you see title IX and its rules _x000D_
and regulations, the Clery Act and the new regulations--how _x000D_
they could be improved, where they conflict, how they could be _x000D_
made clearer so that campuses would have the flexibility that _x000D_
you talked about, President Napolitano? I didn't know quite _x000D_
what title to give you, but I'll call you President Napolitano._x000D_
    Would you be willing to do that and to give it to us in as _x000D_
specific form as you could? If you have any comment you'd like _x000D_
to make about that, I'd be glad to have that.",corker
REAUTHORIZING THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT: COMBATING CAMPUS SEXUAL ASSAULT,7/29/2015,"    The University of California--I know that _x000D_
through your system, you're so large and such a good system _x000D_
that, you're bound to have plenty of people who are wading _x000D_
through all the Federal rules and regulations._x000D_
    Just tell us, ``We don't know what this means, and this _x000D_
duplicates this.'' You've been in so many different positions, _x000D_
as Governor and here--you know exactly what I'm talking about, _x000D_
particularly, on behalf of all the colleges and universities. _x000D_
We need that by around September in order to be able to include _x000D_
it in the reauthorization act if there's something that we need _x000D_
to do.",corker
REAUTHORIZING THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT: COMBATING CAMPUS SEXUAL ASSAULT,7/29/2015,    Yes.,corker
REAUTHORIZING THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT: COMBATING CAMPUS SEXUAL ASSAULT,7/29/2015,"    That's a reasonable request. Several of us on _x000D_
the committee asked a distinguished group headed by the _x000D_
chancellors of Maryland and Vanderbilt to look at, generally, _x000D_
simplifying our education rules and regulations and making them _x000D_
more effective._x000D_
    One of their findings was that every one of our 6,000 _x000D_
colleges and universities gets, on average, every work day, one _x000D_
new guidance or rule. I will ask the department not to do that, _x000D_
especially while we're in the midst of the reauthorization of _x000D_
the Higher Education Act._x000D_
    The other observation to make as a part of that is that _x000D_
only 15 percent of the colleges are private universities. We _x000D_
often think about those. There's a difference between Nashville _x000D_
Auto Diesel College and UCLA in terms of what we might be _x000D_
thinking about doing. We need to keep that diversity in mind._x000D_
    A second question I would ask you--one college president, a _x000D_
very accomplished one--she's been president of three different _x000D_
colleges--when I asked her what we should do about this, she _x000D_
said,_x000D_
_x000D_
          ``You should focus on helping campuses better _x000D_
        coordinate with law enforcement agencies, but do not _x000D_
        turn colleges into law enforcement agencies.''_x000D_
_x000D_
    Do you have any comment on that?_x000D_
    Ms. Stafford, I would think you might.",corker
REAUTHORIZING THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT: COMBATING CAMPUS SEXUAL ASSAULT,7/29/2015,"    The last question I would have is this. What _x000D_
can we do or not do to make sure that colleges establish _x000D_
procedures dealing with sexual assault that are fair and _x000D_
protect the due process rights of both the accused and the _x000D_
accuser? What should we keep in mind as we work on that issue?",corker
