       INVESTIGATE RUSSIA'S INVOLVEMENT IN OUR NATIONAL ELECTIONS

  (Mr. GARAMENDI asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I remember well the investigations that 
Congress undertook in the Nixon period--the Watergate investigations.
  Frankly, I am appalled at the way in which this House is conducting 
its investigations. It is high time that we have an independent 
investigation.

[[Page H2769]]

  The reality has changed since the sixties and seventies. We now have 
24-7 cable TV, and everything seems to be momentarily disclosed. We 
can't continue. We need an independent investigation of this extremely 
important issue of Russia's involvement in our national elections.
