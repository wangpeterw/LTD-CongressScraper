                 POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS AWARENESS MONTH

  (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the month of 
June as National Post-Traumatic Stress Awareness Month.
  Millions of our Nation's heroes experience post-traumatic stress upon 
returning home from their service. Invisible wounds like PTS are just 
as important and worthy of treatment as physical injuries. Seeking help 
for PTS is not a sign of weakness or defeat, but a show of strength and 
commitment to a full and healthy life.
  Treating PTS is not a one-size-fits-all process either. Our veterans 
need options to find the treatments that work best for their unique 
needs. That is why I am proud my legislation, the COVER Act, has been 
signed into law and will help increase access to evidence-based 
alternative therapies at the VA.
  For National PTS Awareness Month, I stand committed to serving our 
Nation's heroes and improving their treatment options.
