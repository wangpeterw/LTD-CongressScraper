                     CONGRATULATING ELIZABETH DENT

  (Mr. ADERHOLT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, today I rise to recognize the tremendous 
work of Elizabeth Dent, who has been an invaluable part of the staff of 
the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture for the past 3 
years. Elizabeth came to work with the subcommittee I chair after 
working several years with a former appropriator, Congressman Jack 
Kingston.
  Elizabeth has been a valuable member of the subcommittee team. She is 
diligent, dedicated, and keen to details, something that is very 
important to the appropriations work.
  She is always eager to volunteer and lend a hand to accomplish 
whatever tasks may be needed in assisting in the agricultural 
community. She has become an integral part of the team, and she will be 
greatly missed on our subcommittee.
  Elizabeth will be leaving the House Appropriations Subcommittee on 
Agriculture to work for the Senate Agriculture Appropriations 
Committee. I thank her for her outstanding work. The Senate 
Appropriations Committee is very fortunate to have her work on the 
staff. We wish her all the very best, and we look forward to working 
with her in her new capacity.
