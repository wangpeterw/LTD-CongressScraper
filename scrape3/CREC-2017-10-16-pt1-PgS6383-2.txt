                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal Lord God, we bless Your Holy Name. Provide our lawmakers with 
the wisdom to obey You completely and receive Your guidance. May Your 
guiding presence inspire them so that they can find, even in troubles, 
opportunities for joy.
  Lord, remind them of the blessings that come from being challenged, 
as they learn from experience that the things that test them produce 
endurance. When their endurance is fully developed, give them the 
satisfaction of possessing such integrity that their faith will not 
shrink, though pressed by many foes.
  Lord, help our Senators to seek You repeatedly each day with their 
prayers, fully expecting You to answer their intercession and direct 
their lives.
  We pray in Your mighty Name. Amen.
