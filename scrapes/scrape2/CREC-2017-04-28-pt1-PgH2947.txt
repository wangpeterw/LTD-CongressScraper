           HEALTH PLAN NEEDS TO COVER PREEXISTING CONDITIONS

  (Ms. ROSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. ROSEN. Mr. Speaker, the GOP is trying to pull a fast one over 
working families. This week, House Republicans and President Trump gave 
into extreme demands of the Freedom Caucus by colluding on a dangerous 
amendment that would gut protections for individuals with preexisting 
conditions, allowing insurers to once again discriminate against sick 
Americans.
  We all know that the ACA isn't perfect, but we cannot, in good 
conscience, throw out essential health benefits that have helped 
working families to get the protections that they need.
  The MacArthur amendment would take us back to the days before these 
key protections helped save lives. Without protections for preexisting 
conditions, my constituents with serious illnesses and health 
conditions would face discrimination from insurance companies solely 
based on their illness.
  How can Speaker Ryan seriously tell Americans that this plan is 
somehow better for people with preexisting conditions? We need a health 
plan that will help working families pay for their health coverage, not 
one that puts health insurance out of reach.
