                HONORING LIEUTENANT FREDERICK DELLECKER

  (Mr. YOHO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the loss of a 
Floridian, a patriot, and one of the Air Force's finest.
  Two weeks ago, three servicemembers were lost in a crash of a 
reconnaissance and surveillance plane in New Mexico. These young men 
were not just servicemembers serving in our United States Air Force; 
they were sons, brothers, husbands, and fathers.
  In particular, Florida's own Lieutenant Frederick Dellecker, a 
dedicated first lieutenant, had a long and promising career ahead of 
him. Lieutenant Dellecker was 26 and known amongst his friends for his 
legendary humor.
  As a veterinarian, I was particularly touched by Lieutenant 
Dellecker's love of animals. His friends and family recently revealed 
that, while in pilot training, Lieutenant Dellecker once shared a 
hotdog with a flea-bitten stray who had just delivered a litter of 
puppies and was starving. He ended up taking her in and giving her a 
second chance at a new life.
  I would like to take a moment on behalf of all Americans and all of 
the Members here today to thank him and his family for their service.
  Lieutenant Frederick Dellecker, your name will not be forgotten.
