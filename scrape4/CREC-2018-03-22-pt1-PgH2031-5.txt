        NEW HARTFORD, NEW YORK, CELEBRATES ITS 230TH ANNIVERSARY

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 230th 
anniversary of the settlement of my hometown, New Hartford, New York.
  New Hartford was settled in early 1877 by Jedediah Sanger, who was in 
search of the American Dream. By 1789, Jedediah had brought his entire 
family to New Hartford and built a sawmill and gristmill. The village 
began to flourish with farmers who provided New Hartford and the 
surrounding communities with fresh produce and a variety of dairy 
products.
  Today, the town of New Hartford strives to maintain Jedediah Sanger's 
original vision and ideas. It is home to numerous retail stores, 
restaurants, and churches, while remaining an extremely civic-minded 
and generous community.
  In fact, our own New Hartford Central School District, my alma mater 
and the same school from which my son graduated from 30 years later, 
consistently ranks as one of the very best schools in New York State 
and among the top public schools in the country.
  Fun fact: I actually live across the street from the house I grew up 
in, my childhood home, and I now live in a home that I purchased from 
our former Congressman, Alexander Pirnie, who once served in this great 
Chamber.
  Please join me in honoring and celebrating the 230th anniversary of 
New Hartford, New York.
