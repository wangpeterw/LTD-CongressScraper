                              THE TAX SCAM

  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, Franklin Roosevelt was a great President of 
the United States. He said once: ``The test of our progress is not 
whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much, it is 
whether we provide enough for those who have too little.'' That is 
still true today for people who follow morality and Judeo-Christian 
thought.
  Yesterday in Missouri, the President said that the tax bill, which is 
in the Senate now--and unfortunately passed this House--would not 
benefit him at all. He said: Believe me, it won't benefit me.
  You can't believe that. It benefits the billionaires, the 
millionaires, and the wealthy, and that is what it is about. The 
disparity in wealth in this country is growing and growing, and we 
can't continue to have that. The middle class needs major tax relief, 
and the wealthy don't. We could draw a bill to do that, and we could do 
it together.
  Our country is in danger. We need more help in the inner cities to 
fight crime. We need help all over to fight against natural disasters. 
People all over our country need help.
  As Paul Simon said: A nation turns its lonely eyes to you. Jeff 
Flake, Bob Corker, and John McCain, save America.
