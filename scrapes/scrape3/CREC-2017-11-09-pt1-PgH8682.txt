         HONORING THE LIFE, SERVICE, AND HEROISM OF JACK HENLEY

  (Mr. GIANFORTE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, with Veterans Day approaching, I want to 
recognize the life, service, and heroism of Jack Henley from Hamilton, 
Montana.
  Jack was on the front lines in the Second World War. During the 
battle in the Philippines, he led a squad of men through heavy fire to 
fill a gap in the line, without losing a single man. He twice reentered 
the field of fire to save the lives of two wounded men.
  For his actions, Jack earned the Silver Star and the Purple Heart. He 
reenlisted in 1948, training troops for the Korean war. Jack continued 
to serve in the Army Reserve until 1984.
  During his 28 years of service, he was awarded 18 medals and 
decorations. His name is included in the Hall of Valor here in 
Washington, D.C.

  I am proud to have this man as a fellow Montanan, and I am honored to 
recognize his extraordinary life. May we always remember Jack's story 
and those of all our Nation's veterans.
