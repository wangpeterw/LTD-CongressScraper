                       NOMINATION OF RYAN NELSON

  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on another matter, I would like to offer a 
few words of support for the nomination of Ryan Nelson to be the 
Solicitor for the Department of Interior.
  Mr. Nelson has a distinguished legal background. He has worked in 
both the private and public sector, including in all three branches of 
the Federal Government. Most importantly, he is respected by those 
members of the Idaho State Bar who know him best.
  He has been endorsed by numerous colleagues representing a broad 
spectrum of political views. Mr. Nelson's exemplary legal background 
makes him ideally suited to serve as the Department of Interior's 
Solicitor, and we owe the people of Utah and the West the opportunity 
to confirm him at once.
  Once confirmed, I am very eager to work with Mr. Nelson and Secretary 
Ryan Zinke to continue a shared mission of restoring trust between the 
Federal Government and the people of the West.
  There have been some marvelous changes this year, and there will be 
even more if we could just work together and quit all the bumbling 
around here as though we hate each other. I am grateful for my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I believe we have made important 
strides this year, and I think we can make even more. I am grateful for 
what we have been able to get done this year.
  I yield the floor.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.
  Mr. CASEY. Thank you, Mr. President.
  I ask to speak in morning business.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized.
