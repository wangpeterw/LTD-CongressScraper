                        REMEMBERING GRANDMA EDNA

  (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, June 28, 1911, the day my dear grandmother, 
Edna Yoder, was born, has been a special day in my life. Each year, for 
the last 6 years, I have come to the floor to wish her a happy 
birthday. Last year, she celebrated her 105th birthday. Sadly, today 
would have been her 106th, but Grandma Edna passed away recently, and I 
miss her terribly.
  She was a sweet, loving, and strong grandmother. She had an 
infectious laugh, an enormous love of family, and a deep belief in her 
faith. She was a symbol of everything that was great about America's 
Greatest Generation.
  She was also a true example of what makes America a strong and 
vibrant nation: working tirelessly every day on the farm, milking cows 
at dawn, and bringing in the wheat harvest in the hot Kansas sun. I 
like to say she had a front row seat on the journey that was the great 
American century.
  Mr. Speaker, today, I want Grandma to know that we love her, we miss 
her, and we know that she is at peace with the Lord in Heaven.
