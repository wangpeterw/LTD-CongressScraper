                       RECOGNIZING OPHELIA GAINES

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
remarkable career of Mrs. Ophelia Gaines, who will retire as executive 
director of Concerted Services on June 30, 2017.
  Mrs. Gaines' career with Concerted Services, a nonprofit action group 
that focuses on fighting poverty throughout 28 counties in southeast 
Georgia, has spanned nearly 44 years.
  Mrs. Gaines began her work with the company in 1973, traveling door 
to door in low-income communities, educating families on how to enroll 
in programs like Head Start, Energy Assistance, and Senior Nutrition.
  Mrs. Gaines' altruistic career continued with her decision to teach 
social work classes at both Georgia Southern University and Savannah 
State University, enabling young people to carry on her work throughout 
southeast Georgia.
  I am proud to rise today to recognize Mrs. Gaines, and thank her for 
all of her outstanding contributions to our local communities and to 
the lives of our fellow Georgians.
