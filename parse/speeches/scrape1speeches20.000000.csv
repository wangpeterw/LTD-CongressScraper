4320,topic-id,364,"Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the Tennessee General Assembly's proclamation recognizing the city of Kingsport, TN, centennial celebration.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                          Kingsport Centennial       Whereas, it is fitting that the members of this legislative      body should pause in their deliberations to recognize and      honor those venerable communities of this State that are      marking special occasions in their histories; and       Whereas, the new city of Kingsport was incorporated in      1917, using the historical name of a nearby town that was      previously incorporated in 1822 but lost its charter after      the Civil War; and       Whereas, Kingsport is the first thoroughly diversified,      professionally planned, and privately financed city in      twentieth-century America; and       Whereas, Kingsport was the first city in Tennessee, and one      of the first in the nation, to adopt the ``model city      charter'' establishing a city manager form of government; and       Whereas, Kingsport was produced by the marriage of New      South philosophy and Progressivism, born at a time when      capitalists turned their attention to Southern Appalachia;      and       Whereas, the seeds planted in 1917 grew to become the      corporate headquarters of Eastman, a Fortune 300 company with      a significant global presence that has provided economic      opportunity for generations of Tennesseans; and       Whereas, early founders coined the term ``Kingsport      Spirit'' to describe the work ethic, can-do attitude, and      caring culture that are still widely prevalent today; and       Whereas, Kingsport continues to be a leader in innovation      and collaboration to redefine the economic future of      Tennessee and Tennesseans; and       Whereas, on this milestone occasion, it is fitting that we      recognize and honor the city of Kingsport and its residents:      Now, therefore,       I, Randy McNally, Speaker of the Senate of the One Hundred      Tenth General Assembly of the State of Tennessee, at the      request of and in conjunction with Senator Jon Lundberg, do      hereby proclaim that we honor and commend the fine citizens      of Kingsport as they celebrate their city's centennial and      extend to them our best wishes for continued success and      prosperity in the future.

As a longtime resident of the area, Dessey graduated from Georgia Southern University and served in the United States Army from 1959 to 1965.  I was fortunate enough to work for him and with him during my 35-year career in construction and the development industry. I had the opportunity to serve alongside him in the Augusta Exchange Club and sit in front of him on Sundays at Trinity on the Hill United Methodist  Dessey was a husband, a father, a grandfather, a friend, and a mentor to many in our community. He and his wife, Barbara, lost two of their children at a young age, and Dessey was the rock that held that family together.  Mr.Speaker, I have recently lost two of my heroes: Arnold Palmer in September and Dessey Kuhlke last week. But through the loss, I can't help but smile when I think about the possibility of those two getting together with family in Heaven and playing a round of golf. Augusta is a better place because of Dessey We will remember him often.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-02-pt1-PgH887-4.txt,2239,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017.0,2.0,April

4348,topic-id,348,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my distinguished colleague for his leadership on this very important issue.  I have made the statement often when I ran for this office that I ran to change not only the course for this country, but the culture of It is my strong belief that we cannot change the course in any meaningful way without changing the culture.  So I want to, again, thank my colleague, Mike Gallagher, for his leadership in rallying the freshman class, both Republicans and Democrats, on an issue that I think, because of this unique time in the history of our country, a time that I think calls for bold action, he is seizing the opportunity and heeding that call on behalf of our freshman class. And so I am deeply grateful for his courageous leadership.  Our country, the greatest experiment in liberty and democracy, was conceived by men of great principle; men who were committed to leading, to governing; and, yes--and I know this isn't popular--to compromising; making difficult decisions and putting the Nation's interest above their own personal interest. They were also men who never envisioned a lifelong career in politics.  In 1819, only 1 percent of Representatives had served over 16 years. Now, 20 percent of Representatives have served over 16 years. The current scenario where Members of Congress serve for 15, 20, even 30 years, is inconsistent with the Founders' view of citizen statesmen. We need an environment that encourages politicians to do what is right not by their party or some special interest, and certainly not to secure their long-term career goals, but to do what is right for their fellow countrymen.  I think passing legislation to implement term limits across the board is a good step in the right direction. I am grateful to be a part of this body and a part of this freshman class. It is such a unique time in our Nation's history.  We need to go big; we need to go bold; or we need to go home.  So thank you for the opportunity, Mr.Speaker, and my distinguished colleague.

4340,topic-id,396,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank my friend from Wisconsin for organizing this. He is a wonderful freshman Member of the class.  I rise today in support of congressional term limits.  In 1846, when then-Congressman Abraham Lincoln was elected to the U.House of Representatives, he was part of a freshman class that made up one half of the 35th In other words, half of the Congress were new Members when he got elected. Today, in the 115th Congress, our freshmen class of 55 Members make up less than 20 percent of this body. But here is a more stark number.  In the last election, 97 percent of House incumbents won reelection--97 percent. Only 3 percent of the challengers defeated an incumbent. I was fortunate to be one of the exceptions to these overwhelming odds.  Since Abraham Lincoln, our country has grown, this institution has grown, and so has the length of time Members stay here. As a person who is new to Congress and is new to politics, I can tell you the reason why congressional favorability ratings are now at 8 percent. Our constituents feel that we have lost touch. The longer we stay here in Congress and don't cycle back to our home districts, the more out of touch we are perceived.  To restore America's trust in Congress, we must institute term limits. Our Forefathers intended the House of Representatives to be an arm of government closest to the people, and to be the purest embodiment of a representative democracy. Members of the people's House were to come from different walks of life and careers to better shape the direction of our great country. Members of Congress were to feel obligated to serve by a sense of civic duty rather than a desire to pursue a career in public office. We have lost sight of this intent.  The American people deserve new ideas from new faces here in This is the principal reason why I am here today with this great honor bestowed on me from the people of Nebraska's Second Congressional term limits would ensure that we send more successful farmers, successful teachers, business leaders, doctors, nurses, and veterans to Washington so that we can address problems with a firsthand perspective.

4375,topic-id,1283,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today because we are at a decisive and consequential moment in the We are here to consider the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be a Justice of the U.Supreme  Will Democrat Senators vote to have a well-qualified, mainstream Justice who stands for the rule of law, or will the extreme leftwing of that party continue to try to call the shots? That is a decision Members are going to have to make.  America needs judges who can follow the law, apply the law, have the highest ethical standards, and value the independence of our courts. To me, that is a description of Judge That is him in a nutshell. We saw it throughout his career, and we saw it again at his confirmation hearings in the Judiciary  Democrats on the committee asked him to answer hypothetical questions. They asked about issues that are probably going to be coming before the Supreme Court of the land. There are ethics rules that say that judges and nominees cannot answer those kinds of questions and, of course, Judge Gorsuch followed the rules. That is exactly what other nominees have done in the past who were nominated by Republican Presidents and Democratic  Ruth Bader Ginsburg did so in her confirmation hearing in 1993. She said: ``A judge sworn to decide impartially can offer no forecasts, no hints.'' She said this would display disdain for the entire judicial process. Of course, she was confirmed and sits on the Court today. It has been known as the Ginsburg standard, and every nominee since her nomination hearing has followed that same standard. That is what Justice Gorsuch did.  The Democrats on the Judiciary Committee tried to criticize Judge Gorsuch for some of his opinions that they didn't like. They talked about a couple of cases where the person who was on the losing side in the case was sympathetic. They suggested that the Court should have ignored the law and sided with ``the little guy'' in the involved cases. Judge Gorsuch pointed out that judges are absolutely not supposed to consider what they think is sympathetic. They are supposed to rule on the law. Federal judges actually swear an oath ``to administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich.''  Most Senators recognize that judges should be impartial. The minority leader, Senator Schumer, has actually spoken about how important this is. At the confirmation hearing for Justice Sonia Sotomayor in 2009, nominated by President Obama, Senator Schumer praised the way she put the ``rule of law above everything else.'' He said that she followed the texts of statutes, ``even when doing so results in rulings that go against so-called sympathetic litigants.'' That was in 2009. Now it is 2017, and that is the identical standard Judge Gorsuch has continued to follow.  Judge Gorsuch pointed out that it is his job to apply the law, not to write the law. Writing laws is the job of We are not here to select the 101st Senator; we are here to select a Justice for the Supreme We are selecting a Justice for the most important Court in the land, and it is important and imperative that we take this decision seriously and that we set aside any partisan grudges.  Democrats who want to filibuster this judge are not arguing any principle here. Reasonable individuals know this nominee deserves to be confirmed.  One lawyer wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post on March 8, a board member of the very liberal American Constitution He wrote that ``there is no principled reason'' to vote against Judge Well, he is exactly right.  I listened to the arguments Democrats made in the confirmation hearing. I was not convinced. If any of my colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle are undecided about how to vote, I suggest they go back and look and listen to the hearings as well and look at what other people have said about this nominee.  A Chicago Tribune editorial said that confirmation hearing revealed ``unassailable assurances by Gorsuch that he would decide each case on the merits, based on the law as written, applied to the world as it is today.''  The Detroit news agreed. It said that Judge Gorsuch showed that he is a ``deeply knowledgeable nominee who should be confirmed by the Senate.''  On Monday, USA TODAY had their own headline. It said, ``On the Merits, Gorsuch Merits Confirmation.''  The American Bar Association surveyed 5,000 people who have worked with Judge Gorsuch over the years. These people described him using words like ``brilliant,'' ``thoughtful,'' and ``really, really, really smart.''  The Bar Association also found that ``Judge Gorsuch believes strongly in the independence'' of the judiciary. This is the Bar The American Bar Association predicted that ``he will be a strong but respectful voice in protecting it.'' The group ended up giving him its highest possible rating. Interestingly, Senator Schumer once called this group ``the gold standard'' for evaluating judges--``the gold standard,'' he called it--and they have given him their highest possible rating. So why does the minority[[Page S2306]]leader think the gold standard is not good enough anymore?  Judge Gorsuch was even introduced at his confirmation hearing by a former top lawyer for the Obama administration. Neal Katyal is a He served as Solicitor General of the United States under President He called Gorsuch ``one of the most thoughtful and brilliant judges to have served our nation over the last century.'' Let me repeat. This is someone who served as Solicitor General of the United States under President Obama calling Judge Gorsuch ``one of the most thoughtful and brilliant judges to have served our nation over the last century.'' He even wrote an op-ed in the New York Times that predicted that Judge Gorsuch would ``help to restore confidence in the rule of law.'' Help to restore confidence. Isn't that what we want as a nation--confidence in the rule of law?  I think that any Democrat who has looked at this nominee's record will find it is an easy decision to confirm him. If there is a Democrat who reaches the opposite conclusion, I say come to the floor of the Senate and explain why you think our judges should go into a case favoring one side over another because one side is more sympathetic than the other. If there is a Member who thinks that a judge should make promises about how they will rule just to win a confirmation vote of a given Senator, I say come to the floor and make your case. If there is a Member who thinks a Justice on the Supreme Court should rule based on that Justice's own preferences and not based on the law, I would say please come to the floor of the Senate and say so.  I don't think that is what the American people want. The American people do want Justices who are smart. They want Justices who are principled, who are fair, and who know that their job is to follow the law, not to write the law and not to legislate from the bench. The American people know that Neil Gorsuch is exactly that kind of judge. He is the kind of judge we should have on the Supreme Court, we need on the Supreme Court, and we need on every court in the land. That is why I am committed to vote to confirm Neil Gorsuch to serve on the U.Supreme  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

4470,topic-id,641,"Mr.President, I rise to speak about bipartisan legislation that I have introduced to promote innovative solutions to better manage invasive species, conserve wildlife, and eliminate poaching. I have introduced this in a bipartisan way as the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, along with Senator Tom Carper, who is the ranking member of that committee, and along with Senator Jim Inhofe, who is a former chairman of that committee.  This legislation is called the Wildlife Innovation and Longevity Driver Act, WILD for short. I am a supporter of both conserving wildlife and technological innovation that we have before us.  My home State of Wyoming is truly one of the most beautiful places in the world. The people of Wyoming have an incredible appreciation for our wildlife. We applaud the efforts of innovators to help us conserve and manage species much more effectively and at a lower cost. Our State wildlife managers grapple with many challenges that innovators can help us solve.  For example, poaching has been a major issue in Hundreds of animals are taken illegally in the That is what I hear from the Wyoming Game & Fish Poaching is a problem across the country. It is not just the case in Wyoming; it has become pandemic overseas. International poachers seeking to cash in on the ivory trade have reduced the population of African elephants by 75 percent over the last 10 years. It is tragic.  Invasive species also present a threat to native wildlife, to water resources, and to our landscape. Invasive species clog pipes and fuel catastrophic fires. In fact, invasive species have a role in 42 percent of the listings under the Endangered Species It is invasive species that are causing other species to become endangered.  We need creative solutions to these threats to our wildlife. Our Nation's innovators are developing cutting-edge technologies to help us more effectively fight poaching, manage wildlife, and control invasive species.  A 2015 National Geographic article outlined a number of innovative technologies that are being used today to promote conservation of many of the world's most endangered species. That includes DNA analysis to identify the origin of illicit ivory supplies, using thermal imaging around protected areas to notify authorities of poachers, and using apps to assist wildlife enforcement in carrying out their duties.  In December, the National Invasive Species Council cohosted a summit, which highlighted innovations that combat invasive species. A few examples are a fish passage that automatically extracts invasive fish from streams, DNA technologies to provide early detection of invasive species, and the use of drones to gain spatially accurate, high resolution images that could be used to detect and monitor specific invasive species. Innovations like these are why we have introduced in a bipartisan way the WILD  This act provides technological and financial assistance to private landowners to improve fish and wildlife habitats. The legislation does this by reauthorizing the Partners for Fish and Wildlife The WILD Act requires Federal agencies to implement strategic programs to control invasive species. It also reauthorizes important laws to protect endangered and valuable species around the world, such as the African elephant, the Asian elephant, the rhinoceros, the great ape, and the marine turtle.  Finally, this act creates incentives for new conservation innovation. The legislation establishes four separate cash prizes for technological innovation in the prevention of wildlife poaching and trafficking, in the promotion of wildlife conservation, in the management of invasive species, and in the protection of endangered species. The Department of the Interior will administer the prizes, and a panel of relevant experts will award each prize.  Innovation is one of the best tools in conserving endangered species and keeping invasive species under control. The WILD Act will help stimulate that innovation.  I thank Senator Carper and Senator Inhofe for cosponsoring this important piece of legislation.  Thank you.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgS2216.txt,1881,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017.0,4.0,March
4346,topic-id,686,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Congressman Gallagher for his leadership on this issue, and the leadership across the board here as a Member of what we--I think most of us smile when we say the freshman class, because when I look across the experience level of all of the freshman Congressmen, no matter Democrat or Republican, what this country is blessed to have today, as Members of this 115th Congress, are people who come here with the sense of mission, a sense of purpose, a sense that we know what we have here in this country.  We may have disagreements as to how we are going to get to where we need to go, but we all agree that we need to go there. The question is: How do we do it?  One of the ways you create an environment where you have fresh ideas and fresh ways of looking at it is to change the people who are presenting and acting those ideas.  I find myself asking many times as we stand on the floor here: What would the Founders say if they were here today with us? How would they look at how we are enacting their vision of what it means to be a constitutionally-based Republic that is ``We the People''? How would they react?  I think there are probably a few things that they could not have imagined. Twitter or Snapchat might be one of them--pick your way of communicating across the spectrum that we now have today as our reality. I am not saying those things are bad. They are just the new reality that we have.  So how do we take what was given to us as a framework and move it forward?  Well, again, my colleagues have all eloquently very well stated that they believe that we need to have a higher turnover in Term limits is going to be a very good first step in ensuring that we maintain the freshness of ideas.  When you look at the challenges that face our country, we know that there are people out there who have chosen not to run, for whatever reason, because of the fact that they view they[[Page H2343]]can make more of a difference outside of That is too bad, because we need good people. We need them. We need them to be here, to be part of us.  One of the brutal realities as--author Jim Collins of ``Good to Great,'' you know, he talks about facing the brutal realities. One of the brutal realities that I believe we have to face is the professional politician. That wasn't written about anywhere 240 years ago. It just occurred over time.  It is our responsibility--especially as a freshman class, you can feel the passion that we believe is the right passion to be put behind term limits to begin to make the change necessary. So we are all in this together. In fact, I am proud to be a member of the freshman class, and I am proud of the fact that we signed a commitment to civility a couple of months ago that put us in a position where we are finding our voice. And what you are hearing today from our colleagues is part of that voice says: We need to do some things a little differently.  So let's move forward; let's expand the debate; and let's make sure that we are inclusive in everyone who wants to get their opinion heard on this issue; and make sure that those who have questions about what we mean, we articulate it because in so many areas we have got big decisions to make. This is going to be a big one.  In the Marines, we accept the mission that is assigned; we plan and train for it, and then we execute it, and we get it right. And that doesn't mean we don't make a few tweaks in the process, but the bottom line is that we accomplish the mission.

Chief amongst them is investigating retaliation againstwhistleblowers from the executive branch agencies, as well as other prohibited personnel practices. Once again, this is vitallyimportant to the work we perform in the Government Reform and Oversight Committee and ensures greater accountability from theexecutive branch to  We are proud of the support this bipartisan bill has received from the whistleblower communityand from those who care deeply about our efforts to perform effective oversight in our Federal  Since the lastauthorization expired in 2007, there are a number of necessary reforms for the OSC as the role of the Office continues to growand evolve. By enacting this legislation, we can ensure the Office of Special Counsel will have access to Federal agency recordsthat are absolutely necessary to perform their duty of protecting Federal employees who had the courage to speak up aboutmalpractice, mismanagement, and fraud in the Federal  I think we can all agree how unfortunate it is that someexecutive agencies continue to stonewall the Office of Special Counsel in order to prevent them from investigating retaliatoryactions against whistleblowers, even going so far as to invoke executive privilege when dealing with the Common sense tellsus that this is unacceptable. If the Office of Special Counsel isn't granted the access to the information it needs, there is noway it can properly conduct the duties authorized by  This bill also takes important steps to increase theefficiency and effectiveness of the Office of Special Counsel, such as allowing OSC to use a simplified process to reduceduplicative complaints to better focus their limited resources on allegations and investigations, and instituting a commonsense3-year statute of limitations after which document recovery and witness recollections can be difficult to obtain.  Mr.Speaker, before concluding my remarks, I would like to specifically highlight the important work the Office of Special Counselperformed recently in their exposure of the mismanagement and abuse of our veterans at the Department of Veterans  Two whistleblowers at the VA hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, recently came forward with information regarding inadequatemental health treatment in employee training at their facility. They were later retaliated against by management. OSC was ableto ensure that they received a new job at a nearby facility under different management. Just last month, the VA issued a reportin response to OSC's investigation detailing the changes they had made to improve mental health care at that VA facility.  Incidents like these serve as a great reminder that hardworking taxpayers are tired of corruption in the Federal  I would also like to note the excellent work of the current special counsel, Carolyn Lerner, who is a breath of fresh air inthis role.  Mr.Speaker, the bottom line is this committee, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, needs morewhistleblowers in the Federal Government, not less; and the best way to ensure government employees come forward to exposewaste, fraud, and abuse is to ensure that they will be protected. This legislation will enable OSC to do exactly that on behalfof all hardworking American taxpayers.  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation.

4415,topic-id,870,"Mr.President, the rules that the Federal Communications Commission recently promulgated--and when I say ``recently,'' it was October, only months ago--expanded the concept of privacy and consumer protection as applied to broadband. Now we are on the verge of rescinding those rules through S.34.  This resolution is a direct attack on consumer rights, on privacy, on rules that afford basic protection against intrusive and illegal interference with consumers' use of social media sites, websites, that often they take for granted. Many Americans simply don't stop to think about how broadband providers, as the carriers of all internet traffic, are also able to collect and use consumer data, to put together a detailed picture of who they are, what they do, where and when they buy things, where they go, what they like to do--all of it an array of data that people assume is private, all of it freely available to those internet providers.  Even when data is encrypted, our broadband providers can piece together significant amounts of information about us--including private information, medical conditions, financial problems--based on online activity. It is a mine that can be used--more valuable than a gold mine--because that information can be sold and bought and used again so that privacy becomes a completely evanescent and illusory feature of our lives.  Consumers wanting to switch broadband providers are often hit with hefty termination fees, and they have to experience a lapse in Internet service at home--something that most simply don't have the luxury to do or endure in today's connected society where internet is accessible. They have no meaningful choice about how to safeguard broadband privacy. They have one choice if they want speeds above 25 megabits per second. That is why I applauded those rules when they were promulgated by the FCC back in October, finalizing broadband privacy protections. I applauded them because signing up for the internet should not mean you sign away your rights to privacy.  Just as telephone networks must obtain consumer approval before selling customer information, broadband providers ought to be required to obtain consumers' affirmative consent before selling their sensitive browsing or app usage data to advertisers. The FCC rules that this resolution would decimate, utterly destroy, essentially seek to protect that privacy interest. The only way the FCC's broadband privacy rules protect consumers is through an affirmative opt-in consent. That is the only real protection that works.  These rules also prohibit pay-for-privacy schemes that would require consumers to waive their privacy protections as a precondition to receiving service. They establish data security and breach notification standards for broadband providers.  They also have important national security implications. Just last week, the Department of Justice indicted four individuals, including Russian spies, for hacking into Yahoo! systems in 2014 and obtaining access to at least 500 million Yahoo! accounts. According to the indictment, these Russian intelligence officers spied on U.Government officials and private sector employees of financial companies. One defendant also exploited the data for financial gain.  Without clear rules of the road, broadband subscribers will have no certainty or choice about how their private information can be used, no protection against abuse, and no assurance that security standards will be bolstered against that kind of attack that the Russians and their spies launched.  The FTC doesn't have jurisdiction over the security and privacy practices of broadband, cable, and wireless carriers. If the Ninth Circuit's recent decision in FTC v. AT&T is upheld, adopting a ``status-based'' instead of ``activity-based'' interpretation of the FTC's common carrier exemption, the FTC's jurisdiction and ability to impose privacy and security obligations would be even further curtailed.  Critics also say that the FCC's broadband privacy rules would unfairly create a separate regulatory regime for ``edge providers,'' websites such as Google or If that is their real concern, why haven't they focused their efforts on ensuring that the FTC has meaningful rulemaking authority so that it can implement privacy and data security rules over such websites?  In closing, I have long supported giving the FTC authority to adopt its own rules governing the privacy and security of websites. Giving the FTC authority to adopt new rules would help ensure our privacy, keep our privacy safe no matter where we go on the internet or how we connect. However, I don't see any of our colleagues, in supporting this resolution, rushing to accomplish these goals.  We should all remember that consumers need control over their own information and how it is used. This resolution would subvert and sabotage that control.  All too often, Americans take for granted privacy until it is lost. Once it is lost, rarely can it be recovered. Once that information becomes public, privacy is irreparably damaged.  Today's vote, if it succeeds, will deprive Americans of important baseline privacy standards that they expect and demand the government to provide. Few Americans are aware of this vote today. Many will be aware of its consequences. It will do extraordinary damage to privacy, if it is approved.  I urge my colleagues to reject it and to help preserve American privacy.

4403,topic-id,1514,"Mr.President, I rise today to talk about a bill that I have introduced. I have introduced it in prior But I think it is particularly important in this It is the End Racial and Religious Profiling Act of 2017. I am proud to have many of my colleagues as cosponsors of this legislation, including Senators Baldwin, Blumenthal, Booker, Brown, Cantwell, Coons, Duckworth, Durbin, Feinstein, Franken, Gillibrand, Harris, Heinrich, Hirono, Kaine, Markey, Menendez, Merkley, Murphy, Murray, Sanders, Stabenow, Udall, Van Hollen, Wyden, and  In the House of Representatives, the bill's principal sponsor is Congressman It is needed now more than ever before. I say that for many reasons, one of which is that we have seen a large increase in hate crimes in our community. Yesterday I was on the phone with a father from Harford County, MD, whose son was the victim of a hate episode related to that person's religion and ethnic background.  We have seen in our community a large increase in hate crimes against the Jewish community. There have been a lot of bomb threats that have been called into Jewish schools and to the Jewish Community We have seen physical attacks and the desecration of cemeteries. So the minority community feels threatened.  That has been escalating as a result of the actions of our President and his Executive orders. The Executive orders--he has issued two now that are dealing with the immigrant community--do raise the temperature in our community and the concern in our community that people are being threatened because of their religion, threatened because of their ethnic background, threatened because of their status as part of an immigrant community.  All of that has added to the concerns in America today. The legislation that I have introduced would make it illegal for discriminatory policing--for police to use as an indicator for their actions a person's race, religion, or ethnic background.  Discriminatory policing is against our values. Quite frankly, it is not what we stand for as a nation. We don't target people because of their religion. I will always remember that shortly after the Trayvon episode, I met with community activists in Many told me examples of how they were with their parents when the police stopped them randomly, for no reason at all, but solely because of the person's race and how communities felt threatened as a result of it.  It is not what we stand for as a nation. It turns communities against police, rather than working with the police. It is a waste of resources. It does not work. It can be deadly as we have seen in too many communities in our In my own city of Baltimore, we had the episode concerning Freddie Gray, who died in police custody.  I went to Sandtown, where Freddie Gray came from, shortly after that episode and met with the community, and I heard comparable stories about how good community activists felt like they were betraying their community if they worked with the local police, because they said the system was just stacked against their community and their race.  So let me, if I might, quote from the Department of Justice report on the Freddie Gray case. Our congressional delegation asked for a pattern or practice investigation. In part of that investigation, they came out with this finding:       There is overwhelming statistical evidence of racial      disparities in Baltimore Police Department's (BPD's) stops,      searches, and arrests. . . . BPD officers subject African-     Americans to a disproportionate number of pedestrian and      vehicles stops on Baltimore streets and search African-     Americans disproportionately during these stops. . . . The      policing practices that cause the racial disparities in BPD's      stops, searches, and arrests, along with evidence suggesting      intentional discrimination against African-Americans,      undermine the community trust that is central to effective      policing. . . . Indeed, we heard from many community members      who were reluctant to engage with the officers because of      their belief that the Department treats African-Americans      unfairly. . . . These concerns were acknowledged by BPD      leadership and officers, who explained that lack of trust--     particularly in many of Baltimore's African-American      communities--inhibit officers' efforts to build relationships      that are a key component of effective policing. . . .  I say that because racial profiling--discriminatory profiling--is ineffective and is counterproductive. It actually makes communities less safe. I have the honor of being the Special Representative for Anti-Semitism, Racism and Intolerance in the OSCE, or the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's Parliamentary  In that capacity, I have identified four major areas of concern within the 57 countries that represent the OSCE, including the United Those priorities are discriminatory actions against the Muslim community, the rise of anti-Semitism, the concerns of discrimination against the immigrant community, and also the concerns on discriminatory policing.  Discriminatory policing is very much engaged in our concerns about the rise of anti-Semitism, racism, and intolerance. Now, I want to make it clear: The overwhelming majority of people in law enforcement are good people. They are professionals. They are trying to do their job. They are against racial profiling. But we need to protect the professionalism within the police departments and establish a national policy against racial profiling.  My legislation is supported by over 1,150 organizations. Let me just, if I might, mention a couple of those, by quoting their leaders. Wade Henderson, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, who supports this legislation said:       Discriminatory profiling is wrong, fosters distrust between      law enforcement and the communities they serve and puts      public safety at risk. Racial profiling infringes on civil      liberties and squanders resources that should be used instead      to catch criminal perpetrators. We urge his colleagues to      join Senator Cardin and stand for effective law enforcement      by supporting [this legislation].  Jennifer Bellamy, the ACLU legislative counsel, who also supports this legislation, said:       For centuries, discriminatory profiling practices have      harmed communities of color. It is not enough to be `against'      racism and racial profiling, we need national leaders to end      discriminatory practices. We know that profiling of any kind      is ineffective and diverts law enforcement's time, money, and      energy away from actual threats. The time is now to end      racial profiling once and for all.  Then, lastly, Hilary Shelton, the director of the NAACP Washington Bureau and the senior vice president for policy and advocacy said:       This important legislation takes concrete steps to put an      end to the insidious practice of profiling individuals by      federal, state and local levels based on physical attributes      or an individual's religion. It is difficult for our faith in      the American criminal justice system not to be challenged      when we cannot walk down the street, drive down an      interstate, go through an airport, or even enter into our own      homes without being stopped merely because of the color of      our skin, who we are perceived to be, or what we choose to      wear.  I could mention many of the other groups and many other quotes. This legislation is pretty straightforward. It establishes a national uniform standard against discriminatory profiling at all levels of law enforcement--State, local  For example, it tells us that we can't use as descriptors a person's race. We can do so when we are using it to describe a particular crime, but not as a predictor of future crimes. Let me close by quoting from Ron Davis, the former police chief of East Palo Alto, CA, where he said:       [T]here exists no national, standardized definition for      racial profiling that prohibits all uses of race, national      origin, and religion, except when describing a person.      Consequently, many state and local policies define racial      profiling as using race as the ``sole'' basis for a stop or      any police action. This definition is misleading in that it      suggests using race as a factor for anything other than a      description is justified, which it is not. Simply put,      race is a descriptor not a predictor. To use race along      with other salient descriptors when describing someone who      just committed a crime is appropriate.  That is what this legislation does. It establishes a national definition. It prohibits it in any form of policing in our country. It provides for training. It provides Federal grants for best practices. It requires the Attorney General[[Page S1944]]to issue reports. It is legislation that is needed in our country.  Former Attorney General Eric Holder adopted it at the national level, and he said:       In this Nation, security and liberty are--at their best--     partners, not enemies, in ensuring safety and opportunity for      all. . . . In this Nation, the document that sets forth the      supreme law of the land--the Constitution--is meant to      empower, not exclude. . . . Racial profiling is wrong. It can      leave a lasting scar on communities and individuals. And it      is, quite simply, bad policing--whatever city, whatever      state.  The 14th Amendment to the U.Constitution guarantees ``equal protection of the laws'' to all Racial and discriminatory profiling is abhorrent to those principles, and it should be ended once and for all.

4521,topic-id,1934,"Mr.President, I rise today to lend my voice in support of perhaps one of the most qualified individuals ever nominated to the U.Supreme I am referring, of course, to Chief Judge Merrick  Over 1 year ago, on March 16, 2016, a President who was twice elected by significant margins in both the popular vote and the electoral college nominated Judge Garland to fill the vacancy left by the death of Justice Antonin President Obama upheld his constitutional duty by submitting a name to the Senate to fill this vacancy.  By submitting the name of Merrick Garland, he gave the Senate a man who has spent his career working to build consensus and to find principled compromises. His impeccable credentials speak for themselves: Harvard undergrad, top of his class; Harvard Law, top of his class; law clerk to Judge Friendly on the Second Circuit and Justice Brennan on the Supreme He served in the Justice Department after a time in private practice.  When tragedy befell Oklahoma City in April of 1995, Merrick Garland led the investigation that brought justice to the perpetrators of that unthinkable act of terrorism. Judge Gorsuch called this work ``The most important thing I have ever done in my life.''  His career was far from over at that point. In 1997, Republicans and Democrats joined together to confirm Judge Garland to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, which is often called the ``second highest court in the land.''  Here is what Senator Orrin Hatch, former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and currently the President pro tempore of the Senate, said of him at the time:       Merrick Garland is highly qualified to sit on the DC      His intelligence and his scholarship cannot be      questioned. . . . His legal experience is equally impressive.      . . . Accordingly, I believe Mr.Garland is a fine nominee. I      know him personally, I know of his integrity, I know of his      legal ability, I know of his honesty, I know of his acumen,      and he belongs on the court.  Those are not my words. Those are the words of Senator Orrin Hatch, a good friend and colleague.  Over the past two decades on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Garland established a reputation as a thoughtful judge, a fair judge, a man of high integrity, a judicial moderate, and a consensus builder in a day and age when we need consensus builders--not here but on the Supreme Court and other courts.  Even those who may disagree with him tend to find themselves thinking a little harder about their own views after hearing his.  During his 2005 confirmation hearing to serve as Chief Justice, John Roberts, who served with Judge Garland on the DC Circuit, stated these words: ``Any time Judge Garland disagrees, you know you're in a difficult area.''  Thank you, Chief Justice  In 2013, Judge Garland was promoted to chief judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, the second highest court in the land--the chief judge, presiding over that court.  When President Obama nominated him to the Supreme Court over 1 year ago, Judge Garland brought with him more Federal judicial experience than any nominee in the history of the United  When I met with Judge Garland last year, I got to know him beyond just his resume. Ironically, he had actually performed the marriage ceremony for my former chief of staff and his bride several years ago.  I was struck by Judge Garland's humility and by his personal character, his personal traits. Even as a nominee for the Supreme Court, he continued to serve his community as a mentor to elementary school students right here in Washington, Imagine that. A chief judge of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals taking time every week to mentor some kid who needs another good role model in his or her life. That is something that Judge Garland has done for about two decades.  Over 1 year later, as I stand here today, a seat on the Supreme Court--what should be, in my view, Judge Garland's seat--remains vacant. Our Republican colleagues, in an unprecedented display of what I think is obstructionism and partisanship, denied Judge Garland a hearing and a vote. Many of our Republican colleagues refused to even meet with him. He was denied both a hearing in the Judiciary Committee and a cloture vote in the full  Well, since the Senate Judiciary Committee began holding public hearings on Supreme Court nominees 101 years ago, in 1916, no Supreme Court nominee had ever been denied a hearing and a vote.  I will say that again. No Supreme Court nominee had ever been denied a hearing and a vote--well, until Judge  According to the highly respected website, SCOTUSblog, we read these words:       The historical record does not reveal any instances since      at least 1900 of the president failing to nominate and/or the      Senate failing to confirm a nominee in a presidential      election year because of the impending election.  That is right off the blog.[[Page S2144]]  Judge Garland was denied a hearing and a vote. In fact, during the 1988 Presidential election year, Justice Anthony Kennedy was confirmed by the Senate 97 to 0--not 51 to 49, not 60 to 40, but 97 to 0. But Judge Garland was denied a hearing and a vote.  Our Constitution, the one that every Member of this great deliberative body has sworn an oath to uphold, standing right over there, requires the Senate to provide its advice and consent to Supreme Court nominees.  Over the years, there have been a lot of questions as to what advice and consent entails. Judge Garland was denied a hearing and a vote. A good man--I think an extraordinary man--was treated badly, as was our  I believe the unprecedented obstruction our Republican colleagues mounted last year against Judge Garland was a shameful chapter for the U.Mr.Garland, a consensus builder, one of the most qualified judges in our country, waited 293 days for a hearing and a vote that ultimately never came. I am still deeply troubled by those 293 wasted days, and I am still deeply troubled by the way Judge Garland was treated. I believe Judge Garland still deserves a hearing and still deserves a vote.  While I do not believe that two wrongs make a right, I believe this may be our only opportunity to right a wrong and erase the enormous black mark that the Senate's failure to consider Judge Garland leaves on this chapter of American history. I think it is unacceptable to put partisan politics over fidelity to our U.Confirming anyone for this vacancy other than Judge Garland would be a stamp of approval for playing politics with Supreme Court nominees.  From where I sit, upholding our oath to protect the Constitution means finding agreement on moving Judge Garland's nomination forward at the same time as that of Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump's nominee. When President Trump lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes last year and narrowly won the electoral college, he promised to be a President for all I think a fair question is, Has he upheld that promise?  Well, let's decide--an unconstitutional Muslim ban, an unnecessary and overpriced wall on the southern border, a failed healthcare bill that would have provided less coverage for more money, a rollback of environmental protections for all of us who don't want to drink dirty water and don't want to breathe dirty air. If you ask me, the President has broken the promise to be a President for all Now I realize that others may differ and disagree, but his nomination of Judge Gorsuch represents what I believe is another broken promise.  I have heard from middle-class folks, from workers up and down my State, from special education teachers, from immigrant communities, from women who depend on access to healthcare, and my guess is my colleagues have as well. Many of them fear that Judge Gorsuch is not on their side. Despite his impressive resume, I share those same concerns.  At this time, I believe it is appropriate to hit the pause button until an agreement can be reached that provides justice for Judge Garland while restoring credibility to the U.I believe that is only bolstered by the cloud that lingers over President Trump's campaign.  As FBI Director Comey testified last week, there is an ongoing investigation to determine the links between Russia and the Trump campaign and whether there was any coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia to interfere in the 2016 election. It has also been widely reported in the media that officials from the upper echelon of the Trump campaign have close ties to Vladimir Putin's interests in weakening democratic governments throughout the There are many Americans who believe that Judge Gorsuch has been nominated for a stolen Supreme Court seat. There are also a number of Americans who believe that he has been nominated by a man whose campaign may have coordinated with foreign adversaries on stealing a Presidential election.  Let me be clear. At the moment, no evidence has been made public to indicate that this is the case, but there are few nominations that any President will make that will have more of an impact on our Constitution and on the lives of everyday Americans than the U.Supreme To hastily move forward with Judge Gorsuch, who is 49 years old and can serve on the Supreme Court well into the middle of this century, without first getting to the bottom of the suspicious and irregular actions of the Trump campaign officials, I believe, would be a mistake.  The American people need to know that the President's campaign was above reproach before we decide whether Judge Gorsuch merits approval for a lifetime appointment.  I will close my remarks by offering a word of caution to my colleagues. We have maintained and preserved a 60-vote threshold for Supreme Court nominees to prevent Democrats and Republicans from choosing political expediency over bipartisan consensus. If Judge Gorsuch fails to obtain 60 votes on the cloture vote next week, I think it could signal one of three things. First, that Judge Gorsuch's views are outside the judicial mainstream; second, that we still have an opportunity to rectify the injustice done to Judge Garland and to our Constitution; or third, that we still do not know the nature of the relationship between the Trump campaign and Russia--a country whose leadership has ordered an attack on our election and our democracy, as well as a whole lot of other countries around the world.  If Judge Gorsuch fails to achieve 60 votes on the first try or the next try, it does not mean that his nomination will not move forward at some point in the future. It means we have hit the pause button. It may very well be that while we pause, another vacancy on the Court could emerge. Who knows when another vacancy might occur? But if you ask me, another vacancy might present the Senate with an opportunity to right what I believe is a historic wrong, and we should see if the other objections that have been raised about Judge Gorsuch could be addressed before we change the rules of the Senate in favor of the party in power.  In closing, I will say again that Judge Garland waited 293 days for a hearing and a vote that never came. Judge Gorsuch waited 48 days for a hearing, and we will be voting on his nomination next week. Talk about a rush to judgment.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Young). The Senator's time has expired.

4450,topic-id,429,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I mayconsume.  First, let me note in the last Congress this legislation passed out of committee by regular order and passed theHouse on January 11, 2016.  The Office of Special Counsel is tasked with protecting Federal employees fromprohibited personnel practices, including reprisals on whistleblowers. Whistleblowers are an indispensable part of helpingCongress identify waste, fraud, and abuse at Federal agencies. Information provided by these brave folks can result ininvestigations and legislation that changes the way we conduct ourselves in government.  As the agency tasked with protectingwhistleblowers, the OSC is vital to make sure these individuals feel comfortable coming forward and that they are offeredprotections. The agency has been busy. From 2013 to 2015, OSC's caseload increased from 4,500 cases open to more than 6,100.That increase coincided with multiple scandals within the Veterans Administration, as Mr.Blum of Iowa has highlighted.  In fiscal year 2016, OSC projected nearly 2,500 cases from just the VA--2,500 cases at just the Veterans Thisreauthorization will ensure the OSC has adequate funding to continue protecting whistleblowers in the VA and other agencies aswell. The majority of the OSC funding goes directly to hiring employees who work to protect whistleblowers.                              {time}  1330  The bill also makes substantive improvements to current law to ensurethe OSC can carry out its mission more effectively. Those reforms cover a few areas, ensuring agencies cooperate with the OSC,clarifying OSC's investigative procedures and making sure Congress receives clear information on whistleblower reprisalthroughout the Federal  With this bill, the OSC has clear authority to access agency records and to conduct itsinvestigations. For its part, the OSC must treat those records in the same manner of confidentiality as the agency would,alleviating concerns about disclosure of sensitive information.  The bill also gives OSC needed flexibility to focus onclaims that deserve our attention. It will allow the agency to terminate duplicative claims already being pursued by the MeritSystems Protection Board and claims that[[Page H74]]exceed statutory timeframes. Agencies will also be required to submit reportsdetailing what actions they take as a result of these OSC investigations--something in Congress that we should be payingattention to. This reporting provision requires agencies to admit any failures in holding people accountable and gives Congressmuch-needed transparency.  Finally, the bill codifies OSC's practice under the current special counsel of disclosing toCongress results and statistics. Codifying this transparency ensures the practice will continue and allow for easier oversightof these activities.  In order to help protect the whistleblowers and reform the Federal agencies, I would urge ourcolleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.69.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

President Franklin Roosevelt established the first Presidential library in1939. Since then, every former President since Herbert Hoover has had a library dedicated to his Presidential records. Each ofthe 13 current libraries is managed and operated by the National Archives and Records Administration at an annual cost ofroughly $75 million. While these facilities are operated at taxpayer expense, the construction of these libraries is privatelyfinanced through donations.  As the volume of records for each President has increased over the years, so have constructioncosts. For example, when it opened in 2004, the Clinton Presidential Center, in part, cost approximately $165 million.                              {time}  1300  Nine years later, the George Bush Presidential Center, which openedin 2013, cost about $250 million. The Chicago Tribune has reported that President Obama's library might cost as much as $500million.  Despite these escalating costs, there are no transparency requirements for Presidential library fundraisingorganizations. Here, transparency is important and very much needed.  This bill will require Presidential library fundraisingorganizations to disclose to the National Archives contributions in excess of $200 in any fiscal quarter in a searchable andsortable format. In turn, the National Archives will post this data online.  This disclosure requirement would end oncecontrol of a library facility is transferred to the National This ensures compliance costs of this legislation areminimal for both fundraising organizations and the National  This legislation is bipartisan. It is not intended totarget any one individual.

It speaks volumes that the first thing Republicans attempted to do wasweaken ethical standards and that they only changed course once their efforts were exposed to the public. This is not what theAmerican people sent us here to do.  It seems that, contrary to rhetoric, Republicans don't want to drain the swamp. Theywant to fill it up. This is wrong, and it is critical that Members of Congress be accountable and adhere to the highest ethicalstandards.  In the weeks ahead, it is critical that all of us hold the majority accountable and prevent them from going backto the days when thinly veiled bribes, kickbacks, and worse were commonplace in this town.

4459,topic-id,337,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I thank my long-time friend Representative Duncan and Ranking Member Cummings for sponsoring this bill.Representative Duncan first sponsored a bill to improve Presidential libraries 17 years ago. I hope we can now, finally,get this important legislation enacted.  The Presidential Library Donation Reform Act would make the process for buildingPresidential libraries more transparent. Presidential libraries have become increasingly more expensive as they have evolvedinto multipurpose centers. The George Bush Presidential Center cost an estimated $250 million to build, and President Bushraised, approximately, $500 million for the building and an endowment for his library, museum, and institute.  Under currentlaw, there is no requirement to disclose the identities of those who donate to a Presidential library and to a President whilehe is still in office. He is able to raise an unlimited amount of private donations. Requiring the disclosures of donors wouldhelp prevent the trading of political favors in exchange for donations.  This bill would require organizations that raisemoney to build Presidential libraries to disclose the identity of any individual who donates more than $200. The National Archives and Records Administration would then be required to post the donation informationonline. The bill would also create criminal penalties for individuals who report false information on donations and forfundraising organizations that omit donation information.  As was mentioned earlier, a group of 15 good governmentorganizations, including CREW and the Sunlight Foundation, sent a letter that urged the House to support this bill. Here is whatthey wrote:       Under the current opaque system, Presidents raise funds      privately to establish theirPresidential libraries.       These efforts, which often begin long before they leave      office, are unregulated and undisclosed,creating      opportunities for--or the appearance of--influence peddling.      Improved transparency would help reduce the appearance      ofimpropriety and help deter any inappropriate behavior.  This bill was approved, without opposition, by the Committee onOversight and Government Reform, and it passed the House last year without opposition. I urge every Member of this body tosupport this bill.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-01-04-pt1-PgH65.txt,1654,AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET,2017.0,4.0,April

Bill has earned my respect and that of the thousands of people in north Mississippi who know him as a dedicated field representative on my staff.  I am confident that the tenacity, loyalty, and work ethic that characterized Bill's work for me were forged early in life with the lessons he learned as an outstanding student athlete.  Bill grew up in the shipbuilding town of Pascagoula, MS, where he earned letters in basketball, baseball, and football. As a college freshman at Furman University, he started at quarterback for the Paladins and set school records throughout his college football career, completing 215 passes for 2,460 yards and 24 touchdowns. He was elected unanimously in 1988 for induction into the Furman University Hall of  Bill played professional football for the Toronto Argonauts, a Canadian Football League organization, but was soon called to serve his country.

4451,topic-id,356,"Mr.Speaker, again, I thank my friend, Mr.Clay,for his leadership and for his kindness.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the Thoroughly Investigating RetaliationAgainst Whistleblowers Act--a mouthful, but it captures what we are trying to do.  I certainly appreciate Mr.Blum'sefforts to advance legislation that authorizes the Office of Special Counsel and protects whistleblowers in the FederalGovernment, an effort the Oversight and Government Reform Committee strives to promote when we are at our best on a bipartisanbasis, and I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the bill.  I welcome consideration of this bill which would reaffirmCongress' commitment to whistleblowers, upholding the Oversight and Government Reform Committee's obligation to protect thosewhistleblowers that help identify mismanagement, waste, and fraud at Federal agencies and to support the oversight work ofThat is Congress at its best.  With the enactment of the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, OSC became anindependent agency within the executive branch. Its mission is to safeguard the merit system of protecting Federal employeesfrom prohibitive personnel practices, especially reprisal from whistleblowing. OSC provides employees a mechanism for disclosingwrongdoing in government agencies and provides advice on the Hatch Act, which restricts political activity by governmentemployees generally.  OSC enforces employment rights under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of1994 for Federal employees who serve or have served in the uniformed services. Congress last reauthorized OSC for the period2003 to 2007. Due in part to Congress' emphasis on transparency in government, OSC has experienced significant growth in itscaseload since its last reauthorization. In the past 5 years, that caseload has increased, Mr.Speaker, by 58 percent.  Thisbill reauthorizes the agency from 2016 through 2020 and makes several important changes to assist OSC in carrying out its vitalmission. The bill codifies OSC's current practice of providing important performance metrics in its annual reports to theCongress and requires additional metrics to support congressional oversight of its effectiveness.  Last Congress, this billwas successfully passed out of our committee on, I believe, a unanimous basis. I urge my colleagues to continue Congress'longstanding tradition of support for oversight, accountability, whistleblower protection, and transparency, and vote in theaffirmative for the Thoroughly Investigating Retaliation Against Whistleblowers  ",CREC-2017-01-04-pt1-PgH71.txt,1959,CONGRESSIONAL TERM LIMITS,2017.0,4.0,April

They unnecessarily target internet service providers and, ultimately, make our internet ecosystem less efficient by adding more redtape.  The bottom line is that the FCC privacy rules are bad regulations that need to be repealed.  I should also note that this Congressional Review Act vote will not change the entire online privacy protections that consumers currently enjoy, and it will not change statutory privacy protections under the Communications It will repeal something that was done unilaterally by President Obama and his administration, as I said, following the ending of his term, as they were headed out the door.

4494,topic-id,953,"Mr.President, I thank my friend from Rhode Island for his courtesy.  Last week, the Senate took the first step in providing needed relief for the American people from a health care plan, the Affordable Care Act, that overpromised and underdelivered. Many people are hurting now as a result of the failed promises of They were told their premiums would go down, that they would be able to keep the policy they had if they liked it, and that if they liked their doctor, they could keep their doctor, none of which has proved to be true. So it is important that we keep our commitment to the American people. I believe we have gotten a mandate as a result of the election on November 8 that we keep our promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act and to deliver health care that is affordable and is a matter of individual choice and freedom of choice.  The basic problem with ObamaCare is that it was command and control right out of Washington, DC, where people didn't have sufficient humility when it comes to rearranging one-sixth of our national economy and believed that they could, in the process of writing a 2,700-page bill--that I doubt many of them read--take over and improve our health care delivery system.  It was sold on the basis of providing people access to affordable care, and in many instances, according to my constituents, they have seen their premiums skyrocket and deductibles skyrocket, effectively being insured but giving them no benefit of insurance coverage at all.  I realize there were some things that people liked to talk about when they talk about ObamaCare that were positive; for example, dealing with people with preexisting conditions. I agree that people should not lose their health insurance coverage when they change employers and be caught in a trap where your insurance company doesn't cover your preexisting condition, but you don't need ObamaCare in order to deal with that problem. People also like the idea that single adults living at home can continue to be listed on their parents' health insurance up to age 26. That is enormously popular on a bipartisan basis. Again, we don't need a 2,700-page takeover of the health care system in order to deliver some of these consensus items of reform.  I believe, and we believe, that there are certain principles that ought to govern the replacement of ObamaCare that we will see unfold in the coming weeks; first and foremost, moving the health care decisions outside of Washington and back to where they belong--to patients, families, and their doctor.  We also believe patients ought to have more tools, such as health savings accounts which they can use to pay for their regular health care along with perhaps a catastrophic coverage which would help them in the event of an unexpected health care condition that would require hospitalization. If you are young and healthy and don't need all the money you set aside in health savings accounts, you can keep that money and use it for your eventual retirement.  We also believe we ought to break down barriers that restrict choice and permit Americans to pick an insurance plan that is best for them and their family. One of the worst aspects of ObamaCare is that Washington, DC, said: Here is your health care coverage, and we are going to punish you with a penalty if you don't buy it, forcing people to buy coverage that they didn't want and didn't need--for example, a single male being forced, in essence, to buy maternity coverage. That is just 1 of the 10 essential health benefits that was mandated in ObamaCare that drove the cost of insurance through the roof, not to mention the fact that the pools of people who were insured tended to be older and less well, thus driving premiums again through the roof.  Another principle that is really important to our health care reform replacement is empowering small businesses to provide employees with the kind of health care coverage that meets their needs through association health plans so they can pool their risks together to bring costs down and to increase their choices. We believe there ought to be flexibility on the part of the States when it comes to Medicaid spending. We ought to, in my book, give the States the money and the block grant and say: Come up with a health care delivery system for Medicaid's low-income citizens that best suits their needs. We haven't done that under We have had a mandate and tied the hands of the States when it comes to coming up with alternatives to health care delivery.  Finally, when it comes to employers that provide 61 percent of the health care coverage for Americans, rather than tying their hands and driving up costs, what we ought to do is allow for increased flexibility for employer-sponsored plans that will help bring down the costs. We hear our colleagues on the other side of the aisle talking about ObamaCare like it was the gold[[Page S331]]standard: There is nothing wrong with it. It is just perfect as it is.  Well, I don't have to tell our Democratic friends about the unintended consequences of this partisan exercise. ObamaCare was passed without a single Republican vote so the problems that have developed from it are problems that were created by our Democratic colleagues. Having said that, we hope they will work with us to come up with an alternative which we believe would be an improvement on the status quo, to make health care more available, at a price people can afford, with choices that would be theirs, not a mandate out of Washington,                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-17-pt1-PgS330.txt,1692,BEARS EARS NATIONAL MONUMENT,2017.0,17.0,April
4577,topic-id,486,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank Mr.Doyle for his generous yielding of time and the great work he does representing the great city of Pittsburgh, which has had many Super Bowl rings in the past and will again in the future no doubt.  Mr.Speaker, again, I rise in support of this measure. As Mr.Kinzinger indicated, this is the third try that we have pushed this bill on a bipartisan basis, and hopefully the third time will be the charm. It was introduced only 10 days ago, and the fact that, again, we are moving so quickly hopefully is going to send an encouraging signal that the Senate can really move forward and finish this very, I think, important and useful piece of legislation.  There are about 737,000 ham radio operators that have been licensed by the Federal Communications Commission across the country. As has been said, they provide a great backup for emergency services around the country. Again, in Connecticut, where we did get hit with Hurricanes Sandy and Irene in back-to-back years, the harm that was done to the wireless communications system as well as just the regular radio system really put the spotlight on the fact that ham radio operators were critical in terms of keeping police, fire, and small communities and State services in up-to-date, realtime communication regarding both weather conditions as well as public safety conditions. So the work that they perform is not just kind of a hobby; it really has great value to the country.  What I think this bill tries to address is that, in 1985, the FCC issued an order and ruling basically describing ham radio as critical to the Nation's information and communication infrastructure, and that reasonable accommodation should be made in terms of public entities like zoning boards and land use bodies. It did not extend, however, to private land use restrictions.  Since the 1980s, there probably hasn't been a deed signed in the country that hasn't had land use restrictions, and this bill really tries to, I think, adjust to that reality with the compromise language that has been put forward so that condominium associations and, again, neighborhood developments have to reasonably make sure that this network is going to be able to function.  The good news is that the technology has moved forward so well that the antenna intrusion really is not what it used to be, that the equipment that they have is quite remarkable to see how strong their signals are and the reception is with, again, just really almost tiny antenna technology.  So, again, this legislation I think really updates the FCC's promotion of ham radio. Communities that are going to end up depending on it because of natural disaster and other emergency situations I think will benefit strongly. So again, I congratulate all the members of the Energy and Commerce I thank Mr.Doyle again for generously yielding his time to me.

4363,topic-id,287,"I ask the Senator from Oregon through the Chair again: During the course of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse raised this question about dark money with Neil Gorsuch, the nominee for the Supreme Court, and asked if he was aware of the fact that millions were currently being spent on ad campaigns and mail campaigns across the United States to promote his nomination--and whether Neil Gorsuch felt that the source of this money should be disclosed. As far as we could bring the judge on this subject, he said: Well, someone should ask about where the money is coming from. That, I guess, is a pretty bold statement because many Republicans don't believe that it is fair to even ask where the money is coming from.  There was a time when even the Senate majority leader used to say: I am not going to complain about the amount of money. I just want to make sure it is all disclosed. Well, he is completely vacating that position. He doesn't want disclosure. He doesn't want the American people to know where the money is coming from.  I don't know if the Senator from Oregon noticed the television advertising here in Washington, where there is a lot on an issue like this before us.

4365,topic-id,542,"I ask the Senator from Oregon if he will further yield.  Neil Gorsuch, the judge from the Tenth Circuit who has been nominated for the Supreme Court, has had some noteworthy opinions. One was the Hobby Lobby case. It is an interesting parallel between Hobby Lobby and Citizens In Citizens United, the Supreme Court said: We believe that money is speech. And we believe that the protections of the First Amendment extend to corporations who should be treated like persons when it comes to their right of free speech.  In the Hobby Lobby case, Neil Gorsuch, who is headed for the Supreme Court, reached a parallel decision, giving good credibility to the argument that the Republicans know why they are pushing for this man to go to the Court because this was a case where the Hobby Lobby company, which has stores across the United States owned by the Green family--the Green family had their own special personal religious beliefs when it came to family planning and birth control. So they refused to provide for their 13,000 employees across the United States any health insurance plan that provided for methods of birth control, which they found personally offensive. They said that this was a corporate position they were taking--a company position.  So it was Neil Gorsuch, with others on the Tenth Circuit Court, who decided to expand the definition of personhood--again to include closely held corporations like Hobby The net result was that the owners--the Green family--were able to say: We are going to stand up for our religious beliefs when it comes to family planning. And to say to 13,000 employees that those employees' personal beliefs--the religious beliefs of each employee--really made no difference from the viewpoint of Judge Once the owners of the company had decided what was good, principled religious conduct, they could impose that on their employees.  So there is a parallel here where Citizens United said a corporation is a person. Judge Gorsuch and Hobby Lobby said that a closely held corporation is a person. And in the Citizens United case, he said this person--corporation person--has the right of free speech. In the case of Hobby Lobby, Judge Gorsuch said this corporation has the right of freedom of religion to exert their sincerely held religious beliefs.  So I say to the Senator from Oregon: It is clear to me that they tested Judge Gorsuch in the Tenth Circuit, and he came out ahead when it came to the basic principle that corporations should somehow be treated as persons when it comes to rights under the That to me is hard to imagine.  I just can't fathom how they could stretch the meaning of person to include corporations when it doesn't say so expressly in any of the statutes that were referenced here. I haven't seen a lot of corporations pleading guilty and being sent to prison. It doesn't happen much.  So my question to the Senator from Oregon is, when it comes to the clearance of Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court seat--this open seat on the Supreme Court--whether they found the Hobby Lobby decision something that said to them: This man would believe in Citizens United had he been on the Court at the same time.

4367,topic-id,856,"If the Senator from Oregon will yield further, when I started trying to find out the source of the money for these television ads that support Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court, I went to something--the 45 Committee, I mentioned to you. I had never heard of it before. I looked it up. There was a committee that sounds just like this. It is hard to keep track of them. The largest donor by far in terms of money was Sheldon Adelson, a man out of Las Vegas who has become rather celebrated, if not notorious, for putting millions of dollars into those political efforts on behalf of candidates from the right--some say from the extreme right.  I would also ask the Senator from Oregon if, during the course of his review of Judge Gorsuch's record, he came across the TransAm Trucking case, which was really explored at length in the Senate Judiciary Many of us felt this was such a clear definition of the values of Neil Gorsuch, who tends to rule on the side of big business and corporate elites over and over again.[[Page S2288]]  The case involved a truck driver who was driving near Chicago on Interstate 88 in January a few years ago during a bitterly cold period of time. He had trouble with his trailer. He pulled it off to the side of the road and realized the brakes on the trailer were frozen. So he got on his cell phone and he called his dispatcher, and his dispatcher said: Whatever you do, stay with that truck and trailer. The repairman is on the way.  So he waited a while. No one showed up. He fell asleep. By the time he woke up to a phone call from a member of his family, his legs were numb and he was having trouble breathing. It turned out there was no heater in the cab of the truck. So there he was, facing hypothermia and freezing in his truck. Again, the dispatcher told him: Stay there. Don't leave the truck.  He decided that the idea of dragging this trailer down the interstate was dangerous and the idea of staying in this truck could threaten his own life, so he made what I consider to be a reasonable decision: He unhitched the trailer, took the truck to the gas station, filled it with gas, warmed up, and came back to the trailer. For that conduct, he was fired by TransAm Because he was fired, he was blackballed from ever driving another truck.  This man, whom I happened to meet in my office a few weeks ago, Alphonse Maddin, then did not know which way to turn. He couldn't make a living. He was a hard-working fellow out of  Somebody said: You can go to the Department of Labor, and you can file a complaint for unfair dismissal.  I see the Senator has a photograph of Mr.Maddin there.  He told me he went to the Department of They handed him the form. With a ballpoint pen, he filled it in as to what happened to him, protesting this dismissal and firing. He said he was shocked a few months later to get a letter in the mail that said: You win. You are right. They shouldn't have fired you.  Well, he thought that was a pretty good thing and that he would get some backpay out of it. But then the appeals started, and it went in the Federal court system. By the time it got to the Tenth Circuit, where Judge Neil Gorsuch sat, seven different court judges and administrative judges had considered the case of Alphonse Maddin as to whether it was fair to fire him under these circumstances. Only one judge out of the seven said it was the right thing to do--Neil Gorsuch, the man who aspires to be on the Supreme  One of my colleagues--and I think it was Senator Franken--said to Judge Gorsuch: What would you have done if you were sitting in that truck? What would you have done if you faced freezing to death or dragging a disabled trailer out on a busy interstate, endangering the lives of others?  Judge Gorsuch replied: I never really thought about it.  He never really thought about it. To me, that really gets to the heart of what we are talking about here. He thought about it enough to rule against that truck driver who faced that terrible choice in his life, but he did not think for a moment what a reasonable, ordinary man would do under the circumstances. He reduced the situation to the absurd and decided to rule for the trucking company, for the corporation.  When you consider that this Roberts Supreme Court has ruled on the corporate side, the U.Chamber of Commerce side, 69 percent of the time, it is pretty clear why they have this fond feeling for Neil Gorsuch as the next Supreme Court  Does the Senator from Oregon see the linkage here between what the Republicans are looking for in a Supreme Court nominee and what they would find in this TransAm Trucking decision?

4564,topic-id,470,"Mr.President, on December 28, 2016, President Obama designated the Bears Ears National Monument in Southern Utah, and I wish to commend him on protecting these important lands. This designation is an important step forward in the conservation of some of southern Utah's important national treasures.  The 1.35-million acre monument, which spans from forested mesas to redrock canyons and plateaus, will protect the region's abundant cultural resources, including well-preserved cliff dwellings, rock and art panels, artifacts, and Native American burials.  The Bears Ears National Monument, which derives its name from twin buttes that lie at the heart of the majestic Cedar Mesa, was requested by a coalition of five Native American tribes that united to protect a landscape revered in their shared histories and cultures. The Hopi Tribe, the Navajo Nation, the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, the Pueblo of Zuni, and the Ute Indian Tribe have all passed through the area at some time, leaving behind scores of fragile dwellings, pottery, petroglyphs, and pictographs. The Bears Ears region is a living natural and cultural landscape, where the people of these tribes still use the lands to collect herbs and medicines and pass their stories to the next generation.  I have fought to protect this area's resources through the America's Red Rock Wilderness Act, a bill I have introduced every Congress since 1997. My bill would safeguard 9.2 million acres of wilderness in Utah--some of the last great wild places in the lower 48  Historically, national monuments have been the first step in protecting some of our most beloved public lands--the Grand Canyon, the Grand Tetons, and indeed, four of Utah's five national parks. Not only do these monuments help preserve precious habitat, landscapes, and history, they create jobs and invigorate nearby communities.  President Obama's decision to protect the Bears Ears came after significant public input in Utah, with the administration holding multiple listening sessions. Those sessions made clear that even diverse stakeholders agreed the Bears Ears is special and needs to be protected. It is the right decision for the present, and it is the right decision for the future.  Republican President Theodore Roosevelt signed the Antiquities Act into law in 1906, and a review of its history and its controversy showed that, time and again, the temporary anger over designated lands was overshadowed by the long-term benefits to our Teddy Roosevelt said it best, ``Of all the questions which can come before this nation, short of the actual preservation of its existence in a great war, there is none which compares in importance with the great central task of leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it is for us.''  I urge my colleagues to join me in celebrating the Bears Ears National Monument and defending it and the Antiquities Act that made it possible.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-10-pt1-PgS199-2.txt,326,PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY DONATION REFORM ACT OF 2017,2017.0,10.0,January

In closing, I read a few weeks ago that the new administration was planning to retool the State Department to focus more on terrorism. The article suggested that the State Department might do away with some of our smart power efforts. That would be a mistake. I look at an effort like this one, expanding access to education, and I know that it isn't taking away from our ability to combat terrorism. In fact, it is critical to that fight.  When we help more young people get access to a good education, we are giving them the tools to think critically and resist those who mean us harm. We are helping give people an alternative, a path forward for their lives.  When kids don't have these skills, who do you think shows up?

Since being sworn in earlier this year to serve the people of Bucks and Montgomery County, I have made it my mission to advance commonsense bipartisan government reform agenda that includes, perhaps, the single most important thing that I believe we need to do in this Nation, and that is institute term limits.  For 14 years, serving as an FBI agent, most of that time being in the political corruption units throughout the country, there was one commonality that I saw very frequently--there was an unmistakable correlation between the length of time in office and the instances of corruption, and that the lines that were very bright for elected officials coming into the system on day one weren't so bright in year 7, 8, or 9, and certainly not in year 15 or 20.  Even the most well-intended backbone individuals oftentimes can be corrupted by a system that has the power to change some people. Those lines become blurred over time. And it is with this background and these real-world experiences that myself and my colleagues are pushing this issue, in this House of Representatives, in this Chamber, for the 115th  I, myself, introduced House Resolution 7 on my first day, among other reform-minded measures, on my first day in This was a constitutional amendment that would, once and for all, set term limits for Members of the House and the  As tonight shows, there is a wide range of support for this need of reform.

4339,topic-id,522,"Mr.Speaker, I was back in Green Bay, Wisconsin, the past week. Someone asked me: What is the biggest surprise you have encountered since being in Congress?  I said: I will give you a negative surprise and a positive surprise. The negative surprise was how much of our time is spent here in Congress doing things that really, in my opinion, have nothing to do with the hard task of legislating, running around to an endless series of meetings that distract us from the hard work of the floor of coming together and fixing problems.  I said: But on the positive side, I have been blown away by the quality of talent, the commitment to service, and just the incredible collection of experiences we have in the freshman class of the 115th Congress--on both sides of the aisle, by the way.  I think we have a unique opportunity to seize this moment and send a message to our citizens back home that we are ready to change politics as usual and we are ready to work together to get things done. So today we would like to speak about that in general and in particular about term limits, an idea whose time has come.  In my 10 years in the Marine Corps and during two deployments to Iraq, I saw brave young men and women from across this country working together, doing whatever it took to accomplish the very difficult mission.                              {time}  1715  I would submit that our constituents from across the country sent us here to accomplish a very difficult mission. They sent us here not to treat our time here as a career, but rather like a deployment, an act with a sense of urgency to get things done. And, my gosh, do we have a list of problems that we need to fix.  Our healthcare system in this country has failed the American people, the Federal debt and deficit continue to balloon, taxes are driving out businesses and jobs, and our foreign policy is in shambles right now. These issues aren't new, yet they never seem to get fixed. Why is that? Well, I would argue because Washington isn't working for the American people. The people's House has become distracted and distorted from its original intention. It is up to us--the new Members of Congress--to fix that and restore the balance that the Founders and the Framers had in mind--the concept of the citizen legislator--people from all walks of life who would put aside their primary responsibility and come and embark on a season of service and then return home when that season was done.

4373,topic-id,1623,"Mr.President, we are continuing to debate the nomination of Judge Gorsuch to serve as Associate Justice of the Supreme My colleagues on both sides of the aisle have said that this is an important moment for the I couldn't agree more.  I think it is important to reflect on why we are here and how we got here. Before I turn to the Supreme Court and the current debate, let me take just a few minutes to talk about lower court nominees and provide a little bit of history and context, especially for the benefit of some of the Senators who weren't here over the last few years.  I am going to start way back in the spring of 2001. President George Bush had just been elected As we all know, it was a close election, and it was hard fought. The Senate was closely divided, with the Republicans in control. Given how close the Presidential election was, there were elements of the hard left who refused to accept the results of that election. Some blamed Ralph Nader, others blamed Governor Jeb Bush, and still others blamed the Supreme Many on the hard left claimed that President George Bush wasn't a ``legitimate'' Liberal interest groups were egging on the Democratic leadership to fight the new President at every turn.  That still sounds very familiar for this year we are in.  At the same time, one major concern for the hard-left liberal interest groups was that President Bush, who they claimed wasn't legitimate, would be able to nominate conservative judges. Again, doesn't that sound familiar?  Senator Cornyn went over some of this same subject yesterday, but it deserves discussion now, and it serves as a reminder of where we have been before because sometimes the past predicts the future.  So in the spring of 2001, the hard-left interest groups went to the Senate Democratic leadership with a plan. According to the New York Times, ``42 of the Senate's 50 Democrats attended a private retreat . . . where a principal topic was forging a unified party strategy to combat the White House on judicial nominees.'' Thinking about 2017, doesn't that sound a little familiar?  At that meeting--Cass Sunstein, Marcia Greenberger, and Laurence Tribe spoke at the retreat and pitched to the Democrats who were present their idea of how this crusade could proceed.  According to one attendee, ``They said it was important for the Senate to change the ground rules, and there was no obligation to confirm someone just because they are scholarly and erudite.''  Well, let's think about that for a moment. Why do you suppose they believed they needed to ``change the ground rules'' for confirming judges? It is because up to that point you didn't filibuster judges. You just didn't. You heard the majority leader speak to that point in his short remarks this morning about how things have changed after more than 200 years.  Well, as it happened, less than a month after the caucus retreat, Senator Jeffords from Vermont switched parties and began caucusing with the That threw the majority to the Democrats for the next 18 months. Then they lost the election of 2002, and in the spring of 2003, Republicans were back in the majority.  Now back in the minority, Senate Democrats went ahead with the plans that were enunciated at that retreat to ``change the ground rules.'' For the first time in the history of the Senate, they began to systematically filibuster circuit court nominees--not because they believed the nominees weren't qualified. The nominees were qualified. And it was not because they believed the nominees didn't have the necessary experience. The nominees did have the necessary experience. They filibustered those nominees because they believed they were conservative judges.  So with respect to appellate court nominees, Senate Democrats, at the behest of the far left, took the unprecedented step of using the filibuster in a very systematic way for the first time in Senate history. At the time, there was a lot of debate about changing the rules, dubbed the so-called nuclear option, so that nominees would be afforded an up-or-down vote, consistent with the Senate's history and practice.  Well, Republicans exercised restraint and agreed to step back. Then President Obama became Our side didn't like the use of a filibuster for judges, but we also didn't think there should be two sets of rules--one for a Republican President and one for a Democratic Common sense tells you that is a legitimate position to take.  We defeated two circuit court nominees, one to the Ninth Circuit and one to the DC Then President Obama nominated three individuals to the DC Our side denied cloture on those three nominees to the DC  Well, at that point, their side didn't like playing by the rules they wrote, so then-Majority Leader Reid took another unprecedented step. In November of 2013, he utilized the so-called nuclear option to eliminate the very tactic they pioneered. The nuclear option becomes effectively the regroup.  So that is how the filibuster was first used on lower court nominees and later eliminated. Senate Democrats took the unprecedented step to utilize that. Then when it no longer benefited them, they used unprecedented means to eliminate it.  This brings me back to where we are today and the rest of this week--talking about a Supreme Court nominee, Judge  Everyone knows we had a big debate last year about whether to proceed with the Garland nomination. There were 52 Republicans who believed we should follow Senate history and tradition and not proceed with the nomination in the middle of a heated election year.  I know it frustrates my colleagues to hear me say it, but fact is that in 1992, when then-Senator Biden was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he announced that he wouldn't hold a hearing to fill a vacancy in the last year of President Bush's term. So last year, we followed the precedent that then-Senator Biden described in 1992 for all of the same reasons he discussed.  You get back to this commonsense principle: Can you have one rule for Republican Presidents and another rule for Democratic Presidents? We didn't feel you could. And, of course, everyone in this Chamber knows that if the shoe were on the other foot, the Democrats would have done the same thing, because they said they would. In fact, President Obama's former White House Counsel admitted as much. She said she would have recommended the same course of action if the tables were turned.  So now here we are, April 2017, with the nominee before us. Just as in 2001, we have just had a very contentious Presidential election. It was close. It was hard fought, and frankly, some on[[Page S2305]]the hard left refused to accept the results of the election. Once again, leftwing groups are egging on the minority leader to take another unprecedented step with respect to judicial nominations. Only this time they want him to lead the very first partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nomination in U.history. Based on the vote we had yesterday, it appears 44 Democrats are prepared to follow the minority leader on this fool's errand. No Supreme Court nomination in our country's entire history has ever failed because of a partisan filibuster. There is no getting around that fact.  Abe Fortas, whom I have referred to, was subjected to a bipartisan filibuster over ethical concerns when President Johnson tried to elevate him to be Chief  Justice Thomas was confirmed by a vote of 52 to 48. I was here for that nomination. A single Senator--any Senator--could have demanded a cloture vote, but out of 100 Senators, none did. Why? For the simple, commonsense fact and 200 years of history that you don't filibuster a Supreme Court nomination.  But today is entirely different. The minority is committed to filibustering this fine nominee in the first partisan filibuster in U.history.  So here we are. The President has nominated an exceptionally qualified judge to take Justice Scalia's seat on the Supreme The Democrats will break new ground again by conducting a partisan filibuster of the nominee. Republicans aren't the ones breaking new ground here. As a matter of fact, the Democrats' own Vice Presidential nominee last year emphatically promised that the Democrats would further change the rules to make sure an expected-President Clinton's nominees couldn't be filibustered.  So at the end of the day, the fact is that if Democrats insist on a filibuster, the Republicans will insist on following the practice that Senators have followed for more than 200 years, and that is not to have a partisan filibuster for somebody going to the Supreme We don't conduct partisan filibusters of Supreme Court nominees, and we certainly are not going to start with this highly qualified nominee.  I hope those that think back 16 or 17 years--when this meeting of Democrats in retreat came to the conclusion that you had to break new ground--realize that they have poisoned the well of the comity traditional of the I think maybe a lot of them realize that was a mistake, as we realized that was a mistake, and it would be nice to get back to the comity of the Senate that existed on judges prior to 15 or 16 years ago. But that is going to take people on their side who were present at that same retreat who are still in the U.Senate to drill a new well, because the present one is poisoned, and we need to get back to the comity that we have had.

In early 2011, just after I was elected attorney general of California, I went in for a checkup. It had been a while since I had seen her. Chrystal asked me how I had been, and I asked her how she had been, and then she shared with me great news. She was pregnant.  As a dental hygienist, she was working for a few different dentists and wasn't on the payroll of any of them as a full-time employee. This was before the ACA was in place, so Chrystal was on private insurance with only basic coverage, just enough to cover her annual exams.  When Chrystal found out she was pregnant, she went to her insurance company to apply for prenatal coverage. She was denied. When I asked her why, she told me that they said she had a preexisting condition. So you can imagine I asked her: Are you OK? What is wrong? What is the preexisting condition?  She told me she was pregnant.  When she applied to another healthcare company for insurance, again, she was denied. Why? Preexisting condition. What was it? She was pregnant.  So this young woman was forced to go into her sixth month of pregnancy before she received a sonogram. Instead, thankfully, there was a free clinic in San Francisco, so she could get her prenatal care.  Thank God she had a strong and beautiful baby boy. His name is They are both doing well today.  Thank God that situation is no longer the reality for millions of  I share Chrystal's story to remind us what America's healthcare system looked like only a few years ago.  We should not forget that before the ACA, 48 million Americans lacked health insurance. That is more people than the entire country of  Before the ACA, when these people got sick, they had three choices: Go without treatment, go to the emergency room, or go broke.  Before the ACA, 129 million people--almost one out of every two Americans--could be denied insurance coverage because of preexisting conditions. And the minute you got sick, your insurer could dig up some flimsy reason to drop your coverage. You could be denied coverage for chemotherapy or insulin if you had cancer or diabetes. You could be denied prenatal coverage if you were pregnant, like You could even be denied health coverage if you were a victim of domestic violence.  Before the ACA, healthcare costs were crushing low-income and middle-class Premiums--which, of course, are those monthly bills that we all pay for our insurance--were going up and up. Sky-high medical bills were the 1 reason Americans went broke, causing them to sell their homes, their cars, and even pawn their jewelry to pay off their debts.  One of the worst things about facing the healthcare system without coverage before the ACA was that it left you feeling utterly alone. Most Americans know what I am talking about: that knot in your stomach when you know there is something wrong with your health or the health of your child or your parent, but you are not sure what it is, whether it can be fixed or whether your insurance will cover it, and the frustration, the anger as you try to make sense of the fine print and codes on the medical bill that has so many zeros.  How many of us have walked into an emergency room with a loved one and felt time just stop? Maybe it was with your child who was running a fever or having trouble breathing. Maybe your partner is being rushed in with a possible heart attack. All you will know is that something is wrong. All you know is that you are overwhelmed and scared, and you know that you should not also have to fight on the phone with an insurance company or wonder if a doctor will even see you at all. That is how millions and millions of Americans experienced our healthcare system.  It was not right or fair. So the ACA set out to make things better, and 7 years ago today, President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law. It finally extended good, affordable health insurance to Americans like Chrystal all across the Vice President Biden was absolutely right when, at the time, he said that it was a ``big''--and then I will not quote the next word; let's call it blanking--``deal.''  It is a shame that people have been playing politics with this law and with America's health. The former Speaker of the House said that the ACA would be ``Armageddon.'' A Republican Presidential candidate who now sits in the Cabinet called the ACA--and these are his actual words--``the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.''  Earlier this month, the President of the United States tweeted that the ACA is ``a complete and total disaster.'' Well, I say: Tell that to the people of California because when a State wants to make the ACA work, it works--whether that is California or Kentucky, and real people living real lives know it.  For example, I recently heard from Myra from Sherman Oaks, CA, who was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer. She wrote:       Before ObamaCare, my husband and I lived under constant      stress due to our lack of good health insurance.  But, because of the ACA, Myra told me:       We had a Silver Blue Shield plan that covered . . . well      over a million dollars in bills to date. I am happy to report      I am now well, but without insurance, I was facing a death      sentence. Without the ACA, we would certainly have had to      sell our home to pay my bills and try to figure out how to      make ends meet.  She wrote that it covered well over a million dollars. That is what the ACA does.  Here is how Cindy of from Oakley, CA, has experienced real life. She wrote:       My daughter was diagnosed with an eating disorder at 13      years old and I can directly thank the excellent care      received at Kaiser Northern California for her good health      today at age 17. Without the ACA and the mental health parity      it helps provide . . . I would not have had treatment options      available to me.  Again, coverage for mental health treatment--that is what the ACA does.  Honoree, a single mom from Samoa, CA, living with a spinal cord injury that has kept her from working for 3\1/2\ years, wrote to me and said:       I wanted to let you know that I love ObamaCare! My      healthcare has steadily improved since the ACA was enacted. .      . . I can't tell you how AMAZING it felt to get my teeth      cleaned and cared for after waiting more than a decade.       I walked around for weeks saying, ``thanks, ObamaCare!''      whenever I sensed how good my teeth felt.       I would be saddened to see the ACA get scrapped. It's made      a huge difference in our lives. Actually, I'd be more than      saddened, I'd be very scared.  Again, this is testimony about the ACA, in this case about dental coverage and improved healthcare. That is what the ACA does.  I will state that I believe there is a huge disconnect between the over-the-top criticism of the ACA and the law's actual impact. There is a disconnect between the politics and how people are actually living and thriving under the In fact, in a recent poll, one in three Americans didn't even realize that the ACA and ObamaCare were actually the same thing, and they are. So, everybody, let's be clear about this. The Affordable Care Act is ObamaCare, and ObamaCare is the Affordable Care  We all know, of course, that there are ways to improve the ACA, but ending it is not the answer. The truth is that the ACA has largely done what it was supposed to do--expand, protect, and reduce--expand coverage, protect consumers, and reduce the pace of rising healthcare costs. Thanks to the ACA and Medicaid expansion, 20 million[[Page S1953]]more Americans have health insurance. That is the population of the entire State of New Thanks to the ACA, premiums are going up at the slowest rate in half a century. Thanks to the ACA, doctors are innovating and providing better preventive care, from keeping people out of the hospital to delivering healthier babies. Thanks to the ACA, insurers cannot set lifetime limits on your care, meaning your insurance company won't tell you in the middle of a cancer treatment that they have paid all they ever will. Thanks to the ACA, millions of underserved Americans in rural towns and in cities and everywhere in between have access to care for the first time. Thanks to the ACA, young people can stay on their parents' insurance until they are 26. Thanks to the ACA, 55 million women have insurance that works--mammograms, checkups, and birth control with no copays. When you pick up your prescription at the pharmacy and see that the bill is zero dollars, well, that is the And thanks to the ACA, you can't be discriminated against if you have a preexisting condition, including that preexisting condition called being a woman.  Of course, navigating the healthcare system is still daunting, but things are better. There are now some rules of the road to keep insurance companies from taking advantage of you during some of life's most vulnerable moments. Because of the ACA, because of ObamaCare, you can sleep a little easier at night and know that your care will be there when you need it.  Let's fast-forward to today. Today, we mark the seventh anniversary of this historic life-changing law. But all that it covers and protects could also be ripped away, and that is because of the American Health Care Act, the Republican healthcare plan on the House side. That is what it will do--rip it all away.  They have done their best to mislead folks about their plan. They have criticized objective news reports, and they even questioned the Congressional Budget Office--which, as we know, is, by the way, a nonpartisan, independent office which crunched the numbers and found that this new plan would cause millions of Americans to lose insurance coverage.  Before we leap on to this new bill, let's all ask some key questions. Let's all take a good look at what this plan really would and would not do.  First, will this bill provide insurance for everybody, as President Trump promised? Well, the answer is no. In fact, the independent Congressional Budget Office says that under the GOP plan, 24 million Americans will lose their health insurance by the end of the decade. That is equal to the population of 15 States combined.  Who are these people? These are middle-class families, our Nation's teachers, veterans, truckdrivers, nurses, and farmers. These families include those who struggle with opioid addiction, have a child that needs support for autism, or have an aging parent who needs a nursing home. This bill threatens them all.  Let's ask: Will the plan help the folks who need care most? The answer is no. The House Republican plan's flat tax credits are based only on age, with no consideration of income level. So what that means is that a 40-year-old cashier making $10,000 gets the exact same amount as the 40-year-old banker making $74,000 a year. It doesn't matter whether you live in downtown Manhattan or the Cleveland suburbs or rural  Let's ask: Will monthly costs go down for low-income and middle-class families who are stretched horribly thin right now? The answer is no. According to that same independent analysis, the Republican plan will immediately increase American families' premiums by 15 to 20 percent, with higher deductibles and out-of-pocket costs after that. In the next decade, a person in their fifties could see their insurance costs go up 850 percent. Their insurance costs can go up 850 percent.  Let's ask: What about our seniors--will their monthly costs go down? Sadly, the answer is no. The Republican plan lets insurers charge seniors five times as much as other Americans, meaning that high cholesterol your doctor diagnosed could cost you $3,200 more a month.  Let's ask: Will all women still have access to affordable family planning? The answer is no. This new bill will give Americans choice in healthcare, but the women of America will not have choice. The bill denies women tax credits if they get a plan that covers abortions. It prohibits Planned Parenthood from providing care for millions on Some 2.5 million patients choose Planned Parenthood every year, including roughly 1 million in They should be able to see the provider they choose and trust.  Let's ask: Will this new plan protect Medicaid, as President Trump promised? Well, the answer is no. Medicaid covers many people whose jobs don't offer healthcare, and it also pays for half of all the births in this It supports people with disabilities and children with special needs. Most people don't realize that Medicaid is the primary payer for treatment of opioid addiction and substance abuse. But this new plan being offered by House Republicans would roll back Medicaid coverage and cut nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid benefits over the next decade.  Let's ask: Does the plan put American families ahead of insurance companies? The answer, tragically, is no. Under this plan, if you lose your job and it takes more than 2 months to find another, you will be charged a 30-percent penalty on top of the monthly costs you are already paying. That money goes right into the insurance company's pockets.  So, by now, you are probably wondering: Who exactly does this bill help? Well, here is your answer. It gives millionaires a $50,000 average tax cut every year. It gives the top 0.1 percent in this country a $195,000 tax cut every year. It gives insurance companies a $145 billion tax break over the next decade. The President and the Speaker want you to believe that this plan is good for American families, but under their bill, the only thing that gets healthier are the insurance companies' bottom line.  As far as California is concerned, this bill would devastate our families. Here are the facts, and, frankly, here is the fight. Over 5 million Californians have received insurance through the Affordable Care I say they are worth fighting for.  Since the ACA went into effect, California's uninsured population has been cut almost in half, from 17 percent to about 7 percent. I say they are worth fighting for.  Medi-Cal went from covering 8.5 million Americans to 13.5 million today. One in two children are covered under I say they are worth fighting for.  The community clinics and health centers that so many Californians rely on would be cut back or closed. I say they are worth fighting for.  A UC Berkeley study estimates that repealing the ACA would cost California up to 200,000 jobs, everyone from home healthcare aides and janitors to workers in retail, restaurants, and accounting. I say they are worth fighting for.  I rise today to emphasize that it is really important that we understand the everyday consequences of this bill. We are talking about real people. If you are a farmer in the Central Valley on Medicaid, you can lose that coverage. If you are a Los Angeles senior with diabetes, you may no longer be able to afford coverage on the individual market. If you are a family in Shasta County with a child dealing with a prescription drug addiction, substance abuse treatment likely will not be covered. If you are a couple in Humboldt County with an ailing parent, your request for home health services could be denied. These are the kinds of Californians and the kinds of Americans who this plan would hurt.  When these folks wake up at 3 a.m. worrying about an ache or pain or their next chemo appointment, when they wake up with that concern and that thought at 3 a.m., I promise you, they are not thinking about that through the lens of being a Republican or a They think about themselves as fathers, mothers, parents, daughters and sons, and grandparents. They worry about their health needs and how their health needs will affect not only themselves but their loved ones. These concerns are not about politics. These are universal concerns, and we have all been there.  It is because all of us share these concerns and because all of us would be badly harmed by this new plan that[[Page S1954]]this bill is opposed by the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, the American Nurses Association, the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society, the American Diabetes Association, and the They are the most respected medical and patient advocacy groups in this country, and they know what is at stake.  Ultimately, I believe this bill is not just about medicine or math; I believe this is about morals. The plan that the House is voting on today is a values statement, and it is not a good one. As our former President said about the ACA, this is more than just about healthcare; it is about the character of our country, and it is about whether or not we look out for one another.  I think we need to take a good, hard look in the mirror and ask: Who are we as a country? Are we a country that cuts the deficit by cutting care for our most vulnerable?  Let's look in the mirror and ask: Are we a country that gives tax breaks to insurers while giving higher medical bills to patients?  Are we a country that tells seniors and cancer patients and women ``You are on your own''?  Are we a country that sees healthcare as a privilege for a few or a right for all?  I believe that is what we have to decide.  The ACA is not perfect. It can be strengthened, and I am willing to work with anyone who will work in good faith to do that, but it is time to stop playing politics with public health.  Our government has three main functions: public safety, public education, and public health. We shouldn't be turning these responsibilities into partisan issues. Instead, we should be figuring out how to improve the lives of all Americans, whether we are Democrats, Republicans, or  People are counting on us, people like one of my constituents in Kern County--a woman who is suffering from lung disease, who said:       We are not asking for much . . . decent healthcare. . . .      Don't take it away. . . . Make it better.  I say to my colleagues: Do not take away American people's healthcare. Let's make it better.  I yield the floor.

4344,topic-id,342,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Congressman Gallagher for his bipartisan leadership on the term limits initiative, and my friend General Bergman for his leadership on this issue.  I don't think term limits are a partisan issue. The Economist had an article that the turnover rate in the people's House is less than European monarchies. European nobility turnover is at a faster rate. Incumbency reelection is 96 percent. When folks say, ``Why can't you just vote people out of office,'' it is not looking at the actual statistics. Ninety-six percent of folks here are reelected, and that is not what our Founders intended.  James Madison and Alexander Hamilton agreed: ``The security intended to the general liberty consists in the frequent election and in the rotation of the Members of Congress.''  They envisioned a place where people would come, serve, and go back home to their communities.  Thomas Jefferson said that people ought to live, lawmakers ought to live under the laws that they pass. The only way we get back to our founding ideals is if we pass some version of term limits so that people do their public service, and then return to the communities where they reside.  This bill on term limits is really a move against political dynasty, and that is one thing that this election showed us people really were not for. They don't like the idea of a few families, or people connected, holding the reins of power.  Let me end with someone who I think summed this up so eloquently, which is Barbara Bush, our former First She said: ``If we can't find more than two or three families to run for high office, that's silly, because there are great governors and great eligible people to run. And I think that the Kennedys, Clintons, Bushes, there are just more families than that.''  This is from Barbara Bush, who understood the essence of democracy is to have new voices, new families, new ideas.

The legislation before us today is the same legislative text as H.1301, which was able to gather over 100 bipartisan cosponsors and passed the House by voice vote in the 114th  The intent of this legislation is to remedy current law which prohibits the use of any antenna for amateur radio operators in certain areas with no consideration for the emergency ramifications that come about as a result. For some, this is merely a nuisance, but for others--those who use[[Page H583]]their amateur radio licenses for emergency communications--a dangerous situation has been established by limiting the ability of hams to create effective communications for those in need.  For example, during times of emergency service, such as following a hurricane or a tornado, amateur radio operators are able to use their skills and equipment to create a network of communications that are utilized by first responders when other wired or wireless networks are taken down or are otherwise unavailable. This is a vital and lifesaving function.  Additionally, there are numerous hams that take their certifications even further by purchasing expensive equipment and going through extensive training to become part of MARS, the Military Auxiliary Radio I have personally used this system as a pilot in the military. What is amazing about MARS is that it gives our military members the ability to communicate both domestically and abroad when other systems are not available or are simply not able to establish communications the way that these hams are able to do.  MARS members are able to accomplish this not only due to their extensive training and knowledge, but due to their commitment to this program. MARS members must not only have access to expensive high-frequency radio equipment, but they must also file monthly reports and participate in a minimum of 12 hours of radio activity each quarter in order to stay in compliance with the requirements of this program. This is a great service provided by these individuals, and it is my hope that we can get even more amateur radio operators involved in the future with the passage of this bill.  Again, the purpose of this bipartisan legislation is to change current regulations hampering the ability of amateur radio operators to effectively communicate in certain areas, while respecting and maintaining the rights of local communities in which many of these hams reside. It is my hope that by passing this bipartisan legislation early in this session of Congress, that we will be able to get this legislation through the Senate and to the President's desk in short order.  Mr.Speaker, I urge support of this bill, and I thank all my friends who helped work with me on this.  ",CREC-2017-01-23-pt1-PgH581.txt,2014,INAUGURAL CEREMONY,2017.0,23.0,March

This plan would strip millions of working families of their health care, cut benefits for millions more, and increase premiums for older Americans by 25 percent. It would ravage our economy by destabilizing the healthcare sector and pushing State and local governments to the brink of bankruptcy.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.  The text of the bill is as follows:                                H.555       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT       This Act may be cited as the ``Amateur Radio Parity Act of      2017''.     2.       Congress finds the following:       (1) More than 730,000 radio amateurs in the United States      are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission in the      amateur radio services.       (2) Amateur radio, at no cost to taxpayers, provides a      fertile ground for technical self-training in modern      telecommunications, electronics technology, and emergency      communications techniques and protocols.       (3) There is a strong Federal interest in the effective      performance of amateur stations established at the residences      of licensees. Such stations have been shown to be frequently      and increasingly precluded by unreasonable private land use      restrictions, including restrictive covenants.       (4) Federal Communications Commission regulations have for      three decades prohibited the application to stations in the      amateur service of State and local regulations that preclude      or fail to reasonably accommodate amateur service      communications, or that do not constitute the minimum      practicable regulation to accomplish a legitimate State or      local purpose. Commission policy has been and is to require      States and localities to permit erection of a station antenna      structure at heights and dimensions sufficient to accommodate      amateur service communications.       (5) The Commission has sought guidance and direction from      Congress with respect to the application of the Commission's      limited preemption policy regarding amateur service      communications to private land use restrictions, including      restrictive covenants.       (6) There are aesthetic and common property considerations      that are uniquely applicable to private land use regulations      and the community associations obligated to enforce      covenants, conditions, and restrictions in deed-restricted      communities. These considerations are dissimilar to those      applicable to State law and local ordinances regulating the      same residential amateur radio facilities.       (7) In recognition of these considerations, a separate      Federal policy than exists at section 97.15(b) of title 47,      Code of Federal Regulations, is warranted concerning amateur      service communications in deed-restricted communities.       (8) Community associations should fairly administer private      land use regulations in the interest of their communities,      while nevertheless permitting the installation and      maintenance of effective outdoor amateur radio antennas.      There exist antenna designs and installations that can be      consistent with the aesthetics and physical characteristics      of land and structures in community associations while      accommodating communications in the amateur radio services.     3. APPLICATION OF PRIVATE LAND USE RESTRICTIONS TO                    AMATEUR       (a) Amendment of FCC Rules.--Not later than 120 days after      the date of the enactment of this Act, the Federal      Communications Commission shall amend section 97.15 of title      47, Code of Federal Regulations, by adding a new paragraph      that prohibits the application to amateur stations of any      private land use[[Page H582]]     restriction, including a restrictive covenant, that--       (1) on its face or as applied, precludes communications in      an amateur radio service;       (2) fails to permit a licensee in an amateur radio service      to install and maintain an effective outdoor antenna on      property under the exclusive use or control of the licensee;      or       (3) does not constitute the minimum practicable restriction      on such communications to accomplish the lawful purposes of a      community association seeking to enforce such restriction.       (b) Additional Requirements.--In amending its rules as      required by subsection (a), the Commission shall--       (1) require any licensee in an amateur radio service to      notify and obtain prior approval from a community association      concerning installation of an outdoor antenna;       (2) permit a community association to prohibit installation      of any antenna or antenna support structure by a licensee in      an amateur radio service on common property not under the      exclusive use or control of the licensee; and       (3) subject to the standards specified in paragraphs (1)      and (2) of subsection (a), permit a community association to      establish reasonable written rules concerning height,      location, size, and aesthetic impact of, and installation      requirements for, outdoor antennas and support structures for      the purpose of conducting communications in the amateur radio      services.     4. AFFIRMATION OF LIMITED PREEMPTION OF STATE AND LOCAL                    LAND USE       The Federal Communications Commission may not change      section 97.15(b) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations,      which shall remain applicable to State and local land use      regulation of amateur service communications.     5.

4574,topic-id,519,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, amateur radio, also known as ham radio, is a fun hobby for enthusiasts who use it to communicate with people around the world while teaching themselves the basics of communications technology. But more importantly, amateur radio operators utilize their skills to provide essential communication services to first responders when the conventional networks go down in times of emergency.  In order to be eligible to operate an amateur radio station, individuals must obtain a license from the FCC and comply with the FCC's rules. One such requirement is that individuals must own and install the equipment needed to operate a station. This includes a transceiver, transmission lines, and an antenna. Currently, there are more than 730,000 amateur radio operators licensed in the United States, including a number of active clubs in New Jersey, the State I represent in the  Because communications equipment provides a societal benefit and is a critical part of our Nation's infrastructure, the FCC prohibits land use restrictions imposed by governments or homeowners' associations on certain communications equipment. However, these protections do not extend to amateur radio equipment.  Roughly 90 percent of new housing in the United States is subject to deed restrictions, homeowners' associations, and other land use limitations. This is increasingly making the installation of amateur radio equipment more challenging.  Amateur radio operators have a history and tradition of being ready, willing, and able to lend their services during times of emergencies at no cost to taxpayers. Due to the nature and structure of amateur radio, hams are able to link communications between first responders using their own networks and equipment.  The only necessity for amateur radio stations, however, is some form of outdoor antenna. For this group of unsung heroes with a long tradition of public service when it is needed most, Congress should help deter barriers to their operation. H.555 would extend the FCC protections over limitations on communications equipment to include amateur radio equipment.  Now, while I have described the critical role that amateur radio plays during times of disaster, I also understand the concerns shared by homeowners' associations that this bill will expose their neighborhoods to big towers and antennas. This bill recognizes that there needs to be a balance between the right of homeowners and their associations with the rights of amateur radio operators. That is why Mr.Kinzinger's bill passed without objection twice last Congress and enjoys the support of both the amateur radio community and the Community Associations I congratulate our distinguished colleague from Illinois on working with both sides on this critical issue.  Mr.Speaker, there was much discussion and hard work that went into this bill in order to strike the right balance between the rights of the amateur radio community and the concerns of homeowners' associations. Both sides were willing to compromise, and we are considering a good bill today because of that compromise. I hope all of our colleagues will support this bipartisan piece of legislation that I believe is critical to the safety of the American  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Since then, I have seen our country slide into new wars. I have seen scandals that have consumed this town and our I have seen horrific terrorist attacks that have shaken our country to its core, from Oklahoma City to 9/11, and others. All of these events, in different ways, have tested our country. But I have never seen a threat to our democratic institutions like I see today.  There is still much we do not know about Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election, but what we do know is deeply disturbing. Last night, reports indicated that there is evidence that certain Trump officials coordinated the release of hacked documents with Russian officials. And on Monday the FBI Director confirmed that the FBI has been investigating possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia since July of last year.  Already, the Intelligence Community has made public its conclusion that Russian President Putin waged a multifaceted influence campaign to delegitimize Secretary Clinton and help Donald Trump win the Worse, he intended to undermine public faith in our democratic process. What is even worse is that this interference did not end on November 8, election day. It is ongoing. That--whether you are a Republican or a Democrat--should concern every  According to the Intelligence Community, President Putin will continue using cyber-attacks and propaganda campaigns to undermine our future elections. This is nothing less than an attack on our democracy. It should outrage all Americans, no matter what their political affiliation, and we need to know all the facts.  Frankly, my experience here tells me we need a thorough, independent investigation. We need to send a clear message to President Putin that America, our country--the country that the Presiding Officer and I revere--will not tolerate future efforts to manipulate our most sacred democratic process, our elections.  All of us here know that President Trump is not going to lead such an investigation. He is not going to deliver this message. The President, unfortunately, spent much of the 2016 campaign supportive of President Then-Candidate Trump refused to call on Russia to stop meddling in our election, saying: ``I'm not going to tell Putin what to do.'' He even encouraged Russian hacking on live television, pleading: ``Russia, if you're listening, I hope you'll be able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.'' It is unprecedented. No candidate, in my memory, of either party has ever called on another country to interfere in our elections that way.  This was occurring as the President was claiming to have had no role in weakening the Republican Party's official position on Russia's incursion into Of course, we have now learned that this was false, and his campaign played a central role in softening his party's stance on  I do not know why the President is so enthralled with President Vladimir Putin, a man who has shown such disregard for personal rights, even as he has made himself one of the wealthiest people in the world. It may be simply because Russia is heavily invested in the Trump brand. Years before the President denied having any financial relationships with the Russians, his son admitted that Russians own a disproportionate share of Trump assets, saying: ``We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.'' Now, just how invested Moscow is in Trump is not known. The President broke with precedent of both Republicans and Democrats and did not release his tax returns. But I imagine there would be quite a sigh of relief if the only secret in the President's full tax returns were that he did not pay his share of taxes and paid far less than the average  The President, though, is not the only one in his administration incapable of telling the truth when it comes to His Attorney General provided testimony that was not true before the Senate Judiciary Committee in response to questions from me and Senator Franken about Russian contacts, and we know his first National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, resigned after lying to Vice President Pence about his conversations with the Russian  President Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, also resigned after questions were raised about his extensive activities in Russia and Of course, now it has been reported that Mr.Manafort earned $10 million per year for secret work on behalf of  Another former adviser, Roger Stone, had early warning of the release of hacked documents.

There is so much smoke here that it is getting hard to breathe. The President unfortunately continues to make matters worse. This week alone, he continued his untruth about President Obama personally ordering a wiretap of Trump Tower, something everybody knows is not true. I think members of his own administration's inner circle are embarrassed every time he persists in this.  On Monday, the President ramped up his own influence campaign to undermine the integrity of this investigation, tweeting ``fake news'' as the Director of the FBI prepared to testify under oath in the House of  Now, I have no reason to doubt the integrity of the FBI's investigation thus far, but I have every reason to believe it is eventually going to be at risk. That is why we need somebody independent--independent of the Congress, independent of the administration. We need an independent special prosecutor to lead this investigation and to ultimately decide whether there is sufficient evidence to prosecute. A special prosecutor would not report to the Attorney General, who himself is a witness to this investigation. And a special prosecutor, unlike the Attorney General or even the FBI Director, cannot be fired by the  I have thought long and hard about this. I went on my experience here with administrations beginning with President Gerald Ford straight through to today. It takes a lot of thought to call for a special prosecutor, but this is one where we need it, where the American people have to have somebody they can trust outside Republicans, Democrats, and the Congress, and certainly outside the administration.  Our Nation is at a precipice. We can either confront what happened in our election and get to the bottom of it with an independent investigation and make sure it never happens again. Or we can just pretend this is another Washington scandal and allow it to be filtered through a familiar partisan lens. That would be a terrible mistake. In all my years here, I have never seen a time when another country--one that has shown its animosity toward us--has tried to interfere in our elections. If Russia can get away with interfering with our elections, what else can they interfere with in our democratic Nation? They do not share the ideals we do. They do not allow free elections. They do not allow freedom of expression. They do not allow their people to speak out. Why would anyone think that they would have America's interests at heart?  Today we have a counterintelligence investigation into the campaign of a sitting There is evidence that this campaign colluded with a foreign adversary to impact our Presidential election. This is not normal. We must not treat it as such. I would feel this way no matter who had won the election--no matter if they were Democrat or Republican, because it goes beyond one party.  President Putin's goal last year was to undermine our democratic institutions--to corrode American's trust and faith in government, something that has sustained us through two World Wars, through a Civil War, through all the other problems this Nation has faced. That trust should sustain us long after every one of us in this body are gone.  This is a responsibility that we as Senators have to our great Nation: not to think of ourselves for the moment, but to think where this Nation is 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, and 100 years from now. We must do that. We owe that to the American people. Republicans and Democrats alike, we owe it[[Page S1951]]to the American people. We take an oath to uphold our  We come here, all of us--and I have great respect for every Senator here in both parties--we come here hoping to do the best for our Our Nation is in peril. All of us would stand together if we had an adversary attack us. All of us would stand together if somebody declared war on us. We have done that in the past. We did that after Pearl We did that other times in our Nation's history. Well, because this is done quietly behind the scenes, it is a great attack on us.  As I said, President Putin's goal last year was to undermine our democratic institutions--to corrode Americans' trust and faith in our government, no matter who is If we do not get to the bottom of Russian interference, he will no doubt be successful. And if anybody doubts it, if he is successful, he will try it again.  That is why we should stand united and call for a truly independent investigation. The American people deserve nothing less.

4395,topic-id,376,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in full support of bipartisan legislation that would increase transparency and congressional oversight of U.basic education programs around the world.  H.601, the Reinforcing Education Accountability in Development--READ--Act, which I introduced with my colleague, Representative David Reichert, would elevate the importance of education while improving USAID's efforts and ensuring that taxpayer dollars are well spent.  The challenge is clear. Nearly 60 million primary school-age children and 65 million adolescents are out of school around the world. Millions more are expected to never enroll. Women and girls are disproportionately out of school. The United States has a clear moral, economic, and security interest in promoting universal basic education as a fundamental human right.  The bill before us today enhances Congress' oversight of USAID's work with foreign governments, NGOs, and multilateral organizations to help nations develop and implement quality programs, address key barriers to school attendance, and increase completion rates for the poorest and most vulnerable children worldwide. It calls on USAID to develop a comprehensive strategy and appoint a senior coordinator tasked with ensuring that our programs expand access to millions of children who are not in school and improve the quality of education for millions who are.  These efforts will not only help students read and write, they will ultimately help protect vulnerable children from poverty, disease, hunger, and even extremism.  There is no greater force multiplier than education. An education is the fundamental tool with which girls and boys are empowered to increase their economic potential, improve their health outcomes, provide for their families, address cultural biases, participate in their communities, and contribute to democratic societies.  First introduced in 2004 and passed by the House last year, the bill before us today represents many years of hard work to elevate the importance of global education, bipartisan compromise, and the support of over 30 nonprofit and advocacy organizations, including RESULTS, the ONE Campaign, the Basic Education Coalition, the Global Campaign for Education, Global Citizen, the Malala Fund, and many other vital partners.  In closing, I thank Chairman Royce, Ranking Member Engel, their hardworking staff--Joan, Jessica, Janice, and Mark, and, of course, Marin Stein, who has been working around the clock on this bill.

They sent me here to repeal ObamaCare, our health system. Our health insurance system is crushing those that it is supposed to help.  They sent me here to remove Washington bureaucrats from the healthcare business and to restore the doctor-patient relationship that has broken down. If ObamaCare has shown us anything, it is that coverage and affordable care are two very different things.  They sent me here for sweeping tax reform that benefits every American, to create a tax structure that rewards American workers and American businesses.

4407,topic-id,1537,"Mr.President, today, we are truly in a historic fight, a fight to protect one of the most treasured and revered American values--our right to privacy. Make no mistake, our privacy has never been more in danger, and the American public knows it.  The American public knows its privacy is in danger when a smart TV can listen to its most intimate living room conversations--your conversations with your children, with your parents, with your spouse.  The American public knows its privacy is in danger when it seems that every day there is a hack on the databases of one of our country's largest companies--Yahoo!, Target, Home Depot, JPMorgan  The American public knows its privacy is in danger when the Russian surveillance machine--firing on all cylinders--hacks the U.election, threatening to undermine our sacred democratic system.  The American public knows its privacy is in danger when both Chambers of Congress hold countless hearings, launch investigations, and receive briefings on the rapidly growing cybersecurity threat to our Nation and the impact both on our national security and to the public.  The American public wants us to do more to protect its privacy. The American public wants us to do more to protect its sensitive information. Yet what do the Republicans in Congress want to do today on the Senate floor? They want to make it easier for Americans' sensitive information to be used, shared, and sold without their permission.  Today, the Republicans are seeking a vote on a Congressional Review Act resolution that would allow Comcast, Verizon, Charter, AT&T, and other broadband companies to take control away from consumers and relentlessly collect and sell their sensitive information without the consent of that family.  That is sensitive information about your health, about your finances, even about your children. They want to track your location and draw a map of where you shop, where you work, where you eat, where your children go to school, and then sell that information to data brokers or anyone else who wants to make a profit off of you.  They want to document how many times you search online for heart disease, breast cancer, opioid addiction treatments, or AIDS treatment, and then sell that information to your insurance company. They want to know what games your teenagers play or shows they watch so they can then target ads to your family--and all of this done without your consent.  What the Republicans are bringing to the floor today is going to basically change the definition of ``ISP''--internet service provider--to ``information sold for profit.'' It will stand for ``invading subscriber privacy.''  President Trump, himself, is outraged about fake violations of his own privacy, but we should all be alarmed by this very real violation of privacy that will occur today if the Senate decides to roll back these important consumer protections.  Here on the Senate floor, the Republicans are fighting to make it easier for your broadband provider to use and sell that same type of information--remarkably detailed and sensitive dossiers of information about you, your kids, your parents, your grandparents--320 million  The Republicans are trying to rescind the Federal Communications Commission's broadband privacy rules, which simply require your cable, wireless, or telephone company provider to obtain consumer consent before using or sharing subscribers' personal information; promote transparency by disclosing what they collect about internet and wireless users; and adopt data security protections and notify consumers if a breach occurs.  That is it. That is what this whole debate is all about--whether consumers, not the broadband providers, have control over their sensitive information.  The big broadband companies and their Republican allies say we need a light touch regulatory framework to protect Americans' broadband privacy--a light touch approach, like with the Federal Trade Commission, which does not prescribe actual privacy rules. The Federal Trade Commission only enforces the privacy policies companies create for themselves, and then they bring an enforcement action if a company violates its own very low standards, but if Comcast's or AT&T's or Verizon's policy is that you have no privacy, there is nothing for anyone to enforce. It would be impossible for the internet service provider to violate its own nonexistent or very low privacy protections.  Let's be clear here. When the broadband behemoths say ``light touch,'' they mean ``hands off.'' They mean hands off their ability to monetize captive consumers' sensitive information.  Let's be clear. When the big broadband barons and their Republican allies are firing their opening salvo in the war on net neutrality, they want broadband privacy protections to be the first victim.  When Republicans say we need to harmonize regulations, they really mean self-regulation. Self-regulation is the ultimate dream of the Republicans, who are beholden to those special interests. They really want to allow broadband companies to write their own privacy rules.  Is this really what the American public wants--a harmonized, light-touch approach to protecting their sensitive information from their broadband providers? Does the American public really want us to allow our broadband companies to ignore reasonable data security practices, making consumers' sensitive information more vulnerable to breaches and unauthorized access?  This resolution does just that. The internet service providers even oppose[[Page S1948]]following reasonable data security practices.  We should know better. The American public wants us to strengthen our privacy protections, not weaken them. The American people do not want their sensitive information collected, used, and sold by any third party, whether that be your broadband provider or a hacker.  At its core, this debate is about our values--our values as a people, our values as a society. While technology has certainly changed, our core values have not changed as a country. For generations, we have valued the right to choose whom we let into our homes, whom we communicate with, whom we share our most sensitive secrets with, but now the Republicans and the broadband industry are telling us that we must forgo those rights just because our homes are connected to the internet and our phones are connected to the internet.  With many Americans across the country having only a couple of broadband providers, at most, to choose from, they will not have the option of changing service providers if their privacy protections are not transparent or robust. And throughout it all, while the internet service providers monetize your personal information, the monthly bill will continue to show up for the service that is siphoning off your sensitive information.  My colleagues, we know the attack on the free and open internet is coming. Net neutrality is on the chopping block, and this is the first step in ensuring that the few and the powerful control the internet. We must stop this today, so I urge my colleagues to join with me.  The fundamental principle here is that every person should have the knowledge that information is being gathered about their families when they use the internet; second, that they have notice from the company that that information is going to be resold to a third party, to someone else, not to the broadband company; and third, that you have the right to say no, that you do not want that information about your family member to be resold.  When we were all younger and the salesman came to the front door and knocked, your mother told you to tell the salesman that they could not come into the house because the privacy of your family did not warrant allowing a stranger into your home. The broadband companies now say: Well, we are in your home, and we are wired in every room, and we now have the right to take all of the information of your family and sell it. What sites do your children go on? What sites do you go on to look for help for the disease that someone in your family might have?  Now the broadband companies say they are coming right through the front door. They are going into every room in your house. The American people have the right to say what they have always said: No, you cannot take those secrets of our family. You cannot take how we use that information.  So this vote that we are about to take in the next couple of hours on the Senate floor goes right to the heart of who we are.  We now hear more about the Russians, and we hear more about companies whose information has been hacked. Then the Republicans are crying their crocodile tears about the compromise of privacy of people in our country, and then they come to the floor and take all of the information online in the family and allow it to be sold as a product. That is just fundamentally wrong. It goes contrary to the values of our country.  I urge very strongly a ``no'' vote from the Members of the Just remember: This is the privacy vote of all time on the Senate floor--of all time--because there has never been anything like the internet going into our homes. No one should be allowed to take all of that information and just sell it without getting their permission.  Mr.President, I urge a ``no'' vote on this resolution.  I yield the floor.

4353,topic-id,7082,"Let's turn to Planned Parenthood Association of Utah v. In August of 2015, Gary Herbert, Utah's Republican Governor, ordered the State to strip $272,000 in Federal funding from the Planned Parenthood Association of Utah in response to a series of highly edited videos that alleged that Planned Parenthood clinics were selling fetal tissue, even though Utah's clinics were not in the video then.  By the way, those videos had been found to be completely doctored, completely inaccurate, completely misleading. But despite the fact that the videos were not authentic and despite the fact that they didn't have any bearing in Utah, Governor Herbert stood by his ruling to carve out and take away funding from Planned So Utah's Planned Parenthood Association filed for a restraining order against the State, saying that the State was not acting justly, so they asked the Court to protect them from unjust action.  In spite of his continued claim that stripping the funding was not to punish the organization for its stance on abortion but in response to the videos--the doctored, inauthentic, discredited videos--the Governor eventually admitted, while responding to Planned Parenthood's motion for a preliminary injunction, that defense of the videos involved different affiliates--not the ones in Utah--that there was not even an accusation that Planned Parenthood in Utah had broken the law--not even an accusation. The organization didn't participate in programs that provided fetal tissue for research, so it was completely disconnected from the operation of Planned Parenthood in that  The background of this is that medical institutions have utilized fetal tissue and there have been charges related to the preparation of that tissue. We could have a whole debate, and we should bring in the medical professionals to understand the details. But in this case, it is irrelevant to have that debate because Planned Parenthood in Utah wasn't part of the fetal tissue research organization. So we don't have to argue over whether fees they have charged for repairing the tissue were fair or unfair because they didn't repair anything. This was all about something else, which was the Governor's decision to launch an attack on Planned Parenthood, punish Planned Parenthood for its constitutionally protected advocacy.  This issue is one which I am sure we will be talking about for years to come. But in the context of the law, a three-judge panel of the Tenth Circuit granted a preliminary injunction on Planned Parenthood, concluding that Utah's Planned Parenthood was operating lawfully and that the Governor's personal opposition to abortion as a motivation for blocking Federal funds and targeting the health organization did violate its constitutional rights.  So when this was decided, neither Planned Parenthood nor the State of Utah sought to have the Tenth Circuit rehear the case en banc, which means all the judges that serve on the Tenth So you had a three-judge panel that made a decision. Neither side of the case--they were like, OK, we are done with this. We are done with this. The practice wasn't even relevant to the association in Utah, not just because the videos were from different States, not just because the videos were doctored and basically illegitimate, but also because they were about a fetal research program that the organization in Utah didn't participate in.  So from every possible direction, both sides said: The judge has ruled, and we understand why. We accept their ruling. But did Judge Gorsuch accept the ruling? He dissented from the court's denial and wanted to grant an en banc review, not at the behest of any litigant, just that Judge Gorsuch didn't like the outcome of the case and wanted to have a full panel in hopes of getting the decision that would defer to Governor Herbert, who wasn't seeking any review because he wanted to strip the organization's funding, even though the organization had done nothing wrong and didn't participate in the program at all. In other words, Judge Gorsuch was willing to ignore court practice and custom and a whole set of facts that showed that the whole decision the Governor made was on the wrong basis--wrong basis on the facts because the videos were doctored, wrong basis on the facts because it wasn't even about the State of Utah, wrong basis on the facts because Planned Parenthood of Utah didn't participate in this research program--wrong on every level.  But Judge Gorsuch wanted to ensure that he could show a case backing Utah's Republican Governor that eliminated funding for Planned That is judicial activism. That is rewriting the law. That is not a judge; that is a legislator. A person who wants to rewrite the law in the frozen trucker case, a person who wants to rewrite the law in the autistic child case, a person who wants to rewrite the law in the Planned Parenthood case should run for office and legislate, not use the courts as your personal strategy for judicial activism; that is, to rewrite the law, the opposite of what the law says.  In the majority's opinion, Judge Mary Briscoe wrote separately to highlight the troubling nature of Gorsuch's dissent. She noted first how ``unusual'' and ``extraordinary''--those are words that she put in--it would be for the Tenth Circuit, on its own motion, to order an en banc review when neither[[Page S2258]]party to a litigation sought such a review. And then she went on, and what did she say about Judge Gorsuch's proposal? She said he ``mischaracterized this litigation and the panel decision at several turns.''  Politics should be in this room, not taking your politics and trying to change the law through judicial activism on the court by turning the law upside down and saying it means X when it clearly states  An unidentified judge--we are not sure who--requested that judges be polled. Again, that would be an unusual situation, apparently, in this context. Another judge in the majority pointed out that none of the parties asked for a hearing within the time permitted, and there was no justification for polling the court on that question at all.  These types of cases give you a sense of how Neil Gorsuch has used his judicial position to rewrite laws. The law says protect the trucker. If the trucker is seeking to pursue safety, he says don't protect the trucker. The law says provide the disabled child with an appropriate education; Neil Gorsuch says no appropriate education is required.  The court says that Planned Parenthood's rights were violated because they were singled out. That is not equality before the law, a very important principle in American jurisprudence. Neither side contested the outcome. It was kind of like, yes, OK, the court got it right. Judge Gorsuch wanted to contest it so he could strip Planned Parenthood of funding on a basis that the Court found to be unconstitutional. That is yet another reason that this hearing, this review of the judge be set aside.  You have these three fundamental reasons. First, for the first time in our history, the seat has been stolen from one Presidency and delivered to another in a strategy to pack the Court, causing tremendous damage to the institution, as well as tremendous damage to this institution, because it involved not exercising our advice and consent responsibility.  By the way, one may wonder, why didn't the majority, rather than stealing the seat, putting it in a time capsule and fast-forwarding it into the next administration in hopes of packing the Court--why didn't they just bring Judge Garland up and vote him down? The Senate has acted to not confirm in roughly a quarter of the nominations that have come forward to us for the Supreme In those election year cases that I put up earlier, the Senate acted in all 15 of the cases that preceded the death of Antonin Scalia, but they didn't confirm in every case; they turned several of them down. They tabled a couple of them. They defeated a motion to proceed in another. But the Senate always acted.  Why didn't the majority honor the responsibility under the law for the Senate to do advice and consent, when there was plenty of time to do so, when the entire tradition of the Senate had been to always do so, when the written responsibility under the Constitution was to do so? So why not just bring up the judge and defeat him?  The answer is in the quotation that I read earlier from my colleague from Utah, who anticipated that if only the President would nominate somebody like Merrick Garland, it would be a great thing, and we would see a quick confirmation. Merrick Garland was that acceptable. He was that down the middle. He was without the kinds of issues that raised concerns. That was Merrick  So the majority said: We can't have a debate on him because the Senate will approve him, because he is that qualified. He will get that bipartisan support.  That is the principle of the filibuster; that is, that you don't close debate unless 60 Members say you close debate. So if 41 say we are not ready for whatever reason, you keep debating. That sends a strong message for Presidents to do what President Obama did. He consulted with the Democrats; he consulted with the Republicans and chose somebody who would be acceptable to both sides. That is the way it is supposed to work. And when a President ignores that and says: I am going to support somebody from the extremes, I am going to nominate somebody from the extremes, that is an invitation for the Senate to say no. The reputation, the legitimacy of the Court matters, so we are not going to approve this judge.  That is probably what is going to happen this week. The majority here in the Senate may say they want to close debate, but will they have a supermajority, a bipartisan majority? A few Senators perhaps, but they will not have those 60 votes.  Obama's judges met the 60-vote standard--both of them that they put forward before the third vacancy--and nobody filed a motion to close debate. There wasn't a vote on a motion to close debate. And why was that? Because everyone knew that they would have 60 votes to close debate. So, still, even out of the context of having had a cloture vote, you have the 60-vote standard there guiding the President and guiding the selection of the nominees.  We should not go back in time to a world in which the copper barons ruled Montana, not back to a time where the railroads and the oil companies called all the shots. We need to recognize that we have come a long way in terms of fulfilling the constitutional vision that our Founders set out--this vision of equality under the law, this vision of the pursuit of justice. But with the recent decisions of the 5-to-4 Court, we have gone backward. We have gone backward by allowing gerrymandering, by allowing voter suppression, by striking down the Voting Rights Act, and, most importantly, we have gone backward by allowing this vast infusion of dark money from the very few to drive election results.  I have been sharing the many reasons this debate should be suspended: One, because the seat was stolen; two, because there is an enormous cloud over the legitimacy of the President, and there are investigations under way, and we need to get to the bottom of it before a life-tenured position is filled by this President; and, three, a judge who repeatedly has engaged in rewriting the law to find for the powerful over the people, even when the law was very clear--even to the point that the entire Supreme Court overturned him on his effort to say doing merely more than nothing is acceptable under a law that says you must provide an appropriate education.  But here is one more thing. Breaking news: A POLITICO report has just come out which says that Judge Gorsuch committed plagiarism in a book and in an academic article. Well, that is news I had not heard, so I will read the article, and we can all learn about it at the same time.  This is a report from POLITICO entitled, ``Gorsuch's writings borrow from other authors.'' It came out at 11:19, which would put it an hour ago. Since I am here and since we are talking about Gorsuch, it is probably appropriate to share this breaking news with you.       Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch copied the structure and      language used by several authors and failed to cite source      material in his book and an academic article, according to      documents provided to       The documents show that several passages from the tenth      chapter of his 2006 book, ``The Future of Assisted Suicide      and Euthanasia,'' read nearly verbatim to a 1984 article in      the Indiana Law In several other instances in that      book and an academic article published in 2000, Gorsuch      borrowed from the ideas, quotes, and structures of scholarly      and legal works without citing them.       The findings come as Republicans are on the brink of      changing Senate rules to confirm Gorsuch over the vehement      objections of The documents could raise questions      about the rigor of Gorsuch's scholarship, which Republicans      have portrayed during the confirmation process as      unimpeachable.       The White House on Tuesday pushed back against any      suggestion of impropriety.  Here is what the White House said:       ``This false attack has been strongly refuted by highly-     regarded academic experts, including those who reviewed,      professionally examined, and edited Judge Gorsuch's scholarly      writings, and even the author of the main piece cited in the      false attack,'' said White House spokesman Steven      ``There is only one explanation for this baseless, last-     second smear of Judge Gorsuch: Those desperate to justify the      unprecedented filibuster of a well-qualified and mainstream      nominee to the Supreme Court.''  That was the comment from the White I must do a little bit of editorializing here. Having a lengthy debate on a judge is not unprecedented at all. What is unprecedented is, for the first time in U.history, the majority leader filed a petition to close debate on the first day of debate. That motion under our rules means, in 2 days, we will have a vote to close debate. That[[Page S2259]]is what is unprecedented and never before done in U.history. Quite frankly, when the White House says ``mainstream nominee,'' the analysis by the Washington Post didn't find him to be a mainstream nominee. You can call him that, but read his opinions; read his judicial activism; find how he rewrote the law so that it means the case comes out the opposite of the way the law is written. See how that happened in the frozen trucker case. See how that happened in the autistic child case. See how that happened in his pursuit of the assault on Planned Parenthood, when everyone agreed there was a fair outcome and no one was appealing the outcome, except Judge  If we are going to talk about a filibuster and we want to think about it in the longer sense, we aren't even allowed to continue talking to keep this from being considered because the majority leader filed a petition to close debate, so we have to have a vote on it. But last year, for 290-plus days, the Republicans completely filibustered Merrick If we are talking about the core heart of the meaning of filibuster--piracy, freebooting piracy to take over the system--that is what they did last year. They wouldn't allow even a committee hearing or a vote also for the first time in U.history. That is piracy. That is a violation of our responsibility. So the White House certainly got some of this completely wrong.  The article goes on--after having cited the White House opinion that this was an unfair attack--saying:       However, six experts on academic integrity contacted      independently by POLITICO differed in their assessment of      what Gorsuch did, ranging from calling it a clear impropriety      to mere sloppiness.       ``Each of the individual incidents constitutes a violation      of academic ethics. I've never seen a college plagiarism code      that this would not be in violation of,'' said Rebecca Moore,      a Syracuse University professor who has written extensively      on the issue.       Elizabeth Berenguer, an associate professor of law at      Campbell Law School, said that under legal or academic      standards Gorsuch's similarities to the Indiana Law Journal      would be investigated ``as a potential violation of our      plagiarism policy. It's similar enough to the original      work.''  She continued:       ``I would apply an academic writing standard,'' said      Berenguer, who teaches plagiarism and legal writing. ``Even      if it were a legal opinion, it would be plagiarism under      either.''       The White House provided statements from more than a half-     dozen scholars who have worked with Gorsuch or helped oversee      the dissertation he wrote at Oxford University that was later      turned into his book. They included John Finnis, professor      emeritus at Oxford; John Keown of Georgetown University, one      of the outside supervisors for Gorsuch's dissertation; and      Robert George of Princeton University, the general editor for      Gorsuch's book publisher.       The experts offered by the White House asserted that the      criteria for citing work in dissertations on legal philosophy      is different than for other types of academia or journalism:      While Gorsuch may have borrowed language or facts from others      without attribution, they said, he did not misappropriate      ideas or arguments.       ``Judge Gorsuch did not attempt to steal other people's      intellectual property or pass off ideas or arguments taken      from other writers as his own,'' said ``In no case      did he seek credit for insights or analysis that had been      purloined. In short, not only is there no fire, there isn't      even smoke.''  The article continues:       The examples at issue make up a small fraction of published      works by Gorsuch, which includes hundreds of legal opinions,      academic articles, news articles and his book. POLITICO did      not conduct a full examination of the federal judge's      writings.       Yet a review of the documents provided to POLITICO shows      Gorsuch parroting other writers' prose and sourcing without      citing them. Instead, Gorsuch often acknowledges the primary      sources cited by those writers.       In the most striking example, Gorsuch, in his book, appears      to duplicate sentences from an Indiana Law Journal article      written by Abigail Lawlis Kuzma without attributing her.      Instead, he uses the same sources that Kuzma used: A 1982      Indiana court ruling that was later sealed, a well-known      pediatrics textbook, ``Rudolph's Pediatrics,'' and a 1983      article in the Bloomington Sunday       At one point, Gorsuch's prose mimics Kuzma's almost word      for word in describing a child born with Down syndrome.       Kuzma stated that--  Some medical terms here that I won't get right--       ``Esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula      indicates that the esophageal passage from the mouth to the      stomach ends in a pouch, with an abnormal connection between      the trachea and the esophagus.''  Did everybody follow that?       Gorsuch wrote that ``Esophageal atresia with      tracheoesophageal fistula means that the esophageal passage      from the mouth to the stomach ends in a pouch, with an      abnormal connection between the trachea and esophagus.''  That is pretty close to word for word.       Gorsuch also used similar language as Kuzma in describing      ``Baby Doe's'' first days.       ``Shortly after Baby Doe was born, a hearing was held at      Bloomington Hospital to determine whether the parents had the      right to refuse the surgery on behalf of their child. An      attorney was present at the hearing to represent the parents,      though no one was present to represent Baby Doe's potentially      adverse interests. Six physicians attended, three of whom had      obstetric privileges and three of whom had pediatric      privileges at Bloomington Hospital,'' Gorsuch wrote.  Kuzma, the predecessor from which it is being argued that he has taken this virtually word for word, wrote:       ``Approximately twenty-six hours after Infant Doe was born,      a hearing was held at Bloomington Hospital to determine      whether the parents had the right to choose a course of      treatment for their child that consisted of allowing the      child to die. An attorney was present at the hearing to      represent the child's parents. No attorney was present to      represent Infant Doe's interests. Six physicians attended the      hearing, three of whom had obstetric privileges and three of      whom had pediatric privileges at Bloomington Hospital.''  I believe that last sentence was virtually word for word copied from what Kuzma wrote.       Kuzma, a one-time aide to former Dick Lugar (R-Ind.),      did not respond to an inquiry from POLITICO, but released a      statement through Gorsuch's team. Kuzma said she does ``not      see an issue here, even though the language is similar.''       ``These passages are factual, not analytical in nature,''      Kuzma, now a deputy attorney general in Indiana, said. ``It      would have been awkward and difficult for Judge Gorsuch to      have used different language.''       But a 1983 Notre Dame Law Review article addressing the      same case did, in fact, use different, plainer language to      describe the issue than Kuzma or Gorsuch did. Author John      Maciejczyk wrote that the ``infant needed surgery to correct      a blocked esophagus.''       In several other examples provided to POLITICO, Gorsuch      follows the fact patterns and sourcing without acknowledging      them.  This article goes on for another several pages. I guess we have the time to share it in its entirety. But let's not lose the fundamental point at the start of the article; that is, the title, ``Gorsuch's writings borrow from other authors,'' and an introductory comment here:       Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch copied the structure and      language used by several authors and failed to cite source      material in his book and an academic article, according to      documents provided to  To continue and to share the full text here, the article continues, providing more details. Tomorrow many people will be going through these because this is information that just came out an hour ago. It makes you wonder, is the reason that we had a first-ever motion to close debate on the first day of debate--the first time in U.history this happened--because there is information that people are aware of, and they want to get this nomination vote concluded before this information becomes public? Is that why we are violating all the constitutional norms here? Well, I hadn't thought of that possibility until this article was put in my hands a few moments ago.  The article continues:       In several other examples provided to POLITICO, Gorsuch      follows the fact patterns in sourcing of other writers      without acknowledging them.       In describing euthanasia activist Derek Humphrey, Gorsuch's      book tracks closely with the 2003 book titled ``A Merciful      End: The Euthanasia Movement in Modern America,'' by Ian            ``In 1989 Humphrey left his second wife, Ann Wickett, soon      after she had undergone surgery for breast cancer. During the      divorce, Wickett alleged that when Humphrey purported to help      her mother commit suicide, the resulting death was not fully      consensual,'' Gorsuch wrote.       Dowbiggin wrote--  In a parallel phrasing that preceded Gorsuch's writing--       ``In 1989 he left his second wife, Ann Wickett, shortly      after she had undergone surgery for breast cancer. Their      subsequent divorce was made messier by Wickett's allegations      that her mother had not died willingly when Humphry had      participated in the suicide of her own parent,'' Dowbiggin      wrote.       Gorsuch did not include an attribution to Dowbiggin in the      passage at issue, though he did cite the author at numerous      other points in the book. Dowbiggin listed his sources as      ``Deadly Compassion: The Death of Ann[[Page S2260]]     Humphry and The Truth About Euthanasia,'' by Rita Marker, and      ``Last Rites: The Struggle Over the Right to Die,'' by Sue      The same titles were cited as sources by       In the same chapter, Gorsuch appears to rely heavily on a      2002 article by Paul Lombardo of the University of Virginia      about sterilization techniques used in that state in the      early 20th century. Lombardo writes that a woman named Carrie      Buck was sterilized after having a child and her mother was      institutionalized.       ``Even worse for her, officials at her mother's asylum      claimed that mother and daughter shared heredity traits in      feeblemindedness and sexual promiscuity,'' Gorsuch wrote.       Wrote Lombardo, ``Officials at Virginia Colony said that      Carrie and her mother shared heredity traits of      `feeblemindedness' and sexual promiscuity.''  There is a bit of an echo there.       Gorsuch did not cite Lombardo despite mimicking his      sentences and presenting them in virtually the same order,      according to an electronic search of Gorsuch's book.       Howard, the Syracuse University professor, said Gorsuch      engaged in a passage known as ``patchwriting''--essentially      patching together words, fact sequences and quotes from      another source, but occasionally changing up the phrases and      tenses.  It is a way to copy someone else's work while making it look like it is your own.       In addition to ``heavy patchwriting,'' Howard said, Gorsuch      ``hides his sources, which gives the appearance of a very      deliberate method. I would certainly call it plagiarism.''       In a 2000 article in the Harvard Journal of Law & Public      Policy titled ``The Right to Assisted Suicide and      Euthanasia,'' Gorsuch's writing aligns closely with a 1985      Duquesne Law Review article about euthanasia in colonial      Gorsuch describes laws in colonial Virginia,      Massachusetts, Rhode Island, South Carolina, North Carolina      and Pennsylvania in the same order and with similar      quotations as the Duquesne article. But Gorsuch never cites      the article in that passage, instead only repeating the same      sources that it relied on.       Oxford's academic guidance for plagiarism states that      ``paraphrasing the work of others by altering a few words and      changing their order, or by closely following the structure      of their argument, is plagiarism if you do not give due      acknowledgement to the author whose work you are using.''       Christopher Sprigman, a New York University law professor      involved in building an online standard for citation in legal      scholarship, said he did not believe examples of Gorsuch's      questionable writing reflected ``mendacious'' acts on the      judge's part. Gorsuch's manner in attributing sources is ``a      choice that you might agree or disagree with,'' Sprigman      said. ``It's a little bit risky, but I wouldn't say it rises      to the level of a bad act. I think some people would say it's      sloppy.''  That is the conclusion of the article--again, information that just came out about 1 hour 20 minutes ago. So I recommend that folks take a look at the article. I am sure many people will be analyzing it tomorrow.  Part of the point of the lengthy debates we often had over the Supreme Court is to have a chance for all the facts to come out. And the fact that tonight--well, that is, Tuesday night; it is now Wednesday morning--Tuesday was the first time ever in our entire 200-plus years as a Senate that a cloture motion on a Supreme Court nominee has been filed on the first day of debate. Maybe that motion should be withdrawn given that there is more information now to analyze as of a few minutes ago than we had before.  The challenge this institution faces is, how do we restore it to a functioning legislative body, and how do we repair the deep divide in America? This question goes far beyond just the issue of the nomination of Neil Gorsuch; this issue goes to fundamental changes in how this Senate operates, fundamental changes in how our society receives its information. While I shared some of that previously, I think it is probably now, many hours later, worth going back through a little bit on this set of challenges the Senate faces.  When I was first here as an intern in 1976--41 years ago--the Senate was here all week long, Monday through It had a normal workweek. The Senate families were here, which meant that people had a more normal family life. During the breaks, they returned to their home States to share what they had worked on, what they were going to work on, what the Senate was working on, and generally hold townhalls and meetings and catch up on everything and then come back here after the break. That structure of families living here meant that there were connections not just between Senators but connections between them and their spouses. There were connections between their children. There were relationships formed over many evenings in which people socialized, and they had activities on weekends.  There were a lot of connections that we don't have now, four decades later, because we fly in and vote on Monday night, and then we vote on Thursday afternoon and fly out. So we don't have the reenforcement of our families being here to provide the kind of fabric in which the legislative discussion occurs, and we don't have the time to get to know each other. That is a challenge.  Plus, we have to spend a lot more time fundraising than folks in the Chamber did four decades ago. When you realize that a single individual, under the deeply mistaken decisions of the Supreme Court, can now put as much money into a campaign attack against you through a third party campaign--that they can write a check for more than the total amount you have raised for your entire campaign, it means that you are going to have to work very hard year after year to prepare for the next battle because the opposition doesn't have to prepare for the next battle. They simply have these massive amounts of funds that they can deploy at a moment's notice: Let's put $5 million in that race. Let's put $10 million in that race.  The result is, for example, in the case of the Koch brothers, that when the Koch brothers used front groups to attack various candidates across America, the candidates wrestled with whether to respond by attacking the Koch brothers, and generally, they decided not to because of the old adage ``Don't pick a fight with someone who buys ink by the barrel.'' But the modern version of that is ``Don't pick a fight with someone who has the most deeply funded super pac that exists in the United States.''  So the Koch brothers carried their fight in 2014 into the Senate race in They carried their battle into the Senate race in They carried their battle into the race in North Carolina and in Colorado and certainly in Iowa and in Alaska and my home State of They were funding front groups to attack me with a third-party campaign. This is what people fear. The Koch brothers can write a $5 million check--they and their associates--and counter all the funds you raised.  In addition to the fact that we are here only 3 days, a portion of those 3 days from Monday night to Thursday night is given over to fundraising. So instead of being able to go to dinner with colleagues, you go to a fundraising dinner. Maybe you slip across the street to do an hour of phone calls. If you are not raising for your own campaign, you are raising for your party's Senate group--the Republican Senate campaign committee or the Democratic Senate campaign committee--or maybe you are raising money directly for your colleagues themselves, helping to make calls for an event that is upcoming.  So you have an incredible shrinking of the Senate week, combined with a huge expansion of the time dedicated to fundraising in order to prepare for the attack that may well come from deeply funded super pacs. That is not a good combination in terms of Senators getting to know each other and getting to respect each other, developing projects together.  I know that it not only damages the time people should be working together, but it also delegitimizes what this group of 100 Senators does. The minority feels almost compelled to fight the battle after having been attacked so viciously by the other side in third-party campaigns. To some degree, this probably goes both directions. So we come here brutalized by the groups who are supporting the other side of the aisle. You are not particularly in a mood to help them out.  This is why I keep coming back to this: It is easy to simply become a pure partisan in this world in which deep-funded interests make up all kinds of attacks and put them on television in an effort to elect someone who will do their bidding, but if we do that, if we don't keep coming back together with the philosophy of problem-solving, then problems will never be solved. We will never have a better healthcare system. We will never have a better public education system. We won't have a better transportation system. We won't[[Page S2261]]have better deployment of infrastructure in rural America if all we do is nurture the wounds of elections. But it also means that we need to change the dynamic that creates those wounds. That is why the Supreme Court seat matters, because the 5-to-4 Court has been doing a lot of wound infliction on our system, making it easier to gerrymander, making it easier for voter suppression, making it easier for dark-money campaigns to corrupt the election process. So we have to attack it on all fronts.  That experience of coming here 41 years ago as an intern and seeing this place operate in a very different way gives me the hope that some way, we could find our way back from the brink. I don't think we have been anywhere as deep in the pit of partisanship--to mix metaphors--as at this moment, with this stolen seat; at this moment, with a cloud over our President and, therefore, a cloud over his nomination; at this moment, with a nomination that disrespected the role of a supermajority, the role being to help encourage Presidents to make nominations from the mainstream, not from the ideological extreme. Here we are, deep, deep into the pit.  If we don't solve the dark-money problem which is very related to the Supreme Court, then we aren't going to come together to solve the other problems because we won't have people who have been elected through a ``we the people'' vision of America, where each citizen has an equal voice, Jefferson's mother principle.  So that is the challenge that we face both on the Supreme Court side of this nomination but also in terms of problem solving.  I think that article that just came out is one that should add to this conversation--this article that says there is now yet another issue, an issue that didn't come out in the Judiciary Committee deliberations.  POLITICO has prepared a side-by-side comparison, which I have on this multicolored chart so citizens can look that up and contribute to that. But it is yet another reason we should probably go a different direction.  Now I am going to turn to Gorsuch's views of expansive Executive power.  Given the need for strong judicial oversight of this administration, under the circumstances, this nominee is particularly ill-suited. He has consistently taken the position that Executive power has very few limits.  As a member of the Bush administration, Judge Gorsuch, according to the New York Times, ``was at the center of both litigation and negotiations with Congress'' regarding ``detainee abuses, military commissions, warrantless surveillance and its broad claims of executive power.''  As a lawyer at the Department of Justice, Judge Gorsuch defended President Bush's enhanced interrogation methods.  In 2005 Congress passed the Detainee Treatment Act, which was meant to ensure greater human rights for detainees held at Guantanamo Judge Gorsuch, working as a Department of Justice lawyer at the time, managed to weaken a provision in the Detainee Treatment Act permitting a civilian appeals court to review decisions by military tribunals.  The original draft let judges scrutinize whether the tribunal had applied the correct standards, but the revised language only let them look to see whether the tribunal had applied standards set by the That is quite a change.  After the legislation was passed, Gorsuch sent an email to a colleague in the White House in which he said he needed cheering up. In the email, he discussed successful efforts to weaken the legislation stating: ``The administration's victory is not well known, but its significance shouldn't be understated.''  After the Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling in June 2006 to find that officials involved in the use of interrogations could be vulnerable to prosecution for war crimes, Judge Gorsuch helped draft a legislative proposal to address the issue, though he left before the eventual bill, the Military Tribunal Commissions Act, was enacted.  It is clear that he played a significant role in the case of Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, which former Solicitor General Walter Dellinger called ``the most important decision on Presidential power ever.'' The case was regarding the legal process being accorded to detainees at Guantanamo His central role was made clear by a request from the Department of Justice Office of Public Affairs that he, along with the Solicitor General and his principal deputy, participate in a background media call on the day the decision was to be announced.  The Department of Justice records show that Gorsuch had been very involved in helping support the inclusion of language in the Detainee Treatment Act and the National Defense Authorization Act and bolstered the position that only the DC Circuit should be able to review complaints about the Bush military commissions.  Gorsuch repeatedly asked several DOJ colleagues in November where we stand on the legislative language and if there is anything we can do to help.  In February, a Republican Senate Judiciary Committee staffer sent Gorsuch a drafted amicus brief on behalf of Senators Kyl and Graham for the administration's jurisdiction stripping arguments, a Congressional Record excerpt supporting the claim. Fortunately, the Supreme Court rejected the jurisdiction stripping Hamdan, but it was clear that Gorsuch was trying his best to enact sweeping Bush claims to unilateral authority and severe limits on judicial review.  Let me go back to the central premise here. As a member of the Bush administration, Judge Gorsuch, according to the New York Times, was at the center of both litigation and negotiations with Congress regarding detainee abuses, military commissions, warrantless surveillance, and broad claims of Executive power.  I think all of us should be more than a little disturbed by getting to the bottom line here, which is that Congress sought to ensure greater human rights for detainees held at Guantanamo Bay and Judge Gorsuch was working as a DOJ lawyer to weaken a provision in that regard and these other pieces that I have referred to.  I will turn now to an analysis of ``The Dissents of Judge Neil Gorsuch: Far to the Right and Out of the Mainstream.''  This analysis by People For the American Way goes through a number of cases, setting out the picture, if you will, of just how far out of the mainstream Neil Gorsuch is. I will just read this by Elliot Mincberg, written last month:       Many, if not most, decisions by the Supreme Court and the      court of appeals are unanimous. Reviewing the cases where an      appellate judge has chosen to disagree with and dissent from      his or her colleagues, therefore, can be particularly      revealing. And that is precisely the case with Judge Neil      Judge Gorsuch's dissents from his colleagues on the      Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals are consistently right-wing,      generally seeking to favor big business and other authority      and harm the interests of workers and those who have suffered      abuse by government officials. And this is on a court which,      until recently, consisted primarily of Republican appointees      like For example:       In Compass Environmental, v. Occupational Safety &      Health Review Commission, Gorsuch dissented from a decision      to affirm a Department of Labor fine against a company that      failed to properly train a worker, resulting in his death by      electrocution. Gorsuch claimed that there was no evidence to      show that industry standards would have required more      training. But as the court majority and the agency found,      there was ``clear evidence'' to support the ruling.  Let me say that again. Gorsuch said there was no evidence. The court majority basically found there was ``clear evidence'' to support the ruling.       In particular, the company's own job hazard analysis found      ``fatal danger'' from the high-voltage power lines involved,      and recommended training for employees.  That was the company's own job hazard announcement. The company itself knew: If you are operating a piece of equipment next to a high-powered voltage line and that metal equipment touches that line, you create the possibility of an electrocution.  That training was given to some employees, but the employee who was killed did not get that training because they didn't give it to him. So the court majority said: Yes, you should have provided the training that you knew was necessary for the operation of this equipment in that setting with a high-voltage power line, but you didn't give it. Therefore, you are in the wrong. But Judge Gorsuch saw it differently.       As a result of that negligence, the danger truly did become      fatal, and the fine against[[Page S2262]]     the company was clearly justified. But Gorsuch disagreed with      his own colleagues--including one who, like Gorsuch, was      appointed by President Bush--and argued that the corporation      should pay nothing.  My father was a mechanic. He worked when he was first out of high school for construction companies on highways in Arizona, and he did a whole host of roles but mostly repairing the equipment of the shop.  In a few years, he became a journeyman, a mechanic. In the course of that work on these big machines, you come to be aware that there are a lot of hazards that need to be addressed. You know some of those hazards for the operators, some of the hazards for working on the machines themselves.  Companies know this as well. They know that if they are hiring a new employee to work in a hazardous setting, they need to train the employee so the employee doesn't get hurt.  The company didn't provide the training. The employee died. The company is fined. And Gorsuch says: No, no, no problem here.  Really? Why did the rest of the court majority find otherwise? Why did the Department of Labor find otherwise? Why did he disagree with his colleagues in order to protect a powerful corporation that had failed to provide the training that resulted in the death of a person?  That is what the requirements for training are all about--to protect individuals from situations where they are at high risk. You eliminate those risks.

That Citizens United decision was a 5-to-4 decision. Four Justices laid out the case that these unlimited funds--and often secret funds--are corrupting our American political system. And if one wants an example of that corruption, simply look at the vast change--within a short period of years--of the position of our colleagues on the right side of the aisle in regard to the environment.  We had many colleagues who were very concerned about carbon pollution coming from the extraction and burning of fossil fuels. They wanted to make sure that we had a sustainable planet to pass on to our children--our children's children. It was following a Republican tradition of being involved in things like the Environmental Protection Agency creation with President Nixon and the Clean Water Act and Clear Air  In a short period of time, like a shallow pool beneath a hot sun, it just evaporated.

4366,topic-id,331,"I say to my colleague from Illinois that we will probably never know the full vetting that took place and the conversations that took place, but your observation that Hobby Lobby involves a parallel with Citizens United is absolutely right. In Citizens United, the Court said: The corporation gets these political rights; that is, the ability to spend money in campaigns, unlimited funds. And in Hobby Lobby, the corporation gets religious rights, if you will--the right to overrule, not just express them through the benefits they provide to their employees, but to trump the religious choices of their employees. It is kind of a super religious power, if you will, choosing the corporation over the people. In both cases, there is this element of choosing the corporation, promoting it, exalting it, over the rights of individuals.  Jefferson made a comment in a letter where he talked about the philosophy of the mother principle. The mother principle said that the only way our government will proceed to fulfill the will of the people is if each citizen has an equal voice--not vote, but voice. ``Vote'' was a big piece of that, but he chose the word ``voice,'' as did President Lincoln on another occasion. The point he was making is that you have to have a place where everyone can weigh in, more or less, in equal fashion.  The opposite of that is Citizens United, where an individual who is a multibillionaire can weigh in massively by buying up the air waves, the radio waves, the television waves, the web advertising, the social media, scrolling and so forth--all of these tools that didn't exist at the time they were formed. So there is this ability for the wealthiest to do a citizen sound equivalent of a stadium sound system that drowns out the voice of the people, just as you have this situation in Hobby Lobby where the religious preference of the corporate entity can trump the religious preferences of the employees.

4368,topic-id,294,"My colleague from Illinois brings up the frozen trucker case, as it has often been referred to, and how it demonstrates an effort to really twist the law away from its original purpose in order to find for the powerful over the individual.  In this particular case, when he wrote his viewpoint, Neil Gorsuch revealed a whole lot because here was a law specifically crafted to protect truckers from being fired if they operated for personal safety or the safety of the public.  Clearly, for him to have driven that trailer down the road, a fully loaded trailer without brakes because the brakes were frozen, would have been incredibly dangerous to all kinds of people. To stay in that cab freezing to death was dangerous to him. You can interpret the concept of operating a truck, and the law said refusing to operate a truck. Well, does refusing to operate a truck mean that you refuse to operate it in exactly the manner that you were told to? Does it mean driving the cab without the trailer or the cab with the trailer?  Gorsuch zeroed in on the fact that, well, he did not refuse to operate because he drove the cab. He was operating. Well, no, he was not operating in any common person's understanding. He left the trailer there. He wasn't driving it down the road. But he searched for that slight little way that he could say: Well, that does not quite fit, and therefore I can find for the corporation.

I appreciate the great knowledge he brings to Senate issues and the deliberations in the Judiciary I am not a member of the Judiciary Committee, so, as I listened to my colleagues commenting on the questions that were being raised and how they were being answered, I saw in the course of those hearings a trajectory in which many colleagues found, as they looked into the heart of these decisions, that there was an absence of heart reflected in the decisions.  The ability to understand the full context of which something happened is so important. When I was a freshman in college, I had a course, a freshman seminar, and that seminar was taught by an esteemed professor of the law school. She would have us read the circumstances of a case, and then say: How would you have ruled on this case? We would write up our little memos, our short little memos, not really based on law because we didn't know the law but on common sense or whatever life experience would have brought to bear.  Then the next week, we would read the Justice's opinions, their decisions on what they had found to be the case--did they sustain the argument for the defense or otherwise, and what arguments did they bring to bear?  I was always struck that William Douglas seemed to have the best grip on being able to place himself into the mindset and the situation of folks who were bringing grievances forward to be addressed. I think a lot of that came from his life experience and the life experience in which he had basically lived in the wilderness part of the time. He had hung out with hobos, and he had ridden the rods underneath the railroad cars to get from one place to another. He had experiences that were not just inside the bubble--the billionaire bubble, the elite bubble, the gated community.  The opposite of that is the situation when I was in New York back in 2008 and I was speaking to someone about campaigning for the The individual said: I don't understand why you are so concerned about healthcare. Everybody has healthcare--everybody. Well, in his world, in his bubble, everybody had healthcare and everybody was wealthy, but that is not the entirety of the world.  So it is so important to have people on the Court who can get inside the experience that others have and that diverse experience. You don't see that reflected in decisions that have been written by Neil  I thank my colleague from  The Guardian wrote an article titled ``The Guardian view of Trump's Russia links: a lot to go at.'' I will share this particular article, but before I do so, let us remember that we are here at this moment with three substantial issues.  One issue is the fact that for the first time in U.history, a Supreme Court seat has been stolen from one President and delivered to another--the first[[Page S2289]]and only time. Sixteen times we have had a vacancy in a Presidential year, and 15 times the Senate has acted to consider the nominee, in some cases rejecting them, in some cases--in most cases confirming them, but always acting until last year.  The second big issue is this Russia investigation, the investigation of the links between the Trump campaign and the Russians, this big cloud hanging over the legitimacy of the It needs to be resolved. That certainly affects whether it is legitimate to be considering at this moment the President's nominee before that cloud is dissipated or resolved because this individual, whoever is confirmed for this seat, will quite likely serve for many decades. When it is a younger nominee, as it is with Neil Gorsuch, that could be five decades. It could be an extensive length of time with decisions that stretch far into the future.  Rather than rush through this in a few days, we should be setting this aside until these issues are resolved to make sure that we have established the legitimacy of the President's role in office and gotten rid of this cloud hanging over him.  The third, of course, is the nominee himself. I so much appreciate my colleague from Illinois proceeding to, through his questions, raise a number of the points about Neil Gorsuch's record. There is the case of the frozen trucker. We did not talk about the case of the autistic child, but that is very similar, where the law--and it is similar in this sense--the law was quite clearly written to promote a particular resolution of a challenge, and that is that every child, despite their disability, would have the opportunity to have an appropriate education. Neil Gorsuch managed to reduce that down to mere improvement over de minimus; that is, basically a tiny little bit of improvement over doing nothing. That was the Neil Gorsuch standard.  That standard went to the Supreme The Supreme Court just recently issued its decision, and it was not a confirmation that it is OK to have just a mere improvement over doing nothing, it was a wholesale rejection, because the law is very clear, and Neil Gorsuch tormented it and twisted it and tortured it to produce a position that you can do nothing and meet the standard of the law that says you have to do quite a bit.  So it was 8 to 0. It was not six out of eight or seven out of eight, but eight out of eight. Every Justice, no matter where they were in the ideological spectrum, said: That is an absurd finding and overthrew the Neil Gorsuch decision.

4372,topic-id,3055,"I appreciate that clarification. I am going to make this comment now, in case I might forget later. I want to give special thanks to the team of individuals who make this body work in order to provide for the opportunity for extended debate, sometimes here under extraordinary circumstances. Because I have been here through the night speaking, one of those extraordinary circumstances was this night that has just passed. The stenographers, the Parliamentarians, the pages, our doorkeepers, our caucus staff, the bill clerks, and others who staff the desks in the offices in the Democratic and Republican cloakrooms--I am excited to see the set of smiles on the pages' faces. I don't know if the same pages were here all night or not. Well, they will hopefully really get a lot out of this opportunity to serve here. But thank you to all the staff members who have labored during the wee hours of the night and into this morning.  I was summing up the issues that we labor under and noting a significant one is the stolen Supreme Court seat and the damage that completing that theft will do to our institutions. I have been going through a number of cases that are related to the far-right, anti-we-the-people vision of Neil Gorsuch, from the frozen trucker case, to the autistic child case, to the worker suffering sexual discrimination or gender discrimination at work--all of these cases that have come forward.  We have the third issue, of course, being that cloud that is hanging over the Presidency because of the investigations underway at this moment into the role the Trump campaign may have played in communicating with or collaborating with the Russians in their extensive strategy to interfere with our Presidential election. So there are a lot of concerns.  This should be the last case where we are cutting short the debate by filing a petition to close debate on the opening day, but there it is--another first, another degradation of the institution.  Dahlia Lithwick wrote in November:       We are already hearing from Republicans and Democrats in      leadership positions that it is incumbent upon Americans to      normalize and legitimize the new Trump presidency. We are      told to give him a chance, to reach across the aisle, and      that we must all work hard, in President Obama's formulation,      to make sure that Trump succeeds. But before you decide to      take Obama's advice, I would implore you to stand firm and      even angry on this one point at least: The current Supreme      Court vacancy is not Trump's to fill. This was President      Obama's vacancy and President Obama's nomination. Please      don't tacitly give up on it because it was stolen by      unprecedented obstruction and contempt. Instead, do to them      what they have done to us. Sometimes, when they go low, we      need to go lower, to protect the thing of great value.  I don't love the way that is phrased, that is for sure. Because in my mind, the point here is to guard our institutions and make them work better. That is the high road. That is not going lower; that is going higher. We must strengthen and defend these institutions that are being torn asunder by this strategy of stealing a Senate seat.  That is an article from the Slate.[[Page S2295]]  The Miami Herald says: ``Supreme Court Nominations Will Never Be the Same.''       The story of the Supreme Court in 2016 can be summarized in      a statistic: It's been 311 days since Justice Antonin Scalia      died on February 13, and his seat remains unfilled. That is      not the longest Supreme Court vacancy in the modern era, but      it's about to enter second place--and it will become the      longest if Donald Trump's nominee isn't confirmed about the      end of       This striking fact will be front and center when the      history of the court in 2016 is written, but what really      matters isn't the length of the vacancy. It's the election in      the middle of it. The Republican Senate changed the rules of      confirmation drastically by refusing even to consider Judge      Merrick Garland's nomination. And against the odds, it paid      off for them.  It is interesting because we talk about the nuclear option of changing the rules, but in a very de facto matter, the nuclear option went off the day the majority leader came to the floor and said that we are going to conduct ourselves in a totally different way than the Senate's ever conducted itself. Unlike every other time in U.history, when there was a vacancy during election year and the Senate acted, we are not going to act. We are going to essentially engage in stonewalling the President's nominee--no hearing, no discussion. That was a nuclear option. So, certainly, I think that is a point well made by this article.       The history of the confirmation process is central to the      history of the court. There have been some important      landmarks in the last century. Louis Brandeis was the first      justice to have a confirmation hearing. Felix Frankfurter was      the first justice who had to testify at his confirmation.       More recently, the confirmation process for Robert Bork in      1987 had epochal consequences. For the first time, judicial      philosophy was a focus.  That was 1987.       No one disputed Bork's intelligence or qualifications.      Instead liberals, including law professors like my colleague      Laurence Tribe, criticized Bork's conservatism, as opposition      to fundamental rights.  Well, there is a whole host of commentary from all across Let's turn to the Pittsburgh Post-``The Senate's shame: Merrick Garland deserved a hearing for Supreme Court.''       Judge Merrick Garland is returning to his work on the Court      of Appeals for the D.Circuit, his nomination for the      Supreme Court killed without a vote by a Republican Senate      majority more concerned with partisan politics than with      doing its job.       The behavior of those who disposed of his nomination stands      in sharp contrast to his own record and reputation as a      nonideological judge.       Judge Garland is a moderate jurist with a reputation for      careful reasoning. Mere days before President Barack Obama      announced Merrick Garland's nomination, Senator Orrin Hatch,      a Republican from Utah, told a conservative news site that if      the President wanted to pick a moderate, he ``could easily      name Merrick Garland, who is a fine man.''       But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had already      announced, in February, that his caucus would block any Obama      nominee. ``This vacancy,'' he said, ``should not be filled by      this lame-duck President.'' So the Senate refused even to      hold hearings.  Let's be clear. We have had 16 vacancies in the course of an election year during our 200-plus years of history, and never before did a majority refuse to exercise their advice and consent responsibility under the Constitution, arguing that it is a lameduck That is not embedded in the It is not embedded in the Senate rules. It is not embedded in history. It is not embedded in any logic. When you elect a President, you elect him for 4 years.  Obama was elected, not by a small margin, not by an electoral victory combined with a citizen majority loss. No, he won the citizen vote massively, as well as winning the electoral college. He won it twice. You can't look for a better endorsement for the role of a President and an affirmation in the face of the determined effort to ensure he did not get a second term.  So that lameduck argument is lame. The argument that the President was a lameduck so, therefore, his Supreme Court nominee should not get a hearing is disingenuous and irresponsible. Mr.Obama had a year left in his term, and Presidents have their full constitutional authority until noon on inauguration day. They must perform all of their duties until then.  Granted, a President must nominate justices the Senate can reasonably be asked to confirm. You can't ask a Senate dominated by the other party to confirm someone whose judicial philosophy could appeal only to someone who shares the President's politics. He must, when facing such a Senate, choose someone in the middle. Mr.Obama did that. He did his job. He picked the very judge Senator Hatch said would be a moderate choice.  The Senate did not do its job. Its refusal to confirm Judge Garland was not based on any flaw in the nominee's character, any deficit in his abilities, or even any disagreement with his jurisprudence. It was pure partisan politics. Senate Republicans wanted to let a Republican President fill the vacancy, and they are going to get their way. But this refusal of the Senate to do its duty cost a good man a fair hearing, and, more importantly, it cost the Nation a potentially fine justice, one more faithful to the law than one of the political parties or particular judicial ideology.  As a result of this abdication of responsibility, it will be harder to get Justices like that in the future. Indeed, the Senate has established a terrible precedent that makes it less likely that any President will be get a Senate controlled by the other party to confirm his or her Supreme Court nominees, however wise and well-qualified.  This was a study of Washington politics at its worst--political and constitutional malpractice--and it will have a lasting consequence.  Well, there is still time to change course and not have this legacy, as characterized by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, of ``political and constitutional malpractice with lasting consequences''. So one question we have not talked about too much in this debate through the night is how voters view this GOP maneuvering to push through Trump's ultraconservative Supreme Court nominee. This is a national survey of likely voters by Greenberg Quinlan Rosner It notes the following:       In the wake of President Donald Trump's nomination of Neil      Gorsuch to the U.Supreme Court, a new national poll shows      that voters believe that the nomination has real consequences      for the direction of the country. Voters strongly oppose      efforts by the Republicans to change the rules in order to      push through Trump's ultraconservative nominee.  Americans see this as a fight that matters to them. When presented with potential consequences and rulings that could result from Gorsuch's confirmation, including overturning Roe v. Wade and leaving the flow of special interest money in politics unchecked, large majorities of voters say they are more likely to oppose the nominee.  Key findings from the poll conducted January 27 through 31 on behalf of NARAL Pro Choice America Foundation, Every Voice, and End Citizens United, include:       Voters overwhelmingly believe that Trump's nomination will      have a real impact on the country's future. Fully 72 percent      of voters think the nomination will have a big difference in      the direction of the country. Voters across the political      spectrum agree on the importance of this nomination, with 76      percent of Democrats saying it will make a big difference,      along with 75 percent of Republicans and 64 percent of       So, in short, basically roughly three out of four Americans recognize that it is a very big deal because out of this discussion could come a confirmed nominee, a ninth vote on the Supreme Court, and that 5-to-4 votes of the Supreme Court steer the country in very different directions, depending on how that 5-to-4 voting occurs.  If you are adding to the Supreme Court spectrum of conservatives who have this view of Merrick Garland and antipathy toward the ability of citizens to pursue justice through class action lawsuits, and an effort to always kind of torture the law in order to find for corporations over the individuals, and a love of arbitration agreements, and even inventing them as we heard last night--inventing an arbitration agreement where none exists--in order to prevent an issue from going forward in the courts--all of that is a real handicap for Americans in the future. So Americans understand this is a big deal.       Americans strongly object to any GOP attempts to use      political tactics to strong-arm Trump's nominee through the      confirmation process. After hearing balanced messaging, seven      in 10 (69 percent) oppose Republicans changing the rules to      prevent a filibuster and allow the Senate to confirm a      nominee with just a simple majority instead of the required      60 votes, with 54 percent strongly opposing this proposal. In      fact, even 4-out-of-10 Trump voters (39 percent) oppose      Republicans trying to change the filibuster rules.[[Page S2296]]       Highlighting potential actions and rulings that could      result from confirming Trump's Supreme Court nominee makes      voters much more likely to oppose him. Large majorities of      voters say they are more likely to oppose Trump's nominee      when they hear a diverse set of issues that could be impacted      by a nominee like Actions that create strong      opposition include:       Upholding the Citizens United decision to allow      corporations, unions, and wealthy donors to spend more money      on elections.       Overturning the Roe v. Wade decision that made abortion      legal.       Eliminating or weakening environmental regulations that      protect air, water, and land from pollution.       Refusing to uphold or eliminating rights and protections      for LGBT individuals.       Failing to protect voting rights and making it more      difficult for Americans, particularly the poor and people of      color, to vote.       Weakening the ability of labor unions to organize workers      to negotiate for better wages and working conditions.       Voters strongly support legal abortion and oppose a Trump      nominee they believe could put that right at risk. Seven out      of 10 voters (69 percent) support a woman's right to choose,      and they recognize that Trump's Supreme Court nominee      jeopardizes the Roe v. Wade decision that made abortion      legal. More than half of voters (52 percent) think it is very      or somewhat likely that Roe v. Wade will be overturned if      Trump's nominee is confirmed. This possibility raises strong      opposition for voters, with 61 percent who say they are more      likely to oppose a nominee who wants to overturn Roe v.       Voters have strong negative reactions to a Supreme Court      nominee who will continue to allow corporations and special      interests to use money to gain influence and drown out the      voice of individuals in politics. Opposition to a nominee who      wants no spending limits for corporations and wealthy      individuals in elections is broad and deep. Overall, 78      percent are more likely to oppose a nominee (56 percent much      more likely to oppose), including 92 percent of Democrats, 84      percent of Independents, and 59 percent of Three      quarters of voters express a desire for their Senators to      oppose a Supreme Court nominee who was ruled in favor of      allowing campaign contributors to spend more money in      politics.       Voters recognize this Supreme Court nomination is crucial      to the direction of the country and they strongly oppose any      efforts by Republicans to skirt the rules to push through      Trump's ultraconservative nominee.  So the date of that Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research poll was February 1. I think it really highlights that voters understand that what we are doing now--this process of considering the potential confirmation of a nominee--has huge consequences for this country and has a huge impact on a whole variety of issues--environmental issues, labor issues, discrimination issues, consumer issues, commerce issues, a whole host of a range of things that the Supreme Court regularly considers. So there is a lot of concern at this point.  Here is another issue, and that is the potential impact on LGBT rights. This is an article by Rebecca Buckwalter-Poza entitled: ``Judge Gorsuch Threatens the Dignity of LGBT People.''       Judges with Supreme Court aspirations tend to guard their      views, avoiding stances and statements that could impede a      nomination or a confirmation. Judge Neil Gorsuch has done      just that, leading observers to look to his influences rather      than his issuances. Among them is Justice Anthony Kennedy,      for whom he clerked. While Judge Gorsuch and Justice Kennedy      may share a bond, they part ways on several issues. One      lesser known but critically important point of potential      disagreement surrounds a somewhat nebulous legal principle      critical to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender, or LGBT,      rights: the dignity of free persons.       For decades, the Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed that      individuals' due process right to liberty also protects their      dignity--and shields them from indignity. The concept of      dignity encompasses an individual's innate value as people      and their right to live free of interference; their right to      make important personal decisions; and their entitlement to      social recognition or protection from discrimination. This      notion of human dignity is at the heart of the Court's three      landmark LGBT rights cases: Lawrence v. Texas, United States      v. Windsor, and Obergefell v.       Judge Gorsuch's writing--both on the bench and in his book      against ``assisted suicide,'' based on his Oxford      dissertation--suggests he is, at a minimum, skeptical of the      principle from which the right to dignity derives:      substantive due process. To be clear, substantive due      process, which protects individuals from having their      fundamental rights violated without justification, has      been part of Supreme Court jurisprudence for more than 100      years.       In one case, Judge Gorsuch made a point of incorporating      criticisms of substantive due process. He noted that ``some''      believe if such a concept existed, it would reside elsewhere      in the ``Others,'' he offered, question whether      substantive due process ``should find a home anywhere in the      Constitution.'' This critical aside, while mild, is unusual.      Judge Gorsuch hews to precedent on substantive due process      only grudgingly, after conceding that ``the Supreme Court      clearly tells us'' that substantive due process does have a      home in the       In his book, Judge Gorsuch went so far as to criticize the      Supreme Court for adhering to substantive due process      precedent in ``case after case.'' He also proposed an      alternative relevance for dignity, based in equal protection,      that could restrict rather than protect individual rights.      The recognition of innate human dignity is the foundation for      equality, Judge Gorsuch claimed, and equality makes      ``assisted suicide''--termed ``death with dignity'' in those      states that permit it--unacceptable because all people      created equal enjoy an inalienable right to life. This view      is troubling, not only in signaling an intent to      misappropriate the concept of dignity to restrict individual      choice, but also because of the implications for reproductive      access, rights, and justice.  This article continues:       Senators must press Judge Gorsuch to commit to upholding      Supreme Court precedent based on the recognition of dignity--     or admit he would not respect this long-established, critical      principle.  This goes on in a somewhat scholarly fashion.  (",CREC-2017-04-04-pt2-PgS2257-2.txt,1900,TRIBUTE TO ROBERT K. SCHRATZ,2017.0,4.0,January

Mr.Speaker, there is no doubt that ObamaCare is failing Healthcare costs continue to rise, and people have less coverage and less choice today than ever before. No doubt, some have benefited from the law, but millions more Hoosiers have been hurt by the law and are worse off today than they were before this law was passed.  I have heard from countless Hoosiers in the Sixth District of Indiana, who are hurting under ObamaCare and who have sent me here to repeal this disastrous law.  There is one message from a constituent from Greenfield who said: ``I am a perfectly healthy human being, and I used to pay $230 a month with a $500 deductible for my health care. Since ObamaCare, my premiums have risen to over $1,480 a month with a $10,000 deductible.''  Or a dad in Shelbyville, who lost the healthcare plan he liked when[[Page H2246]]ObamaCare took effect, and whose prescription costs for his daughter have now doubled and tripled under  Or the owner of a small telecom company in southern rural Indiana, who tells me that he and his employees have faced higher health insurance rates every year since ObamaCare with out-of-pocket costs increasing as well, not to mention the endless paperwork and red tape. He says: ``ObamaCare has been an absolute disaster for small businesses and our employees.''  I heard from a cancer survivor from Vevay, whose plan went from $199 a month to over $800 a month, and who couldn't keep her plan or her doctor. She says: ``I am a cancer survivor, and the old policy has taken me through three surgeries and worked well for me. Now we're paying over $1,300 a month with a $5,000 deductible, and the policy paid nothing the entire year. Then, we received a notice that, in 2017, the premium would raise again.''  Or the family physician from Muncie, who told me his patients have ``more limited options, longer wait times for approval of vital procedures and medications, and--through the confusing nature of the health insurance marketplace--have ended up with plans they didn't understand and couldn't afford.''  Or the hardworking mom and wife in Shelbyville, whose husband lost hours at work because of ObamaCare's full-time employee mandates, and whose own health insurance increased in cost with less coverage. She says: ``We work hard for our benefits, and now the benefits are terrible. I am paying more for worse coverage, and we lost income. It was a double whammy.''  These Hoosiers and so many others are being crushed by ObamaCare and its burdensome taxes, mandates, and fees. We can do better for Hoosiers, and this week we will. We will start the process of repealing ObamaCare and replacing it with something better.  This week, Congress will vote on the American Health Care Act, the first phase of our plan to repeal and replace This is a transformational change that will do away with ObamaCare's costly mandates, provide much-needed relief to Hoosiers, and create a healthcare system that actually lowers costs and increases choice.

Selfless individuals have donated their resources, including over 250 bales of hay, fencing, cattle feed, financial support, and more.

4377,topic-id,4231,"Mr.President, like several in this Chamber, I was asked for my input to the President on whom to nominate to the U.Supreme After much reflection, I recommended to the Vice President that Judge Neil Gorsuch of Denver, CO, should fill the Scalia seat on the Supreme  I am, of course, very pleased that my advice was considered. I offered that recommendation before I had an opportunity to sit down one-on-one with Judge Gorsuch, although, in fairness, we had an opportunity in the Senate to review Judge Gorsuch and his credentials in 2006 when this body voted to confirm him by voice vote to the U.Court of Appeals where he now sits. After spending time with this exceptionally talented jurist and after reviewing his performance before the Senate Judiciary Committee, my level of respect for him has only grown.  Judge Gorsuch checks the box on every measure of what I am looking for in a Supreme Court nominee. Intellectual capacity, experience, independence, integrity--he has all of these. There is no question that he has the intellectual capacity to meet the challenge. Yes, we acknowledge he is an Ivy League graduate from Columbia and Harvard Law, and that actually describes many people at the top of the legal profession, but that alone is not what makes Judge Gorsuch exceptional.  Judge Gorsuch did something that most practicing lawyers don't do. He went on to earn a doctorate in legal philosophy at I think this is one of the many illustrations of Judge Gorsuch's tremendous depth. And whatever else my colleagues will have to say about Judge Gorsuch in this contentious confirmation debate, there is no question that he is an intellectual heavyweight.  I next look to those who mentored Judge Gorsuch along the way, and one really cannot have better mentors than the late Justice Byron White and sitting Justice Anthony Justice Kennedy, we all know, has carved a niche for himself as the swing vote on the Supreme There is a great deal of debate about whether a Justice Gorsuch will be more of a Scalia than a Kennedy or a White or whether, instead, he will be a I suspect that he will be a Gorsuch, and that is fine by me.  What really matters is that Judge Gorsuch will come to the Supreme Court with a strong understanding of its dynamics, and there is no question that he will be effective from day one. There is no question that he will be his own man. I want to emphasize that point.  Judge Gorsuch made it very clear to me when we met that he has made no commitments to the President or his team. And he made it clear at the hearings that if any commitment were sought, he would have gotten up and walked out. After spending time with Judge Gorsuch, I believe him. I believe him on that. His commitment to an independent judiciary is resolute, and I think on this issue he will not bend to political expedience, as he should not.  He is not the President's man, not the party's man, nor will he represent an ideological movement on the Judge Gorsuch will be his own man, following the law where it leads. That is what we should want in a Supreme Court Judge Gorsuch's unshakable integrity explains why he has earned the unanimous ``well qualified'' rating from the American Bar  I am also enthusiastic about Judge Gorsuch because he brings a western perspective to a Court that is desperately in need of diversity. Mr.President, you would surely agree with that--that making sure we have those who are knowledgeable based on their experience, of what is like to live in the West is important. Six of the eight sitting Supreme Court Justices have spent their entire professional careers in the Boston-Washington corridor--six of the eight. The only sitting Justice who came to the Supreme Court from someplace other than the Boston-Washington corridor is Anthony Kennedy, who was elevated from the Ninth Judge Gorsuch has, of course, done the ``Washington thing,'' but his home is in the West, and he served for a decade on the Tenth Circuit in I think that makes a real difference, at least in my book.  Appellate judges in the East rarely hear cases involving Federal Indian law and Native American issues. Among the hundreds of cases that Judge Gorsuch has heard, dozens involve Indians and Indian law. In deciding those cases, he has demonstrated great sensitivity to the unique role of Indian Nations under our  I think that explains why Judge Gorsuch has been enthusiastically endorsed by the National Congress of American Indians as well as the Native American Rights NCAI is the umbrella organization for the Nation's federally recognized NARF is an independent, highly respected public interest law firm which advocates for Native Americans nationally. Neither of these organizations--neither NCAI nor NARF--could ever be characterized as right-leaning. Yet they have endorsed Judge Gorsuch after reviewing his track record on cases involving Native rights. I think it is also important to recognize that the Central Council of the Tlingit and Haida Tribes of Alaska has also endorsed the Gorsuch nomination, which is important for Alaska  Another example: The Federal government controls vast amounts of land in the West and, of course, that includes our home State of Public lands cases tend to originate in the West, not in the It is tremendously important that somebody on the Supreme Court have a familiarity with these issues, and Judge Gorsuch clearly does.  Along with the pervasive Federal presence in the West comes a huge Federal regulatory influence. Mr.President, you and I know that Alaskans[[Page S2307]]talk about the extent of Federal overreach in our State like other people talk about the weather. Alaskans will be interested to know, perhaps excited to know, that one of Judge Gorsuch's top intellectual interests is regulatory overreach. He has publicly questioned the proposition that Federal courts must defer to agency interpretation of the law when regulations are challenged. That is a very good thing because when a homeowner has to go to court to litigate the question of whether the pond in the back of his house is regulated wetland, the last thing that the homeowner wants to hear is that the scales of justice are somehow tipped in favor of the agency on accord of a principle known as Chevron deference.  I understand--and we all know--that there are some interest groups that suggest that Judge Gorsuch's views on Chevron deference means that somehow or another he stands for big business and against the little guy. To those organizations, allow me to introduce you to an Alaskan named John  Mr.President, you and I know him well. Mr.Sturgeon was prohibited from taking his hovercraft, his boat, up a river in northern Alaska adjacent to National Park Service land. Mr.Sturgeon had to go all the way up to the Supreme Court to vindicate that right, and, against many odds, he won.  I think it is clear that Federal agencies can and do trample on the rights of the little guy. I will tell you, I find Judge Gorsuch's views on the question of deference highly refreshing at this point in time.  I should point out that I don't agree with all of the opinions written by Judge Gorsuch, but I don't expect that from a nominee. That is almost an impossible standard. In fact, Judge Gorsuch himself has acknowledged that. I do expect that the nominee be always true to the law, as Judge Gorsuch has demonstrated throughout his career.  Finally, from everything I know, Judge Gorsuch is a good and a decent man. He is a husband. He is a father of two girls. He is an outdoor person. He is a person who gives back to the next generation. In addition to his judicial duties, he regularly teaches legal ethics and professionalism at the University of Colorado Law In the classroom, he is known to have great respect for his students and their diverse views.  In endorsing Judge Gorsuch's elevation to the Supreme Court, the Denver Post suggested that ``While Democrats will surely be tempted to criticize the nomination of anyone Trump appoints, they'd be wise to take the high road and look at qualifications and legal consistency.'' That is an editorial from the Denver Post, published on January 16 of this year, 2017. Those are pretty wise words. Again, ``Democrats would be wise to take the high road and look at his qualifications and legal consistency.'' That is what we should be looking at. And I think it is so unfortunate that many of my friends on the other side of the aisle have failed to heed this advice laid down in the Denver Post earlier this year.  I have seen judicial nominees come and go over my 14 years in this body, but I will tell you, I haven't seen anyone more intriguing than Judge Gorsuch with his qualifications. He has had a stellar legal career. He is brilliant. He is a rock star among Federal judges. And that kind of judge is the one law students would compete to clerk for. If this body could step back from the politics of all this, he should be confirmed with upwards of 80 or 90 votes, not subjected to a filibuster. That is the caliber of the person we are considering. I honestly cannot fathom why an individual of Judge Gorsuch's stature would be drug through the mud. I just don't believe that reflects well on this body.  I am known within the Senate for my independence in evaluating judicial nominees. While I was not a part of the Gang of 14 back in 2005 who proposed the standard for Federal court nominees, I have pretty much chosen to live by it. Except in the most extraordinary of circumstances, I do not believe judicial nominees should be denied a straight up-or-down vote. I just don't believe they should be denied that. I have practiced that. If one were to examine my record, it is clear that I have walked that walk. Sometimes it has been a walk accompanied by my friend the Senator from In the case of Goodwin Liu's nomination to the Ninth Circuit, I was the sole Republican to stand up for this principle and vote against a filibuster. I would not have voted to confirm Mr.Liu, but I felt very strongly that he had the right to an up-or-down vote.  So we are at this place today in considering not a nominee to the Ninth Circuit but a nominee to the Supreme I would ask my colleagues on the Democratic side to give the same deference to Judge  I also pride myself as one who believes in the traditions of the Senate, but it is not the tradition of the Senate to filibuster a U.Supreme Court nominee.  I do not believe that Judge Gorsuch is getting a fair shake in today's Senate, and as deeply as I care about bipartisanship in this body, I will not acquiesce to an effort to deny Judge Gorsuch a seat on the Supreme  I acknowledge my friends on the other side of the aisle who have indicated that they will not support a filibuster, and I implore those of my colleagues who have indicated that they will filibuster the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to reconsider that position.  After spending time with Judge Gorsuch, after studying his life story, I am left with the undeniable impression that Neil Gorsuch has been nominated to a position that he has prepared his whole life to assume. He is not merely a good choice, in my book, he is the best choice. He will not merely be a good Justice; I believe he will be a great Justice, perhaps a Justice of historic proportion.  So today I offer Judge Gorsuch my most enthusiastic endorsement. I have no doubt that before we leave for Easter recess, he will be confirmed as an Associate Justice of the U.Supreme  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  Mr.Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING Without objection, it is so ordered.                                 Syria  Mr.Mr.President, before I get into my remarks about the impending action of the Senate with regard to the so-called nuclear option, I would just point out that the attacks yesterday on innocent men, women, and children should not have come as a surprise. It was in 2013 that the then-Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, and the head of the CIA recommended to the President that we arm the Free Syrian Army and bring Bashar Assad's barbarity to a halt. The President of the United States rejected that. Bashar Assad used chemical weapons, and the President called me and Senator Graham over to the White House and said: If they cross the redline, I am going to act. We are going to degrade Bashar Assad and upgrade the Free Syrian Army and have regime change.  Then, of course, he backed down. You know, there is one thing worse than doing nothing: It is saying you are going to do something and then not doing it. That sent a signal everywhere in the world, not just The fact is, we knew it would happen again. So we have seen this movie before. Unless we act, we are going to see it again.  I am encouraged, frankly, that General Mattis, General McMaster, and the President of the United States have said that this act of incredible barbarity and cruelty will not go unresponded to. But I can assure my colleagues this: If we don't respond to this, then there will be more use of these chemical weapons and weapons of mass destruction, and there will be more innocent people who will die.  Eight years of Obama's failure is what led to the events that just took place that horrified all of us. That requires us to stand up to this barbarity, help the Free Syrian Army, establish safe zones, and make sure that Bashar Assad, propped up by the Russians and the Iranians and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and Hezbollah, is no longer able to perpetrate these war crimes on innocent men, women, and children.  Mr.President, it is also with some sorrow that I regret having to come to[[Page S2308]]the floor to speak once again on the issue of eliminating the 60-vote threshold on judicial nominations, specifically a nominee to the U.Supreme It is particularly troubling to do so because the nominee in question, Judge Neil Gorsuch, has impeccable legal credentials and a strong reputation as a fair- and sharp-minded lawyer and jurist. The American Bar Association and many others of all political stripes agree that his distinguished career as a lawyer and a jurist makes him well qualified for the position of Associate Justice on the U.Supreme  Regrettably, very regrettably, my colleagues in the minority have decided to filibuster the nomination of this good, decent, highly qualified man.  Numerous times over the years, the Senate has come to a standstill over nominees, whether they were judicial or executive branch. That gridlock has inevitably led to threats from the majority--whichever party was in the majority--to use the ``nuclear option,'' basically changing the rules of the Senate of 200 years to strip the minority party of their right to filibuster certain nominees.  I have been privileged several times to be a part of a group of Senators who were able to come together and negotiate agreements to end the gridlock surrounding nominees, avert the nuclear option, and allow the Senate to move forward with our work on behalf of the American people. My work in these groups--often referred to as gangs--has won me both praise and condemnation and has often put me at odds with some in my own party.  In 2005, I joined 13 of my colleagues in an agreement that allowed for votes on three of President Bush's judicial nominees who were being filibustered by the Democrats, who were in the minority at the time. Part of that agreement addressed future nominees. It stated:       Signatories will exercise their responsibilities under the      Advice and Consent Clause of the United States Constitution      in good faith. Nominees should only be filibustered under      extraordinary circumstances, and each signatory must use his      or her own discretion and judgment in determining whether      such circumstances exist.  In other words, if that nominee is so far out of the mainstream that it is extraordinary, only then would they seek to block the nomination and filibuster.  I have had conversations with colleagues on both sides of the aisle in an attempt to once again come up with a way forward and avoid both a filibuster of Judge Gorsuch and the nuclear option. Sadly, I learned on Monday that those efforts had failed and that the Democrats had secured the necessary votes to successfully filibuster the highly qualified Supreme Court nominee for the first time in our history. In response, the majority leader has indicated that he will move to change the Senate rules and eliminate the ability of the minority to do so.  We are in a terrible place. My colleagues should understand that this is a historic moment if we move forward with it.  In 2013, then-Majority Leader Harry Reid changed the Senate rules to eliminate the 60-vote threshold on most judicial and executive branch nominees. Those in my party, including me, were enraged--rightly so. We warned that the Democrats would not be in control of the Senate or the White House forever and that they would come to regret their actions. We were right.  Their actions came back to haunt them. I believe our actions will haunt us as well.  In an op-ed on November 27, 2012, Senator McConnell, knowing of the Democrats' plans to change the Senate rules in their favor, wrote this:       A serious threat has been quietly gathering against one of      the most cherished safeguards of liberty in our government--     the right of a political minority to have a voice. Until now,      this has always been the defining characteristic of the      That's why all Senators have traditionally defended      the Senate as an institution, because they knew that the      Senate was the last legislative check for political      minorities and small states against the kind of raw exercise      of power large states and majority parties have always been      tempted to wield.       The threat I'm referring to is the effort by some      Democrats, most of whom have never served a day in the      minority, to force a change in the Senate rules.  How soon we forget.  In fact, Chairman Grassley exactly predicted what is about to happen. In November 2013, he said:       Not too many years ago, my colleagues on the other side      described their fight to preserve the filibuster with great      pride. Today the other side is willing to forever change the      Senate because the Republicans have the audacity to hold      them, the majority party of today, to their own standard.       The silver lining is that there will come a day when roles      are reversed. When that happens, our side will likely      nominate and confirm lower court and Supreme Court nominees      with 51 votes regardless of whether the Democrats actually      buy into this fanciful notion that they can demolish the      filibuster on lower court nominees and still preserve it for      the Supreme  Senator Alexander, on November 21, 2013, when threatened with the nuclear option by the Democrats, said:       This action today creates a perpetual opportunity for the      tyranny of the majority because it permits a majority in this      body to do whatever it wants to do any time it wants to do      it.  Senator Alexander went on to say:       In my view, this is the most important and most dangerous      restructuring of Senate rules since Thomas Jefferson wrote      them at the beginning of our country.  On November 21, 2013, Senator Shelby said:       Democrats won't be in power in perpetuity. This is a      mistake--a big one for the long run. Maybe not for the short      run. Short-term gains, but I think it changes the Senate      tremendously in a bad way.  The same day, on the same issue, Senator Thune said:       I think Democrats are playing with fire. This is very      dangerous in terms of what it means for the What goes      around comes around. And someday, they're going to be in the      minority.  Senator Burr said on that same day:       The American people know what they get when the minority      party is stripped of its filibuster rights: they get      unchecked power by the executive branch.  He went on to say:       If sweeping legislation and lifetime appointments cannot      muster 60 votes in the United States Senate, then it probably      is not a good idea to force either on the American people.  My own colleagues on this side of the aisle need to remember our own words and heed our own warnings. We will not control this body forever. We will not hold the White House in perpetuity. What we are poised to do at the end of this week will have tremendous consequences, and I fear that someday, we will regret what we are about to do. In fact, I am confident we will.  Having said that, it is hard for me to keep a straight face when I hear the current righteous indignation coming from the other side. After reading the comments some of my Democrat friends made in 2013, it is difficult to have much sympathy for where they find themselves today.  Senator Merkley, who was perhaps the biggest proponent of changing the rules at that time, said this:       Without the nuclear option, Republicans are going to      disable the executive branch.       Ending the abusive filibuster on nominations is a big step      toward restoring the functionality of the Senate, and that      matters for all of us.       This is a terrific vote for the U. Senator Udall said:       I'm just so encouraged now that we're going to be able to--     without filibusters--put people on the courts in an orderly      way.  Senator Warren said on November 13, 2013:       We need to call out these filibusters for what they are:      Naked attempts to nullify the results of the last election.       If Republicans continue to filibuster these highly      qualified nominees for no reason other than to nullify the      President's constitutional authority, then Senators not only      have the right to change the filibuster, Senators have a duty      to change the filibuster rules. We cannot turn our backs on      the We cannot abdicate our oath of office.  Senator Sanders on May 14, 2013, said:       If we bring this nomination to the floor and there is a      request for 60 votes, which we're not going to get, I think      it is time for the Democratic leadership to do what the      American people want, and that is to have a majority rule in      the United States  I did not make up those last quotes. Those are actual quotes. This isn't fake news.  Elections have consequences, my friends. Elections have consequences.  I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle keep this in mind: Now that we are entering into an era where a simple majority decides all judicial nominations, we will see more and more nominees from the extremes of[[Page S2309]]both the left and the right. I do not see how that will ensure a fair and impartial judiciary. In fact, I think the opposite will be true, and Americans will no longer be confident of equal protection under the law.  When then-Majority Leader Reid changed the Senate rules in 2013, there was no one more critical of his actions than the Senator who stands before you now. I fought hard to convince my colleagues of the damage those changes would do to this body. I did so because I love the I revere this institution and the place it holds in our system of government. It is imperative that we have a functioning Senate where the rights of the minority are protected, regardless of which party is in power at the time.  While what happened in 2013 was infuriating to our side, it was also heartbreaking. It was heartbreaking because it seemed to me that the uniqueness of the Senate had been irreparably damaged and, along with it, any hope of restoring meaningful bipartisanship.  The unprecedented nature of the Democrats' filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee has left me in the difficult position of having to decide whether to support finishing what Harry Reid and the Democrats started in 2013 and eliminate the 60-vote threshold on Supreme Court nominations. I find myself torn between protecting the traditions and practices of the Senate and the importance of having a full complement of Justices on the U.Supreme  I am left with no choice. I will vote to change the rules and allow Judge Gorsuch to be confirmed by a simple majority. I will do so with great reluctance, not because I have any doubts that Judge Gorsuch will be an excellent Justice but because of the further--and perhaps irreparable--damage that it will do to the  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

And like any family, Alaska hasbeen blessed with outstanding sons and daughters, distinguished in their own unique ways.  Today I wish to pay tribute to thememory of one such Alaskan, acclaimed watercolorist Byron Byron's passing on December 4, 2016, just 2 weeks shy of his79th birthday, leaves a hole not just in the hearts of Alaskans, but in the art world itself. Given the indelible impact thatByron's prolific volume of work has had on Alaskans over the last 41 years, it is all the more impressive, considering that helived the first half of his life outside the  Born in Buckeye, Arizona on December 18, 1937, Byron was raised in thesuburbs of Los After graduating with a bachelor's degree in history from Seattle Pacific College in 1959, Byronattended Stanford Following his 1960 marriage to his beloved Lynn, who succumbed to breast cancer in 1998, thecouple set out to travel the world. The couple traveled to Africa to teach English and explored the Pacific, living in AmericanSamoa for a few years. They then returned for a job in Seattle before arriving in Anchorage for a job at an advertising agency,which he soon quit to paint full time.  He recalled that it was 1975, during the pipeline boom that he was painting pictures.``People started buying them so I quit work and started painting.'' Byron painted He later explained to the AnchorageDaily News, ``Alaskans love That's what they want to buy.''  Despite his talent in multiple mediums, includingportraiture and oils, Byron will likely be best remembered for his prolific work in watercolor and landscapes, and, perhapsrightly so, as many of the pieces and prints so familiar to most Alaskans were in that format. His work is so highly regardedthat one of his prints, ``McKinley Moonlight,'' was selected to serve as a background for Alaska's heirloom marriagecertificates. As his wife Billie said, Byron was ``inspired by both the scenic beauty of Alaska and its people.''  AlaskaDispatch News writer David James described Byron's landscapes for a recent book Byron completed this year as ``rich with colorand detail. His summer scenes explode with flowers, animals and sunlight, while his images of winter, where snow covers theground and twilight darkens the sky, are alive with elaborate hues and stellar lighting that belie the notion of Alaska as adesolate wasteland for half the year.''  But I would be remiss if I did not take a moment to highlight for the record thatByron's work was not just the beautiful landscapes that Alaskans love so much. Rather, he helped catalog the history of the 49thAmong the many honors we have as Senators is adorning our offices with artwork that represent our In my case,that includes two of Byron's prints proudly hanging in the hallway leading to my office.

It features a crowd huddled in what was then nomore than a tent city near Ship Creek, in what would eventually become downtown Byron's painting reminds me not justof those pioneers who ventured to Alaska with the promise of a new life waiting to be carved out of the wilderness but, despitehow far Alaska has come, how much raw potential still remains.  Despite our rich history and heritage, we are a young State,and many of our founding generation has been--and is now--passing from the scene. However, whether through his capturing of the75th Annual Anchorage Fur Rendezvous Festival or ``Fur Rondy,'' featuring Rondy 10-time champion George Attla racing his sleddog team down 4th Avenue, or in his painting the historic devastation to downtown Anchorage following the 1964 earthquake, Byronwas interpreting and memorializing the highs and lows of our history for generations of Alaskans to come.  I can think of nobetter way to end than with Byron's own words about his life: ``A dream come true. That is what Alaska has given to me.Incredible beauty for subject matter, and a receptive public have combined to allow me to do what I love best, painting all day,every day for more than 41 years.''  On behalf of grateful Alaskans and my fellow Senators, I extend my condolences to Billieand Byron's family. With Byron's passing, Alaska has lost a cultural icon, but his substantial body of work lives onforever.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-12-pt1-PgS310-2.txt,1694,AMATEUR RADIO PARITY ACT OF 2017,2017.0,12.0,January

4405,topic-id,1284,"Mr.President, I want to start by addressing the news last night that Republican leaders have decided to try to make their awful TrumpCare legislation even worse. TrumpCare wasn't enough of a giveaway to insurance companies, and it didn't do enough harm to women, seniors, and people with preexisting conditions, so Republican leaders decided to double down in efforts to appeal to their extreme conservative base.  They are now claiming that they can take away essential health benefits like maternity care, mental health care, and preexisting conditions through the reconciliation process, but here are the facts: Republican leaders know, just as Democrats do, that measures to take away these critically important protections cannot survive the reconciliation process and could never get 60 votes in the They are simply trying to sell conservatives a bill of goods today in the rush to jam this through, but the more they scramble, the more harmful this bill gets for patients and families and the worse it will be for any House Republican who will be held accountable for their votes on it.  As we all know, today marks 7 years since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law. While some here in Congress may view this as an ideal opportunity to ram through a reckless, harmful repeal of the law, I, for one, think about today a little differently.  I remember 7 years ago, standing with a young constituent of mine from Seattle, Marci Owens, as we watched President Obama sign the Affordable Care Act into law. I had met Marci when she was about 11 years old, in the midst of some of the most heated moments of the healthcare reform debate, and to this day, I will never forget the story she told me about her mom, who all of a sudden had become sick, was forced to miss work, and because of that, she lost her job and lost her health insurance. Ultimately, because she wasn't even able to see a doctor or get any care, she died as a result of her illness.  I took that story with me, along with countless other stories of families unable to access care, pay for medication, or see a doctor. I used them as motivation as my colleagues and I worked tirelessly to pass the Affordable Care  Just last month, I was proud to have Marci, who is now 18, attend President Trump's joint address to Congress as my guest. Today, Marci is still sharing her story and advocating for affordable healthcare, as well as transgender rights. She, along with millions of others across the country, is once again standing up, speaking out, and making it clear that we cannot go backward.  I come to the Senate floor to share some of the stories of families in my home State of Washington who are worried, who are afraid, and whose lives will be at risk if President Trump and Republicans take us down this dangerous path to repeal, people whose voices need to be heard more than ever.  I want to make it very clear why we are here and what is at stake. The House Republican TrumpCare bill would have a profoundly negative impact on the lives and the well-being and the financial security of people across the country, people who are truly terrified about the uncertain path forward. Yet, for having such a profound impact, Republicans are seemingly doing everything they can to limit public discussion on This bill was rushed through four House committees without a single public hearing, no testimony, no expert view. House Republicans voted the bill out of two of these committees without a CBO score, without knowing how many people would be impacted.  In the Senate this week, every Senate Democrat on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee called on the chairman to allow for a hearing to talk about this bill, but he refused. He ignored the request, and he held a hearing on other health policy instead. That the Health Committee--the Health Committee--has not been allowed to hold a single hearing to talk about and debate TrumpCare is appalling and shameful.  Not to be outdone, of course, the majority leader, instead of committing to give all Senators time to review and evaluate the bill, has now said the bill will go straight to the floor for a vote as soon as next week, prompting even Members of his own party to come out against this plan.  In all, these efforts are unprecedented. They are wrong, and they speak volumes about the kind of bill they are trying to ram through, because we now know many of the facts of the bill.  This bill will kick 24 million people off their coverage. It will cause premiums to skyrocket. Seniors will pay more for their care. It will put at risk those who are struggling with mental illness and substance use disorders, including opioid addiction. It would end Medicaid as we know it.  Predictively, it attacks women's constitutionally protected healthcare and rights. It defunds Planned Parenthood and puts insurance companies back in charge of other critical parts of women's healthcare, including maternity care, cancer screenings, and contraception. This bill undermines women's access to healthcare and women's ability to make their own healthcare decisions in virtually every way a piece of legislation could.  I oppose this bill in the strongest terms. I am going to be doing everything I can to fight back against it, and I know Senate Democrats will as well.  Families across the country are looking to us, and they have nowhere else to turn. Like many of my colleagues, I have constituents coming up to me constantly when I am at home, asking me what is going to happen if TrumpCare becomes law. They are bravely sharing deeply personal stories about their health, their families, and their fears--something they should not have to do. They deserve to be heard.

4390,topic-id,774,"Mr.Speaker, just hours after the President's misguided, counterproductive, and objectively anti-American Muslim ban was signed, we saw the effects. Chaos erupted at airports around the country, including in my own district at Chicago O'Green card holders were held in legal limbo. Refugees fleeing violence and persecution were sent away before boarding U.S.-bound flights, even after enduring years of thorough screening and vetting.  Unfortunately, this is not the first time we have turned away innocent people seeking safety in our country. In 1939, the German ocean liner Louis Manifest and its 937 Jewish passengers, almost all Jewish refugees, were turned away from the Port of Miami and sent back to Of those passengers, 254 were murdered in the  We all bear a responsibility to learn from the evils of history so that we will never make the same mistakes again. It is our turn to step up and fight to protect the values of our Nation and ensure that we are on the right side of history. Because who can possibly forget the photo of Alan Kurdi, the 3-year-old Syrian boy who was washed up on a Turkish beach. Or Omran Daqneesh, the 5-year-old Syrian boy covered in blood as he waited for emergency care after being rescued from a building in Aleppo hit by an airstrike. These devastating images have become symbols of the refugee crisis. We cannot let them symbolize our inaction, too.  The President's executive order creating this Muslim ban undermines the foundational ideas of this country, a Nation founded by immigrants with the intention of providing freedom, opportunity, and a better life to all who seek it. Making good on one of his most extreme campaign promises, the President signed this order with little or no input from his own national security advisers nor from specialists at the State Department, Homeland Security, or the Justice Department, once again signaling his strong and continued dismissal of facts, evidence, and advice from seasoned experts.  Contrary to the President's misguided belief, Islam is not the issue, and his decision to go after Muslims instead of terrorists only fuels our enemies' propaganda. The President's Muslim ban undermines our national security goals and is counterproductive in the fight against terrorism. The ban jeopardizes our strategic partnerships with allies in the Middle East who are on the very front lines in the fight against Asylum seekers and foreign nationals have provided invaluable assistance to our military and diplomats in a variety of roles overseas. I agree with Senators McCain and Graham, who said this ban will become ``a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism.'' Ultimately, this order is more likely to increase terrorist recruitment than to deter it.  Outrage over this ban extends far beyond national security and counterterrorism experts. For example, we are seeing sharp criticism from business leaders across the country, including CEOs of companies like Google, Apple, Facebook, and They recognize that immigrants play a huge role in fostering our Nation's entrepreneurial spirit, advancing new technology, creating startups, all which spur innovation and economic activity across the country.  Universities and academics across the country are also grappling with what the President's restrictions mean for their students and for scholarship and academia more broadly. Students benefit from the inclusion of all world views, which provide us with a deeper understanding of science, the arts, economic policy, national security, and all other aspects of our society.  Let's be clear. My own city of Chicago has been and will continue to be home to an immigrant and refugee community from all around the world, and we are forever enriched and grateful for the contributions that make this country great. I, along with the majority of American people who took to the streets to make their opposition heard loud and clear, demand that the administration rescind this shameful order before even more grave and lasting damage is done.  Let's call a spade a spade. Despite the White House's insistence that this is not a Muslim ban, the policy laid out by the President will almost exclusively impact In fact, the President went so far as to point out that this administration will prioritize the admittance for Christian refugees. If this is not a religious test, then what is?  Refugees of all faiths, creeds, race, and national origins have looked to America as a beacon of freedom.

4506,topic-id,577,"Mr.Speaker, it is official: the Oakland Raiders are moving to Las Beginning in 2020, they will play in a shiny, new 65,000-seat stadium outfitted with a retractable roof that is expected to cost $1.9 billion.  If you are an American taxpayer, you will help pay for it, even if you live nowhere near About $750 million for the project will be financed through municipal bonds, which are tax exempt. The Federal tax break is projected to amount to some $120 million, according to a study by the Brookings  Congress and President Trump should take the Raiders' bad example as an impetus for reform. As the President considers a $1 trillion plan to restore America's aging roads, rail, bridges, waterways, and airports, lawmakers should ask why so many stadiums are following the Las Vegas model, fleeing one bad economic State and using your tax dollars to go to another.  The alternative is what we did in Oklahoma City in 1993. Our residents passed a temporary 1 percent increase in sales tax to fund, without incurring a debt, a building spree called the Metropolitan Area Projects, or Over 5 years, the plan raised $350 million for nine projects, including a stadium now called the Chesapeake Energy Arena, home to NBA basketball's Oklahoma City This pay-as-you-go approach may sound unremarkable, but it is nothing short of exceptional.  Most professional sports stadiums these days are financed with municipal bonds, something that they were never intended to be used for. But this kind of debt wasn't intended for lavish football stadiums or basketball arenas. Municipal bonds were supposed to give communities a way to build public projects--hospitals, schools, roads--without having to pay Federal taxes on the debt's interest. The point was to ease the financial burden on cities and States that invest in expensive but essential infrastructure.  Over the past 30 years, however, stadium financiers have exploited a loophole in the Tax Code to qualify professional sports arenas for municipal bonds. Because Federal taxes aren't incurred on the interest of this debt, stadiums essentially receive a multimillion-dollar subsidy from  Last year, a Brookings study examined 45 stadiums built or seriously renovated since 2000; 36 were funded at least in part with municipal bonds, resulting in forgone Federal tax revenue of $3.7 billion. That is enough money to employ 88,000 military staff sergeants or give each State a $74 million block grant, or it could help reduce the national debt.  To solve this problem, I have introduced, along with my Democratic colleague, Earl Blumenauer from Oregon, H.811. This bipartisan No Tax Subsidies for Stadiums Act would prohibit arena financiers from using municipal bonds. Instead of building enormous, lavish sports facilities on the backs of unsuspecting taxpayers across the Nation, financiers should ask communities to buy into their vision. If residents want a stadium to be built, fine. They should be willing to pay for it like we did in Oklahoma City; or sports franchises and leagues always have the option to finance construction like most businesses do, privately.  Funding an upgrade to America's core infrastructure will be a challenge. It shouldn't require Congress to use budget gimmicks or run up the national debt.  Closing loopholes, such as requiring stadium financiers to pay Federal taxes on bond interest that was intended to improve our decaying infrastructure, would ensure taxpayers get the best return on their dollars to improve public infrastructure that all Americans use.

4419,topic-id,525,"Madam President, today, we will vote on a resolution that will take away privacy protections from the American people. By voting for this resolution, Congress is ignoring the fact that people want more protections online, not fewer.  In 2016, Pew did a study to determine the state of privacy in the United States, and the center found ``Americans express a consistent lack of confidence about the security of everyday communication channels and the organizations that control them.''  Pew found that this is especially true when it comes to the internet. People no longer trust organizations--public or private--to protect the data they collect.  Today, we are going to make that worse. That is because broadband providers know our complete browsing history. Think about that for a second. They know everything we do online, everything we search for on a daily basis. Think about how personal that information is, how it paints a picture of who we are. It is totally reasonable for broadband providers to have to ask customers for their consent before they take that information--our browsing history, what we do online--and sell it to a third party.  That will no longer be the case after the Republicans vote for this bill and it is enacted into law. Broadband providers will be able to take your browsing history and sell it without your permission. The FCC spent months on this rule, and by using the CRA to get rid of it, Congress is taking away the FCC's authority to do anything like it ever again. That will mean there is no Federal agency--not the FTC, not the FCC--that will even have jurisdiction over the issue of privacy for broadband providers.  What is the solution here? We should work with the private sector, the FCC, and the FTC to find a comprehensive solution together.  At a time when data collection and use is increasing exponentially, Republicans should not be rolling back protections for consumers. This is yet another repeal without replace.  Fifty-five years ago this month, President Kennedy gave a seminal speech about consumer rights. He spoke about the march of technology--how it had outpaced old laws and regulations and how fast that progress had occurred. That progress is only getting faster. The next massive technological change will be the ``internet of things,'' in which we will have tens of billions of devices connected to each other and interacting with us whether we like it or not.  As technology marches on, what stays the same is the bedrock principle that President Kennedy outlined, which is that consumers have a right to be safe, a right to be informed, a right to choose, and a right to be heard. Those rights are in jeopardy. The FCC took a small but important step, but the Republicans are walking it back.  Let me be clear. This is the single biggest step backward in online privacy in many years. I urge a ``no'' vote.  I ask unanimous consent all time be yielded back.  The PRESIDING Without objection, all time is yielded back.  The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read the third time.

I would particularly like to recognize the outstanding work done by every Democratic member of the Judiciary They were outstanding in questioning Judge Gorsuch despite his lack of candor and desire to answer. I would like to particularly call out our exceptional ranking member, Senator Feinstein, who has done a wonderful job leading that committee.  I have thought long and hard about his nomination and what it means for the future of the Supreme Court and for the future of our country. What is at stake is considerable. The decisions we make here in the Senate over the next few weeks about Judge Gorsuch, as on any Supreme Court nominee, will echo through the lifetime tenure of that judge, through a generation of  Discussions of the Supreme Court can get wonky and technical, with invocations of precedent and canons of interpretation. What is at stake, however, is not at all abstract; it is real and it is concrete for Americans, whose lives, health, happiness, and freedoms are on the line at the Supreme Closely divided decisions recently have meant the difference between the ability to marry the person you love or not, the ability to have your right to vote protected or not, the ability to make personal choices about your own healthcare or not. The Supreme Court matters a great deal. It matters for workers who want to protect both their lives and their jobs, for employees who need to be able to seek redress for discrimination, and for parents who want their kids to get a fair shake in the education system.  It is with all this in mind that I have come to a decision about the current nominee. After careful deliberation, I have concluded that I cannot support Judge Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme His nomination will face a cloture vote. He will have to earn 60 votes for confirmation. My vote will be no, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.  To my Republican friends who think that if Judge Gorsuch fails to reach 60 votes, we ought to change the rules, I say: If this nominee cannot earn 60 votes--a bar met by each of President Obama's nominees and George Bush's last two nominees--the answer isn't to change the rules, it is to change the nominee.  This morning, I would like to lay out the reasons I will be voting no on this nomination.  First, Judge Gorsuch was unable to sufficiently convince me that he would be an independent check on a President who has shown almost no restraint from Executive overreach.  Second, he was unable to convince me that he would be a mainstream Justice who could rule free from the biases of politics and ideology. His career and judicial record suggest not a neutral legal mind but someone with a deep-seated conservative ideology. He was groomed by the Federalist Society and has not shown 1 inch of difference between his views and theirs.  Finally, he is someone who almost instinctively favors the powerful over the weak, corporations over working There could not be a worse time for someone with those instincts.  Judge Gorsuch's opportunity to disabuse us of all these objections was in the hearing process, but he declined to answer question after question after question with any substance. Absent a real description of judicial philosophy, all we have to judge the judge on is his record.  First, I want to address the first issue I raised, that of judicial independence. It is so clear that at this moment in our history, our democracy requires a judge who is willing to rule against this This administration seems to have little regard for the rule of law and is likely to test the Constitution in ways it hasn't been challenged in decades. It is absolutely the case that this Supreme Court will be tried in ways that few courts have been tested since the earliest days of the Republic when constitutional questions abounded.  The President himself has attacked individual judges and the credibility of the judiciary at large. The President has attacked a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit and said if they didn't decide with him, they would be responsible for the next terrorist act. I have never heard any President in my lifetime or read about any President in previous history who dared do that. We are in uncharted territory with this President and with judicial independence. It requires a strong independent backbone. Judge Gorsuch has shown none. Senators on the Judiciary Committee rightly asked Judge Gorsuch direct questions about this issue. I did so myself in my meeting with the judge. While the judge repeatedly asserted his independence, he could not point to anything in his record to guarantee it. Judge Gorsuch offered the Judiciary myriad platitudes on this point. ``No man is above the law,'' he said. He said he was ``disheartened'' by the President's attacks on the judiciary. The President, for his sake, said that Judge Gorsuch didn't mean him, and everyone left it at that.  If Judge Gorsuch had an ounce of courage, had shown a scintilla of an ability to be independent, he would have said: No, Mr.No, President Trump, I did mean you. Instead, he just tells us in general that he is demoralized, disheartened. Telling us is not the same as showing us. He is asking us to take him at his word, but his record suggests that he has long been someone who has advocated extreme deference to assertions of broad Presidential power.  That leads me to my second point; that Judge Gorsuch was unable to convince me that he would be a neutral judge, free of ideology and bias. The hearings this week were an opportunity for Judge Gorsuch to explain his record, to tell us how he thinks and how his judicial philosophy does not fundamentally advantage the powerful. Instead, we got banalities and platitudes. We didn't get any real answers to any real questions about what he thinks about the law and why. He refused to answer general questions on dark money in politics, LGBTQ rights, the constitutionality of the Muslim ban. I couldn't believe it, when I asked him: Is a law that bans Muslims, a law that just said all Muslims are banned from the U.unconstitutional, he couldn't even answer that. He refused to say whether he agreed with Supreme Court decisions in seminal cases like Brown v. Board, Roe v. Wade, Griswold v. Connecticut, despite the fact that his predecessors, Justices Roberts and Alito, said they agreed with those cases.  He refused to answer questions about the emoluments clause, a section of the[[Page S1946]]Constitution that prohibits foreign corruption of U.officials. Instead of an umpire calling balls and strikes in baseball, what we really saw was a well-trained expert in dodgeball.  My friend, the ranking member of the committee, said it best. ``What worries me,'' she told the nominee, ``is that you have been very much able to avoid any specificity like no one I have ever seen before.''  Let me repeat. There is no legal standard, rule, or even logic for failing to answer questions that don't involve immediate and specific cases that are or could come before the It is evasion, just evasion, plain and simple, and it belies a deeper truth about this nominee.  If anyone doubts that Judge Gorsuch doesn't have strong views, that thinks he would be a neutral judge calling balls and strikes as Judge Roberts once put it, just look at the way he was chosen. He was supported and pushed forward by the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society, and groomed by billionaire conservatives like Mr.President Trump simply picked someone from off their list.  President Trump sought the advice and consent from the Federalist Society instead of from the U.Does anyone think the Federalist Society would choose someone who just called balls and strikes? Does anyone think they would put on their list a neutral, moderate judge when they haven't ever supported anyone but judicial conservatives, almost all hard-right judicial conservatives in their history? The Federalist Society has been dedicated for a generation to influence the courts to favor corporations and special interests. If anyone doubts that Judge Gorsuch could be an activist judge with views eschewing the interests of average people, look at how he was selected--by a group that is not neutral, a group that has been dedicated to changing the judiciary and placing activist, hard-right judges on the bench. Now that he is nominated, look at how much money, dark, secret, undisclosed money--it is a good bet from the very corporations Judge Gorsuch has been defending his whole career. If he were so neutral, would they be spending this money? I doubt it.  Anyone groomed by the Federalist Society will not call balls and strikes. Their views are best foretold by the ideology of the people who groomed them. To say Judge Gorsuch has no ideology whatsoever is absurd. He just will not admit it to the American people. To say he is just neutral in his views is belied by his history since his college days and by his own judicial record. He even tried to deny it. In the hearings, Judge Gorsuch repeated the hollow assertion that judges don't have parties or politics. He said there are no Democratic judges or Republican judges, but if that were true, we wouldn't be here, would we? If that were true, if the Senate were merely evaluating a nominee based on his or her qualifications, Merrick Garland would be seated on the Supreme Court right now. Merrick Garland is not a We all know why. We all know my friends across the aisle held the Supreme Court seat open for over 1 year in hopes that they would have the opportunity to install someone handpicked by the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society to advance the goal of Big Money interests entrenching their power in the  They don't even mind that this nomination is moving forward under a cloud of an FBI investigation of the President's campaign. The Republicans held a Supreme Court seat open for a year under a Democratic President who was under no investigation but now are rushing to fill the seat for a President whose campaign is under investigation. It is unseemly and wrong to be moving so fast on a lifetime appointment in such circumstances.  Finally, Judge Gorsuch came into this hearing with a record that raises deep concerns about whether he would consider fairly the plight of the average citizen before the interests of powerful special interests. I examined his record. I saw a judge who repeatedly decided with insurance companies that wanted to deny disability benefits to employees. I saw a judge who, in unemployment discrimination, sided with employers the great majority of the time. I saw a judge who, on the issue of money and politics, seems to be in the same company as Justices Thomas and Scalia, willing to restrict the most commonsense contribution limits.  In the hearings, Judge Gorsuch did nothing to explain his philosophy, did nothing to assuage those concerns. We will just have to go by his record, a record that shows time and time again his rulings favor the already powerful over ordinary  Judge Gorsuch ruled against a teacher, Grace Hwang, who, having been through two bouts of cancer, was advised by her doctors not to return to the college campus during a flu epidemic lest she put her life at risk. She was fired for taking sick leave. Judge Gorsuch, true to form, voted to uphold that dismissal. Her daughter Katherine told us last week:       This decision to protect her health cost my mom her job.      When Judge Gorsuch issued his ruling, he didn't think about      the impact that this had on our family. The law calls for      ``reasonable accommodation for those who are disabled.''  Judge Gorsuch ignored the human cost.  Judge Gorsuch ruled against a truckdriver, Alfonse Maddin, who had to make a similar choice between his employer and his life. I met with him. He told me a harrowing story of being stuck in the cab of a tractor-trailer with frozen brakes, no heat, temperatures outside dipping to 27 below zero. He had a choice, leave the trailer with broken brakes and drive the cab to safety or stay in the trailer and freeze to death. He radioed his company to explain his predicament. They told him that the cargo was the most important thing; he couldn't leave it. Rather than risk the lives of other motorists on a freezing highway by driving a trailer with frozen brakes, Mr.Maddin struggled to unhitch his trailer and drive his cab to safety--returning later for it once he was not at risk of dying from the cold. For that, his company fired him. He sued. Seven judges heard this case as it went through appeal. Only one, Judge Gorsuch, in dissent, ruled against him. Judge Gorsuch used an exceptionally technical and illogical reading of the statute to reach the absurd conclusion that Mr.Maddin was obligated to risk his life to protect his cargo.  Mr.Maddin said that Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court gives him ``pause for concern'' because he ``demonstrated a willingness to artfully diminish the humane element that encompassed the issue.''  Judge Gorsuch also ruled against a parent of a severely autistic child, Luke, who sought what the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act guarantees him--the right to an education that met his needs. Jeff Perkins, Luke's father, is testifying before the Judiciary Committee today. Their story is powerful. Judge Gorsuch ruled that Luke was not entitled to attend a specialized school because he was able to make more than de minimis progress in the normal educational system.  Just yesterday, the Supreme Court unanimously--including Justice Alito and so many others who are so conservative--rejected Judge Gorsuch's interpretation of the The Court held that ``when all is said and done, a student offered an educational program providing `merely more than a de minimis progress from year to year can hardly be said to have been offered an education at all.' '' That puts Judge Gorsuch's interpretation of the IDEA law to the right of even Justice Thomas--a very difficult feat.  Whom we put on the bench, their basic judgment, matters. While I do not think that the personal views and experiences should bear on the decisions of day-to-day cases, there is a reason we don't program computers to decide cases. We do not want judges with ice water in their veins. What we want and need are judges who understand the litigants before them and bring a modicum--at least a modicum--of human judgment into the courtroom. You can call this trait empathy or mercy. I think it falls in the category of common sense. It is common sense that necessarily comes from each person's own, unique life experience. Even Judge Gorsuch acknowledged this when he told the committee ``I am not an algorithm.'' Yet he wouldn't tell us how, as a human--a nonalgorithm--he would uniquely approach a case.  When it comes to the application of the law, that empathy, that mercy,[[Page S1947]]that ``humane element'' of common sense--as Alphonse Maddin, the truckdriver, put it--is the most important judicial trait of them all because ultimately the law is abstract, but the people and situations are real. The task of the judge is to apply those abstract legal doctrines to very humane and sometimes very messy situations. It is a hard thing to do to bring fairness and justice to a world that is too short on both.  I am reminded of the words spoken by Portia, the great lawyer in ``The Merchant of Venice,'' who spoke of the blessings and necessity of mercy in applying the law.  He said:     The quality of mercy is not strain'd,     It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven     Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest:     It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.     'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes     The thron-ed monarch better than his crown;     His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,     The attribute to awe and majesty,     Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;     But mercy is above this sceptred sway,     It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,     It is an attribute to God himself.  Judge Gorsuch told us he is not God, and that is true, but his humanity does not excuse him from the attribute of mercy. Instead, his humanity should require it.  Alphonse Maddin sought the mercy of the law. The Hwang family sought the mercy of the law. Luke, the autistic child whose school was failing him, sought the mercy of the law. The man who had the power to see plain sense in their cases, who could rule in their favor and right the wrongs that had been done to them as other judges had done in each of those cases--Judge Neil Gorsuch--said no.  I am voting no on Gorsuch for Alphonse Maddin and workers across the country, for the Hwang family and others who do not want to choose between their health and providing for their children, and for the Perkins family, who loves their children just as they are and wants for them no fewer than the opportunities afforded to every other child in  The American people deserve someone who sees average litigants as more than incidental consequences of precedent, when that precedent produces an absurd result, whose view of the law is not so cold and so arid so as to wring out every last drop of humanity and common sense. It requires only the bare minimum of judicial decency to rule the right way in the cases I have mentioned, and Judge Gorsuch did not.  That is all the evidence my colleagues should need to vote no, and I urge them and will urge them in the days ahead to do so.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

4472,topic-id,547,"Mr.President, I wish to address a troubling report about the President-elect's nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services that came out last night. We learned that Congressman Price bought shares in a medical device manufacturing company just days before introducing legislation in the House that would directly benefit that company.  His legislation wasn't broad legislation. It didn't affect health care in general. It specifically blocked a regulation on medical device companies that do hip and knee implants, including the very business he bought stock in. According to CNN, the company Representative Price bought stock in was one of two companies that would have been hardest hit by this new regulation--one of two--and he puts in legislation to repeal it just after buying stock in it.  Again, this is not someone who has Johnson & Johnson stock and then votes to cut This is a narrow company that works on hip and knee implants--narrow legislation that deals with undoing some regulations on them. It is really troubling.  These revelations come on top of the report late last year by CQ and the Wall Street Journal that Congressman Price had traded stocks in dozens of health care companies valued at hundreds of thousands of dollars during his time in the House as chair on the Budget Committee, when he introduced, sponsored, or cosponsored several pieces of legislation that impacted these companies.  Yesterday's report makes it clear that this isn't just a couple of questionable trades but, rather, a clear and troubling pattern of Congressman Price trading stock and using his office to benefit the companies in which he was investing.  Our President-elect claims he wants to drain the swamp, but Congressman Price has spent his career filling it up. I have asked the Office of Congressional Ethics to investigate whether or not Congressman Price violated the STOCK Act during his time in office before his nomination moves forward in any way.  It may well be that this trade was illegal. This isn't a witch hunt. These are serious and disquieting allegations. The American people deserve to know if their potential Secretary of Health and Human Services violated a law against insider trading in  The facts here are a narrow company with hip and knee implants and legislation with hip and knee implants coming soon thereafter, after he bought stock--whoa. These questions cry out for answers before--let me underline ``before''--Nominee Price goes before the Senate Finance  When the public faith in government is as low as it is today, when politics and campaigns are saturated by money, as they are today, when folks feel their representatives are beholden to special interests before their constituents, reports like the one that just came out about Congressman Price perpetuate that distrust. They add fuel to the fire.  We need to get to the bottom of these allegations and get to the bottom of them quickly. The only way to restore faith in our government and in our most important democratic institutions is to insist upon transparency and ethical behavior by those in positions of the highest public trust. Until a congressional ethics investigation can be completed, this report and his previous trades cast serious doubt on whether Congressman Price is fit to hold the office of Secretary of Health and Human                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-17-pt1-PgS324.txt,1036,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017.0,17.0,January

Totally different, I would say to my good friend the majority leader, than what happened when President Obama took office. As I said, our constitutional duty to advise and consent does not mean ramming through nominees. Here are three instances, just new ones. They pile up.

Before he leaves the floor, picking up on the remarks of our colleague from Massachusetts, I am particularly struck by the fact that I have always thought that it is a classic conservative principle to empower the individual--to empower the individual to make fundamental choices about what would be important to them and their family and their wallets and all of the activities that are central to the life of a working class family.  What we have been touching on--very eloquently by my colleague from Massachusetts--is we are going to be voting in a little bit to strip rights from individuals, to retreat from that classic conservative principle of empowering individuals and families to make decisions.  I think, for all of the reasons that my colleague from Massachusetts has talked about and that Senator Nelson has been talking about, this idea of stripping from individuals the right to make these fundamental decisions and allowing the gatekeepers of the internet to collect, share, and profit from personal information of consumers without their consent is an extraordinary mistake for our country at this time.  I serve on the Senate Select Committee on I think, for many people, these issues have, in effect, converged with respect to privacy policy as it relates to the private marketplace, which is what this ill-advised proposal that we are going to vote on today is all about.  We are constantly offered up ideas that suggest that you really are faced with what amounts to a flawed set of choices. In the intelligence area, we are consistently told: Well, you just have to give up a little bit of liberty to have security. And the reality is that liberty and security are not mutually exclusive. Smart policies give us both. They give us security and liberty. Unfortunately, around here, we are coming up with policies, like weakening strong encryption, that are reducing both--reducing security and reducing liberty. I think what we are dealing with here on this ill-advised resolution in the Senate, with respect to the FCC rule, is yet another set of false choices--that you can either have internet access or privacy. They are not mutually exclusive. Just as we can have security and liberty, we can have internet access and privacy for all of the reasons that my friend from Massachusetts has been outlining.  Now, the FCC acted on the responsibility given to them by the Congress to protect browsing history--arguably the most intimate, personal information imaginable. Browsing history makes what the Senate did in the past with metadata look like small potatoes. Browsing history is really a picture into your personal life. I have appreciated the support of my colleagues for making sure that in the intelligence field, without court oversight, you couldn't get access to people's browsing history.  The Congress, in effect, told the Federal Communications Commission to protect browsing history, favorite applications, and even locations of American broadband users, and the FCC acted on it. Before that time, there were no rules in place outlining how an internet service provider--those are the ISPs that we always hear Senators talking about--may use, share, or even sell their customers' private information. So, just as the FCC has done for wireline phone customers, the FCC said it was going to keep up with the evolution of telecommunications networks by ensuring privacy protections would apply to broadband internet use. This struck a lot of us as just common sense. Again, building on the conservative principle of empowering the individual, the judgment was that by creating what are called ``opt-in'' consent agreements, where the consumer makes an affirmative decision about what they want--it is not what government wants, it is not what big companies want, it is what the consumer wants. The judgment was that by creating this opt-in consent agreement, the consumer would get a clear understanding of what the broadband provider knows about them from, for example, their computer or from their smartphone.[[Page S1949]]  The big internet service providers are in a unique position to see where information flows over the networks and can see more of Americans' data than probably anybody else in what we might call the internet ecosystem. The websites we visit, what we look for, what time we are online--all of this, even our location--would be considered highly personal and highly sensitive information.  The responsibility of the internet service provider is to protect consumer privacy. It is compounded by the fact that the majority of broadband consumers have only one option for fast internet service to their home. There is only one company offering them service. So it seems to me what we are talking about--what Senator Markey has outlined--really looks like bad news for folks in rural areas where they are only going to have one provider, and, frankly, I think in a lot of metropolitan areas, particularly where there are modest-income individuals.  Without these protections in place, most consumers are left with the choice of giving up their browsing history for an internet service provider to sell to the highest bidder or to have no internet at all. So think about what that means for, say, an older person.  By the way, under what is being considered in the other body on healthcare, people between 50 and 64 aren't going to have a lot of extra money laying around. Those are people who are going to get clobbered--clobbered--by the healthcare bill that is being considered in the House today.  What is being considered in the House today--talking about the wallets of people between 50 and 64--would allow the insurance companies to charge people who are pre-Medicare five times as much as younger people. So they are already going to be paying thousands of dollars more out-of-pocket. Now, given what may happen in this body, we would have consumers left with the choice of giving up their browsing history for an internet service provider to sell to the highest bidder or have no internet at all. So we are socking it to them in terms of their healthcare premiums, and then we are socking it to them in terms of essential communications as well.  I just think this is unacceptable and certainly contrary to the whole notion of classic conservatism, empowering the individual. And it is certainly taking away these rights from folks in rural America--most of my towns in Oregon have populations of under 10,000 people. This proposal that is being discussed here is going to strip consumers of basic rights that are practically a requirement for economic success in the 21st century.  I am going to close by picking up on another point that I think Senator Markey said very well, and I believe I heard Senator Nelson, our ranking member, touch on as well. It looks to me like a subject that should not be in controversy: basic transparency and accountability for the individual, and individual empowerment. It shouldn't be controversial. It shouldn't be a contentious matter. My colleague and I served in the other body for a number of years, and we built coalitions of people all across the political spectrum around the principles we are advocating today. Providing transparency and empowering the individual shouldn't be a contentious issue.  Under these regulations, internet service providers can still collect and use their subscribers' information. The rules simply ensure that internet service providers receive consent--receive permission from an empowered consumer--that it is OK to reuse or sell their information, and the companies would provide the consumers an explanation of how their data is collected and where it is shared. These rules are about transparency, plain and simple. Customers, especially those, as I have indicated, who are captive to one internet service provider, deserve to know how their internet service provider is using their data.  The broadband privacy rules are not some kind of attack on monetizing consumer data, but simply a recognition of the importance of consumer consent.  I will close by saying that more and more in this area, the American people are getting presented false choices. They are being told, as I see on the Intelligence Committee, that you have to give up some of your liberty to have your security. Those are false choices. They are not mutually exclusive. Everyone in America, everyone paying attention to this debate ought to know that they have a right to both. Don't ever, ever let a politician tell you that you have to give up some of your liberty to have your security. You have a right to vote, and it is our job, colleagues on both sides of the aisle, to come up with policies that do both.  Today, we ought to make sure that people aren't presented with another false choice--that to have Internet access you have to give up your privacy rights. You can have both, and the Federal Communications Commission has sought to come up with a sensible policy to do that.  So I join my colleagues, particularly my friend from Massachusetts, who knows so much about this field, and our terrific ranking minority member, Senator Nelson, in urging colleagues to oppose a harmful resolution that, in my view, turns class conservatism on its head and strips consumers of their rights in a truly ill-advised manner.  I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2017-03-23-pt1-PgS1942-4.txt,1247,PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY,2017.0,23.0,March

4469,topic-id,478,"Mr.President, today I, along with my colleague Senator Paul from Kentucky, am introducing the Protecting Data at the Border Act, a bill that protects Americans and U.Permanent Residents from warrantless searches of their electronic devices at the border.  1n 2014, the Supreme Court established in California v. Riley that law enforcement agencies must obtain a probable cause search warrant before they can search someone's phone or laptop during a ``search incident to arrest.'' Prior to that decision, law enforcement agencies around the country routinely engaged in warrantless searches of phones and other electronic devices. The Supreme Court rightly recognized that we need new, stronger rules to protect digital information.  Although the warrant protections from Riley have been the law of the land for the last three years, a significant loophole has remained: the border. The Riley decision left unresolved the question of whether or not U.Customs can search the smartphones and laptops of U.persons as they leave the country and return home. This is not a theoretical concern. According to recent statistics provided by Customs and Border Protection, searches of cellphones by border agents has exploded, growing fivefold in just one[[Page S2217]]year, from fewer than 5,000 in 2015 to nearly 25,000 in 2016. Five-thousand devices were searched this last February alone, more than in all of 2015.  My colleague, Senator Paul and I intend to close this loophole, ensuring that U.persons crossing the border do not have lesser digital privacy rights than individuals who are arrested inside the United  This bill has four main components.  First, it requires that law enforcement agencies obtain a probable cause warrant before they can search the laptop, smartphone or other electronic device belonging to a U.person at the border. The bill includes an emergency exception to this warrant requirement, modeled after USA Freedom Act section 102, which became law in 2015.  Second, it requires informed, written consent before the government may request and obtain voluntary assistance from a U.person accessing data on a locked device or account, such as by disclosing their password or otherwise providing access. The bill also prohibits the government from delaying or denying entry to a U.person if he or she refuses to provide such assistance.  Third, it requires that the government obtain a warrant before it can copy and retain a U.person's data, even if the data has been collected without a warrant, during an emergency.  Fourth, it requires that the government create and publish statistics on the electronic border searches they conduct.  Passage of this bill would ensure that the important privacy rights recognized by the Supreme Court in Riley also apply at the border, while still enabling law enforcement agencies continue to do the important work of keeping our country safe.  I thank my colleague Senator Paul for his efforts on this bill, and I hope the Senate will consider our proposal quickly.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgS2216.txt,1247,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017.0,4.0,February
4499,topic-id,221,"Mr.Speaker, today is National Human Trafficking Awareness Day, an issue close to my heart.  Human trafficking is nothing more than modern-day slavery. Last Congress, the Foreign Affairs Committee shined a light onthis scourge that affects millions around the world and passed into law the International Megan's Law, which attacks child sextourism by child sex offenders, improves international law enforcement cooperation, and improves notices of child sex offenderstraveling to the U. We have come a long way in creating awareness, but more must be done. According to the Polaris Project, from 2007 to 2015,over 25,000 cases of human trafficking were discovered in the United States, and 7,700 of these were minors. Over 100,000 callswere made to the National Human Trafficking Resource Center hotline.  We all know this is an issue that does not discriminate. It can affect everyone. In north Florida, over Christmas, a man wasarrested for trafficking a woman across five county lines. This case started with him luring her to Florida over the Internetand ended when law enforcement were able to save the victim after seeing her in adult advertisements online.  I want to thank all those who were involved in bringing this person to justice.  On this National Human Trafficking Awareness Day, we in Congress will not look away. We will continue to fight the scourgecalled human trafficking.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-11-pt1-PgH373.txt,2115,NATIONAL HUMANTRAFFICKING AWARENESS DAY,2017.0,11.0,March
