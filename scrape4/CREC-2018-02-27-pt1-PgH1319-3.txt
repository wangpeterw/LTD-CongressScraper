                    STOLEN: THE INNOCENCE OF A CHILD

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Jane was 9 years old--9--when she was 
first trafficked in Brownsville, Texas. For 3 years, Maria Losoya 
trafficked the child. That is her right there. She trafficked Jane from 
town to town in south Texas. Losoya filled her own pockets by selling 
Jane at the marketplace of modern-day sex slavery.
  Mr. Speaker, filthy criminals steal children like Jane's youth, 
innocence, and they try to steal their souls. Jane's story finally came 
to light when she alerted authorities at her school in 2015. Now she is 
trying to cope with the guilt and shame of her past.
  Mr. Speaker, it is not Jane who should be ashamed; it is the 
dastardly human traffickers like Maria Losoya who should be ashamed. 
That is why my legislation, the Shame Act, gives Federal judges the 
ability to publish the names and photographs of convicted buyers and 
sellers of our children. Buyers and sellers will no longer be able to 
hide in plain sight under the cloak of being anonymous. Those who sell 
and buy the innocence of children should be shamed for all to see.
  And that is just the way it is.
