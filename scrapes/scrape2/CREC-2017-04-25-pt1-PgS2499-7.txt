                      DAYS OF REMEMBRANCE CEREMONY

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, many decades ago, historic tragedy 
befell a continent, and unimaginable horror visited a people.
  Behind cold steel gates and within huddled boxcars, man's capacity 
for cruelty reached grim new frontiers. An inhuman campaign of 
extermination by an inhuman regime not only took aim at the Jewish 
people but also tore deep at the collective bonds of our humanity. The 
scars of the Holocaust continue to run deep in the sinew of our history 
and of our humanity. It must never be repeated. It also must never be 
forgotten.
  Today, the President of the strongest Nation in the world will again 
join with survivors in the Capitol Rotunda to help ensure it never is.
  Today's Days of Remembrance ceremony serves as yet another reminder 
of the immeasurable suffering that was inflicted upon millions of 
innocent men, women, and children during the Holocaust, especially the 
Jewish people. It also serves as a reminder of our responsibility as 
free people to stand against evil and defend those who are persecuted.
