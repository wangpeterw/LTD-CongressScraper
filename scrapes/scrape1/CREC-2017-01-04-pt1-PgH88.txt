              SNOWDROP FOUNDATION FIGHTS CHILDHOOD CANCER

  (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, as you know, everything isbigger in Texas. 
But as any Texan knows, the biggest, most grand thing is the heart of a 
Texan. The best example of these heartsare my two dear friends, Kevin 
and Trish Kline. Their huge Texas hearts want to end childhood cancer, 
so they started theSnowdrop Foundation. They have raised over $1 
million in less than 10 years to stop cancer.
  They do this for kids like Ana.When Ana was 14, she was told she had 
acute leukemia. She wondered: Will my soul be taken away? Who will take 
care of my youngerbrother? Am I going to die?
  After nearly a decade of fear, with Snowdrop's help, Ana now says: 
Cancer, been there, beatthat.
  God bless Ana, Snowdrop, Kevin, and Trish.
