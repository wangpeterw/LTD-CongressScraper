                        TRIBUTE TO REB BROWNELL

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, now, finally, on an entirely different 
matter, I would like to say a few words about Reb Brownell, a key 
member of my team who is departing the Senate today.
  Reb has served with distinction in my office for nearly 13 years. He 
began as an aide on foreign affairs, defense, and veterans issues. 
Since then, he has risen through the ranks, now serving as my personal 
office deputy chief of staff.
  Reb is a tireless worker and a loyal public servant. He has been my 
point person on more important issues than I can name, including my 
support for democracy in Burma and research on prominent Kentucky 
leaders throughout history. I know he is especially proud of our work 
to help Dr. Noelle Hunter bring her daughter back to America.
  I will miss more than Reb's fine work. I will miss him challenging my 
title as the biggest history buff in the office, and all his colleagues 
will miss Reb's genuine warmth, his quick wit and good humor, and his 
readiness to mentor young staffers. Of course, nobody is perfect. Reb 
is a diehard Michigan State fan. Fortunately, he never let it get in 
the way of serving the people of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.
  I am sorry to see Reb go. I thank him for his service, and I wish him 
and his wife Sandy every success in their future endeavors.
