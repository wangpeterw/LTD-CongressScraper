                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT

  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to submit to the Senate the budget 
scorekeeping report for September 2017. The report compares current-law 
levels of spending and revenues with the amounts the Senate agreed to 
in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, S. Con. Res. 3. This 
information is necessary for the Senate Budget Committee to determine 
whether budget points of order lie against pending legislation. The 
Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee and the Congressional 
Budget Office, CBO, prepared this report pursuant to section 308(b) of 
the Congressional Budget Act, CBA.
  My last filing can be found in the Record on July 12, 2017. The 
information contained in this report captures legislative activity 
since that filing through September 5, 2017.
  Republican Budget Committee staff prepared tables 1-3 of this report.
  Table 1 gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee 
exceeds or is below its allocation for budget authority and outlays 
under the most recently adopted budget resolution. This information is 
used for enforcing committee allocations pursuant to section 302 of the 
CBA. For this reporting period, 11 of the 16 authorizing committees are 
in compliance with their allocations, two fewer than my last report. 
Legislative activity during this reporting period brought both the 
Committee on the Judiciary, for a State compact relating to the 
Washington Metrorail Safety Commission, P.L. 1l5-54, and the Committee 
on Foreign Relations, for the Countering America's Adversaries through 
Sanctions Act, P.L. 115-44, out of compliance.
  In total, authorizing committees are estimated to increase outlays by 
nearly $2 billion more than they were allocated over the fiscal year 
2017-2026 period. The largest spending violation since the passage of 
the current budget resolution occurred during this reporting period. 
The VA Choice and Quality Employment Act of 2017, P.L. 115-46, 
increased budget authority by $2 billion and outlays by $1.9 billion 
over the fiscal year 2017-2026 window.
  Tables 2-3 of this report, related to activities of the Senate 
Committee on Appropriations, remain unchanged from my previous report.
  In addition to the tables provided by Budget Committee Republican 
staff, I am submitting CBO tables, which I will use to enforce budget 
totals approved by the Congress.
  CBO provided a spending and revenue report for fiscal year 2017, 
which helps

enforce aggregate spending levels in budget resolutions under CBA 
section 311. CBO's estimates show that current law levels of spending 
for fiscal year 2017 exceed the amounts assumed in the budget 
resolution for budget authority by $1.8 billion. However, levels for 
outlays remain nearly $6.4 billion below assumed levels. CBO also 
estimates that revenues are $1 million above assumed levels for fiscal 
year 2017 and $8 million above assumed levels over the fiscal year 
2017-2026 period. Two pieces of legislation, the FDA Reauthorization 
Act of 2017, P.L. 115-52, and the Countering America's Adversaries 
through Sanctions Act, increased revenues this reporting period. The 
former increased revenues by $7 million over 10 years and the latter by 
$22 million over the same period.
  Social Security levels are consistent with the budget resolution's 
fiscal year 2017 figures.
  CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate 
pay-as-you-go, PAYGO, rule. The Senate's PAYGO scorecard currently 
shows increased deficits of $2.5 billion over the fiscal year 2016-2021 
and $1.9 billion over fiscal year 2016-2026 periods. Over the fiscal 
year 2016-2021 period, legislation has been enacted that CBO estimates 
will increase outlays by $2.5 billion and reduce revenues by $20 
million. Over the fiscal year 2016-2026 period, legislation has been 
enacted that CBO estimates will increase outlays by $1.9 billion and 
increase revenues by $3 million. The Senate's PAYGO rule is enforced by 
section 201 of S. Con. Res. 21, the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution.
  Finally, included in this submission is a table tracking the Senate's 
budget enforcement activity on the floor. Three budget points of order 
have been raised since my last filing, and each was successful. All of 
these points of order occurred during the Senate's consideration of 
H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act of 2017.
  All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.
  I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables be printed in 
the Record.
  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in 
the Record, as follows:

                                  Congressional Budget Office,

                                Washington, DC, September 7, 2017.
     Hon. Mike Enzi,
     Chairman, Committee on the Budget,
     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.
       Dear Mr. Chairman: The enclosed report shows the effects of 
     Congressional action on the fiscal year 2017 budget and is 
     current through September 5, 2017. This report is submitted 
     under section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the 
     Congressional Budget Act, as amended.
       The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues 
     are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of 
     S. Con. Res. 3, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for 
     Fiscal Year 2017.
       Since our last letter dated July 12, 2017, the Congress has 
     cleared and the President has signed the VA Choice and 
     Quality Employment Act (Public Law 115-46). That act has 
     significant effects on budget authority in fiscal year 2017.
           Sincerely,
                                             Keith Hall, Director.
       Enclosure.

Notes: n.a. = not applicable; P.L. = Public Law.
a Includes the budgetary effects of enacted legislation cleared by the Congress during the 114th session, prior
  to the adoption of S. Con. Res. 3, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2017.
b Sections 193-195 of P.L. 114-223 (as amended by Division A of P.L. 114-254), provided funding for innovation
  projects and state responses to opioid abuse. CBO estimated that for fiscal year 2017, these sections provided
  a combined $872 million in budget authority, which would result in $256 million in outlays. However,
  consistent with sections 1001-1004 of P.L. 114-255, for the purposes of estimating the budgetary effects of
  those provisions under the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (Budget Control Act) and
  the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Deficit Control Act), those amounts are
  estimated to provide no budget authority or outlays.
c For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the resolution, as
  approved by the Senate, does not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a
  result, current level does not include these items.
d Periodically, the Senate Committee on the Budget revises the budgetary levels in S. Con. Res. 3, pursuant to
  various provisions of the resolution. The total for the Initial Senate Resolution shown below excludes $81,872
  million in budget authority and $40,032 million in outlays assumed in S. Con. Res. 3 for non regular
  discretionary spending, including spending that qualifies for adjustments to discretionary spending limits
  pursuant to section 251(b) of the Deficit Control Act. The total for the Revised Senate Resolution shown below
  includes amounts for non regular discretionary spending:


 
                                                                    Budget
