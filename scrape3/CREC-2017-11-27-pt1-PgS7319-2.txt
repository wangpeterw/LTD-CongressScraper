                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Our Father God, thank You that we see You in the world around us, 
beholding Your works in the Earth and sea and sky. Your everlasting 
mercies sustain us, enabling us to borrow our heartbeats from You each 
day.
  Today, be for our lawmakers an abiding and sustaining presence. May 
they live to serve and honor You, bringing glory to Your Name. Make 
them patient in debate, charitable in judgment, and slow to anger. 
Lord, empower them to defend and maintain the right, as they seek 
justice and freedom for all.
  We pray in Your sacred Name. Amen.
