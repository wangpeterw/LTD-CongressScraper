    SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 34--RECOGNIZING THE RICH HISTORY, 
  HERITAGE, AND STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL 
  ISLANDS AND THE MARSHALLESE POPULATION RESIDING IN THE UNITED STATES

  Mr. BOOZMAN (for himself and Mr. Cotton) submitted the following 
concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Energy 
and Natural Resources:

                            S. Con. Res. 34

       Whereas the Republic of the Marshall Islands--
       (1) is a sovereign country in free association with the 
     United States under the Compact of Free Association between 
     the Government of the United States and the Government of the 
     Republic of the Marshall Islands (referred to in this 
     preamble as the ``Compact''), approved in the Compact of Free 
     Association Amendments Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-188; 117 
     Stat. 2720), which--
          (A) is set to expire in 2023; and
          (B) authorizes economic assistance, through Federal 
     grants and programs, to persons in the Republic of the 
     Marshall Islands; and
       (2) has full authority and responsibility over security and 
     defense matters relating to the Republic of the Marshall 
     Islands;
       Whereas, under the Compact, eligible citizens of the 
     Republic of the Marshall Islands may reside, work, and study 
     in the United States without a visa and may serve in the 
     Armed Forces of the United States;
       Whereas an estimated \1/3\ of the population of the 
     Republic of the Marshall Islands has relocated to the United 
     States; and
       Whereas Marshallese individuals who live in the United 
     States--
       (1) offer positive economic and cultural benefits to the 
     communities in which those individuals live;
       (2) pay Federal and State taxes but are not eligible for 
     benefits under--
          (A) the Medicare program established under title XVIII 
     of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.); or
          (B) the Medicaid program established under title XIX of 
     the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.); and
       (3) were undercounted in the 2010 census and, as a result, 
     areas where those individuals live are underserved by the 
     Federal Government: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives 
     concurring), That Congress--
       (1) commends--
       (A) the rich history and heritage of the Republic of the 
     Marshall Islands; and
       (B) citizens of the Republic of the Marshall Islands who 
     live in the United States for the contributions of those 
     individuals to--
       (i) the communities in which those individuals live; and
       (ii) the national defense of the United States through 
     their service in the Armed Forces of the United States;
       (2) recognizes--
       (A) the strategic importance of the Republic of the 
     Marshall Islands; and
       (B) the importance of the upcoming renegotiation of the 
     Compact of Free Association between the Government of the 
     United States and the Government of the Republic of the 
     Marshall Islands; and
       (3) encourages a continued commitment to improve census 
     data to better serve citizens of the Republic of the Marshall 
     Islands who live in the United States.
