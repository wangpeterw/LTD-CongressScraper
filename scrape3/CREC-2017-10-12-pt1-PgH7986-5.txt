                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Joshua Leu, First Christian Church, Great Bend, Kansas, 
offered the following prayer:
  God, I ask today that You would open these honorable men and women of 
the House to the significance, weight, and sacredness of the work that 
they get to do.
  Remind them that the detailed decisions that they make here and now 
will not only have effects on the entire world, but will ripple through 
time for generations to come, making a way for all people.
  So gift them, O Lord, with Your wisdom today and every day they serve 
so they can be a part of causing Your kingdom to come, Your will to be 
done, on Earth as it is in Heaven.
  Amen.
