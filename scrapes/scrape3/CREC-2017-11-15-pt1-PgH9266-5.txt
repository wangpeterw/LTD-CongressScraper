                  THE STORY OF HUGO FROM SALEM, OREGON

  (Mr. SCHRADER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the story of Hugo 
from Salem, Oregon, and I continue to urge Speaker Ryan to put forth a 
clean Dream Act.
  Hugo is an undocumented Oregonian originally from Veracruz, Mexico. 
His only memory of Mexico is saying good-bye to his parents as a child 
before leaving for Salem.
  In high school, Hugo played football, he was a JROTC commander, a 
youth police cadet, and a firefighter explorer. He quickly moved from 
ESL into honors classes, and graduated at the top of his class. Hugo 
earned the privilege of delivering the commencement speech at his 
graduation.
  All of this, along with his dedication to community service, led to 
the city of Salem recognizing Hugo as Youth of the Year.
  Because of Hugo's immigration status, however, after leaving high 
school, his only job was a field hand. That is until DACA.
  Hugo was able to enroll at the University of Oregon, working multiple 
jobs to pay for his tuition, and earned his bachelor's degree in 
economics. He now works as a banker, and volunteers as a teacher in 
financial literacy for families. But in 10 months, his work permit will 
expire.
  Mr. Speaker, let's protect 800,000 DACA recipients across this 
country, like Hugo.
