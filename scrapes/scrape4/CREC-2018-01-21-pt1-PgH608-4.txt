        DEMOCRATS CAN'T GET A VOTE ON ENDING THE TRUMP SHUTDOWN

  (Mr. TED LIEU of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I served on Active Duty. I 
want a functioning government. But yet we are in day two of the Trump 
shutdown.
  How did we get here?
  Well, Republicans control the House, they control the Senate, they 
control the White House, and they could not come up with a bill that 
would pass both Houses, signed by the President. In fact, the harmful 
House CR was rejected by the U.S. Senate on a bipartisan basis. It 
couldn't even get to 51 votes.
  But Democrats have a variety of ideas to reopen government, and we 
can't even get a vote on it because we don't control the floor, we 
don't control the agenda, and we do not control this government.
  And watch this: my request to reopen the government won't even get a 
vote. Watch this request get shut down.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 4872, the End 
the Shutdown Act of 2018, a continuing resolution that would 
immediately reopen the government through Tuesday while negotiations 
continue on a long-term budget agreement that adheres to parity and on 
other critical issues.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. As the Chair has previously advised, that 
request cannot be entertained absent appropriate clearance
