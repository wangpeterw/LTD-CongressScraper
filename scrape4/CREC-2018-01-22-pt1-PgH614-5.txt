                         PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY

  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Texas will state her 
parliamentary inquiry.
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary inquiry is the 
utilization of the words ``illegal immigration'' being used against the 
well-stated policies of the United States dealing with respecting 
people who come to this country.
  My question is the terminology being used to indict Democrats, the 
Democratic Party, and it is maligning hardworking Americans who came 
from an immigrant background.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will not interpret the meaning of 
a Member's remarks.
