                  AMERICAN HOCKEY LEAGUE ALL-STAR GAME

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the Utica Comets 
of the American Hockey League, the team that has been selected to host 
the AHL All-Star game on Sunday, January 28, through Monday, January 
29, at the Adirondack Bank Center in our own home city at the Utica 
Memorial Auditorium.
  Central New York has a strong hockey tradition, from the AHL's Comets 
and Binghamton Devils to the classic powerhouse teams of the past, the 
legendary Clinton Comets.
  Many other collegiate hockey teams hail from our region: the Hamilton 
College Continentals; my own home alma mater, the Colgate Raiders; and 
the Utica College Pioneers.
  Fans are passionate for hockey in the Mohawk Valley and Southern 
Tier, which the AHL recognized by awarding the Utica Comets with the 
2015 All-Star game. The success of this event was, in large part, due 
to the Comets organization, including former National Hockey League 
goalie Rob Esche; the amazing Comets fans; and the greater Utica 
community, whose hospitality showcased the enthusiasm and warmth of our 
region.
  Our entire community is thrilled that AHL has again awarded the 2018 
All-Star game to the Utica Comets, and it is my hope that fans across 
the United States and Canada will come to Utica to see great hockey and 
to enjoy the great spirit of our community.
