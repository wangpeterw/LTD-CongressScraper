                LEAVE REPEAL AND REPLACE EFFORTS BEHIND

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, on Friday, when House Republicans withdrew 
TrumpCare, it was a victory for American families. It was a victory for 
24 million people who would have lost coverage under that plan. It was 
also a victory for the millions of Americans who attended townhall 
meetings, who wrote letters and emails, who spoke up. Their voices were 
heard. But we have more work to do, Democrats and Republicans, in order 
to make sure that all Americans have access to affordable health care.
  We need now to turn our attention to doing what we can to improve the 
Affordable Care Act in a bipartisan way. We have ways to make this work 
better. It is not a perfect bill; of course it isn't. Nothing we do 
here is perfect. It needs improvement, significant improvement. We have 
ways to make that happen that I think Democrats and Republicans can 
come together on.
  For example, improving access to prescription drugs by reducing the 
cost of those drugs in the marketplace. There are so many things we can 
do, Republicans and Democrats. We have got to roll up our sleeves and 
get to work.
