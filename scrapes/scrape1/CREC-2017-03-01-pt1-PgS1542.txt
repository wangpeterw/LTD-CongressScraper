SENATE RESOLUTION 75--RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ACADEMY 
   OF NUTRITION AND DIETETICS, THE LARGEST ORGANIZATION OF FOOD AND 
                  NUTRITION PROFESSIONALS IN THE WORLD

  Mr. PORTMAN (for himself and Mr. Brown) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Agriculture, 
Nutrition, and Forestry:

                               S. Res. 75

       Whereas, on October 20, 1917, dietitians met in Cleveland, 
     Ohio, to identify ways in which food and nutrition 
     professionals could help the United States Government 
     conserve food and improve public health and nutrition during 
     World War I;
       Whereas the foundational meeting on October 20, 1917, led 
     to the creation of the American Dietetics Association, now 
     known as the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (referred to 
     in this preamble as the ``Academy'');
       Whereas, since the inception of the Academy, the Academy 
     has grown from a charter membership of 58 individuals to the 
     largest organization of food and nutrition professionals in 
     the world, with a membership as of January 2017 of more than 
     75,000 individuals;
       Whereas the Academy is comprised of a diverse group of 
     registered dietitian nutritionists and technicians, 
     scientists, clinicians, educators, students, and other food 
     and nutrition practitioners; and
       Whereas, through evidence-based research and education, 
     members of the Academy play an important role in shaping the 
     food choices and nutrition of the people of the United 
     States: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) commemorates October 20, 2017, as the 100th anniversary 
     of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics; and
       (2) applauds the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics for its 
     past, present, and future efforts to champion the principles 
     established by its dietitian predecessors more than 100 years 
     ago--
       (A) to promote food and nutrition professionals; and
       (B) to improve the health and wellness of all people of the 
     United States through research, education, and advocacy.
