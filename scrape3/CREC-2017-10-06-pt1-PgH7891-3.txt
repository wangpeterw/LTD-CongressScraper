                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Phillip Ganir, S.J., Gonzaga Jesuit Community, Washington, 
D.C., offered the following prayer:
  Loving God, source of all healing and hope, for the diverse people of 
this Nation we represent, thank You.
  For strength of mind and body, thank You.
  For the gift of freedom in our country, thank You.
  Send Your spirit to guide our deliberations this day. May this work 
bring greater justice, peace, and healing, especially for those who 
suffer most.
  Align our work with the freedom which defines and sustains us; amidst 
competing priorities, give us wisdom to discern wisely; in the face of 
disagreement, ground us in civility; when discouragement looms, let a 
sense of humor remind us of our humanity; and when the goals for the 
common good seem distant, inspire passion within us to act 
courageously, always mindful that Your good gifts become more apparent 
when we seek unity and peace.
  Amen.
