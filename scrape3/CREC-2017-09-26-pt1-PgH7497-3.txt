                  WELCOMING REVEREND WILLIAM LYNN NASH

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. Abraham) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce Brother Bill 
Nash, a great friend who delivered the opening prayer this morning, and 
what a prayer it was.
  Brother Nash's wife founded Glad Tidings Pentecostal Church near my 
home in Mangham, Louisiana.
  In the 15 years since he founded his church, Brother Nash has been 
active in the community. He is the deputy sheriff chaplain for Richland 
Sheriff's Department. He was named an honorary chaplain of the 
Louisiana Legislature in 2014.
  Brother Nash is a true country evangelist and has been delivering 
sermons since he was 15 years old. Mr. Speaker, we appreciate the 
opportunity for him to offer the prayer this morning, and we thank him 
for all he has done for Louisiana.
