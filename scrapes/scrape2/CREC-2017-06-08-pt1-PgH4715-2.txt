                 CREATING OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL AMERICANS

  (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, today the House will take up and consider an 
important bill that will help create opportunity for all Americans: the 
Financial CHOICE Act.
  The Financial CHOICE Act repeals the most harmful aspects of the 
Dodd-Frank legislation that halted the flow of capital to our 
constituents, destroyed small community banks, frustrated small 
businesses, and generally made life harder for Americans. The Financial 
CHOICE Act provides relief to Main Street businesses that had nothing 
to do with the 2008 financial crisis, but were slammed with onerous and 
unnecessary regulations anyway.
  Mr. Speaker, we need smart regulations that protect consumers and 
make our markets less risky. In many cases, Dodd-Frank did the 
opposite, and this has been a wet blanket on the economy, destroying 
jobs and opportunities for millions of Americans.
  Importantly, Mr. Speaker, the bill also ends government bailouts for 
large banks considered too big to fail once and for all. It will cut 
our deficits by $25 billion and finally subject the Federal Reserve to 
a proper audit.
  Mr. Speaker, above all, our bill promotes economic growth so that all 
Americans can have the freedom and ability to get the job they want, 
create the small business they have always dreamed of, and secure their 
family's future.
