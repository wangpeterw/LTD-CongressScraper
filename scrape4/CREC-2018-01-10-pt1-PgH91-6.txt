                   WASHINGTON BUSINESSES GIVING BACK

  (Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, we are already seeing the positive impact 
of tax reform. More than 100 businesses and corporations are giving 
back to their employees and their communities as a direct response to 
the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
  This historic tax reform legislation has paved the way for a better 
American business environment, and hardworking people are benefiting 
from the contributions of major employers and service providers, 
including in my home State of Washington.
  Boeing announced a total investment of $300 million dedicated to 
corporate giving, employee training, and infrastructure improvement. 
Alaska Airlines provided $1,000 bonuses for more than 20,000 employees. 
Washington Federal is increasing salaries by 5 percent for employees 
making under $100,000, investing in training, technology upgrades, and 
making a $5 million philanthropic contribution. Pacific Power has 
committed to passing the company's benefits on to their consumers, 
which include ratepayers in the Fourth Congressional District.
  These benefits and tax relief will have a lasting effect on 
Washington families, and I look forward to continuing to work toward 
bigger paychecks, more jobs, and a prosperous economy.
