                     THE REPUBLICAN HEALTHCARE BILL

  (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, with the Congressional Budget 
Office reporting that 22 million people would lose healthcare coverage 
and premiums for those who keep their coverage increasing by more than 
20 percent next year, it is not surprising that the Republican Senate 
bill was pulled due to a pervasive lack of interest and support.
  Hit hardest under the pulled Senate bill were low-and middle-income 
Americans between the ages of 50 and 64 and people with preexisting 
diseases like cancer and diabetes.
  The time has come for this Congress to use the leverage of a massive 
purchaser of healthcare--the Federal Government--and authorize a 
Medicare buy-in for Americans between the ages of 50 and 64.
  With the leverage of 60 million-plus beneficiaries and low 
administrative costs, a Medicare buy-in option for the 50 to 64 
population will drive down costs and drive up the quality of 
healthcare. We have an obligation to the American people.
