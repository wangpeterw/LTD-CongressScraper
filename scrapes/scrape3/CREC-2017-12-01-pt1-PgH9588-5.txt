                             SALT DEDUCTION

  (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, I want to quote from one of my colleagues 
from California: ``Eliminating the State and local tax deduction would 
assure that almost all of the bill's tax cuts would be distributed to 
other States, leaving California with the bill.''
  That was from my Republican colleague, Darrell Issa.
  Mr. Speaker, he was right on this. The Republican tax plan is cruel 
in so many ways. But perhaps the worst provision specifically targets 
States like California, New York, and New Jersey.
  Our States have stepped into the breach left by the Federal 
Government. We have raised taxes to pay for infrastructure. We have 
raised taxes to pay for hospitals. We have raised taxes to pay for 
schools.
  Now the Republicans want to punish us?
  Mr. Speaker, this is a political game, plain and simple. Californians 
are smart enough to see through it.
