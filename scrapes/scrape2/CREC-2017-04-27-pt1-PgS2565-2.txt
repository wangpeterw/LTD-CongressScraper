                                 PRAYER

  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Today's opening prayer will be offered by 
Martyn Sloan, lead pastor of Harvest Time in Fort Smith, AR.
  The guest Chaplain offered the following prayer:
  Almighty and Eternal God, who has created us, to whom we belong and 
whom we serve, it is in You that we find our purpose, our peace, and 
our prosperity. May Your Kingdom come.
  Use this day our lawmakers to complete and carry out Your will on 
this Earth as in Heaven. Create in each of them a clean and a 
courageous and a selfless heart that will not give in to fear, 
adversity, or temptation. Grant them wisdom and the discernment of the 
truth so that they may rightly judge these, Your children. Strengthen 
them as they grow weary so that they may give strength to the weary and 
burdened in this life.
  We pray this and all things in Your Holy Name. Amen.
