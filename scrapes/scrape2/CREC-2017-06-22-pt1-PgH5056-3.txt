                 WELCOMING REVEREND KEVIN KITRELL ROSS

  The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from California (Mr. 
Bera) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce the House to our 
guest chaplain, Reverend Kevin Kitrell Ross, Senior Minister of Unity 
of Sacramento.
  Kevin is regarded as a respected interfaith social justice leader, 
committed to building bridges of understanding and cooperation across 
race, culture, class, and religious lines.
  Whether in his role leading one of the Nation's most diverse and 
integrated congregations, conducting diversity and implicit bias 
trainings, or being an outspoken activist for healing the crisis 
between law enforcement and communities of color, Kevin is dedicated to 
strengthening communities through dialogue, direct encounter, and 
education.
  A South Side of Chicago native, Kevin is a Morehouse College 
graduate, a senior fellow of the American Leadership Forum, a member of 
the Interfaith Council of Sacramento, and a three-time delegate to the 
Parliament of the World's Religions.
  Kevin and his wife, Anita, have three children and reside in Elk 
Grove, California. Anita is the founder of Women for Equality. They are 
both committed to building a world that works for all.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in welcoming Reverend 
Kevin Ross and thank him for offering today's opening prayer in the 
U.S. House of Representatives.
