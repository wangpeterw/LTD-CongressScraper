                 ECONOMY NOT WORKING THE WAY IT SHOULD

  (Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, the economy simply is not working the way 
it should. Millions of hardworking men and women across the heartland 
feel the American Dream has slipped out of reach.
  In places like Galesburg, Hanover, and Freeport, Illinois, too many 
of the families I serve have seen their jobs boxed up and shipped to 
places like Mexico and China. To make ends meet, many of them have had 
to take on two or three minimum wage jobs.
  That is not the American Dream that we believe in. We believe in an 
America where we never give up on the fight for better jobs, better 
wages, and a better future for all of our families.
  This is why I was proud to help present the American public with our 
``Better Deal'' economic agenda. Together, we will help 10 million 
hardworking Americans find good-paying, full-time jobs by making bold 
investments in our roads and bridges, and doubling our investments in 
workforce training and apprenticeships to connect workers with the 
skills that employers need.
  And while wages will go up, costs will go down by reducing the price 
of prescription drugs and making childcare more affordable.
  The American people are tired of excuses from Washington. They want 
real action, and we have a real plan.
