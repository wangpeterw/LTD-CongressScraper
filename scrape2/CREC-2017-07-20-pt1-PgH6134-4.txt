                        ``MADE IN AMERICA'' WEEK

  (Mr. WESTERMAN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to show my support for the 
``Made in America'' Week initiative. It is an initiative to highlight 
the contributions of American workers and job creators.
  Made in America brings to mind a combination of the American spirit 
of innovation and perseverance that is required to turn raw materials 
into manufactured goods.
  I am proud of the contributions that my home State of Arkansas makes 
to the American economy. In Arkansas, 13 percent of the State's 
workforce is employed in the manufacturing industry, which is the 
second highest percentage in the South and the third highest percentage 
in the Nation. Twenty-eight percent of those jobs in Arkansas are in 
the Fourth District.
  In 2016, manufacturers contributed $2.2 trillion to the American 
economy. For every dollar spent in manufacturing, an additional $1.80 
is added to another part of the economy.
  With abundant resources, a strong infrastructure, and a second-to-
none work ethic, Arkansas is working to train the next generation of 
technicians and visionaries so that manufacturing can expand, promoting 
better careers, stronger families, and thriving communities.
