                       TRIBUTE TO MICHELE MUSTAIN

  Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, today I recognize Michele Mustain for all 
of her hard work on behalf of myself, my staff, and the people of South 
Dakota while working in my Sioux Falls, SD office.
  We are grateful for the excellent work she has done for other elected 
leaders and for all of the help she has given to the citizens of the 
United States.
  Because she has helped so many soldiers and their families, it is 
fitting that she will now be working for the Employer Support for the 
Guard and Reserve.
  My staff and I wish her the best in the future. We will always 
appreciate her and her willingness to help us become better public 
servants.
