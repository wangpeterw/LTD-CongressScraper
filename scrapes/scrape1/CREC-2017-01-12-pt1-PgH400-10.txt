                    LAW ENFORCEMENT APPRECIATION DAY

  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, we celebrated Law 
Enforcement Appreciation Day, which acknowledges thecontributions that 
men and women in uniform make on a daily basis to keep our communities 
safe and secure.
  It was heartening to see the display of support for these individuals 
throughout the House Office Buildings

on Monday.As the Sun went down, you could see blue lights in windows 
across the Capitol complex honoring those brave men and women.
  The dedicated individuals who serve in law enforcement help to 
preserve the way of life we hold so dear. They walk theneighborhood 
beats, patrol our streets, and willingly do dangerous work to protect 
our families and communities.
  It is one of the most honorable activities anyone can engage in, and 
I want to thank them for their selflessness and braverythey demonstrate 
as officers of the law. They deserve our profound gratitude.
