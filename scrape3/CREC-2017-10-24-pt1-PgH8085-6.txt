                       TIME TO PASS THE DREAM ACT

  (Mr. AGUILAR asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Speaker, we live in the land of opportunity where, 
if you are willing to set goals, work hard, and give back to your 
community, anything can be done.
  This idea is the grandest of American traditions and is sewn into the 
fabric of everything that we do, yet we are failing to live up to our 
ideals.
  A few weeks ago I met a college student in my district named Beatriz. 
Beatriz moved to the United States with her family when she was 3 years 
old. And while she wasn't born here, she told me: ``Today, I couldn't 
even tell you what my homeland looks like, Congressman.''
  A good student, Beatriz earned good grades to get into college, but 
would not be able to afford it, except that she received financial aid 
from the State because she is ineligible from the Federal Government.
  But her life was changed when she applied for DACA in high school. 
Beatriz was able to attend Cal State San Bernardino with the help of 
financial aid and is now on her way to becoming the first in her family 
to earn a college degree.
  She said it is the most exciting experience to make progress and 
contribute to the economy. This is her home, Mr. Speaker. It is time 
that we pass the Dream Act.
