                     REMEMBERING MATTHEW McCLANAHAN

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on one final matter, I would like to 
offer the Senate's condolences to a family in the Capitol community who 
suffered a great loss during the recent State work period.
  Last week, Matthew McClanahan, a well-respected member of the Capitol 
community, passed away after a tragic accident near the Capitol 
Grounds. Matt worked as a pipefitter for the Architect of the Capitol 
and earned a reputation as a hard worker who took pride in his work 
here at the Capitol. As those who were closest to him recall, Matt was 
``funny, sweet, and kind'' and ``always the first to show up when 
someone needed a helping hand.''
  His sudden passing is felt by so many--colleagues, friends, family, 
and most especially by his wife, Lauren, and two young children, Evie 
and Matthew.
  We know that no words can convey the heartbreaking loss they feel, 
but on behalf of the Senate and the Capitol community as a whole, I 
want to send our deepest condolences to them at this immensely 
difficult time.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
