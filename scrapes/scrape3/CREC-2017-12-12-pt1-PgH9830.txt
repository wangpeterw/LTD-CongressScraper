                             ISIS IN AFRICA

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as ISIS loses ground in Syria and 
Iraq, we must remain vigilant. There is a growing terrorist threat in 
Africa. Between January and September of 2016, the African continent 
suffered at least 1,426 incidents of terrorism-related violence.
  Terrorism is a major challenge to peace, security, and development in 
Africa. Recently, the threat has grown to directly impact U.S. 
servicemembers serving in Africa.
  Last May, a Navy SEAL was killed in an operation against al-Qaida 
affiliate al Shabaab, the first U.S. servicemember killed in action in 
Somalia since the 1993 infamous Black Hawk Down incident. Last month, 
an ambush by Islamist militants in Niger left four U.S. Green Berets 
killed. Recently, the U.S. conducted its first airstrikes against ISIS 
in Somalia.
  Mr. Speaker, the writing is on the wall. The terrorist cancer in 
Africa is metastasizing. It is on its way to becoming a full-blown 
threat to African and American interests.
  Having been displaced by war in Syria and Iraq, ISIS is finding a new 
home in Africa to carry out its reign of terror, and we must be mindful 
and vigilant.
  And that is just the way it is.
