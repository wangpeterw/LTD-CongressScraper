                         KAPPAS DAY ON THE HILL

  (Mr. McEACHIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise today to recognize my 
brothers of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Incorporated, during the annual 
James ``Biff'' Carter Kappas on Capitol Hill Legislative Policy 
Conference.
  Each year, my brothers come to Capitol Hill with their crimson 
blazers to raise awareness around the key issues that affect our 
communities.
  I had the privilege of joining this noble clan of Kappa Alpha Psi 
Fraternity, Incorporated, right here in Washington, D.C., at American 
University, where we chartered the Kappa Chi chapter of the Kappa Alpha 
Psi Fraternity. It was in the fall of 1980 that I was allowed to cross 
the burning sands and commit myself to a life of honorable achievement 
in every field of human endeavor.
  Mr. Speaker, today I am proud because now, more than ever, we need 
the leaders in our communities to raise their voices, raise awareness, 
and come to Washington, D.C., as advocates on behalf of their 
communities, as it says in the First Amendment, ``to petition the 
government for a redress of their grievances.''
  I am proud of the brothers of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, 
Incorporated, for coming to Congress today, as they do each spring.
