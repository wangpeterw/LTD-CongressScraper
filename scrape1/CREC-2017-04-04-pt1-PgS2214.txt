                  RECOGNIZING WORCESTER, MASSACHUSETTS

 Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, Massachusetts has been the 
birthplace of revolutions for centuries, from sparking the American 
Revolution to leading the world in biotechnology, education, and 
medicine. It is a natural home for the next era of the technology 
revolution. I am proud that Worcester, MA was identified by TechNet and 
the Progressive Policy Institute as a ``Next in Tech'' city, with a 
thriving startup environment poised to drive innovation and job 
creation for years to come.
