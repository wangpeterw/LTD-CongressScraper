      RECOGNIZING LEXMARK'S EXCITING NEW PROGRAM TO TRAIN VETERANS

  (Mr. BARR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to proudly recognize Lexmark 
International, a global leader in printing solutions headquartered in 
Lexington, Kentucky, for its development of an innovative program for 
training U.S. veterans and soon-to-be-separated Active Duty personnel 
with the goal that they can become certified service technicians of 
Lexmark printers.
  The program, called the Lexmark Printer Service Training Partnership, 
is under the auspices of VALORR, the Veterans Association of Lexmark: 
Organized to Recognize and Respect.
  We all recognize that our veterans bring with them tremendous know-
how and a can-do attitude, the ability to step into new fields and 
master them quickly. By completing the printer

service training program, these veterans will be certified to service 
Lexmark printers worldwide.
  I am proud that my constituents at Lexmark have developed such a 
thoughtful program for veterans. I hope my colleagues will join me in 
recognizing those companies and organizations going the extra mile for 
those who have served our Nation in uniform.
