8945,topic-id,221,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the Microloan Modernization Act of 2017. This legislation will benefit America's small businesses by improving the Small Business Administration's Microloan program.  Small business lending has not kept pace with the improving economy after the Great Recession, and this has been especially true for small-dollar borrowers.  Early stage small businesses do not have the proven financial history and[[Page H6181]]lack access to traditional lending. Unable to borrow money from banks and credit unions, they often turn to friends, family, or credit cards to finance their businesses.  The SBA Microloan program provides access to capital through nonprofit intermediaries that will loan up to $50,000 for their upstart companies. These intermediaries also offer technical assistance and counseling to facilitate their business' success.  H.2056 will improve the SBA Microloan program by expanding the lending volume to microloan intermediaries, by giving them greater flexibility with their SBA technical assistance grants, to provide more preloan comprehensive assistance to businesses in their infancy, and by requiring the SBA to study and report to Congress on the utilization of the program.  This bill provides meaningful reforms to modernize the SBA Microloan program, and I am a proud cosponsor. This is a needed bill to support the engine of our economy: our small businesses.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.  ",CREC-2017-07-24-pt1-PgH6179.txt,99999999999999,HEALTHCARE LEGISLATION,2017.0,24.0,May

8895,topic-id,187,"Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.2288, the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017, a bill that addresses the Department of Veterans Affairs' broken appeals process.  As of April 1, 2017, the number of pending appeals for disability compensation with the VA has reached 470,000. That is more than a 20 percent increase since fiscal year 2015. At current funding levels and using its current operational structure, the Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that it will take at least 5 years to address the backlog of appeals claims.  That is unsatisfactory. We can do better. We must do better. Our veterans deserve better. They have risked their lives to protect the freedoms we hold so dear, and it is up to us to make sure they receive the benefits they have earned and deserve.  H.2288 modernizes the appeals process to efficiently and effectively resolve backlogged claims and prevent this kind of backlog from happening in the future. This bipartisan piece of legislation takes a giant leap toward a more efficient Department of Veterans Affairs, and I strongly urge my colleagues to support it.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-22-pt1-PgH4417-3.txt,99999999999999,1230,2017.0,22.0,May

8711,topic-id,732,"Mr.President, I rise to recognize National Drug Court Month and show my support for the positive impact drug courts have on cutting crime, saving money, and restoring lives.  I have seen firsthand the impact of drug courts in This proven[[Page S3055]]approach has helped many Arkansans suffering from drug and alcohol abuse who have received the treatment and services they need to turn their lives around. For more than two decades, these courts have offered Arkansas' drug-addicted, nonviolent offenders an alternative to jail while rehabilitating them through a strenuous treatment program.  We have nearly 90 specialty courts in Arkansas that are providing lifesaving treatment to more than 3,000 individuals with substance use disorders, and the results are impressive. Our State saves $45 million each year by diverting these offenders from prison to drug courts. Ninety percent of Arkansas drug court participants' drug tests come back negative for illegal substances, compared to 64 percent of those on probation and parole.  Drug courts are a critical component of today's criminal justice system. They have proven to be an effective alternative to jail for individuals convicted of nonviolent drug charges. Holding offenders with substance use and mental health disorders accountable through strict supervision and treatment, drug courts and veterans treatment courts have saved taxpayer dollars and the lives of more than 1.5 million people, including a remarkable man I recently met who shared his story.  Blayne was facing 20 years in prison because of crimes he had committed to support a 10-year addiction to prescription opioids. This epidemic currently takes 94 American lives every single day, but Blayne is one of the lucky ones. His community had a drug court. The drug court program gave him the tools he needed to stop using drugs and helped him reconnect with his family, find employment, and get his life back on track.  Instead of sitting in a jail cell on the taxpayers' dime, he is working as a teacher. Instead of breaking into homes, he owns one. Today, Blayne is a dedicated family man. He told me: ``Drug court was a chance to become the father and husband that I wanted to be.''  His story is similar to hundreds of Arkansans who have drug courts to thank for turning their lives around. An Arkansas drug court gave a woman named Sammy a second chance. She became addicted to painkillers at the age of 22 when she suffered a back injury. Her addiction led her down a very dangerous path, where she also started using meth every day. It also led her into the criminal justice system, and she was facing 20 years in prison. Drug court helped Sammy change her lifestyle. Now she is a positive role model for her children, holding down a full-time job and giving back to her community.  This is the power drug courts and other treatment courts have that change lives, heal families, and save money. The success of drug treatment courts has become a model tailored to the needs of different groups from veterans to juveniles. The willingness of the judicial system to adopt alternative methods to jail time is a cost-effective approach to changing the habits of drug addicts and saving the lives of people like Blayne and  As Washington pursues options for criminal justice reform, drug courts are a great example of a program that works. More than 25 years of research has proven they reduce crime and substance abuse, break the vicious cycle of recidivism, and keep families together.  In Arkansas and every other State in the country, drug courts are making a real difference. I want to recognize and thank the more than 30,000 drug court judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, treatment providers, probation officers, court administrators, and other professionals who are on the frontlines of providing a path to recovery. As we recognize National Drug Court Month, this is a great opportunity to show our commitment for the Drug Court Discretionary Grant Program and the Veterans Treatment Court Initiative at the Department of While there are 150,000 Americans being served by drug courts and veterans treatment courts today, there are more than 1 million individuals in our justice system who do not yet have access to these lifesaving programs.  I ask you to join me in supporting resources for these programs to improve public safety, save taxpayer dollars, and, most importantly, save lives.  With that, I yield back.

Congress must act to punish Russia for its continued actions in Ukraine, in East Ukraine, in Crimea, and for its interference in our Presidential election and to deter future such aggression.  This bill will prevent President Trump from relaxing sanctions on Russia without congressional review. We are all concerned about that.  Iran is one of the world's leading state sponsors of terrorism and a continuing source of instability throughout the region. This bill is carefully written to avoid violating U.commitments under the Iran nuclear agreement, and it applies new sanctions in response to Iran's support for terrorism, its human rights abuses, and its ballistic missile program.  It also incorporates sanctions on North Korea, including measures to toughen enforcement of current U.Security Council rules. North Korea's efforts to develop nuclear capabilities must be countered. We must take a stand against its horrendous human rights record, including the savage treatment of Otto Warmbier that led to his death.  These are important steps.

8963,topic-id,354,"Mr.President, today I wish to commemorate the life and legacy of Joseph Carter Corbin, a renowned African-American educator who left a legacy as a trailblazer and innovator that continues to open new doors for students to this day.  Joseph Carter Corbin was born in Chillicothe, OH, in 1833 to former slaves, who raised their family as free people in Chillicothe and later in Corbin's family worked hard to make sure he and his siblings had access what had been denied to them--the right to an education along with the opportunities it provides.  Corbin studied at Ohio University, earning an undergraduate degree and two graduate degrees at a time when African Americans had very limited access to higher education. Corbin started his family in Cincinnati, working as a clerk for a municipal bank and coediting a regular newsletter for African Americans in the However, he made it his life's mission to expand access to higher education to African  In 1871, Joseph Carter Corbin moved to Arkansas where he blazed new trails as the first African-American State superintendent of public instruction.

8722,topic-id,1026,"Mr.President, I join the Senator from Iowa in supporting Governor Branstad as our next Ambassador to I have the opportunity of being the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations I knew of Governor Branstad's reputation as the Governor of Iowa--that he was well thought of and that his leadership was recognized not only by the people of his State but in our  So I was, before the nomination was made, impressed by his dedication to public service. I then had a chance to meet with him in my office. I must tell you that I was extremely impressed about how he was prepared to move on to be the Ambassador to China and how he spoke in favor of our strong ideals.  We then had a confirmation hearing in our committee, and that very much confirmed his knowledge of the challenges that he has, his dedication to public service, and that he would be a strong advocate for American values. So I support his nomination and I urge my colleagues to confirm Governor As Senator Ernst pointed out, our mission in China is a particularly important international responsibility.  We know that China plays a significant role--maybe even a dominating role--in regard to North Korea and in trying to get North Korea to give up its nuclear arsenal. We also know that China has a very checkered record on protecting the human rights of its own citizens. We have major trade issues between the United States and China, in which our Ambassador needs to be engaged to protect American commercial interests.  We have the continuing saga between Taiwan and China and living up to our commitments to protect the integrity of Then, we have a very dangerous situation in the South China[[Page S3059]]Sea, where China has done many provocative activities that will require the diplomacy of our Ambassador in Beijing in order to encourage the use of the rule of law in direct negotiations between the parties and not claiming territory by provocative actions.  So, for all of those issues, we need an experienced Ambassador in China to represent our interests. What really impressed me about Governor Branstad is that I do believe he has a passion for American values.  I particularly appreciated his willingness--and would even say he was anxious--to represent American and global interests for China's improving their human rights record and dealing with the right of religious minorities, dealing with the right of dissent, and dealing with the right of free expression and the press. He very much spoke about the need for the rule of law. So while we welcome the emergence of a prosperous China, we want one that follows international institutional laws and norms. That is going to be the challenge for our next  Let me comment on what I believe the Trump administration is doing that is going to make our next Ambassador's responsibilities even more challenging than perhaps they should be; that is, that we have seen already that in the discussions between President Xi and President Trump with respect to North Korea, it seems like the Trump administration is prepared to give up some of our American values in order to make progress with regard to North Korea, such as our interests in our American workers, our interests in the South China Sea, in maritime security, our relationship with Taiwan, and human rights, et cetera.  That would be a bad deal. Yes, we want North Korea to be under control and to give up its nuclear weapons. Yes, we want China to exercise a much stronger role in convincing North Korea that it is in their interests to give up their nuclear weapon program. We want to do that. There are ways we can. It is in China's interests that North Korea give up its nuclear weapon ambition. They want a nonnuclear Korean We should not trade our values in order for that to be able to occur.  The second matter, which I have talked about on the floor before, that is going to make it more difficult for our next Ambassador is the President's continued unwillingness to comply with the emoluments clause of the  As I have said on the floor before, every President before President Trump either divested of their conflicted ownership of assets or they set up a blind trust, but Mr.Trump did not. Shortly after his election, the Trump organization received trademarks through the Chinese Government that they had been unsuccessful in obtaining for years, in which they have spent literally hundreds of thousands of dollars if not more in legal fees.  All of a sudden, 1 week after the President is elected, the Chinese Government grants these trademarks. It is hard to believe that the fact that they were dealing with the President of the United States did not weigh into decisions made by the Chinese  But it does not end there. We also know that a member of his family was in China to sell the EB-5 visas. That, again, presented a direct conflict. We actually know that his daughter received three new trademarks in an incredibly speedy turnaround--the same night that the daughter had dinner with President  These things don't look good. The emoluments clause is where a foreign government tries to influence our President through doing favors. It is going to be very difficult for the American people--in fact, very difficult for the international community--to believe that it was not, in part, due to the position that Mr.Trump holds that these actions took place.  That violates our That is wrong.  The bottom line is that our next Ambassador is going to have to deal with those issues. We have a hard enough assignment in dealing with North Korea, trade, the South China Sea, Taiwan, and human rights to throw in these additional hurdles.

8943,topic-id,298,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, the microloan program at the Small Business Administration is a program that acutely targets small dollar borrowers by utilizing nonprofit intermediaries known as microlenders.  Beyond lending the needed capital that is critical to a small business, microlenders are required to provide technical assistance and training to borrowers and perspective borrowers.  The program is unique to the SBA's capital access programs because it combines capital with counseling, two ingredients for growth. However, like many Federal programs, it is in need of modernizing to fully meet the demands of America's small businesses.  H.2056, the Microloan Modernization Act of 2017, does just that.  To fully service small dollar borrowers, H.2056 raises the lending volume a microloan intermediary has at its disposal from $5 million to $6 million.  Next, the legislation provides flexibility to the outdated and antiquated 25/75 rule that limits the amount of preloan technical assistance a microloan intermediary can offer to their small business clients.  By updating the rule to a 50/50 split, more complete assistance can be offered in the early stages of the process, oftentimes, when a small business needs it the most.  To determine if the program is running at its full potential with microlenders throughout the Nation, H.2056 also directs the SBA to study the utilization of the program.  Lastly, to make sure the SBA is providing the correct amount of supervision, the Government Accountability Office, the GAO, is required to study the SBA's oversight tools.  As we continue to see signs of economic improvement, we must steadfastly defend the Nation's small businesses and startups. H.2056 makes important changes to the program that will enhance a small dollar borrower's ability to grow and create jobs.

Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.195, the Federal Register Printing Savings My friend, Mr.Russell, is going to develop a reputation around here for being just too commonsense. This bill would prohibit the Government Publishing Office from sending printed copies of the Federal Register to Members of Congress and other Federal offices unless they wanted them.  The Federal Register includes rules, regulations, executive orders, and other Federal documents. It is a very important and useful publication. It does not make sense, however, as my friend from Oklahoma has pointed out, for GPO automatically to send it to offices that don't want it and end up putting it in the garbage, hopefully recycling.  The Federal Register is available online, as my friend has pointed out, which significantly cuts down on the need for printed copies for most of us. This bill would reduce waste both in paper and in Federal dollars.  The Congressional Budget Office says this bill would reduce Federal spending by $1 million a year. It was the late Everett Dirksen of Illinois who said: ``A billion here, a billion there, pretty soon it adds up to real money.'' CBO also estimates this bill would result in 1,000 fewer copies of the Federal Register being printed each day.

The PRESIDING The Senator from  Mr.Mr.President, I thank the Democratic leader for his courtesy, as always.  In just the last 3 years, under Vladimir Putin, Russia has invaded Ukraine, annexed Crimea, threatened NATO allies, and intervened militarily in Syria, leaving a trail of death, destruction, and broken promises in his wake. Of course, last year Russia attacked the foundations of American democracy with a cyber and information campaign to interfere in America's 2016 election.  I am proud--I am proud--of the two individuals who just spoke, the Senator from Maryland and the Senator from Both of them have worked in a bipartisan fashion and got legislation to this floor. Although it is long overdue, it is here. I believe we will see an overwhelming vote, and I thank them for their bipartisanship.  In the last 8 months, what price has Russia paid for attacking American democracy? Very little. This legislation would begin to change that. The legislation would impose mandatory sanctions on transactions with the Russian defense or intelligence sectors, including the FSB and the GRU, and the Russian military intelligence agency which was primarily responsible for Russia's attack on our election.  I believe my colleagues know what is in this. It would codify existing sanctions on Russia by placing into law six Executive orders signed by President Obama in response to both Russian interference in the 2016 election and its illegal actions in Ukraine, and it would take new steps to tighten those sanctions.  The legislation would target the Russian energy sector, which is controlled by Vladimir Putin's cronies, with sanctions on investment in Russian petroleum and natural gas development as well as Russian energy pipelines.  My friends, the United States of America needs to send a strong message to Vladimir Putin and any other aggressor that we will not tolerate attacks on our democracy. That is what this bill is all about. We must take our own side in this fight, not as Republicans, not as Democrats but as  It is time to respond to Russia's attack on American democracy with strength, with resolve, with common purpose, and with action.

One attribute that hasn't been spoken to is this: It has been my goal as chairman, working with the ranking member, that Congress continue to be more and more relevant and to garner back the powers that we have given to the executive branch for decades. One of the most important attributes of this legislation is the congressional review, where, when major decisions are made, Congress is involved; Congress has a say. I hope we will build upon that, not only in foreign policy but in other matters.  I want to thank all involved.  I urge a strong vote on this piece of legislation that sends a strong message to Iran, to Russia, and to North  With that, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING All time is yielded back.

8709,topic-id,2006,"Mr.President, I came to the floor during the last part of the remarks of the distinguished Democratic leader, and it just reminded me of a headline I saw in this morning's newspaper that just, to me, exemplifies how dishonest, sometimes, the way questions are framed here when it comes to dealing with our financial responsibilities. The headline in the Washington Post talked about President Trump's proposal slashing Medicaid, like the Democrats have criticized the House healthcare replacement bill slashing Medicaid even though, as a factual matter, Medicaid would continue to grow year after year after year.  As the distinguished Presiding Officer and I have previously discussed, one question is, What is a responsible rate of Consumer Price Index or inflation to deal with medical inflation so that when we return Medicaid to the States, spending at let's say 2016 levels, what is a responsible rate of continued growth to deal with medical inflation so that the States are not left with an unsustainable burden?  But the idea that spending at current levels, plus an additional cost-of-living index year after year after year, means that Medicaid spending won't go up every year--next year it will be more than this year. The following year it will be more than next year. So only in the fevered imagination of, apparently, the headline writers at the Washington Post and in some of our Democratic friends could that be considered a cut. In the rest of the country, they would consider that as Medicaid growing, not being cut.  It is true that one of the things the House did that I think is an important reform of one of our principle entitlement provisions was to put some sort of sustainable cap on the growth of spending on entitlements, which perviously had been uncapped.  Some day there is going to be a day of reckoning in this country when it comes to spending. We have $20 trillion in debt. We know now that the Federal Reserve is loosening its hold on interest rates, that those are creeping up, and one of the estimates is that if interest rates due to improved economic performance were to reach historic norms, we would soon be paying more for interest on the national debt than we would be paying for defense spending. That is simply unsustainable, not to mention the fact that we would then be essentially appropriating 30 percent of what the Federal Government spends and leaving 70 percent untouched.  We can't get the country on a sustainable financial path just dealing with 30 percent of what the Federal Government spends, and we need to have a serious conversation, not a misleading characterization of the problem. We need a serious conversation about the reality facing our country and future generations because right now we are spending their inheritance, so to speak. In other words, I consider it an act of immorality for me to be spending money and forcing my children and future generations to pay it back. That is just not fair to them, and we need to come to grips with that sooner rather than later.                  North American Free Trade Agreement  Mr.President, on another note, last week, the administration sent official notice to Congress of its intent to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, or It was a big part of President Trump's campaign platform that the United States needed smarter, fairer trade deals that benefit more I certainly agree with that principle.  I do think, in some quarters, NAFTA has been unfairly maligned. But it is true that it is 23 years old, and it needs to be modernized. I think all of us can rally around that, consistent with the principle in President Trump's campaign that America needs smarter, fairer trade deals that benefit more  Free trade has, after all, been a boon to the American economy--and certainly the Texas economy because we are the 1 exporting State in the Our farmers, ranchers, and small business owners have benefited from trade agreements, particularly NAFTA, that help them send more of the products they raise, grow, and build to more markets around the world, principally to Canada and Mexico; but certainly, other trade agreements allow those manufactured goods, stock raised, and produce grown to go to markets around the world.  We comprise in America about 5 percent of the potential markets in the world, so 95 percent is the rest of the world and a market to buy the things we make and grow and raise here. Why not help create more jobs and a stronger economy here at home by encouraging that kind of free and fair trade?  There has been significant growth in exports since NAFTA was agreed to 23 years ago. Of course, Mexico continues to be an important economic partner, helping my State, Texas, grow and specifically creating a vibrant ecosystem along the border, but the rest of the country benefits too.  The national Chamber of Commerce estimates that there are 5 million American jobs as a result of binational trade with With Canada, it is about 8 million. Why in the world would we want to do anything to jeopardize that? I suggest we don't.  Free trade doesn't just mean more opportunities for our agricultural sector or business owners, but it also helps American families buy more affordable products here at home, too, and that is why we need to make sure that any changes to NAFTA are improvements to the overall agreement.  I was encouraged just this last week when Ambassador Lighthizer, the U.Trade Representative, and Secretary of Commerce Ross met with members of the Senate Finance Essentially, what they said is that their first principle, when it comes to renegotiating NAFTA, is to do no harm. That is a pretty good rule of thumb. In fact, it reminds me of the Hippocratic Oath that doctors take when treating patients: First, do no harm. Well, I believe that is a good place to start.  Over the last two decades under this agreement, the economy in my State of Texas--which has been the engine that has been pulling the national economy in many respects--has grown significantly because of the tremendous access afforded by trade. We have to be careful not to do any harm to that and to look for ways to improve it.  There is no denying that this agreement is an old one created well before the digital and global economy of today. It was written before the energy renaissance in North America occurred, whereby instead of peak energy production--which is what we thought we had reached--we now have so much natural gas and oil that we export it to the world. That is great for jobs here at home. It is great to be able to do that for our allies around the world who need a dependable, alternative supply of energy in many respects, rather than being the victims of energy being used as a weapon against them. So the energy renaissance is another good reason that updating NAFTA makes sense.  I look forward to working with the President and his team to take great care that any efforts to modernize NAFTA don't sacrifice the benefits we have enjoyed for the last two decades. Hopefully, we can modernize it in a way that will allow more Americans to take advantage of it, and our economy will continue to grow and prosper as a result.                         Healthcare Legislation  Mr.President, on another matter, as we all know, this Chamber continues to consider the best way forward to repeal and replace The entire Republican Conference, all 52 of us, have been meeting regularly in small groups and larger groups so we can finally put ObamaCare behind us. I have to say it is a shame that none of our Democratic[[Page S3054]]colleagues appear willing to lift a finger to help us do that, even though they know that ObamaCare is in meltdown mode.  We have promised multiple times, at least in the last three elections, to do away with this disaster of a healthcare law so that American families can get the healthcare they need at a price they can afford. This isn't just a talking point. This is our goal. This is our objective.  When I said that ObamaCare has been a failure, I am reminded of a letter written to me by one of my constituents from the Dallas-Fort Worth area. This gentleman is a small business owner. Since the implementation of ObamaCare, he has had to change his insurance each year, and every time, his rates have increased. He estimates they had gone up from roughly $350 a month now to $800 a month, not to mention his out-of-pocket costs. They have skyrocketed from $3,500 to $14,000. That is not affordable healthcare. At that price, I can't imagine it does him much good at all, particularly when you couple those high premiums with higher deductibles, in many instances $6,000 or more for the deductible alone. So even though you are paying premiums for insurance and those premiums are going up every year, you still have such a high deductible that it effectively makes you self-insured, and you don't benefit from the insurance you actually have.  The first time this gentleman was forced to change his healthcare plan was because his insurance carrier completely pulled out of the marketplace, and that is something we are hearing across the country. It is not just a Texas phenomenon. I imagine there are similar stories in States like Indiana, North Dakota, Wisconsin, Missouri, Michigan, and Montana, just to mention a few. It is simply proof that the ObamaCare experiment is a failure, and the government-mandated, one-size-fits-all approach to healthcare doesn't work very well.  The next year, this same gentleman went with a different insurance company, but they canceled the plan he was already on. Then that insurance company pulled all individual healthcare plans from the State, so he had to find another health insurance plan.  That is not where the bad news ends. The doctor he has had for 20 years didn't accept the new health insurance plan, so instead of finding a new doctor, which he didn't want to do, he is now paying out of pocket so that he can keep the doctor he wants.  Remember what President Obama said countless times: If you like your plan, you can keep it. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. He said that a family of four would find, on average, a savings of $2,500 a year in their health insurance premiums. None of that has proved to be true. This is an experiment that has ended in failure. It didn't turn out to be the case for this constituent of mine; each time his plan changed, he saw a price increase and a coverage decrease.  Even if Hillary Clinton had been elected President of the United States, we would still need to revisit the failures of ObamaCare because the situation is simply not sustainable for roughly about 11 million people--about 6 percent of the people who get their insurance in the individual market.  In spite of knowing that many of their constituents are being hurt by the failures of ObamaCare, our Democratic colleagues--even though they know it--refuse to do anything about it. Again, we invite them to work with us, not for our benefit but for the benefit of the people they represent.  This is not making life any easier for my constituents in Texas, and I am confident that is the case for people across the country. That is why our efforts to replace ObamaCare are so important, and that is why we will keep fighting to get it done because families across the country need access to quality healthcare they can afford that is not chosen for them but is what they choose because it suits their needs.

Mr.Mr.President, last week, we confirmed two well-qualified nominees, Jeffrey Rosen as Deputy Secretary of Transportation and Rachel Brand as Associate Attorney General, and today we will have an opportunity to confirm another excellent nominee, Terry Branstad to be U.Ambassador to  While I am pleased the Senate is working to fill these important positions, it has been disappointing to see so much pointless obstruction by our friends across the aisle. They have continuously forced procedural hurdles on nominees for no other reason than to stall confirmations, launching more filibusters against this President's Cabinet than any other in history. They have done so not to change the result but simply to eat up floor time that could be used for legislation to help our constituents.  Take the floor vote they forced last week on the Branstad nomination. The Senate voted overwhelmingly, 86 to 12, on that motion, proving once again that our Democratic colleagues' tactics have little to do with the nominees themselves but are just delaying for delay's sake. It is really past time to stop the games.  Once confirmed as Ambassador to China, Governor Branstad will be tasked with a portfolio that is important not only for our diplomatic relationship with China but also for our trade policies with that country. He has earned the support of Senators on both sides of the aisle and was reported out of the Foreign Relations Committee by a voice vote.  Having served as the Governor of Iowa for more than two decades, Branstad has developed a strong understanding of agriculture, trade, and other key national interests. His experience on these issues will guide him as he works to strengthen our relationship with China and pursue trade policies that can benefit American workers and businesses. I look forward to confirming him as our Nation's next Ambassador to China so he can get started on the important tasks before him.                      Nomination of John Sullivan  Mr.President, after we confirm Governor Branstad, we will vote to advance another well-qualified nominee to serve as our Nation's Deputy Secretary of State, John It is both a critical and challenging role, but Mr.Sullivan's extensive background has prepared him for the task ahead.

8879,topic-id,515,"Mr.President, I am glad to see my friend from Connecticut, Senator Blumenthal, on the floor because last week the Senate Judiciary Committee reported the PROTECT Our Children Act, which helps protect children across the country from exploitation over the internet.  This is a bipartisan bill, not surprisingly so because last time this legislation passed, originally back in 2008, it[[Page S3548]]had 60 cosponsors, including 41 Democrats and 18 But I have introduced this reauthorization with Senator Heller from Nevada and Senator Blumenthal from It is something we call the National Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force It reauthorizes those.  I have had the sad experience of seeing how dangerous the internet can be for our vulnerable children. When I was attorney general of Texas, I launched something we quaintly called at the time the Texas Internet That was a long time ago, about 2000. Today, they call it the cyber crime unit, and they do a lot of even more sophisticated things. But the idea back then and the idea still today is to fight internet crimes and to work with law enforcement agencies around the State, including a Dallas-based task force.  Now, 17 years later, these task forces are a national network of 61 coordinated units dedicated to protecting children from internet predators and investigating perpetrators who engage in these horrific crimes. These task forces are on the frontline every day, protecting our children online and rescuing victims of exploitation and abuse. They also work with local agencies to create victim support programs and encourage proactive community education; for example, educating parents and adults of the sorts of things their children might be exposed to online that they might not know about. So we need to educate families and children about the risks the internet can hold, together with the wonderful opportunities it also presents. This is really the dark underbelly of the internet.  It requires a depth of resources to fight child predators online. My experience as attorney general was that local law enforcement agencies didn't have the tax base. They didn't have the expertise. They didn't have the computers and the other sophistication they needed in order to combat this in their local communities.  Over the past few years we have been able to save many lives from crime online, and it would be a mistake now to change course. We cannot lose this critical tool.  Just for the information of colleagues, we put this on the hotline which, for those who don't work in the Senate, means we asked all Members of the Senate to comment on this and to let us know if they had any objection to its passage.

It is nice to come here and see something that is truly collaborative and underway that helps businesses.  Prior to coming to Congress last year, I spent the past 16 years growing manufacturing companies in Ohio, so I know firsthand how difficult it is to acquire capital to start and operate and grow small businesses. Businesses that overcome the challenges are faced with numerous regulatory roadblocks that further hinder their growth. Many of those have come at the hands of regulatory frame works like Dodd- But this bipartisan measure that we are talking about today has the opportunity to help the challenges with capital acquisition that government has created and continues to create. Currently, the Investment Company Act of 1940 requires any qualified venture fund over 100 to register with the Securities and Exchange  The real burden of these regulations hits small companies in middle America like Ohio's Eighth District where, unlike major cities, particularly on the coast, we do not have as many options for raising capital.  Not every company seeks to become the next billion-dollar blockbuster, but some of them do. All these companies offer great jobs and give many people the dignity of work, but they can also provide great returns. So we are crowding out investment opportunities, and we are crowding out job opportunities.  This is why I am pleased to support H.1219, the Supporting America's Innovators Act of 2017, which simply increases the cap to allow up to 250 investors to be exempt from registration for qualified venture capital funds, allowing America's small businesses the flexibility to operate and grow their companies, hire employees, and innovate.

I thank Chairman Ed Royce, Ranking Member Engel as well, and the entire staff on the Committee on Foreign Affairs for working to get this important legislation to the floor today.  Mr.Speaker, when many Americans look back in our Nation's history, they remember the iconic nature of the 1962 World's Fair in Seattle or the 1939 and 1964 World's Fairs in New Those events highlighted the best the United States had to offer in science, technology, and innovation, all while bringing visitors and revenue to this great country.  While the United States remains a global leader in these fields, our country has been noticeably absent over the past three decades when it comes to hosting a World's In fact, New Orleans was the last city in the United States to host a World's Fair in 1984. But it is time for that to change and to bring this incredible event back to our great country.  Thankfully, in recent years there has been an upsurge of local interest in hosting a World's Exploratory committees in Houston, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, and San Francisco are actively considering bidding to host a future World's Currently, my home State of Minnesota is competing against Argentina and Poland to do just that, with the goal of hosting the 2023 World However, under the current rules, the Bureau of International Expositions will not give bids submitted by a nonmember country the same consideration as those from a country who is a member of the organization.  For those of you who may not know, the Bureau of International Expositions is the intergovernmental organization in charge of overseeing and regulating World Despite being one of the founding members in 1928, the United States has not been a member since 2001. The U.must renew its membership so Minneapolis and every city across the country can have an opportunity to host a World's  That is why I have introduced and I am happy to see H.534 under consideration before the House today. The U.Wants to Compete for a World Expo Act provides the Secretary of State with the authority to rejoin the Bureau of International Expositions so that U.cities can compete against foreign cities to host a World The 6-month World Expo, held every 5 years, can draw millions of visitors and generate billions of dollars in tourism, construction, and other job-creating economic activity, all while promoting exports of U.products around the world.  In Minnesota's case, a 2016 economic analysis conducted by Rockport Analytics found that hosting the 2023 World Expo will attract 12 million visitors, create almost 22,000 jobs, yield $185.3 million in State and local tax revenue, and generate $1.5 billion in total economic benefits. This legislation also has safeguards for protecting taxpayers and ensuring proper use of funds. Recognizing the difficult fiscal climate our country currently faces, H.534 authorizes the use of private funds to pay outstanding as well as future membership dues. It also maintains taxpayer safeguards which prohibit tax dollars from being used to fund a United States pavilion or exhibit at an international exposition or World's  By approving this legislation today, we will give American cities the ability to compete with other cities around the world to host future Expos and World's Fairs where we can showcase American innovation and success while continuing to be wise stewards of the taxpayers' hard-earned dollars.

Far too often, during my travels throughout Minnesota's Sixth District, I hear frustrations from small-business owners and entrepreneurs about the difficulties they face gaining access to working capital.  With Dodd-Frank's one-size-fits-all regulation being imposed on the banks and credit unions that drive America, our Nation's job creators struggle to grow existing businesses and to even start new ones.  Today's small business is tomorrow's big business, and if our entrepreneurs and job creators are to succeed, we must remove the roadblocks currently standing in their way.

These include many brands and companies we all use each and every day such as Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and even Minnesota's own, They all started with a dream, a lot of hope, and necessary access to tools, resources, and, most importantly, working capital.

8919,topic-id,330,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.1219, the Supporting America's Innovators Act of 2017.  This bill will increase the number of accredited investors who can invest in an angel or venture fund before requiring the fund to register as an investment company. This will encourage capital formation in one of the major types of funds that seed startups and helps bring new ideas to market.  Innovation and invention are integral to economic growth, but new ideas are only the first step in the type of businesses that can grow the economic pie. It is crucial that these companies have access to capital to grow and to bring the product to market. Competition from startups, bolstered by access to funding, creates jobs and forces incumbent firms to stay aggressive in their own research and development.  H.1219 is exactly the type of bipartisan legislation that Congress should be considering to facilitate capital formation.  This bill will make it easier to form a fund made up of sophisticated investors who can assess and bear the risks that come with investing in startups. These funds are capped at $10 million in paid-in and callable capital. This means the funds will largely be engaged in angel investing that helps early-stage investors build a better mousetrap. These funds can often be cheaper for the company and can be structured as equity debt or a combination of both.  A fund like this can bring expertise and connections that increase the likelihood of success for the inventor. It can also spread the risk and rewards for investors because it is important to note that not every invention will turn into the next big thing.  We need a startup ecosystem that encourages the testing of new ideas and products with a wide range of risks and rewards. This bill is a targeted measure to help create that ecosystem by enhancing the ability of early-stage companies to get funding.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill today.

8849,topic-id,762,"Mr.Speaker, yesterday was World Refugee Day, a day set aside by the United Nations to reflect upon those in crisis and dedicate ourselves to helping those we can help.  To mark this solemn occasion, today, the Judiciary Committee House Republicans will vote to slash refugee resettlement numbers, cut back aid to those fleeing violence and persecution for their religious or political beliefs, and make it harder for children fleeing violence, especially those from Central America, from receiving asylum from the richest, most powerful Nation in the world.  Tell me, how does that make America great again, Mr.Speaker?  According to the U.High Commissioner for Refugees, there are more than 65 million people--a record number today--who have been forcibly displaced from their homes. More than 21 million are refugees. Eighty-six percent of the world's refugees are now finding refuge in the developing world, with only 14 percent finding refuge in developed countries like the U.or European nations.  Worldwide, more than half of all refugees are children. So when anti-immigrant leaders, websites, and TV networks paint those fleeing the Middle East, Africa, and Asia as hardened jihadists, or those fleeing Central America as gangbangers and drug dealers, remember, most of them are just kids--little kids. That is what we are talking about, fleeing their country for their lives.  Mr.Speaker, America has, throughout our history, been a beacon of hope to refugees fleeing religious attacks, facing government intolerance and persecution, ethnic strife, or unsustainable poverty.  Beginning in the 1840s, when the potato crop disappeared because of a blight in Ireland, the Irish people were left starving. Over 8 million people in Ireland, 3 to 4 million of them faced starvation. About 1 million died mostly of starvation and disease.  Another 2 million came where?  To  According to a recent article in The Irish Times: ``Panic had set in by the winter of 1846/47. People risked winter voyages across the Atlantic on unsanitary, unsafe `coffin ships.' ''  The article continues: ``People were placed in quarantine stations, or held onboard ships docked at ports.''  ``Refugees experienced violent and racist reactions. Liverpool, Glasgow'' . . . ``Montreal, Boston, New York, and Philadelphia sought unsuccessfully to restrict entry'' of the  A lot of this sounds familiar to me today when we discuss the Muslim ban that the courts have blocked and which motivated thousands of Americans to go to airports to demand that the United States honor its visas and honor its commitment to refugees, or as the House Judiciary Committee meets today, to punish children for fleeing for their lives.  Roughly 32 million Americans trace their roots to That is about 10 percent of the U.population. And let's be clear, the British rulers over Ireland were not sending what they consider their best people. They were poor, they were uneducated, and U.politicians at the time said that they were sending rapists, murderers, and drunks, even as some, they assumed, were good people.  They were from a religion that threatened the United They were Catholics who were as foreign to American Protestants, in some regards, as Muslims are today.  But who can imagine America without the Irish today?  You look down the list of generals, Presidents, Members of Congress, and every aspect of American society today, and we can all say, to some degree, we are  As House Republicans vote today to pass bills to keep out the wretched refuse of your teeming shores, as we pass laws to pull up the drawbridge and put a big ``Do Not Enter'' sign on the Statue of Liberty, I hope my Republican colleagues who can trace roots back to someone who came across the water and risked everything and bet their lives on the United States, I hope all of us will reflect on those ancestors as we deliberate laws and how we would have kept so many of them out.[[Page H4998]]  His Holiness Pope Francis, who we all remember just spoke steps away from where I am at right now, reminded us to always follow the Golden Rule in all our deliberations.

8923,topic-id,325,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support today of H.1219, the Supporting America's Innovators Act, introduced by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.McHenry), the chief deputy whip. I am proud to have his leadership in promoting capital formation in our country.  Yesterday, as he has noted, marks the fifth anniversary of the JOBS Act, which has had a positive impact on easing capital formation woes for small businesses and startups.  I am proud to represent and have the opportunity to work every day with The Venture Center in Little Rock and its FinTech Accelerator program, and the innovation hub in North Little Rock and its medical technology innovation hub. These high-tech innovations, combined with angel funds, give good-paying job opportunities to people out in the heartland and not just on the East and West  But in order for these innovative startups to grow, they have got to have access to greater sources of angel capital, and raising capital in rural America is a challenge.  Having helped design and offer private placements for emerging companies during my whole career, and participating in angel funds in 2 decades prior to coming to Congress, I know firsthand the importance of having a multitude of options for our small businesses to raise capital, no matter what their stage of formation.  This bill builds on the success of the JOBS Act by providing an update to a limit set in 1940, Mr.Speaker, limiting the number of accredited investors that can participate in a qualified venture fund. I am glad we are rushing to a change since 1940. And this simple change from 100 to 250 really allows more angel investors to participate in funds of this nature across the country and gives particular advantage off the East and West  I thank the chairman for the time and my good friend from North Carolina for his leadership. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this worthy measure.  ",CREC-2017-04-06-pt1-PgH2759-2.txt,2223,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2017.0,6.0,April
8930,topic-id,262,"Madam Speaker, I also rise in support of H.1219. I absolutely believe that the time has come for us to modernize how capital gets to our small businesses.  Prior to Congress, I have a history in business, so I fundamentally understand that having a better mousetrap is not enough. Small businesses need capital, need access to more capital in order to grow and get their innovations out to market. They also need access to these sophisticated, accredited investors so that they can get the advice that they need in order to get those better mousetraps out to the people who need them, want to buy them, and want to use them to better their lives.  Fundamentally, everybody can agree that we want Americans to have more economic opportunity, and many Americans find that economic opportunity by starting small businesses or by being a part of small businesses, by investing in small businesses, by working for and with small businesses.  Whether it is a startup in New Albany, Indiana, or a small company growing in Franklin, Indiana, these businesses need access to capital to realize the dreams of their founders, the dreams of their investors, and the dreams of their employees.  Quite simply, H.1219 provides them with the access to more accredited investors, enabling them and empowering them to bring their innovations to market. I am excited to be a cosponsor of this important legislation, and I thank all of my colleagues in the Financial Services Committee, as well as, hopefully, on the floor later today, for their support of this important legislation.

8912,topic-id,801,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, we all know that small businesses and entrepreneurs are the heartbeat of the American economy. Access to financial capital is vital for entrepreneurs seeking to start up, operate, or expand their businesses. However, gaining access to capital has remained an enduring challenge for many small businesses.  The financial crisis and the Great Recession made the situation worse, frankly, as capital became increasingly hard to access from institutional banks and various capital market players. While conditions have improved somewhat in recent years, many entrepreneurs continue to struggle with accessing the capital they need to compete and to grow.  In order to succeed, these companies need capital and credit, the lifeblood for growth, expansion, and job creation. Yet the government continues to construct arbitrary walls that cut them off from essential financing, as smaller companies are caught in a sea of regulatory red tape created by Washington bureaucrats.  We know that 60 percent of all net new jobs that have come into this country, that have been created here in the United States, come from these small businesses. They are oftentimes S corporations, LLCs, sole proprietorships. Small companies often have such owners also be operators. They are working alongside their fellow employees.  That 60 percent of those jobs that have been created here in the United States isn't just a one-time blip. That is over the last 20 years, the last two decades, that we have seen that trend.  Congress has made strides in tailoring the regulatory environment for smaller companies, no doubt, most notably when we passed, with strong bipartisan support, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups, or JOBS, Act in 2012. This was a bipartisan bill that was signed into law by President The JOBS Act's benefits are notable as more and more companies use its provisions to raise investment capital in both the public and private markets.  The JOBS Act has raised the cap on investors in a privately held company from 500 to 2,000 investors, but the limit on the number of investors acting as a coordinated group to invest in a company remained at 100, where it has been since 1940, some 77 years ago.  As noted by Kevin Laws of AngelList in his written testimony before our Capital Markets Subcommittee: ``With online fundraising and general solicitation becoming more common because of the JOBS Act, companies are bumping up against the limit more frequently. The current limit . . . now acts as a brake on the amount of money the company wanted to raise, leaving tens of millions of dollars on the table that did not go into startups.''  While H.1219, the Supporting America's Innovators Act, a bipartisan bill introduced by the vice chairman of our Financial Services Committee, Representative Patrick McHenry, and Nydia Velazquez of New York, would amend the cap currently contained in the Investment Company Act to allow 250 investors for a ``qualified venture capital fund,'' therefore enhancing angel investors' ability to provide important funding to small businesses.  This bill is a very modest increase to the current exemption that has been in place for nearly 77 years. Modernizing this cap is long overdue and reflects today's capital markets and the reality of the increasingly important role that angel investors and others play as they commit the funds necessary to help small businesses grow.  The Securities and Exchange Commission, unfortunately, continues to ignore the backlog of good ideas to spur capital formation, which is recommended by entrepreneurs, small businesses, and market participants from their annual SEC Government-Business Forum on Capital This is a forum that is put together annually. They take and solicit ideas. They want to hear from people that are in the marketplace to figure out what ways they could go to improve that. Unfortunately, they have not acted on[[Page H2760]]this, and in the SEC's absence, Congress must act to promote market efficiency and capital formation.  I think we can all agree that we support smart regulation that protects investors and maintains orderly and efficient markets. But outdated, excessive, and unnecessary regulation whose costs outweigh benefits is dumb regulation that overburdens smaller companies. Let's provide some regulatory relief by enacting the bipartisan bill that will ease the burdens on small businesses and job creators and help foster capital formation and get Americans back to work.  Mr.Speaker, I would also like to note, in a hearing that we had on this bill last Congress, it passed our committee 52-2, including the ranking member voting for it. There were no dissenting minority views that were offered, and no amendments were offered at the Rules Committee on this. We have got a lot of consensus. I believe this is the right thing to do to move forward.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-04-06-pt1-PgH2759-2.txt,2028,1730,2017.0,6.0,April

In light of that and in that history, in that spirit, we have reached across the aisle, and Representative Velazquez and Ranking Member Waters worked with me to craft a very good bill here today.  This bill is targeted at small businesses across the rest of the country. We know that 78 percent of venture capital goes to just three If you are in Austin, Boston, or the Silicon Valley, you have capital flowing to you; you have funds for your idea. The rest of the country, whether you are in an urban area or rural area, is starved for capital.  In light of that problem, we are trying to work for a solution for those small businesses, those innovators with good ideas that maybe don't have the best access to capital. We raised the cap on angel investing, thereby allowing more people to participate at a lower threshold dollar amount while still including important investor protection.  Today is a great victory for small-business folks that need access, that need capital to take their idea to market. Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

8706,topic-id,1478,"Mr.President, on April 19, CNN published a guest column by U.Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, ``An unprecedented step on human rights.'' At a time when[[Page S2485]]President Trump has praised Egypt's President el-Sisi and Turkey's President Erdogan, both of whom are responsible for brutal crackdowns on dissent and for subverting the institutions of democracy, and after the White House lifted human rights restrictions on the sale of military equipment to Bahrain and Secretary of State Tillerson did not participate in the public release of the Department's Annual Report on Human Rights Practices, Ambassador Haley's op-ed is welcome.  In it, she made several statements that I think bear repeating. For example, she said: ``[W]idespread human rights violations are a warning sign--a loud, blaring siren--that a breakdown in peace and security is coming.''  ``[T]here is hardly an issue on the agenda of the Security Council that does not in some way involve human rights.''  ``The next international crisis could very well come from places in which human rights are widely disregarded . . . we know from history that it will happen. And when it does, the United Nations will be called upon to act. We are much better off acting before abuse turns to conflict.''  I strongly agree with all of that and commend her for saying it.  Ambassador Haley singled out several countries, including Syria, North Korea, Iran, and Cuba, where violations of human rights--although of different types and on vastly different scales--are common.  A few days later, Secretary Tillerson rightly criticized the government of Venezuelan President Maduro, who has locked up his political opponents and sought to decapitate what remains of the institutions of democracy in that country.  It is not sufficient, however, as some in this administration have been doing, to defend human rights only in countries whose governments are regarded as adversaries of the United That is the politically safe approach, and it weakens the credibility of those who seek to defend human rights.  It is important to note that the governments of a number of U.allies, such as Egypt, the Philippines, Turkey, Ethiopia, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Vietnam, also routinely violate human rights by arresting and imprisoning dissidents, independent journalists, and members of organizations who peacefully protest against government policies.  In the Philippines, anyone suspected of using or selling drugs is in danger of summary execution by the police. Thousands have been killed with impunity in the past 9 months. In Honduras, scores of journalists and environmental activists have been assassinated, and rarely is anyone arrested or punished. In Colombia, thousands of social activists and human rights defenders have been killed, many of them victims of the security forces and rightwing armed groups, and few people have been held accountable. There are many other examples.  I hope Ambassador Haley's statement is a sign that human rights will become a visible and consistent focus of the Trump administration's foreign policy. Freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly, and due process--these are all rights and ideals that Americans cherish. They are also enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human As the world's oldest democracy, we have a responsibility, and it is in our interest to defend them wherever they are violated because protecting fundamental rights is necessary, not only for justice and the rule of law, but, as Ambassador Haley points out, for global peace and security, including America's security.  I ask unanimous consent that Ambassador Haley's guest column be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                       [From CNN, 19, 2017]                 An Unprecedented Step on Human Rights                            (By Nikki Haley)       Imagine you are the parent of a boy--a teenager. Policemen      come to your home in the middle of the night and take your      boy away. He is held without explanation for weeks. And when      he finally comes home, your boy has all the marks of having      been tortured. Bruises from being beaten. Red, open wounds      from being burned. Then you look at his hands and the worst      is confirmed. Where his fingernails once were, there are only      raw, bloody, exposed nerves. Grown men with pliers, he tells      you, ripped his fingernails off in prison.       For a group of parents in Syria in 2011, this was not an      exercise in imagination but a horrifying reality. Their boys      were arrested and tortured for the crime of writing anti-     government graffiti on the wall of a school. When the parents      marched in protest to demand their children's release,      security services opened fire on them. When more people came      out to protest the killings, the government fired on them      again. Soon, the point of no return was reached.       ``We were asking in a peaceful way to release the children      but their reply was bullets,'' a relative of one of the boys      told a reporter. ``Now we can have no compromise with any      security branches.''       The Syrian war is just one example of how human rights      violations can become a vicious cycle of violence and      instability that quickly spirals into all-out war. What began      as an act of free expression of the kind Americans take for      granted has become a conflict responsible for hundreds of      thousands of deaths and millions of desperate refugees.      Nations thousands of miles away have been impacted.       As the U.Ambassador to the United Nations, I've looked      at how we can do more to respond to human rights violations      before they reach the level of conflict. Traditionally, the      United Nations Security Council has been considered the place      where peace and security are debated, not human rights. But      Tuesday, at the insistence of the United States, for the      first time the Security Council took up the connection      between human rights and conflict. We debated how widespread      human rights violations are a warning sign--a loud, blaring      siren--that a breakdown in peace and security is coming.       Syria is not alone. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo      today, it is no coincidence that reports of government      soldiers and armed groups committing extrajudicial executions      of civilians in the Kasais region are occurring at the same      time that the security situation appears to be quickly      spiraling out of control.       These sorts of allegations demand answers from independent      investigations. And when violations are found to occur, the      United Nations cannot turn a blind eye. We must engage these      violators early and often, in the statements we make and the      measures we impose. Human rights violations and abuses      suffered by civilians rarely have a happy ending. At best,      they drive desperate people from their homes and from their      countries. At worst, they radicalize them to take up arms      themselves.       In other cases, human rights violations and abuses don't      lead to violence down the road, they exist side-by-side with      threats to peace and security. In fact, the world's most      brutal regimes are also the most ruthless violators of human      rights.       In the case of North Korea, human rights abuses literally      finance the government's nuclear and ballistic missile      programs. Political prisoners work themselves to death in      coal mines to finance the regime's military. Starvation,      sexual violence and slave labor in the prison camps help      supply the North Korean nuclear program.       In Burundi, the government is using human rights violations      to stifle dissent. The Burundian government services use      torture to crack down on protestors. This has forced hundreds      of thousands of people to flee to neighboring countries and      caused massive regional disruption. A U.report detailed 17      types of torture used by the government, including driving      sharpened steel rods into the legs of victims and dripping      melted plastic on them.       In fact, there is hardly an issue on the agenda of the      Security Council that does not in some way involve human      rights. As president of the Council, I've had great support      from U.Secretary General Antonio Guterres in driving home      the connection between threats to human dignity and threats      to peace. I'm grateful as well to my colleagues on the      Security Council, who agreed to take this unprecedented step.       The next international crisis could very well come from      places in which human rights are widely disregarded. Perhaps      it will be in North Korea or Iran or We don't know when      the next group of desperate people will rise up or when the      next gang of violent extremists will exploit human suffering      to further their cause. But we know from history that it will      happen. And when it does, the United Nations will be called      upon to act. We are much better off acting before abuse turns      to conflict.       Imagine if we had acted six years ago in If we learn      nothing else from the torture of children, let it be this:      Evil is an inescapable fact of life, but the violence that      results from human rights violations and abuses is not      inevitable. We can choose to learn from history, not doom      ourselves to repeat it.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-24-pt1-PgS2484-4.txt,1383,COUNTERING AMERICA'S ADVERSARIES THROUGH SANCTIONS ACT,2017.0,24.0,May
8738,topic-id,1269,"Mr.President, one thing we learn at a young age is the very basic principle that, when you give your word, you keep it. On June I, on the international stage, President Trump signaled to the rest of the world that America cannot be relied upon to meet this very basic tenet. On one warm afternoon in Washington, President Trump withdrew the United States from one of the most sweeping global environmental accords in generations. Abandoning our obligations to the Paris climate accords doesn't make America great. It doesn't reflect America's traditional role as innovator, leader, and standard bearer in our shared commitment to protecting the environment.  The chief U.negotiator of those accords, Todd Stern, is a former member of my staff. No one among the ranks of our government was closer to these negotiations, which led to a deal that was a win for American workers and businesses and a first step toward ensuring the survival of our planet. His words, published by the Washington Post on June 1, should be required reading for every American, including the  By reneging on our pledge to honor these accords, which were forged through U.leadership, President Trump is ceding American leadership in emerging clean energy technologies and worsening one of the genuine existential threats to the world. The President's decision was a serious setback in our fight to save our planet. But as Mr.Stem writes, ``This is not the end of the line. This is a call to arms.''  Governors and mayors and State and local officials are heeding this call, rejecting the President's decision, and pledging to move forward with aggressive efforts to curb climate change. President Trump may think this is the end of America's involvement in the Paris climate accord. But, like Todd Stern, I believe a majority of Americans will reject this move. I, too, hope they will double down on our shared commitment to protecting our environment and our world for generations to come.  I ask unanimous consent that Mr.Stern's column, ``Trump just betrayed the world. Now the world will fight back,'' be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, June 1, 2017]     Trump Just Betrayed the Now The World Will Fight                            (By Todd Stern)       President Trump has made a colossal mistake in deciding to      withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. There is simply no      case for withdrawal, other than a desire to double down on an      ill-informed campaign promise, while the case for staying in      is overwhelming. But damaging as it is, this decision is not      the beginning of the end for efforts to contain climate      change. The world decided in Paris to confront the climate      threat, and it is not turning back.       Around the world, climate change is a metastasizing danger,      for some countries even an existential threat. It was      understood in the years leading up to the Paris negotiation      that the climate challenge could be met only with a new kind      of agreement premised on concerted effort by all. That      agreement--ambitious, universal, transparent, balanced--was      reached in Paris, with the help of U.leadership every step      of the way.       Trump's suggestion Thursday that he is willing to      renegotiate the deal to make it fairer to the United States      doesn't pass the straight-face test. The Paris agreement--for      anyone who actually understands it--is entirely fair to the      United The idea that 194 other countries will listen      to Trump's insulting Rose Garden blather and say, ``Sure,      let's sit down and negotiate a new deal'' is ridiculous.       Instead, Trump's decision will be seen as an ugly      betrayal--self-centered, callous, hollow, cruel. The ravages      of climate change have been on display in recent years in the      superstorms, floods, rising sea levels, droughts, fires and      deadly heat waves that will only get worse as the carbon      index mounts. Vulnerable countries will look at the United      States, the richest power on Earth, the largest historic      emitter of greenhouse gases, and think--even if they do not      say--how dare you?       President Barack Obama once said to business leaders, in a      Roosevelt Room meeting I attended, that climate change was      the one threat, other than nuclear weapons, with the      potential to alter the course of human progress. A near-     consensus of major U.companies urged the Trump      administration to stay in the agreement because they know      climate change is real, that the Paris agreement is a good      and balanced deal, that their own concerns on matters such as      intellectual property and trade will be defended only if U.     negotiators are at the table and that turning the United      States into a climate-change pariah will be bad for business,      for access to markets and for investment. But our chief-     executive president decided to leave U.business in the      lurch.       All this is more than disappointing. And watching the so-     called internal battle on this issue play out between      determined antagonists on the one side and diffident, sotto      voce defenders on the other was downright depressing.       But let's be clear: This is not the end of the line. This      is a call to arms.       Countries won't follow Trump out of the Paris climate      agreement and over a cliff. They won't give Trump the      satisfaction of ``canceling'' the agreement, as he promised      during his campaign. They will want to show that they can      carry on without the United And they know too well      that climate change is real and that if the Paris regime fell      apart, they'd just have to build it again. They will hold on      to the hope that the current administration will be a one-     term wonder. It is true that, in the longer run, it would be      difficult for the Paris regime to produce accelerated action      at the level that is needed without the United But      other countries will probably bet that the United States will      come back.       Progressive U.states and cities also have a crucial role      to play, not only in extending the good work they are already      doing on climate change, but also by sending a clear and      resounding message to the global community: that while      Trump's Washington may have gone dark on climate change,      inspired centers of innovation and commitment are lighting      the way forward all over the country. In states such as      California and New York, Washington, Oregon, Minnesota,      Illinois and North Carolina, and in New England; in cities      such as New York, Chicago,[[Page S3551]]     Los Angeles, Houston and New Orleans, among many others.      These entities account for a sizable chunk of both U.gross      domestic product and carbon emissions. They may not be able      to get the United States all the way to our 2025 Paris      emissions target, but they have the potential to go far.       Private companies, too, have been instrumental in driving      the clean-energy revolution, pursuing the massive economic      opportunities presented by the need to decarbonize our energy      system. And consumers are increasingly demanding that      companies not only provide desirable products or services,      but also stand as good corporate citizens.       Finally, for citizens, it is time to hold our leaders      accountable at all levels of government. Protecting our      nation, our children and our American heritage should not be      optional for an elected leader. Nor should preserving      America's singular standing in the world.       Thursday was not a good day for climate change, and it was      not a good day for the United Nothing we say now can      change that. But it is a day that needs to be remembered as      the visible moment the rear-guard opposition went too far. It      is a day to spark action and resolve. It is a day that needs      to count.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-15-pt1-PgS3550-2.txt,1383,COUNTERING AMERICA'S ADVERSARIES THROUGH SANCTIONS ACT,2017.0,15.0,May

When we started on Iran, there were those who wanted to look only at its intercontinental ballistic missile violations. I and others persisted and said: Wait a minute.

So, indeed, we have to get our arms around this problem.                                 Haiti  Mr.President, I want to address the Senate on a different subject. If you will recall the devastating earthquake in this little country of Haiti--the poorest nation in the entire Western Hemisphere--you can imagine what that earthquake did. Just as people are beginning to get their lives back together, here comes a hurricane, and it devastates even more. As a result, over the course of those years, a number of Haitians were admitted into the United States under TPS, temporary protected status. That is a special entry into the United States, usually because of a natural catastrophe that has occurred in another nation in the world, but it is with the understanding that, indeed, as the first word of TPS says, it is ``temporary.''  So into the United States--allowing some relief on all of the stresses on the local economy and the government because of that devastating earthquake, and then later the hurricane on top of it--are approximately just less than 60,000 Haitians here legally on So the Government of the United States is making a decision and has just announced earlier today that it will extend I might say, that is a bipartisan request from many of us from the Florida delegation--to extend TPS until the nation of Haiti can, in fact, absorb 60,000 people back into its little island economy.  These are people who generally want to go back. Their families are there. These are people who have now earned a substantial savings that they send back as remittances to their families. These are people with skills that Haiti, as it continues to rebuild from a poverty-stricken nation, will want to have back because of their skills.  I might say that when I knew the Department of Homeland Security was considering this--whether to revoke the TPS status or to extend it--I felt quite confident that the Secretary of DHS, General Kelly, the former commander of Southcom, the U.Southern Command--that in his 3-year stint as commander of Southcom, he in fact would understand all the nuances because he had lived with that problem. He understood it. He understood not[[Page S3058]]only TPS for the Haitians, but he also understood the TPS that even years before had been given to a number of Central Americans when they came into the country under temporary protected status, which they likewise had been extended, and that status has not been revoked. I felt quite confident that General Kelly, as the Secretary of DHS, would extend TPS from ordering immediate removal to the Nation of Haiti of 60,000 people. Indeed, General Kelly announced that decision earlier today, and he has granted a 6-month extension.  Now, therein lies the problem. I have just spoken to General Kelly, who is really a tremendous, lifelong marine, very decorated, a true hero. He is someone that has comported with his duties, whatever it has been in his service to America, in the most exemplary manner. What I wanted to discuss with General Kelly was that there is just no way in 6 months that the Nation of Haiti can absorb 60,000 of its people back. It would be like trying to swallow a bite of food that is way too big in order to do it.  So what I urged General Kelly after this announcement was made, which has caused alarm in the Haitian-American community--it certainly caused alarm in the nation of Haiti, the Government of Indeed, the Ambassador was asking for an extension of at least 18 months. I don't think it is out of the question that General Kelly will consider that. Therefore, I asked him to please confer with the leadership in the Haitian-American community in South Florida, a community he is well aware of since he lived in Miami for 3 years as the commander of U.Southern I think he will follow that suggestion and meet in the not-too-distant future with the leaders.  General Kelly also told me he was planning a trip to Haiti to discuss this directly with the Government of That is important because how can they reasonably absorb them back into society, utilize their skills--and over what period of time can that be done? Therefore, I commend General Kelly, the Secretary of DHS, on the way he has approached it. I would urge our Haitian-American communities in America to just be patient. Understand that General Kelly is going to do a comprehensive overview and that in 6 months, come January, suddenly 60,000 people are not going to be kicked out of the country.  The truth is, I am not sure the Government of the United States knows exactly where all the 60,000 are. So that is going to be another question of locating them, once the decision is made, which this Senator has certainly urged at least 18 months before that would start. I have spoken to the Haitian He told me it is a newly formed government in Haiti and is working on a plan to further rebuild and develop the country so its people can make their lives there again. They have asked for the extension of TPS up to 18 months while they continue to rebuild. I think that by Secretary Kelly indicating he is going to Haiti very soon, that he has indicated he is going to reconsider the decision that was made about 6 months, suddenly revoking all of their TPS status. As Haiti continues to rebuild, repatriating 60,000 Haitians here in the United States needs to be pursued according to a plan that will not destabilize the new government's efforts.  Remember, this is a government that had a temporary government because there was a question about chicanery in the election. There was actually a temporary President that governed the country, and then new elections were held with an overwhelming winner who is now the President of So in this newly formed government, you don't want to destabilize their efforts, which would divert precious resources to just reintegrating the people who would be sent back from the United It could cause a severe overburden on the government. Therefore, what this Senator is asking for--what I think, at the end of the day, will probably be 18 months, given that time, and then start an orderly transition of those TPS Haitians back to their own country.  Thus, the United States can continue to be focused on helping Haiti recover from all of these disasters they have suffered. Therefore, I feel quite confident Secretary Kelly will do that.

After 102 days in office, the so-called ``greatest jobs President that God ever created'' has failed to present a single job or infrastructure bill.  At the same time, his slash-and-burn budget would cut investments in job growth and infrastructure, imposing a $2.4 billion cut on the U.Department of Included in those cuts are drastic reductions of the Federal support for Amtrak and the outright elimination of the TIGER grant program.  The President's budget proposal also phases out the New Starts grant program, making critical infrastructure projects, including New Jersey and New York's Gateway Program ineligible for Federal funding needed to move forward.  As I speak, New Jersey rail commuters are probably facing massive delays and disruptions to their already nightmarish commute. President Trump's proposed cuts to vital Federal infrastructure programs will only make the problem worse.

8714,topic-id,2235,"Madam President, I came to the floor last week to talk about our police officers. It was during Police We talked about the bravery and heroism of our officers back home. I talked about tragic stories of police officers who were gunned down in the line of duty and talked about what they do for us every day.  Today I want to talk about an issue that is endangering their lives and the lives of so many in our communities but specifically law enforcement. This happens in every single State represented in this This danger is this new epidemic of synthetic heroin, of opioids.  We know more about heroin and prescription drugs. Now we have these synthetic heroins coming in that are even more powerful. Being a police officer has always been a tough job, but it is becoming riskier today because of this. Some people have heard it as carfentanil or fentanyl or Most of this synthetic poison coming into our communities is coming through the mail system. It is coming from overseas, primarily from China, where they have laboratories, where some evil scientist is mixing up this chemical mix and sending it over here into our communities.  Let me tell you about something that happened last Friday in East Liverpool, Some of you may know the name ``East Liverpool'' because it is the same city where there was a photograph that went viral on the Internet of a couple who had overdosed in the front of a car, with their 3-year-old grandson in a car seat behind them. It showed the grandson, and it showed the two who had overdosed passed out in the front of the car.  In this same town of East Liverpool, OH, an officer by the name of Chris Green pulled over a car in a routine traffic stop. As he came up to the car, he noticed there was white powder sprinkled around the car. He took the appropriate precautions. He put on his gloves, he put on a mask, and he began to deal with the situation at hand. The people in the car apparently had spread the powder to try to avoid it being detected, but it was easily detectible.  At the end of his arrest process, there was a small amount of powder that was left on his jacket, which he did not notice. He went back to the police station. When he got there, he noticed the powder on his shirt and instinctively he went like this to get the powder off of his shirt. This small amount of powder touching his hand caused him to overdose. Officer Green is not a small guy; he is about 6 feet 3 inches, 225 pounds. He is a big, strong police officer who overdosed just by trying to get a few flakes of powder off of his jacket. Why? Because this fentanyl is so powerful. It is so deadly.  Fortunately, his fellow police officers were able to save his life with naloxone. This is a miracle drug which reverses the effects of an overdose and which is being used on our streets every single day to save people from dying from overdoses. In this case, it was used to keep a police officer who was doing his duty and who had simply tried to get a few flakes of powder off of his uniform from dying of an overdose.  East Liverpool police chief John Lane put it this way:       If he had been alone, he'd be dead. That's how dangerous      this stuff is.  Chief Lane later made the point that if Officer Green had gone home in that shirt and unknowingly had this powder on his shirt or his jacket, he could have endangered the lives of his family. That is a scary thought. Obviously, that is true. That is how deadly these drugs are.  It only takes a few milligrams, just a few specks, to kill you. This chart will show you how much it takes. Here you see that 10 milligrams of carfentanil is powerful enough to sedate a 15,000-pound elephant. Here is the carfentanil over here, as shown on this chart. You will see why a fatal dose can be a very, very small amount--30 milligrams for heroin, 3 milligrams for fentanyl, even less than 3 milligrams for carfentanil.  By the way, for those of you at home, if you look at a penny, you will see Abraham Lincoln's profile on one side of it. The deadly dose of fentanyl that we are talking about here is enough to only cover up the face of Abraham Lincoln on a penny. That is how little we are talking about and how deadly this stuff is. You can see why our law enforcement officers are so concerned about this.  Officer Green is not the only one to experience this. There was a famous case last year where two officers in Atlantic County, NJ--Detective Dan Kallen and Detective Eric Price--overdosed on fentanyl just by breathing fentanyl in the air at a crime scene. As some of you have heard, fentanyl is so dangerous that they are afraid to use dogs to try to sniff it out because just by trying to sniff these packages to see whether fentanyl is included in them, the dogs could overdose and die. Fentanyl is dangerous stuff.  By the way, it is taking up more and more of the resources of our police officers and other first responders. Earlier this year, I came to the floor and talked about Officer Ben Rhodes of Chillicothe, Last year Officer Rhodes reversed more than 50 drug overdoses. This is one officer in one small town.  Talk to the firefighters in your community and ask them whether they go on more fire runs or more heroin and fentanyl and carfentanil overdose runs. I almost guarantee you they will say they go on more overdose runs. As a result, in some communities, those firefighters are not there to be able to protect us as you would typically think from the fires that still continue to be a major problem. So this is a real issue. It is taking up more and more of their time and more resources and causing more and more crime.  On Thursday, in Middletown, OH, which is a town in Southern Ohio, a family was getting ready to leave the house. In fact, they had already strapped their 3-month-old baby into a car seat. It is not clear whether they had shot up with heroin before they put the baby in the car seat or after, but they went back into the house and they overdosed in the house. They had the baby in the car seat in the car. They overdosed in the home.  They have another son who is 5 years old. He ran out of the house barefoot. He went to a neighbor's house, to his stepfather's home, which is a few blocks away, and yelled at the door: Mom and dad are dead. Mom and dad are dead.  The grandfather called the police, and they rushed to the scene. They were able to revive the boy's dad with naloxone. They used seven doses of naloxone on the mother, but she still couldn't wake up. From talking to police officers about this, they tell me that there is a very good sign this involved fentanyl, perhaps carfentanil, because after two, three, four, five, six, seven doses of naxolone, she still could not be revived. Fortunately, the police rushed her to the hospital, where they were finally able to bring her back.  Again, this is what police officers are facing every day in my home State of Ohio, in your State, in your community.  After this incident, the Middletown Police said on Facebook:       It has to stop. Please get help before it's too late. Not      only to save yourself, but to save your kids. Give these kids      a chance by getting help. If you or someone you love has a      drug problem, please seek help right now.  This is a cry from our police officers saying that this can't continue.  Talk to the firefighters and police officers who have administered naloxone to the same individual time and time again, overdose after overdose. These brave officers and police officers around the country are feeling overwhelmed.  Drug overdoses are now the 1 cause of accidental death in the United States of It has now surpassed car accidents. It has way surpassed gun violence. In the last 3 years, more Americans have died of drug overdoses than died in the Vietnam war. More Americans are dying of drug overdoses now than died of AIDS at the peak of the AIDS epidemic in 1995. This year, 2017, more people will die from overdoses from opioids than died from AIDS at the peak in 1995--another tragedy. According to an article in the New[[Page S3057]]York Times, more than four times as many people are dying every day from this epidemic than were dying of drug overdoses at the peak of the crack cocaine epidemic. When I say it is the worst drug crisis we have faced in this country and that it is an epidemic, that is not overstating it.  The Fraternal Order of Police and the Major County Sheriffs of America are actually focused on this issue, and they want better tools to be able to at least try to stop some of this poison--the fentanyl and the carfentanil--from coming into our communities.  I mentioned earlier the fact that this actually comes by the mail system. It doesn't come by all mail systems. It comes through the U.mail system, as opposed to the private carriers, such as FedEx, UPS, DHL, or others. One reason is because our mail system in the United States does not require the kind of advanced notice of where the package is from, what is in it, and where it is going that the private carriers require. So where do the traffickers go? They go to our mail service, the U.Postal Service, and the postal service in the country that interacts with and connects with our postal service.  This is why the Fraternal Order of Police, the Major County Sheriffs of America, and other law enforcement are saying: Help us by passing legislation called the STOP The STOP Act is to help stop traffickers from bringing these deadly poisons into our communities, the kind of stuff that caused Officer Green to overdose.  Fentanyl and these other synthetic drugs are not just coming in from overseas; they are coming in through our mail system. What we are saying in the STOP Act is, let's close the loophole. Let's say that the mail system in the United States has to say the same thing that other private carriers say, which is, if you want to ship something through our system, that is fine, but you have to tell us what is in it. You have to tell us where it is from and where it is going. Otherwise, they can't effectively stop these packages. It is like finding a needle in a haystack.  I talked earlier about the difficulty of detecting it and how poisonous it is, and sniffing dogs can't be used because of the potential of them overdosing and dying. It is also very difficult for our officers to find these packages without some information. Expert testimony, including that from the Secretary of Homeland Security, General Kelly, from Customs and Border Protection, and from the folks at DEA all reach the same conclusion, which is that this policy change would make it easier for law enforcement to detect suspicious packages of fentanyl, carfentanil, and other synthetic drugs and help keep this poison out of our country.  Support for this legislation is bipartisan, and it is growing. We now have 16 cosponsors in the Senate--8 Democrats and 8 Completely bipartisan. In the House, Congressman Pat Tiberi of Ohio and Richard Neal of Massachusetts--a Republican and a Democrat--have introduced bipartisan companion legislation. They now have 128 cosponsors. Support is building. It is an obvious way to help push back. Is it the silver bullet? There is not one silver bullet. We need to do more in terms of prevention, treatment, and recovery, and help our law enforcement more to make sure they have naloxone to be able to save lives.  At least, let's stop some of this poison from coming in, and let's at least increase the cost of the fentanyl because one reason you see this big increase in overdoses from fentanyl and carfentanil and traffickers using more of it is because of the cost. At the very least, by helping our law enforcement, giving them the tools they need, we can stop some of it and increase the cost on the street.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the STOP We have a hearing on this legislation on Thursday of this week in the Permanent Subcommittee on We have experts coming in--law enforcement officers who care a lot about their colleagues. They talk about what a danger this is to them, what a danger this is to our communities. It is time for us in the U.Senate to stand up and take this important step, not the silver bullet but the important step to be able to help save lives and make our communities safer.

It is about people, about relieving a person's pain and suffering, about giving a person a chance to live a healthy and happy life. It is about Max Maybe you will remember him. Max was the mini Darth Vader from a Super Bowl commercial in 2011 who captured our hearts.  Max was born with tetralogy of Fallot, a rare and deadly congenital heart defect. Throughout his 12 years, Max has had more than 10 heart surgeries under the loving care at Children's Hospital Los He lives every day with a pacemaker and an artificial pulmonary valve. Open heart surgeries are complex and very serious surgeries. They are tough on patients, with often a long recovery, and grueling for the family.  Max stopped by my office a few days ago to talk about his experience, and he told me: ``I am going to have my condition all my life. I am going to have surgery as a constant commotion on my life. I just want to be covered. I don't want to have to worry about insurance and how I am going to pay these bills. I just want to focus on keeping myself healthy and not having to sacrifice everything for a surgery.''  Max wants to play baseball. He loves Harry Potter, and he dreams of being an actor. Earlier this year, Max was in the hospital for treatments for an entire month. His mom, Jennifer, described how they were feeling bummed one day after such a long and arduous hospital stay. They decided to take a walk, and on their walk they met a boy Max's age named Will is still in the hospital today. He has been there 9 months waiting desperately for a heart transplant.  Max told me how Will has spent every holiday and even his birthday in the hospital this year. Max wanted to do something for Will, so they had these bracelets made. He named them ``Will Power.'' They have Max's favorite verse on them. Max and Will connected. They developed a bond bound by compassion. Their hope for a normal life gave them strength and friendship, and Max promised Will he would bring the bracelets to Congress when they came.  Philippians 4:13: ``I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.''  Max and Will, that is my favorite verse, too.  Max is fighting to protect other kids like him and Will, people with a preexisting illness, from losing coverage and having to pay more from facing a lifetime path on coverage.  He came to tell the stories of so many other children he knows from his many hospital visits. His message is simple: ``Children's healthcare needs a bipartisan solution.''  Max and Will and all the friends they have made in the hospital aren't rooting for Democrats or They are fighting for their life and rooting for each other. They are children who want to get healthy, who want to stay healthy and care for one another.  We can all learn from Max's and Will's selfless courage to help others.

8971,topic-id,416,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  My bill, H.195, the Federal Register Printing Savings Act of 2017, will save taxpayers dollars while providing needed reform in how we conduct day-to-day business in  The Federal Register contains a large amount of information, including proposed rules and public notices, regulations, executive orders, and Presidential documents. This information is compiled by the National Archives and published daily by the Government Publishing Office, or the Often described by the National Archives as ``the daily newspaper of the Federal Government,'' this service enables Members, staffs, and agencies to keep track of activity across government.  In 1994, the GPO began publishing the Federal Register online. To improve user experience, the digital version has been enhanced over time to provide navigational aids that include links to related content.  The Federal Register is now fully searchable and downloadable, making for quick access to any document. But sadly, Mr.Speaker, despite the advance of technology, Members of Congress and Federal offices across the entire government still receive printed copies of the Federal Register every day.  In the course of a year, this stack of Registers would be 16-feet high. This results in thousands of copies going directly into the trash each week, unless occasionally used as doorstops. Subscriptions to the Federal Register cost about $1,000 annually, meaning hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars are wasted each year. This same money could pay for the salaries of 50 soldiers who defend our Republic in a given year.  Mr.Speaker, H.195 makes a small but significant change to fix the problem and ensure that we operate in the 21st century. Instead of automatically receiving printed copies, Members or offices of the Federal Government who want to continue to receive copies need only submit a request. There will be an opt-in, instead of an opt-out.  Current print and on-demand technologies make this possible. The subscriptions will last for 1 year to ensure Members and offices are able to evaluate if they want to continue the service. For Members in offices that do not use or want the printed version, they will not receive it and will still have full access to the searchable digital version which most Members use.[[Page H4268]]  This change will reduce unnecessary printing and, in context, will prevent 96 Americans from having to work each year so that we can throw Registers in the trash.

8708,topic-id,2009,"Mr.President, since last week's all-Senators briefing with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, some of my friends on the other side of the aisle have alleged that his appointment of a special counsel impedes the congressional investigation into Russian interference in our elections and whether the Trump campaign was involved. Nothing could be further from the truth.  The executive branch investigation under the special counsel looks at criminal wrongdoing. The congressional investigation takes a broader approach. The two can proceed on parallel tracks, as has happened many times in the past. If anything the congressional investigation is doing potentially interferes with the special counsel's activities, the two parties will discuss it. It is a process called deconfliction. They know how to do it. They have done it before. There is no reason whatsoever for the congressional investigation to slow down or stop.  Mr.Mueller's appointment as special counsel in no way diminishes the need for Congress to play an active role in helping to get to the bottom of all the recent events. Let me repeat. This is our solemn constitutional duty, the very bedrock of the separation of powers and coequal branches of government designed by our Founding Fathers to preserve something we all cherish: American liberty and American democracy. Let me outline three things that should happen.  First, Intelligence Committee Chair Burr and Ranking Member Warner should continue to pursue their committee's investigation into these matters with just as much vigor. That investigation has been proceeding in a bipartisan way, and it absolutely should continue as such. For example, my friends Senators Burr and Warner have recently requested financial records of key Trump campaign officials from the Treasury They should be given that information and continue to pursue whatever other avenues they view as helpful to the committee's investigation.  Second, Mr.Comey should testify in both the Judiciary and the Intelligence Committees to discuss the events surrounding his dismissal. The committees should be given access to memos he reportedly drafted following interactions with President Trump, and Congress should also be provided any transcripts or tapes the White House might have of Mr.Comey's conversations with President  Third, the Intelligence Committee must be provided the details of transcripts relating to President Trump's reported disclosure of information to the Russian Foreign Minister and There is a great deal of dispute about what was said at that meeting. The committee should have access to both Mr.Comey's notes and the White House's notes.  Finally, the Senate must demand the next FBI Director be nonpartisan, independent, fearless, and of unimpeachable integrity, just as Mr.Mueller is. A career politician of either party or anyone who suggests a lack of impartiality should not be considered a fit choice for that office. Every one of these, by the way, deals with congressional oversight--some directly, like the appointment of an FBI Director; some a little[[Page S3052]]more indirectly, such as figuring out what exactly was said in the room with the Russian Foreign Minister and Ambassador, but all of it is clearly within what the Constitution requires and the Founding Fathers wanted Congress to be. So the congressional committees have really an obligation to our democracy to continue their role.                               Healthcare  Mr.President, on another matter--healthcare. Today, the Trump administration delayed for another 90 days their decision on whether to defend the administration's position in a lawsuit filed by the House Republicans about the cost-sharing payments in the Affordable Care It is a decision that greatly increases the uncertainty in our healthcare system.  The cost-sharing program keeps healthcare costs low for working Americans and helps insurers stay in the marketplace, giving Americans more choices. It keeps the average person's premiums down, keeps their deductibles low. It makes it a lot easier for many working Americans to afford healthcare. That was its purpose, and it is succeeding in its purpose, but by continuing to sow uncertainty about this program, both by refusing to defend the lawsuit and by making outright threats to end it, the Trump administration has already caused insurers to flee the marketplace or propose rate increases for the next year. Let me repeat. Right now, the Trump administration's actions are sowing great uncertainty that causes insurers to pull out of States and increase their costs, making it more likely that working Americans won't be able to afford coverage next year.  A spokesperson for America's Health Insurance Plans, AHIP, the industry's main trade group, said the following, and this is their quote, not mine:       We need swift action and long-term certainty on [the cost-     sharing program]. It is the single most destabilizing factor      in the individual market, and millions of Americans could      soon feel the impact of fewer choices, higher costs and      reduced access to care.  The insurance industry itself is saying that the 1 thing that could be done to keep costs down, to keep other insurers in the marketplace, is to make permanent cost sharing.  President Trump's attempt to blame what is happening on ObamaCare is totally contradicted by what the health insurance plans say when it comes to cost sharing. So refusing to guarantee the cost-sharing payments is sabotage, plain and simple, and the Trump administration knows it.  The administration made the last cost-sharing payment but refuses to say they will continue to make them permanently. They know they will get blamed for the chaos that would ensue should they end these payments. They are afraid to do that. But they also want to threaten the stability of the healthcare system in order to get Democrats to work with them on their healthcare bill. So what they tried to do is have their cake and eat it too. They said: We are going to delay the lawsuit, but we are still going to have that uncertainty that hurts Americans out there. That is profoundly irresponsible.  Threatening to defund healthcare in order to win political leverage is hostage-taking at its very worst because it holds hostage millions of innocent Americans who very much need healthcare costs to be lower and affordable. It is already causing massive uncertainty. It will only get worse if the administration continues to kick the can down the road 3 months at a time.  There is one very simple solution: Instead of delaying the decision every 3 months, the White House ought to step up to the plate and say once and for all that they will make those payments permanently--payments which help millions of Americans pay less for their healthcare, payments which the insurance industry itself says would help stabilize markets and help people gain healthcare.                         The President's Budget  Next, Mr.President, on the budget, the President of the United States will release his budget for 2018 this week. It could come as early as tomorrow. All indications are that it will be similar to his skinny budget from earlier this year. I want to remind everyone here in the Senate what a disaster that budget would be if it were ever implemented by  The President told the American people he would help create jobs and provide greater economic security for families. This budget does exactly the opposite. It is not a jobs budget. It is not an economic security budget. It is a budget that takes a meat cleaver to the middle class by gutting programs that help them the most, including many that create jobs and power the economy. Transportation is cut. Education is cut. Programs that promote scientific and medical research are cut. Programs that protect clean air and clean water are cut. All of these programs are favored by the American people. They have been favored by a vast majority of my Republican friends across the aisle. But the President's budget is an outlier, way out there. It fits with Mr.Mulvaney's beliefs, but he was an outlier in the Congress when he called for the government to be shut down and when he wanted to have the government play so little a role in helping the middle class. That is harmful to  Here is another one that really is worrisome: Recent reports say that the President's budget will target Medicaid for significant cuts--as large or larger than the $880 billion the House Republicans would cut in their TrumpCare bill. This would pull the rug out from so many Americans who need help--those suffering from opioid and heroin addiction, people in nursing homes and their families who care for them, the elderly, the disabled, and children.  Medicaid has become a middle-class program. Opioid addiction. What about a 40- or 50-year-old couple who is trying to raise their kids, saving for college, and has a parent who needs to be in a nursing home. Right now, Medicaid pays for it. What are they going to do when that is cut? They have two choices: Shell a huge amount of money out of their own pockets, which they can't afford, or maybe bring mom or dad back home, where there may be no room for them. What a horrible choice. What a horrible choice. Well, that is what the President is proposing to do when he dramatically slashes  I will repeat. Medicaid helps the very poor, but it also helps the middle class, and the majority of its money now seems to go to the middle class. I believe something like 60 percent goes to nursing homes or some high percentage like that.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that a cut to Medicaid of this size would deprive roughly 10 million Americans of Medicaid benefits over the next decade. Medicaid has always benefited the poor, and that is a good thing, but I remind my colleagues that it has increasingly become a middle-class program. Here is where it goes: Medicaid provides benefits for 60 percent of Americans in nursing homes.  Listen to this, Mr.President and my colleagues: Medicaid helps 1.75 million veterans--1 in 10. It provides services for Americans struggling with opioid addiction, which is a problem that affects so many.  If the reporting is accurate, these cuts to Medicaid that are in the President's budget carry a staggering human cost. Once again, Donald Trump is breaking his promise to the working people of  We have seen promise after promise broken as if they did not even matter. What he said in the campaign and what he governs as has almost no overlap in so many areas. Here is what Candidate Trump said when he campaigned: ``I'm not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican and I'm not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid.'' He promised he would help take care of those suffering from opioid addiction. If he cuts Medicaid, he is breaking that promise--boom--right in half.  Candidate Trump campaigned as a populist and said he wanted to help the working people, but since he has taken office, he has governed like a hard-right conservative, pushing policies that help the uber-wealthy at the expense of the middle class. TrumpCare and the budget the President will be proposing tomorrow says one thing and does another.  Many of my Republican friends come from States that have significantly expanded their Medicaid Programs over the past few years, insuring hundreds of thousands, sometimes millions of their constituents.  Based on what we know about this budget, the good news--the only good news--is that it is likely to be roundly rejected by Members of both parties[[Page S3053]]here in the Senate, just as the last budget was. Democrats and Republicans, on the 2017 budget, virtually ignored the President and his proposal. We got together, and we compromised. Not everyone got everything they wanted, but we produced a budget that America can be proud of and one that helps the middle class.  We have shown Democrats and Republicans, the House and Senate, can come together to compromise on appropriations in 2017. We should follow that same blueprint in 2018. We should ignore the President's budget which would devastate the middle class and instead work across the aisle to advance reasonable compromise legislation later this year.

8869,topic-id,817,"Finally, Mr.President, on the issue of trade, according to reports, the Trump administration is preparing an open investigation into China's trade practices, focusing on economic espionage and the theft of intellectual property.  I certainly applaud the sentiment. I have been decrying for years how the Chinese have been taking advantage of us in a way that has sent trillions of dollars of American wealth to China and millions of jobs to China so we should certainly go after them. The problem is, we don't need another investigation to know what China is up to. That is what the President called for: Let's investigate--another investigation.  It is clear what China is up to. By dumping counterfeit and artificially cheap goods into our markets, denying U.companies fair access to its markets, and relentlessly stealing and exporting intellectual property of U.companies, China, as I said, has robbed the U.economy of trillions of dollars and caused the loss of millions of good-paying U.jobs.  Estimates by our own government--already made estimates; we don't need a study, President Trump--pin the cost of cyber espionage alone at $400 billion a year to the U.economy--$400 billion a year, and 90 percent of it comes from China's This is not a benign process. This is not some rogue company. This is the Chinese  Here is what our four-star general, Keith Alexander, the former Director of the National Security Agency and commander of the U.Cyber Command said. He called the loss of industrial information and IP through cyber theft ``the greatest transfer of wealth in history''--the greatest transfer of wealth in history.  That pains me--this country, with its entrepreneurial vigor, with its acceptance of people from all corners of the globe for centuries to go work hard and create good things, China is stealing it. They are not doing it on their own. Every American, when they hear that statement, it should make them cringe. It makes me cringe almost every day.  Those are the facts. So I would say to President Trump: We don't need another study that takes months and months to complete while no action is taken. We need a plan of action now.  Unfortunately, this is what the Trump administration is doing on all issues of trade. They really talked tough on the issue of steel and aluminum dumping. As someone who has aluminum plants in the State up there in Massena--Alcoa--and all along Lake Ontario--what used to be called Alcan is now called Novelis--I know the issue of aluminum dumping. It hurts jobs in my The President early on talked tough, tweeted tough on illegal steel dumping, illegal aluminum dumping, but it is 7 months into this administration, and we are still reviewing its effects on our economy.  The administration failed to secure any deal with China in a number of forums, and they continue to delay on action that was promised in Tough talk and tweets are cheap, but strong and decisive action on trade is[[Page S4700]]required. American workers have waited too long for our country to crack down on abusive trade practices that rob our country of millions of good-paying jobs.  Today, I am proud to announce that the Democratic Party will be laying out our new policy on trade, which includes, among other things, an independent trade prosecutor to combat trade cheating, not one of these endless WTO processes that China takes advantage of over and over again; a new American jobs security council that will be able to review and stop foreign acquisitions of U.companies if they are likely to have a detrimental effect on U.jobs; penalties for Federal contractors that outsource jobs; stronger ``Buy American'' rules; and an outsourcing tax on companies that leave the United  On the issue of NAFTA negotiations, we are laying out a set of tough principles that must be a bottom line for any new NAFTA text. I voted against NAFTA in 1994. That was 23 years ago. We have seen how it has hurt us in so many ways. There have been some benefits, but overall the loss of jobs is painful. More jobs and higher wages have to be our guiding principle, and it needs full transparency with workers and the public at the table, not just corporations.  So I hope the administration--and I always said when I heard Donald Trump campaign that my views on trade are probably closer--I am closer to his views than I was to either President Obama's or President Bush's. I hope he will listen to us and work with us. These are good things to do. We can do them quickly. We can save jobs, create good-paying jobs. But I say to the President: We don't need another investigation, another study that languishes for months and maybe even years. We need strong, bold action on trade, and Democrats will offer those strong bold ideas later this morning.  Thank you.

8845,topic-id,954,"Mr.President, it has been said that nothing is certain but death and taxes. To that, nowadays, we might add bad news about ObamaCare because if there is one thing we can count on, it is bad news about this fatally flawed law--high premium costs, huge deductibles, customers losing health plans, customers losing doctors, fewer choices, failed co-ops, unraveling exchanges, and I could go on.  There is no question that our healthcare system had problems before ObamaCare was passed. Clearly reforms were needed. But as the past 7 years have made clear, ObamaCare was not the answer, and this law is rapidly collapsing under its own weight.  Here is a sampling of recent ObamaCare headlines.  This is from Bloomberg: ``Thousands of ObamaCare Customers Left Without Options as Insurers Bolt.''  This is from CNBC: ``Aetna will exit ObamaCare markets in Virginia in 2018, citing expected losses on individual plans this year.''  From the Arizona Republic: ``Consumers seek relief as `ObamaCare' rates rise.''  From USA TODAY: ``Iowa may be without individual health plans if insurer pulls out.''  In February of this year, Mark Bertolini, the CEO of health insurance company Aetna, asserted that ObamaCare is in a death spiral. There is good reason to think he is right in that significant losses are driving health insurers out of the exchanges. Last year, Aetna announced that it would withdraw from 11 of the 15 States in which it offered exchange plans, Humana said it would exit several exchanges, and mega-insurer UnitedHealthcare announced that it was pulling out of most of the 34 States in which it offered exchange plans.  Roughly one-third of U.counties have just one choice of health insurer on their exchanges for 2017, and the situation looks likely to get much worse next year. In February, health insurer Humana announced its decision to completely withdraw from the ObamaCare exchanges for 2018. Aetna is pulling out of two of the four States in which it will still offer plans in 2018, and it has indicated it may pull back even further. Wellmark is leaving UnitedHealthcare is leaving Other insurers are contemplating similar exits.  The New York Times reported in March that ``ObamaCare Choices Could Go from One to Zero in Some Areas.''  ``Parts of the country,'' the Times notes, ``are in jeopardy of not having an insurer offering ObamaCare plans next year.'' The quote goes on: ``Many counties already have just one insurer offering health plans in the ObamaCare marketplaces, and some of those solo insurers are showing signs that they are eyeing the exits.'' That is from the New York  What that means is that tens of thousands of Americans may have ObamaCare subsidies next year without insurance plans to spend them on. As my colleague Senator Alexander, who does so much good work on healthcare as the chairman of the HELP Committee, has said, it is like having a bus ticket in a town with no buses running.  While Americans' health insurance options dwindle, their premiums are rising. Midlevel ObamaCare plans saw an average 25 percent premium increase for 2017--a 25-percent increase for just 1 year, which is on top of years of premium increases under And what are Americans with those plans paying for? The odds are good that they are paying for plans with limited choices of doctors and hospitals. A 2016 study of 18 States and Washington, DC, found that 75 percent of their exchange plans for 2017 would likely be health maintenance organizations or exclusive provider organizations--two types of plans that tend to offer narrow provider networks.  In his joint address to Congress at the end of February, the President said of ObamaCare: ``Action is not a choice--it is a necessity.'' He is exactly right. ObamaCare is collapsing, and the status quo is not sustainable. Unless we want millions of Americans to face healthcare disaster, we have to repeal and replace this law.  Last week, the House passed an ObamaCare repeal and replacement bill. This legislation repeals ObamaCare's tax increases, penalties, and mandates and starts the process of restoring control of healthcare to States and individuals.  The House has made a good start, and I am looking forward to getting to build on their bill here in the I want to make sure we amend the House tax credit to ensure that assistance is better targeted to those who need it the most. I am looking forward to working with my colleagues--Chairman Alexander, Chairman Hatch on the Finance Committee, Policy Committee Chairman Barrasso, and many others--to make sure we have a bill that will provide the American people with real relief.  ObamaCare was founded on the premise that government knows best when it comes to individuals' healthcare and that a one-size-fits-all solution is somehow the best solution, but we know now that is not the case. Individuals know best, and their doctors know best. Government does not know best. It is absurd to think that a massive Federal bureaucracy can hand down one comprehensive solution that will somehow meet the needs of hundreds of millions of individuals in this country. We need to move control from Washington and give it back to the States so they can embrace healthcare innovations and solutions that work for the individuals and the particular needs in their  Republicans are working to implement the kind of healthcare reform the American people are looking for--more affordable, more personal, more flexible, and less bureaucratic.

8982,topic-id,367,"Mr.Speaker, today I rise to honor former Congressman Ray Kogovsek, a dear friend who represented the Third Congressional District of Colorado before me. I ask that you keep him in your thoughts and prayers as he now faces a challenge far greater than any political race.  Ray is a native of Pueblo, Colorado, and but for his college years and his tenure here from 1979 to 1985, he never left his hometown and never wanted to. His commitment to his community spread to encompass the entire Third District, which he came to serve after 10 years in the Colorado Legislature where I first met him.  Ray won election to Congress in 1978 by 364 votes. In 1980, he faced the same challenger in a Reagan landslide year. He won by 22,000 votes. And in 1982, after redistricting changed half of his district, he handily won again. Ray won because of who Ray is. He is a man of gentle wisdom, wisdom about people, a man with a gut instinct to know what is right, a genuine man, a man who knows no anger.  His achievements in his short time here in Congress were many. From a vast wilderness bill painstakingly built through his outreach and development of a coalition of broad support, to funding to widen a beautiful highway through Glenwood Canyon to make it safer for road travel, to resolving a decades-old boundary dispute for the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, and his work on behalf of the Third District continued after he chose to leave  He is known for his work on Western water issues and was awarded the prestigious Wayne Aspinall Award by the Colorado Water Congress, an award named after another Colorado congressman who served as chairman of the House Interior  But I have a sense that what Ray values most about his career in public service, about his advocacy for his district and for the West, are his friendships, the friendships that he found and nurtured here in these halls and beyond.  I want to thank Ray Kogovsek on behalf of the House of Representatives and the Third District and wish him and his family comfort and strength during this difficult time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-27-pt1-PgH2902-2.txt,1997,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,27.0,July
8906,topic-id,297,"Mr.Speaker, yesterday, the CEO of United Airlines, Oscar Munoz, apologized to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for his company having dragged a passenger off of one of their aircraft. Mr.Munoz highlighted the policy changes the airline has made since the wake of the incident.  Mr.Speaker, I believe that Congress should hold the airlines accountable and ensure that the events like what happened to Dao are prevented.  When United Airlines had Dao forcibly removed on April 9, the airline more than just created a disruption for him and other passengers; it sparked a national outrage. Dao was bumped from his flight by a crew member of United in line with the then-airline's policies that crews could book seats on United flights until flights departed.  An airline's lack of preparation for its own staff's travel should not result in the disruption of the lives of its paying customers. Now crew members of United are required to make must-ride bookings at least 1 hour prior to departure, and they are not able to displace customers who are already on board.  However, today, I believe that we need to go further. This still has travelers at risk. So today, I am introducing the Hands Off Passengers Act or the HOP This bill requires the Secretary of Transportation to modify a regulation regarding the involuntary deplaning or the denial of boarding of a flight by any passenger on an oversold flight merely to accommodate a member of the airline flight crew or staff. In other words, it prevents an airline from bumping ticketed passengers of an overbooked flight merely for the travel of one of the airline's crews.  Airlines should be better prepared on the movement of their crew to avoid the disruption of the lives of paying customers.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-03-pt1-PgH3073.txt,1741,THE AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT,2017.0,3.0,July
8914,topic-id,488,"Mr.Speaker, let me take this opportunity to thank the ranking member for yielding me time.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.1219, the Supporting America's Innovators Act of 2017, which I am proud to cosponsor with Mr. Throughout my career here in Congress, I have always supported and encouraged legislation that creates jobs and fosters innovation for America's entrepreneurs and small businesses. The bill we are considering today will further that goal.  Mr.Speaker, I always say access to capital is access to opportunity. That is exactly what this legislation does.  The Investment Company Act of 1940 currently limits the number of accredited investors in a venture fund to no more than 100 individuals, but most funds try not to reach that limit in order to adjust for unforeseen circumstances. This artificially low limit restricts the number of individuals that can invest in small businesses and startups. That means less opportunity for entrepreneurs.  Our bill will address this problem by allowing up to 250 accredited investors to participate in venture funds with up to $10 million in capital.                              {time}  0930  It is important to stress that these are accredited investors. They have at least $200,000 in minimum income or $1 million in net assets. These are sophisticated investors comfortable with the risks involved in the startup sector.  Many of these investors pool their money together either in local or national groups. More recently, many have gotten involved in online crowdfunding platforms, which were created through the JOBS Act, to funnel more capital to small businesses and startups.[[Page H2761]]  Our bill will create greater access for women-owned and women-led businesses. The types of funds empowered to attract more investors under this bill are often a good capital source for women-owned firms.  I am proud that our bipartisan legislation has garnered a wide range of attention and support from the industry. The Angel Capital Association and the Internet Association have endorsed the bill. These are groups dedicated to expanding capital opportunities for small businesses.  This bill has also moved through the legislative process with strong bipartisan support every step of the way. Last month, we passed this bill out of the Financial Services Committee with a broad bipartisan vote of 54-2. The same day, the Senate Banking Committee was busy passing its bipartisan companion version, 444, sponsored by Senators Heitkamp and It is also important to recognize that, last year, this Chamber passed a nearly identical version of our bill by a vote of 388-9.  It is time to see this legislation enacted. It will create more capital for small businesses and it will mean more jobs throughout the  Let me take a moment to thank Mr.McHenry for working with me on this bill, as well as Chairman And let me also thank Ranking Member Waters for her leadership and hard work.

8902,topic-id,1020,"Mr.President, today I wish to pay tribute and offer my deep appreciation to Randy Bookout for his many years of dedicated service as a professional staff member on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Randy joined the committee staff in October 1999 and served in various capacities, most recently as the committee's budget monitor for the Central Intelligence Agency, During his almost 18 years with the committee, Randy established a solid reputation of fairness and professionalism that was widely respected by members and staff, regardless of party, and officials within intelligence community elements over which he conducted oversight.  Randall Bookout joined the committee after serving a 28-year career with the Army, retiring as a colonel in the infantry. His distinguished Army career included assignments as a company commander in Korea and Panama and as an infantry battalion commander in He served as a staff officer in the Office of the Army Chief of Staff and later as the senior military aide to Secretary of the Army Togo West, His last duty in the Army was as the Army's Chief of Legislative Liaison for the Senate from 1995-1999. Randy graduated with a bachelor of science degree from the U.Military Academy at West Point and a master's degree in business administration from the University of Northern He attended the Army's War College at Carlisle Barracks, PA, as well as airborne and Ranger training.  Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, who often traveled with Colonel Bookout when he served as the Army chief liaison for the Senate, was chairman of the SSCI in 1999 and asked Randy to interview for a nonpartisan staff job on the committee. Randy retired from the Army on a Friday and began work at SSCI the following As often was the case, Randy took to the challenge of this new role with a deep commitment, including long hours of study to learn an entire new encyclopedia of acronyms from the ones he knew after 28 years in the  Much of Randy's work for the committee must remain unspoken. I will simply say here that he has made significant contributions to this country's national security and to the operations and activities of the CIA and the rest of the intelligence community. He knew the Agency in detail, seriously challenged it at times, and fiercely defended it at others. He forced changes that improved its operations, while at all times respecting its mission and, most importantly, respecting the women and men who worked there.  In fact, one of Randy's greatest traits and admirable qualities is that he cared not only for the organization, but genuinely cared about the individuals. His job was to focus on big programs, run by hundreds if not thousands of people, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and affecting the lives of countless others. He did that oversight job exceptionally well. He also saw and noticed each person who was a part of these big operations. Randy did what he could to help them perform their mission and to help them in their personal lives when something was amiss. For example, he helped a woman who served admirably for both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the CIA, who unjustly lost her American citizenship. Randy helped get her legal resident status back. He helped an intelligence official, who left government service due to health problems incurred in a war zone, get the retirement ceremony he rightly deserved and was important to him and his family. After every trip he took for the committee, he left a trail of handwritten thank you notes that traced his path. He not only never forgot the little guy, Randy knew their name.  In the committee office, Randy always represents the highest standard of professionalism and collegiality. He always took the time to mentor young staffers, was willing to share his knowledge on programs or activities, and has never shied away from a request for assistance from a colleague. A fellow staff noted that Randy ``treats colleagues, superiors and the most junior staff member with respect and encouragement. He treats the intelligence officials with whom we interact in the same manner. So many times I've seen him engage with junior officers in challenging and remote settings at odd hours of the night, and his interest and enthusiasm for their work leaves them invigorated and inspired to do their work.''  Staff have shared many interesting stories and traits about He is generally the first to arrive in the office, around 5 to 6 a.m. For his 60th birthday, he ran an Iron Man triathlon. Colleagues talked about his love of travel, strange penchant for weird hats, participation in a Tough Mudder, and the particularly interesting fact that he and his family were chosen to be on the ``Family Feud'' TV show. They won. Staff also have noted his constant positive demeanor, even when addressing difficult and challenging issues, but, foremost, they noted his commitment to and pride in his family.  After 46 years of serving his Nation, Randy will retire next week to the[[Page S3094]]great State of North Carolina with his wife of 44 years, Cindi He talks proudly and lovingly of her and their two children. Their son, LTC Josh Bookout, graduated from West Point and is currently serving his third tour in Afghanistan as a battalion commander. Their daughter, Whitney Corey, achieved a master's degree in psychology and is currently in San Retirement will give Randy and Cindi well-deserved time to be grandparents to their six wonderful grandchildren: Cade, Brock, Colt, Ali, Chloe, and  Let me close by again noting that Randy's commitment to his mission, his colleagues, his family, and his country is unquestioned. I want to thank him for his energy, his intellect, his passion, and his efforts on my behalf and on behalf of the committee. I am certain that I can on the Senate floor here today also express the appreciation of the six chairmen and vice chairmen of the committee, all of whom Randy served, for his service and share our collective wish for great joy and happiness in the next stage of his life.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-23-pt1-PgS3093-2.txt,1897,FEDERAL REGISTER PRINTING SAVINGS ACT OF 2017,2017.0,23.0,July

There is not one. There is not a man or woman in this institution who doesn't understand that balancing budgets is going to mean hard decisions, and so it is absolutely the right place for the dialog about what those hard decisions should be.  But let us not be confused for one moment. There is no pathway to balance that isn't hard. Borrowing from your children and your grandchildren to pay for what you want today is always going to be easier, Mr.Speaker, than paying for it yourself. We are going to have to have that conversation.  I agree with my friend from We do not work for the President of the United States in this institution. If anything, he works for us.  I sit on the House Budget Committee, Mr.Speaker, and I promise you, we are promulgating our own House budget, a work product that is going to make this institution proud. I am particularly pleased to be working with Budget Committee Chairwoman Diane Black on that budget, even as we speak.                              {time}  1300  Mr.Speaker, it will balance by making commonsense changes to Federal programs, one of which is included in this bill here today.  Take the EPA, for example. Mr.Speaker, I encourage you, if you have not read the comments of our new EPA Administrator, to get into those because what he would tell you, which is absolutely true, is that we have Superfund sites in this country that are so polluted they cannot be utilized for other purposes.  They have been on the Superfund list for decades through Republican Presidents and through Democratic They have been sitting on that list. There is no plan to clean them up, no plan to make a difference in those communities, and no plan to serve those constituencies. That is wrong.  Instead of spending its time and resources making a difference for families, making a difference for the environment, what is the EPA having to do?  Respond to court cases that tell it to treat the reasonable and labeled application of pesticides; not as spraying pesticides in your field, but as if you were operating a factory and just having as an effluent, pesticide flowing out of your factory. That is just nonsense.  The reason we produced pesticides is to spray it in fields. We do not need an effluent discharge permit as if we are running a factory, pumping it into our streams. We are not. We are spraying it on our plants to do what?  Address the food needs of this  My friend from Massachusetts is absolutely right when he talks about hunger in this Nation, Mr.He is absolutely right. I dare say that there is not a community in this country that is not affected by hunger. But the biggest advocate we have in the fight against hunger is the American farmer, Mr. There is nobody in the world who does it better; there is nobody in the world who produces it cheaper; there is nobody in the world that has the capability of producing the food to go on the grocery store shelves in America except the American farmer. And these pesticides and herbicides make a difference in getting that food out of the field and onto those store shelves.  We want to do it with strict EPA regulation. That is what is lost in this debate. There is not one Member of this body that wants to repeal EPA regulation. We want to keep that EPA regulation. It is called FIFRA, that regulation that pesticides are regulated under. No one wants to change that at all.  All folks want to do is say: Wait a minute, this is not a factory discharge issue. This is a pesticide issue.  My friend from Massachusetts is absolutely right. I sit on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Mr.We did not have a hearing or a markup on this bill, and it was absolutely referred to our committee.  Why, Mr.Speaker?  It was referred to our committee because we have jurisdiction over the Clean Water Act, but this has never been a Clean Water Act issue, except the courts tried to make it one. This has never been a Clean Water Act issue, except the litigants tried to make it one. So when we tried to fix the problem, we didn't waste a moment in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee dealing with the Clean Water Act because this has never been a Clean Water Act issue. It is an ag issue, which is why it went through my friend of Massachusetts' Agriculture  Mr.Speaker, I don't begrudge anyone the job that they have to do in this institution. We have different constituencies. They ask different things of us.[[Page H4438]]We all have to come and do our work. But I will tell you what, Mr.Speaker, everything doesn't have to be an us-against-them battle. Sometimes it is just about us. Sometimes there is more that unites this country than divides this country, and that is okay. Sometimes we are able to work together on commonsense solutions, and that is okay.  Mr.Speaker, when this bill came to the House under suspension of the rules, again, that process that we use for things that are noncontroversial, my friend from Massachusetts supported it at that time. He supported it because it is good legislation that is going to make a difference for folks back home. It is going to make a difference in combating hunger in every jurisdiction across this  When this bill went through the Agriculture Committee, Mr.Speaker, there were no amendments offered. The Agriculture Committee is composed of Republicans and It is a place where discussion takes place. It was the markup of this bill, which is when you go and try to amend it and make it better. Not one amendment was offered from either side.  Why?  Because we have discussed this issue, we have litigated this issue, and we have worked together on this issue, and it is a collaborative work product.  Mr.Will the gentleman yield?

8811,topic-id,275,"I thank my friend. He is absolutely right. When the experts on the Agriculture Committee considered this, when the folks who spend their entire careers on Capitol Hill working on pesticide and pesticide safety considered this, they had absolutely no amendments to offer whatsoever.  When it came to the Rules Committee and the entire House could offer amendments, folks absolutely offered amendments. The Rules Committee, on which the gentleman from Massachusetts and I serve, made two of those amendments in order. We rejected others. You heard my friend's opening statement, Mr.Speaker, that one of the amendments we rejected was to protect pregnant women.  Well, Mr.Speaker, for Pete's sake, I have served with these men and women in here. I have been in this body for 6 years. There is not one Member of this institution who doesn't care about pregnant women. There is not one Member of this institution who doesn't care about children. There is not one Member of this institution who doesn't care. What we do in this institution is care. And when my friend from Massachusetts supported this bill, when he supported this bill, there were no amendments along those lines.  When the gentleman supported this bill without the amendment dealing particularly with pregnant women and children, I don't believe for a moment the gentleman forgot about those pregnant women and children. I don't believe for a moment he decided he was going to punish pregnant women and children. I believe that he thought those protections were inherent in the base text, and he was right when he thought it, and he was right when he supported it.  Mr.Will the gentleman yield?

I guess the question is: If we are all in agreement that we want to protect women and children, what was the harm in making in order an amendment that would have done that?  It was perfectly germane, and the Rules Committee decided not to make it in order. I think that is a question that the gentleman hasn't answered.  I appreciate that all the people on the Agriculture Committee are experts, but you know what?  There are other people who know a lot about science, pesticides, and agriculture who were not on the committee. And just because a committee takes action--I mean, if that is the new rule now: if you are on the committee, you can't offer amendments. Well, that is an unfortunate new approach that the Republicans are taking.  ",CREC-2017-05-23-pt1-PgH4433-4.txt,2008,1230,2017.0,23.0,May
8813,topic-id,1450,"Reclaiming my time, I will tell my friend two things that he already knows. Number one is we do accept amendments from the entire That is the purpose of the Rules Committee being in existence, and we have added two amendments to this bill for consideration.  When the gentleman supported it in the 112th Congress, we considered no other amendments. That is a change this time. We are going to do that. When it passed the last time we did a rule, no one offered any amendments. This is a change from that time. When we passed it in the Agriculture bill, no one offered any amendments. So it is a change this time. We absolutely are opening up the process more and more with every time the House considers this bill.  But I would also tell my friend something that we are going to have to grapple with as an institution, and that is that I don't need a Rules Committee if what we are going to do is make every amendment that comes to this institution in order.  The only reason we have a Rules Committee is to pick and choose. The only reason we have a Rules Committee is to set up a timetable on which we can debate and consider things in a reasonable manner. The only reason we have a Rules Committee is because we are not operating under unanimous consent as our friends in the Senate do, though we absolutely could. And I would refer him to my friend, Daniel Webster, who has some marvelous ideas about how we might do that.  But, Mr.Speaker, I think it is legitimate for folks back home to wonder what is going on in that United States They passed it in a bipartisan way once. They passed it in a bipartisan way twice. They passed it in a bipartisan way three times, and here it is on the floor today, and it is as if the sky is falling and going to open up and swallow everything that is good and decent about this land.  Why is that, Mr.Speaker? Why is that the conversation we are having today instead of the one we had not once, not twice, but three times about how we could use this legislation to improve the lives of citizens across this country?  Perhaps that is just the environment we are in. Perhaps that is just the cards we have been dealt in politics across America today, Mr.Speaker, but we have a chance together as an institution to stand up and say it does not have to be that way. We have a chance together to stand up and say that we can do better than those partisan shenanigans. We can get together on things that are going to make a difference, and the first opportunity you are going to have after this speech, Mr.Speaker, to do that, is in supporting the rule for this bill. The first opportunity we are going to have to do that is in supporting this rule, and then supporting the underlying legislation and sending it back to the Senate one more time. It is the right thing to do, Mr.Speaker, and we have the opportunity to do that together.  Mr.Speaker, I urge strong support for the rule and the underlying bill.  The material previously referred to by Mr.McGovern is as follows:       An Amendment To Be Offered to 348 by Mr.McGovern       At the end of the resolution, add the following new      section:       2. Rule XXI of the Rules of the House of      Representatives is amended by adding at the end the following      new clause: RESTRICTIONS ON CONSIDERATION OF LEGISLATION THAT WOULD BREAK DONALD    TRUMP'S PROMISE NOT TO CUT SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE, OR MEDICAID       13. (a) It shall not be in order to consider a bill, joint      resolution, motion, amendment, amendment between the Houses,      or conference report which includes any provision described      in paragraph (b).''       (b) A provision referred to in paragraph (a) is a provision      which, if enacted into law, would result in any of the      following:       (1) a reduction of guaranteed benefits scheduled under      title II of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.401 et seq.);       (2) an increase in either the early or full retirement age      for the benefits described in paragraph (1);[[Page H4439]]       (3) a privatization of Social Security;       (4) a reduction of guaranteed benefits for individuals      entitled to, or enrolled for, benefits under the Medicare      program under title XVIII of 18 such Act (42 U.S.1395 et      seq.); or       (5) a reduction of benefits or eligibility for individuals      enrolled in, or eligible to receive medical assistance      through, a State Medicaid plan or waiver under title XIX of      such Act (42 U.S.1396 5 et seq.).       (c) It shall not be in order to consider a rule or order      that waives the application of paragraph (a). As disposition      of any point of order under paragraph (a) or this paragraph      (except a point of order against an amendment pursuant to      paragraph (a)), the Chair shall put the question of      consideration with respect to the measure, order, conference      report, or rule as applicable. The question of consideration      shall be debatable for 10 minutes by the Member initiating      the point of order and for 10 minutes by an opponent, but      shall otherwise be decided without intervening motion except      one that the House adjourn.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

8842,topic-id,2711,"Mr.President, it has been a rough day at the office for the Senate Republican healthcare plan, and my take is that it is going to be even tougher over the next few days. There will be a lot of Senate Democrats home, meeting with folks in open meetings. We will see if any Senate Republicans have the courage to do that as well.  Earlier this morning, the whole Senate had its first opportunity to look at this bill in the light of day. The debate that unfolded on the floor made it clear that our colleagues are committed to a partisan scheme to jam this bill through at any cost. There isn't going to be a full debate. There isn't going to be any bipartisan input.  If you read through the fine print in this destructive proposal, as the American people have had the chance to do over the last several hours, it becomes clear why my colleagues on the other side have kept this bill hidden and want to jam it through as quickly as possible.  This proposal is stunning in its sameness to the cruel House bill that the American people have rejected outright--in fact, rejected, according to polls, by really eye-popping numbers. So I want to begin by warning against anybody's buying into the sales job that is inevitably going to unfold in the days ahead. This bill may change, but Senate Republicans will only be putting lipstick on a devastating blow to the healthcare of the American people.  This is a plan to raise costs, slash Medicaid, and cut millions of people off of their healthcare to pay for tax breaks for the fortunate few.  My colleagues on the other side have spent the last month telling every reporter and constituent who would listen that they were throwing out the House bill and they would be starting anew with a fresher and kinder bill. That has turned out to be fiction. Republicans are going to keep telling Americans that they are fixing their healthcare right up until the second it gets taken away.  This bill doubles down on the meanness that even the President described in the bill from the other body. The Senate Republican plan doesn't fix the problems with people's healthcare. It creates a bunch of new ones.  After a day of pouring over this bill--and the Finance Committee Democratic staff has been looking at this in detail--I would like to lay out, as we close up this afternoon, some of the most devastating effects this bill will have.  First, Senate Republicans are so committed to slashing Medicaid that their bill cuts it even deeper than the Today, Medicaid comes with a guarantee to the most vulnerable Americans and their families who walk an economic tightrope every day. Today, if you get sick or suffer an injury, you will get the care you need. The Senate Republican plan ends that guarantee for good. It ends the Medicaid program as our country knows it for good.  People shouldn't be distracted by date changes or sweeteners for people already enrolled. This is a radical plan plucked from the wish list of the far right, and it is cloaked in the complicated language of inflation rates and dollar figures. When you talk about slashing Medicaid by hundreds of billions of dollars, you are not simply talking about the lingo of healthcare policymakers, like bending the cost curve. You are talking about people's lives.  Medicaid helps to pick up the bill for two out of three seniors in America's nursing homes. These are the people who have done everything right. They are our older parents, our grandmothers, our grandfathers. They scrimped, they saved, and they worked hard. But it is pretty clear: It is really expensive to grow old in So Medicaid is there to support them and cover the cost of nursing home care when savings run out.  The Senate Republican plan slashes Medicaid so deeply that States are going to be forced to cut benefits, and the guarantee of nursing home care will be in danger. This is one of the greatest threats seniors have ever faced, and it is being imposed on them by an act of  I don't make that statement lightly. My background is working with the older people of Oregon and our country. I was director of the Oregon Gray Panthers for 7 years and ran the legal aid office for the elderly before I was elected to I will say point-blank, having worked in this field now for more than three decades, that this is an extraordinary threat to the well-being of the Nation's older people, who shouldn't have to worry about winding up living in squalor or on the street.  Families shouldn't have to worry about where they will find the money[[Page S3738]]to cover the cost of a nursing home. That is $90,000 a year--$90,000 a year, on average, for nursing home care. Independence, safety, and a reasonably comfortable old age should not become a privilege reserved just for the wealthy in our country.  Second, the age tax in the Senate Republican bill is going to hit older Americans between 55 and 64 like a wrecking ball. They are going to be forced to pay several times as much as a younger person for health insurance. You are going to see older people desperately hoping and praying that they can hold on to their health until they make it to 65 and enroll in I would like to hear somebody try to explain what healthcare problem that is fixing or why it is a good approach to healthcare policy.  Third, Senate Republicans have now cooked up a scheme to decimate the value of middle-class tax cuts for healthcare and send deductibles into the stratosphere. Here is how that is going to work. A whole lot of families in the middle class are going to lose their tax benefits outright.  As the ranking member on the Senate Finance Committee that has jurisdiction over tax policy, I have seen that. Then, as if that is not enough harm, this plan cheapens the value of the tax benefits that were created under the Affordable Care It is a scheme to force people into bargain basement insurance plans with sky-high deductibles. It also risks kicking off a death spiral in States where the private insurance markets are stable and competitive today.  Fourth, Republicans have twisted a part of the Affordable Care Act I wrote to promote State innovation, and they are using it to give insurance companies the power to run roughshod over individual What we are talking about here is what are called section 1332 waivers. What was done in 2009, in the Senate Finance Committee--it came out of my original bipartisan bill, the Healthy Americans Act--we told States that the Affordable Care Act was going to set a new bar for insurance in terms of coverage and affordability. We said to the States--the laboratories of democracy--if you believe you can do even better, you can get a waiver so you can go test an innovative, new approach. We did build in protections, basic protections, so people would get decent coverage, and their lives would be protected.  The Republican plan wipes those protections out, wipes out the consumer protections. It tells States: If you want to do worse, go right ahead. In fact, the Senate Republican plan offers States a bribe to end basic health protections and lower the bar for insurance. You will see insurance companies given a green light to cut essential benefits out of the plans they sell on the open market.  For example, take maternity care. The Affordable Care Act banned the practice of price-gouging women just because of their gender, but the Republican plan takes the side of the big insurance companies in this debate.  On a fundamental level, this plan says that health insurance in America ought to be based on what men need and what women need ought to cost extra. Services like maternity care would be an add-on item, and that means women are going to face higher costs just because they are women.  Fifth, this proposal attacks Planned Parenthood and deprives hundreds of thousands of women of the right to see the doctor of their choosing.  I want to come back to what that really means. Women in America ought to be able to see the doctor of their choice, the doctor they trust, the doctor, in their own judgment, is the best doctor for them. This provision keeps them from doing that. Never mind that there is already an air-tight ban on taxpayer dollars funding abortions. Never mind that Planned Parenthood doesn't get a single dime of Federal funding above what is available to other Medicaid providers. Never mind that Planned Parenthood is where millions of women get routine medical care from doctors they know and trust--services such as basic checkups, cancer screenings, preventive care, HIV tests. The Senate Republican bill continues this ideological crusade against Planned Parenthood, and it is going to cost women across this country the right that I see as so fundamental--the right of women to be able to choose to go to the doctor they trust.  Sixth, at a time when the opioid epidemic is ripping apart communities from one corner of this Nation to another, this bill would be a devastating setback in the fight against opioid abuse. No community has been spared from this crisis, and I would wager that virtually every Senator has come to the floor at some point and spoken about the impact it has had on their  By the way, it would be hard to forget the parade of Presidential candidates in 2015 and 2016 that went through State after State claiming they had the very best plan to end the opioid crisis, but now the Senate Republican healthcare bill makes the crisis worse.  Medicaid is the only lifeline that thousands and thousands of people across America have in their struggle to try to put their lives back together after falling victim to opioids. For thousands and thousands of people, over the last few years, the treatment they have gotten through Medicaid has been their escape, their path out of a downward spiral that too often leads to heroin abuse and overdose deaths. The Republican plan takes this lifeline away.  Some on the other side have proposed creating a separate pool of money, a separate slush fund to replace the loss of treatment through In my view, this is a very serious mistake because it is based on a complete misunderstanding of the opioid crisis, and it is not going to work.  The opioid epidemic is a public health crisis, and fighting it means making sure people can get the healthcare they need. That means treating substance abuse disorders the same way you treat other diseases. Our country doesn't pay for heart surgery through grant programs. We don't pay for chemotherapy through congressional appropriations. If you are sick and you have healthcare coverage, you get the care you need. Anything less when it comes to opioid addiction treatment is going to fail.  Finally, when you listen to that parade of horribles--all the harm this bill is going to do to generations of Americans across the country--you have to wonder why my colleagues on the other side would push this bill forward.  People have been asking me this all day. There is a simple answer for it. This bill takes healthcare away from millions of Americans and raises costs for millions more for one reason--to give tax breaks to the fortunate few in This isn't a debate about two competing visions of healthcare--one liberal and one conservative. One side in this debate wants to protect Americans' healthcare coverage, make sure they can go to the doctors they trust and afford the medical care they need. The other side in this debate has a plan to take away healthcare coverage and raise the cost of care for the vulnerable, the middle class, families struggling to get by--all to pay for tax breaks for the wealthiest few. This is an out-and-out attack on millions of Americans' health and well-being.  In the debate that played out on the Senate floor this morning, it was suggested several times that Democrats turned down a chance to participate in the process. This is completely, entirely 100 percent false.  I am the ranking member of the committee that is responsible for healthcare. I have not once been asked by a single Republican to work on this bill or discuss fixes to the Affordable Care I was stunned this morning when I heard the Democrats had been given an offer to work on these fixes; that Democrats aren't interested in being bipartisan.  I have made the center of my time in public service working in a bipartisan way on healthcare. I have written healthcare legislation that has been signed into law that has been bipartisan. It was based on principles that both sides of the aisle could agree on. Certainly, if there had been any interest in a process that would actually give both sides the opportunity to do the kind of give-and-take that you do with a bill--not through this partisan ``my way or the highway'' reconciliation--I would have been very interested in it, and I know Senate Finance Democrats would have been very interested in it. That wasn't on offer. The claim the Democrats have refused to[[Page S3739]]work in a bipartisan way is fiction, a gross fiction.  It is clear now that the only way to bring this partisan process to a halt is for Americans to stand up and speak out. I am going to close with two points. Ever since those Gray Panther days, I have always thought healthcare was the most important issue because if Americans and their loved ones don't have their health, then pretty much everything goes by the board. You can't go to the game. You can't spend time with family. It is hard to do much of anything.  It is very clear that healthcare, as a result of this proposal for millions of Americans and for our country, is going to be at risk. What is at risk is the prospect that the Senate will turn back the clock to the days when healthcare was basically for the healthy and wealthy. We shouldn't go there.  In the past, Democrats and Republicans have agreed we shouldn't go there. With the bill I wrote--seven Democratic Senators, seven Republican Senators--that was the centerpiece of it. By the way, several Senate Republicans who are here in this body were cosponsors of that legislation. We shouldn't go back to those days when healthcare was basically for the healthy and wealthy.  For all those who are paying attention to these proceedings, my view is, the only way you are going to end a partisan process and make policy the way it ought to be made is not through something Washington lingo calls reconciliation--it is just partisan--but through the give-and-take of Democrats and Republicans finding good ideas that the other side can agree on. The only way we are going to do that is for Americans to stand up and speak out.  Political change does not start in government buildings and then trickle down to the people. It is not trickle-down. It is almost always bottom-up, starting from communities where we are going to hear people speaking out over the next few days.  I am going to close by way of saying that over the next few days, this is one of the most important times for Americans to make their voices heard. As we wrap up the first day of actually seeing what the draft Republican proposal is all about, I hope Americans will weigh in, that we will see that grassroots juggernaut develop, and we will defeat a partisan plan and set about the task of doing healthcare policy again in a bipartisan way--where you find common ground that is sustainable rather than just a partisan approach, which continues the gridlock and the polarization on an issue that is the most important issue of our time.  I yield the floor. I believe there are no other speakers.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-22-pt1-PgS3737-4.txt,1247,1230,2017.0,22.0,April
