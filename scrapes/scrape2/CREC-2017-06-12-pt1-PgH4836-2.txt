                LITTLE ROCK'S CHI ST. VINCENT INFIRMARY

  (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Little Rock's 
CHI St. Vincent for being named to the 2017 list of 100 Great Hospitals 
in America by Becker's Hospital Review.
  CHI St. Vincent Infirmary's history of excellence in patient care 
dates back to 1888, when it began as a 10-bed charity hospital and the 
first hospital in Little Rock.
  Over the years, to meet increasing demand for patient care, in 
addition to expansion for construction, the hospital has made four 
moves to larger facilities. In 1906, the hospital opened Arkansas' 
first nursing school, the St. Vincent's Infirmary School of Nursing.
  I am proud to have come into this world at St. Vincent, as did our 
two children.
  I would like to thank CHI St. Vincent for continuing its 129-year 
legacy of leadership in patient care centered on service and quality 
care in central Arkansas.
