             RECOGNIZING THE BUCKS COUNTY CHILDREN'S MUSEUM

  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize The Bucks 
County Children's Museum and the impactful programs that they bring to 
our community.
  Located in New Hope, the museum focuses on creating fun for children 
up to 7 years old who enjoy using their imagination. At 9,000 square 
feet, the Children's Museum provides something for every kid. From 
``The Hospital'' exhibit, where kids can put on a lab coat, drive an 
ambulance, and perform an operation, to the ``Town Square,'' where kids 
can go back in time to a ``turn of the century'' general store, or ride 
the Express train. Our kids can take a virtual hot air balloon or grab 
a shovel and dig to find artifacts buried in a ``Digging'' exhibit.
  It is incredibly important that we continue to inspire and educate 
our next generation. I thank the Bucks County Children's Museum for 
what they do to bring wonder and wonderful experiences to the youngest 
citizens of Bucks County.
