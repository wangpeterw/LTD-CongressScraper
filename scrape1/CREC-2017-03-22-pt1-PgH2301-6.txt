 RECOGNIZING FIREFIGHTERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS IN OVERLAND PARK, KANSAS

  (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to shed light on a recent eight-
alarm fire in my district and to thank the firefighters and other first 
responders for making sure that no one was seriously hurt.
  The fire on Monday destroyed an apartment complex and 22 neighboring 
homes. Amazingly though, no one was killed or seriously injured. Three 
firefighters were treated for their injuries while fighting the fire, 
and we wish them a speedy recovery.
  It is a reminder of the risks that our first responders take every 
day, not knowing when they will have to answer the call, placing their 
lives on the line to protect us and our community.
  We pray for the families who are displaced right now, who came home 
from work on Monday to find their homes

gone. We also thank the Christ Lutheran Church and many other community 
organizations and partners that have come together to assist these 
families who have lost so much so unexpectedly.
  Finally, Mr. Speaker, thank you to Overland Park Fire Department 
Chief Bryan Dehner and all of the firefighters in Kansas who came 
together to contain the largest fire in Overland Park history.
