               CELEBRATING MONROE COUNTY DUCKS UNLIMITED

  (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, this past weekend I had the privilege of 
attending the Monroe County Ducks Unlimited annual dinner. More than 
1,000 people came out to the MB&T Expo Center to celebrate our hunting 
and fishing heritage.
  As a lifelong outdoorsman, I have been a proud supporter of 
conservation policies that protect our wetlands and wildlife habitats. 
The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative is a model example of a public-
private partnership that has been invaluable to the health of the Great 
Lakes ecosystem.
  The GLRI has received widespread bipartisan support because of the 
economic and environmental benefits it brings to Lake Erie, the State 
of Michigan, and the entire Great Lakes region. Mr. Speaker, this 
critical initiative is getting results and needs to be preserved.
  I want to thank Monroe County Ducks Unlimited for all of their 
conservation efforts, and I will continue

working to ensure that future generations can enjoy our precious 
natural resources just like we do today.
  Mr. Speaker, in a point of personal privilege, I want to welcome my 
newest granddaughter, Hanna Belle, born less than 2 hours ago in 
Africa. I welcome her to this life, and God bless her.
