                                 PRAYER

  Bishop Joshua K. Lynn, Mastin Lake Church of God of Prophecy, 
Huntsville, Alabama, offered the following prayer:
  Holy Father, You are the almighty, all-knowing creator. We submit to 
Your infinite wisdom.
  On behalf of our Nation and these leaders, we seek Your forgiveness 
for placing other ways higher than Yours. Grant us Your amazing grace 
from our sin as we turn to You. Open the ears of this body, this 
Nation's leaders, and all who call this great land home to hear Your 
voice. Tenderize the soil of our hearts so we may receive Your 
guidance.
  Heal our land of bitterness, hate, and evil against You and one 
another. Grant our Nation a spiritual renewal and awakening.
  Give this Nation and its leaders wisdom today and the days that 
follow. As we follow You, let Your favor be with us.
  Let Your name ring higher than any other name. For it is in Your 
holy, loving, merciful, and gracious name we pray.
  In Jesus' name, amen.
