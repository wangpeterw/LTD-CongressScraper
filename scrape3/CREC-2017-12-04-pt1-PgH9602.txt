                 2017 NATIONAL BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL AWARD

  (Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition 
of Greenville Junior/Senior High School in Greenville, Pennsylvania, 
and Laurel Junior/Senior High School in New Castle, Pennsylvania, which 
were recently honored by the Department of Education as 2017 National 
Blue Ribbon Schools.
  This award, given to only 342 schools in America this year, is based 
on a school's overall academic performance as well as its progress in 
closing achievement gaps among its students.
  In her message of congratulations, Secretary DeVos commended the 
visionaries, innovators, and leaders who are preparing every child for 
a bright future. I am proud to join her in congratulating the teachers 
and administrators of Greenville and Laurel, as well as the families of 
these students, for the love and support they provide.
  Most of all, I want to congratulate the students themselves for a job 
well done. They are truly a credit to Pennsylvania's Third District and 
to our country. It is an honor to represent them in the people's House.
