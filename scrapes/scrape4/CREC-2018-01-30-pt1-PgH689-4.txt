       TAX CUTS BENEFITING MONTANA'S SMALL BUSINESSES AND WORKERS

  (Mr. GIANFORTE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, because of the tax cuts passed by 
congressional Republicans and signed by President Trump, small-business 
owners in Montana are expanding their businesses and giving raises and 
bonuses to their employees.
  An insurance broker in Harlem is giving a pay raise to all of his 
employees and hiring another staff member. A small business in 
Stevensville is giving pay raises to all of their employees, and a 
local grocery store owner in St. Ignatius is giving employees a raise, 
increasing the starting wage, and providing his workers with a bonus.
  The leader on the other side of the aisle may deride these bonuses, 
raises, and investments as crumbs, but they make a real difference to 
the folks I represent back in Montana. I look forward to sharing more 
good news about how the tax cuts congressional Republicans and 
President Trump enacted last year are benefiting Montana.
