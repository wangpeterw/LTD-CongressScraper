                     REMEMBERING CHRISTOPHER FOLEY

  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I wish to begin this afternoon by 
offering condolences to the family and friends of Christopher Foley of 
Louisa County, VA. Mr. Foley was killed last Wednesday when his truck 
collided with an Amtrak train carrying many of my fellow lawmakers to a 
conference in West Virginia. He was just 28 years old. He leaves behind 
his fiancee Adriana and Rylan, their 1-year-old son.
  Our thoughts are with them especially, along with Christopher's 
family, his community, and his colleagues at Time Disposal. They and 
all those who were injured in the accident are in our prayers.
  Our heartfelt thanks are with the first responders who rushed to the 
scene. It is too easy to take for granted

that our brave law enforcement, firefighters, and emergency personnel 
will be there for us on our worst days, forgetting that, for them, 
heroism and service are everyday realities. I would like to recognize 
some of our own colleagues who immediately sprang into action to assist 
the wounded. Senator Cassidy and Congressmen Wenstrup, Burgess, Roe, 
and Bucshon are all doctors by training, as are Senator Cassidy's wife 
Laura and Congressman Bucshon's wife Kathryn. All of them sprang into 
action and rushed to aid the victims, alongside our attending 
physician, Dr. Brian Monahan. Senator Flake and several others also 
hurried to help.
  I thank all of them for their efforts when every moment counted, and 
I am proud to call them colleagues and friends.
