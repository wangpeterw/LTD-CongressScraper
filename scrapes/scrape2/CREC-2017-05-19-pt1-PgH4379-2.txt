                 HONORING DEPUTY MICHAEL SCOTT WILLIAMS

  (Mr. DUNN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of fallen 
Taylor County Sheriff's Deputy Michael Scott Williams.
  On the morning of October 31, 2016, Deputy Williams put on his 
uniform and climbed into his patrol car, heading to the job he loved. 
He was tragically killed in a collision that morning.
  Deputy Williams joined the Taylor County Sheriff's Department in May 
of 2015, and was promoted to officer in charge, serving as his 
sergeant's second in command. He dedicated his life to law enforcement. 
For him, it was not just a job; it was a calling. Friends and family 
described Deputy Williams as a quick study and an experienced lawman 
who loved to make people laugh.
  This week, Deputy Williams was honored at the National Peace 
Officers' Memorial Service in Washington, a fitting reminder that his 
heroism will not be forgotten.
  Please join me in honoring Deputy Michael Scott Williams and all of 
our fallen law enforcement heroes who have made the ultimate sacrifice 
to ensure our safety.
