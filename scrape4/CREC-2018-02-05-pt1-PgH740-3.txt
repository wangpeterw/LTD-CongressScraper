                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Merciful God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  Guide our minds, thoughts, and desires this day. By Your spirit, 
breathe into us a new spirit. Shape this Congress and our world 
according to Your design that we may fulfill Your will.
  Bless the Members of the people's House. Give them attentive hearts 
and open minds, that through the diversity of ideas they might sort out 
what is best for this Nation. May their speech be deliberately free of 
all prejudice, that others might listen wholeheartedly.
  Grant that all dialogue be mutually respectful, surprising even the 
most jaded with the emergence of unity and justice.
  Bless us this day and every day, and may all that is done here be for 
Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
