                   SNAP UPDATE AFTER PATHWAYS HEARING

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, last week the Nutrition 
Subcommittee hosted a hearing on how eligible SNAP participants can 
improve their education and labor force involvement as they aim for 
independence.
  Over the past 2\1/2\ years, the House Agriculture Committee has done 
a comprehensive review of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance 
Program. We have looked at how it is administered and how it can be 
improved. We have also looked at how we can help Americans climb the 
ladder of opportunity and get out of poverty.
  The subcommittee hearing looked at ways to sync employers with work-
capable SNAP participants whose education, skill set, and backgrounds 
match their needs. This comprehensive approach brings together 
resources, funding, data, policies, partnerships, and, perhaps most 
importantly, shared performance measures that continue to allow the 
development, scaling, and sustainability of these pathway programs.
  Stable employment that provides a living wage is essential to helping 
individuals and families rise out of poverty. As chairman of the 
subcommittee, I am committed to exploring ways to couple services with 
employment and education to empower work-capable recipients and help 
them achieve self-reliance.
