  Eternal Spirit, our guide and strength, we need Your guidance. Show

  Today, use the Members of this body to do Your will. Quicken their 
hearts and purify their minds. Broaden their concerns andstrengthen 
their commitments.
  Lord, show them duties left undone. Remind them of promises unkept 
and reveal to them tasks unattended. Lead them, Father,through this 
season of challenge to a deeper experience with You. Then, send them 
from Your presence to be Your instruments ofgood in transforming our 
Nation and world.
  We pray in Your mighty Name. Amen.
