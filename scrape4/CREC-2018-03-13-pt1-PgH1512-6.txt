               HONORING GIRL SCOUTS ON ITS 106TH BIRTHDAY

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
Girl Scouts of the USA as it celebrates its 106th birthday.
  I know firsthand the positive impact that Scouting can have on the 
life of a young person. I have been actively involved with the Boy 
Scouts of America my whole life.
  On March 12, 1912, Juliette Gordon Low founded the first Girl Scout 
troop with just 18 girls. Over a century later, more than 50 million 
American women are Girl Scout alums, and the Girl Scout program reaches 
2.6 million members.
  Girl Scouts helps girls lead in their own lives and communities. It 
also positions them to become tomorrow's leaders in our country and the 
world by encouraging them to dream big and work hard to achieve their 
goals. Girl Scouts is committed to ensuring all girls develop to their 
full potential.
  This week, as we celebrate Girl Scouts' 106th birthday, I applaud the 
Girl Scout councils that serve girls in my community for building 
evermore girls of courage, confidence, and character.
