                            SUE STIVERS DAY

  (Mr. COMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Ms. Sue 
Stivers of Columbia in the First District of Kentucky.
  Heralded as the ``matriarch of Adair County,'' Sue has been an 
outstanding contributor to the livability and prosperity of her 
hometown. Her extensive involvement in working to better her fellow 
citizens' lives through her decades of experience with the Cooperative 
Extension Service is a testament to her steadfast dedication to a life 
of serving others.
  She has not only helped local businesses to thrive during her tenure 
as executive director of the Columbia-Adair County Chamber of Commerce, 
but has also been extensively involved in one of the main components of 
life in Columbia, Kentucky: Lindsey Wilson College.
  An honorary alumnus and a long-time member of the board of trustees, 
Sue has continually pursued means of giving back to her community and, 
as a result of her positions, has had an influence on individuals from 
across the Commonwealth, country, and globe.
  I am honored to recognize Sue for her tireless service as she has 
continually made Columbia and Adair County ``a great place to call 
home.''
