                                S. 1116

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Indian Community Economic 
     Enhancement Act of 2017''.

     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

       Congress finds that--
       (1)(A) to bring industry and economic development to Indian 
     communities, Indian tribes must overcome a number of 
     barriers, including--
       (i) geographical location;
       (ii) lack of infrastructure or capacity;
       (iii) lack of sufficient collateral and capital; and
       (iv) regulatory bureaucracy relating to--
       (I) development; and
       (II) access to services provided by the Federal Government; 
     and
       (B) the barriers described in subparagraph (A) often add to 
     the cost of doing business in Indian communities;
       (2) Indian tribes--
       (A) enact laws and exercise sovereign governmental powers;
       (B) determine policy for the benefit of tribal members; and
       (C) produce goods and services for consumers;
       (3) the Federal Government has--
       (A) an important government-to-government relationship with 
     Indian tribes; and
       (B) a role in facilitating healthy and sustainable tribal 
     economies;
       (4) the input of Indian tribes in developing Federal policy 
     and programs leads to more meaningful and effective measures 
     to assist Indian tribes and Indian entrepreneurs in building 
     tribal economies;
       (5)(A) many components of tribal infrastructure need 
     significant repair or replacement; and
       (B) access to private capital for projects in Indian 
     communities--
       (i) may not be available; or
       (ii) may come at a higher cost than such access for other 
     projects;
       (6)(A) Federal capital improvement programs, such as those 
     that facilitate tax-exempt bond financing and loan 
     guarantees, are tools that help improve or replace crumbling 
     infrastructure;
       (B) lack of parity in treatment of an Indian tribe as a 
     governmental entity under Federal tax and certain other 
     regulatory laws impedes, in part, the ability of Indian 
     tribes to raise capital through issuance of tax exempt debt, 
     invest as an accredited investor, and benefit from other 
     investment incentives accorded to State and local 
     governmental entities; and
       (C) as a result of the disparity in treatment of Indian 
     tribes described in subparagraph (B), investors may avoid 
     financing, or demand a premium to finance, projects in Indian 
     communities, making the projects more costly or inaccessible;
       (7) there are a number of Federal loan guarantee programs 
     available to facilitate financing of business, energy, 
     economic, housing, and community development projects in 
     Indian communities, and those programs may support public-
     private partnerships for infrastructure development, but 
     improvements and support are needed for those programs 
     specific to Indian communities to facilitate more effectively 
     private financing for infrastructure and other urgent 
     development needs; and
       (8)(A) most real property held by Indian tribes is trust or 
     restricted land that essentially cannot be held as 
     collateral; and
       (B) while creative solutions, such as leasehold mortgages, 
     have been developed in response to the problem identified in 
     subparagraph (A), some solutions remain subject to review and 
     approval by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, adding additional 
     costs and delay to tribal projects.
