                     JUDGES THREATEN OUR DEMOCRACY

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, in their coverage of the President, 
the liberal media have given up being objective, and their credibility 
is now at an all-time low.
  Are the courts next?
  When considering the President's written immigration orders, some 
judges are basing their decisions not on the actual text but on what 
was said during the heat of the campaign.
  This is a dangerous development, dangerous to our judicial system and 
dangerous to our democracy. The judiciary's role is to interpret the 
law and decide whether it is constitutional.
  When judges decide to become politicians, injecting their own 
political bias into a decision, our Constitution and our government are 
at risk.
  If the media and the judiciary cease being objective, we should fear 
for the future of our country.
