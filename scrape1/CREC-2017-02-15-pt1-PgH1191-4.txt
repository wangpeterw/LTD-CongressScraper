                PUT AMERICA FIRST INSTEAD OF THE KREMLIN

  (Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, for the sake of our country, I was relieved 
that General Michael Flynn resigned from his post as National Security 
Adviser. Not only did he mislead the Vice President and the public on 
his secret conversations with the Russian government, he may have also 
violated Federal law.
  But what is just as concerning is that the Trump administration was 
aware of General Flynn's misconduct weeks ago and did nothing about it. 
The American people deserve to know what President Trump knew, and when 
he knew it.
  And let me be clear: General Flynn's resignation is not the end of 
the Trump administration's shady ties to Russia. We still don't know 
President Trump's financial interests in Russia because he refuses to 
release his tax returns.
  We still don't know the extent of Russia's disturbing interference in 
our election because our calls for an investigation have been 
stonewalled.
  And we just learned that the Trump campaign was in regular 
conversation with Russian intelligence officials.
  President Trump's coziness with Vladimir Putin is an urgent matter of 
national security.
  It is time that the Trump administration truly put America first, 
rather than the Kremlin.
