  (Mrs. BLACKBURN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, as we were home over the Christmas 
holiday break, so many calls that came into my office dealt with the 
ObamaCare issue--the rise in premiums, the lack of affordability.
  Here is one example. A 64-year-old man, his premiums $30,000, 
deductible $12,000--indeed, too expensive to afford and too expensive 
to use.
  But we do have a plan for repealing and replacing. You will find it 
at A Better Way. This will help lift the financial burden from many 
Americans

who are currently facing high costs due to ObamaCare. Our plan allows 
patients greater access to affordable care and affordable insurance.
  Our next step includes my legislation, H.R. 314. It is the Health 
Care Choice Act of 2017. What it will do is allow greater access, more 
choice, and more options by allowing across-State-line purchasing of 
health insurance. You find the plan that is most suited to you and your 
family at a price that you can afford.
  It is time for us to repeal and replace with good patient-centered 
options.
