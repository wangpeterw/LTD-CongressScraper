                           BIRTH CONTROL RULE

  (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today against the Trump 
administration rule allowing corporations to decide whether their 
employees can access birth control. This morning, 500,000 comments were 
delivered in opposition to this rule.
  It is astonishing to me that we are having this debate in 2017: 
women's access to birth control.
  Birth control is not healthcare alone. It is the right of women to 
control their own bodies, plan their own families, and chart their own 
futures.
  Obstetricians and gynecologists from Chicago submitted a comment, 
saying: ``Women who are able to control when and how they become 
pregnant are able to finish school, pursue graduate degrees, and 
further the greater social and economic good of our Nation.''
  Mr. Speaker, for 99 percent of women of reproductive age, birth 
control is an essential part of their lives. This is a direct attack on 
women, and we will not stand for it. Women in America are watching.
