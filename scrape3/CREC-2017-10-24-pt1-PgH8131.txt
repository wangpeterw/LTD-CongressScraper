                           GOLD STAR FAMILIES

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, as Americans, we mourn with Gold Star 
families, but we cannot feel their pain. There is nothing anyone can 
say or do to really comfort families suffering the loss of a loved one. 
But there is a lot people can say or do to cause grieving families 
additional pain, as we have seen over this past week.
  As Members of Congress, we are there for our constituents. They are 
our families. It is our obligation to speak up when they are hurt.
  The loss of American servicemembers should not be politicized. Our 
fallen heroes should be honored.
  Sergeant La David Johnson is an American hero.
  Staff Sergeant Jeremiah Johnson is an American hero.
  Staff Sergeant Bryan Black is an American hero.
  Staff Sergeant Dustin Wright is an American hero.
  The 28 men and women who lost their lives in service to their country 
this year are all American heroes. Let us honor their sacrifices and 
comfort their families, as has been the tradition in this country until 
last week.
