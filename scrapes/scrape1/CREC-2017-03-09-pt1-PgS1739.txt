                        TRIBUTE TO GEORGE FLYNN

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today it is my honor to celebrate 
former Pulaski County circuit clerk George Flynn. Although he began his 
retirement last year, his community is still recognizing him for his 
three decades of public service. The Somerset-Pulaski County Chamber of 
Commerce presented the ``Distinguished Community Service Award''--its 
top honor--to Flynn in recognition of his dedicated work to the people 
of Pulaski County.
  In both his personal life and professional work, Flynn tirelessly 
tried to make his community a better place. He was first elected in 
1987 because he ``is [the] personification of a `one of us' attitude 
necessary to attract votes in Pulaski County.'' Because of his 
exemplary work as circuit clerk, the people reelected him four times. 
In his tenure, he worked with five circuit court judges and oversaw the 
modernization of all court records.
  After a proud career of public service, Flynn said he is ready to 
spend his days sleeping in, enjoying time with his wife, Resa, his 
grandchildren, and his dogs. He has earned a relaxing retirement. I 
would like to extend my warmest congratulations to George Flynn for a 
notable career of public service and this much deserved award.
