                           TRUMPCARE PROMISES

  (Mr. TONKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, The Senate is introducing yet another version 
of TrumpCare today. I rise to express my grave concern with the most 
harmful aspects of this mean and merciless bill.

[[Page H5772]]

  TrumpCare still includes billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid, a 
critical source of healthcare for 1.75 million of America's veterans, 
two-thirds of U.S. nursing home residents, and one in five Americans. 
The latest Senate TrumpCare bill cuts Medicaid by as much as a third.
  Every version of TrumpCare we have seen would result in more than 20 
million fewer Americans covered over the next 10 years.
  There is still no sign of a TrumpCare bill that would not break 
President's Trump's healthcare promises to the American people. The 
President promised ``insurance for everybody.'' He said: ``Everybody's 
going to be taken care of.''
  Every version of TrumpCare would break that promise, big league. The 
President promised that Medicaid would not be cut under his healthcare 
plan. No version of TrumpCare has been proposed that even comes close 
to keeping that promise.
  President Trump promised the American people a healthcare plan that 
would ``lower premiums'' with ``much lower deductibles.''
  It is time for Americans to get a real plan and not be left with 
broken promises.
