                MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 1894

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I understand that there is a bill at 
the desk due for a second reading.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bill by title for the 
second time.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (S. 1894) to exempt Puerto Rico from the coastwise 
     laws of the United States (commonly known as the ``Jones 
     Act'').

  Mr. McCONNELL. In order to place the bill on the calendar under the 
provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection having been heard, the bill will be 
placed on the calendar.

                          ____________________
