                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Loving and gracious God, we give You thanks for giving us another 
day.
  Bless the Members of the people's House during these decisive days. 
May they remain genuine enough to preserve their integrity, great 
enough to be humble, and good enough to keep their faith, always 
regarding public office as a sacred trust. Give them the wisdom and the 
courage to fail not their fellow citizens nor You.
  Bless as well all those who serve: those men and women who are in the 
Armed Forces and, at the end of this week, those men and women of the 
blue line, who protect us daily in our homes, towns, and cities.
  May all that is done be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
