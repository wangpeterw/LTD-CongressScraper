               PANAMA CITY BEACH AND GOVERNMENT RED TAPE

  (Mr. DUNN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight a prime example of 
how needless government regulation is wasting both taxpayers' time and 
money.
  In my district in Florida, on the beautiful Gulf Coast, we are 
susceptible to hurricanes with damaging winds and flooding. Sometimes 
roads get washed out.
  Back in November of 2014, Panama City Beach applied for a Federal 
grant from FEMA to improve drainage and alleviate flooding of Front 
Beach Road. The project involves the installation of just two culverts 
under the road for storm runoff. This is not building the pyramids.
  Three years later, local officials have submitted more than 900 pages 
of paperwork and spent countless hours working on this application. All 
this is for a project that will take just 1 week to construct and 
involves a grant of only $170,000.
  Mr. Speaker, this is exactly the kind of crushing red tape that our 
constituents face on a regular basis, and this is what we are working 
to fix.
