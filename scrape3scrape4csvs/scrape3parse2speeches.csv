993,topic-id,591,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the critical and lifesaving work being done by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Aircraft Operations  On September 23, I had a front row seat flying into the eye of Hurricane Maria as it headed toward Puerto Rico and the coastal United I rode through the hurricane aboard a NOAA P-3 Orion operated by the highly specialized workforce of the NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps, civilian technicians, meteorologists from NOAA, and others, who have safely navigated these hurricanes for decades.  The P-3's instruments collect and transmit realtime weather data from storms far out to the sea back to the mainland. This data is critical for hurricane forecasters used by the American public and emergency managers.  Providing the most accurate forecasts of hurricane track and intensity, as early as possible, is the focus of these flights. Whether a strong hurricane directly hits a major U.city or weakens and spins out to sea with minimal impacts is a question that can impact billions of dollars and thousands of lives. These flights are vital to protect our Nation's lives and property.  In addition to the P-3 hurricane hunter I flew in, NOAA also has a G-IV jet that goes high above the storm. The specialized instrumentation on NOAA hurricane aircraft provides critical storm data. The dual-channel tail doppler radars provide three-dimensional views of the storm.  These advanced technology tools make NOAA's fleet a critical resource to safeguard lives and property when hurricanes threaten our shores. There is no doubt that this has been a challenging hurricane season for the country, with Hurricane Harvey's flooding in Louisiana and Texas, Hurricane Irma impacting Florida, and Hurricane Maria devastating Puerto NOAA's aircraft have performed tirelessly throughout these events. Over a 4-week period, two NOAA hurricane aircraft flew over 300 hours and dropped over 500 weather probes into these storms.  After the hurricanes pass, NOAA's work is not done. NOAA's fleet of light aircraft perform poststorm damage assessments, taking high resolution images that enable limited emergency response resources to be delivered to the most critical areas.  NOAA's King Air aircraft emergency response efforts to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria have resulted in more than 1.7 billion requests for damage assessment images. In total, more than 65,000 images were collected, covering more than 24,000 square kilometers of impacted areas. Think about that. These images allow emergency managers and the general public to be able to flee quickly, to react quickly, and to assess quickly in these impacted areas.  NOAA's light survey aircraft also perform a diverse set of missions, including river and snow pack surveys essential for flood forecasts and water management; coastal mapping required for safe maritime navigation by commercial, military, and recreational sectors; and fisheries assessments.  NOAA's aircraft are responsive and flexible, able to deploy at a moment's notice in support of national disaster response. NOAA aircraft provided critical data and support on scene following the Deepwater Horizon event and over the skies of New York after Hurricane NOAA aircraft provide data critical for public safety, economic, and national security.  The NOAA aircraft fleet, the NOAA Commissioned Corps, and NOAA civilians are an invaluable natural resource, and it is one that we have a duty to maintain. These crews and aircraft require regular updates, readiness training, and technology enhancements that directly benefit us and our country.  I look forward to working with my colleagues and the President to ensure that NOAA aircraft fleet has all of the resources they need to safeguard lives and property for decades to come.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-25-pt1-PgH8149.txt,2244,THE PRESIDENT'S CORRECT AND NECESSARY DECERTIFICATION OF THE JCPOA,2017.0,25.0,October

Mr.Speaker, I rise to recognize the 150th anniversary of the General Baptist State Convention of North Carolina and join my colleagues, Congressman Butterfield and Congressman Price, in congratulating them on their achievements and the appointment of their 32nd president,  In North Carolina, the convention partners with Shaw University, the[[Page H8221]]oldest Historically Black University in the South and one of the oldest in the  As a retired professor, as you heard, of 40 years from Bennett College in Greensboro, founder of the Congressional Bipartisan HBCU Caucus, and a member of the Education and the Workforce Committee here in the Congress, it gives me great pride to reflect on the general support that the convention gives to Shaw and its students.  I feel a special attachment to Shaw, since that is what became my alma mater. North Carolina A&T State University was located on Shaw's campus during its first year. Its history of leadership, activism, and service is well-documented. The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, founded on Shaw's campus in 1960, and the Center for Alternative Programs in Education--CAPE--had its beginnings there in 1980.

334,topic-id,253,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Congressman Butterfield for yielding.  I just wanted to add that he was almost a Shaw Bear with his parents attending there. Just last year, I had the opportunity to address Founder's Day to all of the students there.  Many firsts Shaw boasts: the first college in the Nation to offer a 4-year medical program, the first Historically Black College in the Nation to open its doors to women, and the first Historically Black College in North Carolina to be granted an ``A'' rating by the State Department of Public  Over the years, as Mr.Butterfield has said, many scholarships have been provided to those students. They have encouraged the students to not only attend their divinity school, but we find that many of them have become college presidents: the founder of North Carolina Central, the first President of Elizabeth City State, and North Carolina A&T State University were all Shaw Bears, and we are delighted. So the lives that the General Baptist State Convention has touched throughout its existence is beyond admirable and almost beyond comprehension.  I want to close by saying that W.E.Du Bois reminded us that of all the civil rights of which the world has fought for for 500 years, the right to learn is undoubtedly the most fundamental.  So I praise the General Baptist State Convention and its commitment to education, and Shaw University, as well, for their charitable giving and for their dedication to educating young people through these 150 years, a century and five decades.

728,topic-id,842,"Mr.President, in respecting Senator Cornyn's prerogative, I will stop when he comes to the floor.  I believe that Senator Murray has come to the floor and has reported that the Congressional Budget Office has just finished an evaluation of the Alexander-Murray proposal to the U.Senate that would be for the purpose of reducing premiums and avoiding chaos in the individual insurance markets during the years 2018 and 2019.  The Senator from New Hampshire is a strong sponsor of that legislation. It is unusual, in fact, that it has 12 Republican Senators and 12 Democratic Not many pieces of legislation come to the floor with that support. The reason we accelerated work on it was that President Trump called me and asked me to work with Senator Murray to try to develop such a proposal. So now it is being considered by the President, by the House of Representatives, and by other Members of this body.  An important piece of information, as Senator Murray has said, is what the Congressional Budget Office writes about the impact of our proposal on the Federal taxpayers and on the consumers across the country.  President Trump has been very clear on one thing he wants, which is that we do not bail out insurance companies if, in 2018, we pay cost-sharing payment reductions, which are payments to pay for deductibles and copays for low-income  I 100 percent agree with President Trump on that, and Senator Murray 100 percent agrees with President Trump on that. We have language in our proposal to make sure that benefits go to consumers and to taxpayers and not to insurance companies. We asked the Congressional Budget Office to review that, and this is what it wrote: ``On net, CBO and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimate that implementing the legislation would reduce the deficit by $3.8 billion over the 2018-2027 period relative to CBO's baseline.''  In other words, the Alexander-Murray proposal would reduce Federal spending by $3.8 billion. Not only does it not cost anything, but it saves the taxpayers money.  They then wrote a second thing, and this is quoting the Congressional Budget Office: ``CBO and JCT expect that insurers in almost all areas of the country would be required to issue some form of rebate to individuals and the federal government.''  Let me say that again. This is the CBO talking, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, with respect to the Alexander-Murray proposal that has been cosponsored by a total of 24 Senators--12 Republicans, 12 Democrats: ``CBO and JCT expect that insurers in almost all areas of the country would be required to issue some form of rebate to individuals and the federal government.''  The Congressional Budget Office has found that our proposal benefits taxpayers and consumers, not insurance companies. The specific benefit to the taxpayers is $3.8 billion. The exact benefit to consumers has not been determined yet because that will be done State by Under our proposal, every State would come up with a plan to say, in 2018, because of the cost-sharing payments, premium rates need to be lower than they are already set. Then, in that State, they would be, and as a result, there would be rebates to individuals.  The CBO also found that there is a provision in the law for a catastrophic plan. That is a new insurance plan for people over the age of 29 that would have lower premiums and higher deductibles, but it would allow people to afford an insurance policy so that a medical catastrophe would not turn into a financial catastrophe.  ``CBO estimates that making catastrophic plans part of the single risk pool would slightly lower premiums for other nongroup plans, because the people who enroll in catastrophic plans tend to be healthier, on average, than other nongroup market enrollees.''  A major objective, I think, of all of us is to attract more young, healthy people into the pool as a way of lowering rates for everybody.  ``As a result of the slightly lower estimated premiums, CBO and JCT expect that federal costs for subsidies for insurance purchased through a marketplace established under the ACA would decline by about $1.1 billion over the 2019-2027 period.''  We have already said what the Congressional Budget Office has reported earlier; that if we don't pass something like the Alexander-Murray proposal, this is what happens: If the cost-sharing payments are not paid, premiums in 2018 will go up an average 20 percent. They are already up. Our proposal will take them down. The Federal debt will increase by $194 billion over 10 years, if we don't pass our proposal, due to the extra cost of subsidies to pay higher premiums, and up to 16 million Americans may live in counties where they are not able to buy any insurance in individual markets. The 350,000 Tennesseans in individual markets in Tennessee would be terrified by the prospect of not being able to buy any insurance or by the skyrocketing premiums.

77,topic-id,244,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to support my fellow Georgian's, Congressman Doug Collins, bill, H.469.  One of the biggest complaints I hear about the Federal Government is the lack of accountability or these backroom deals. One glaring example of this is what is referred to as sue and settlement litigation.  Under previous administrations, left-leaning groups would sue a Federal agency to try and enact regulatory changes without going through the normal rulemaking process. Both parties, the Federal Government and special interest groups, settle in court with an already-agreed-upon deal.  Regulatory rules are then made quickly without any public notice or the input of any other relevant parties but carry the rule of law.  These new rules are often the most burdensome and cost our businesses billions of dollars each year. This doesn't sound like draining the swamp to me.  H.469 stops these unfair arrangements by requiring agencies to publicly post and report to Congress on sue and settlement complaints, consent decrees, and settlement arrangements. It also prohibits the same-day filing of complaints and settlement agreements in cases seeking to compel agency action.  Congressman Collins' legislation, the Sunshine for Regulations and Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act, will provide greater accountability and transparency to the American public, while stopping special interests from improperly influencing our Nation's regulatory regime. We must uphold a fair and transparent regulatory process. The American people demand this from us.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the rule on this commonsense legislation.

It evokes images of stress, accountants, lawyers, and American families sending hard-earned money to the Federal  I, for one, have never been excited when it is tax season, and as a businessowner, it took on a whole new meaning.  Taxes affect all Americans, but tax season shouldn't include months and months of preparation, often required to hire tax professionals.  Our Tax Code is broken, and millions of Americans are looking to us to fix it. That is why Republicans have released the Unified Tax Reform Framework to provide relief for hardworking Americans and jump-start our economy.  First, it lowers taxes at every income level, allowing Americans to keep more of their hard-earned paychecks. It delivers the lowest tax rates in modern history for job creators, allowing them to invest in growing their business. I will remind you that the small business community is responsible for 70 percent of all new jobs created.  The vast majority of taxpayers will no longer have to deal with the complexity of itemizing due to the increased standard deduction. Small businesses will no longer be taxed under the individual side of the code. Families will no longer be penalized for inheriting family property or businesses, when the death tax is removed. Finally, we will cut tax rates on personal savings and investment in half.

583,topic-id,1325,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Congressman Zeldin for his leadership on this issue; his voice in criticism of this flawed nuclear deal with Iran; and, of course, for his valiant service to the United States in the military.  I rise tonight in strong support of the President's decision to decertify this[[Page H8215]]deeply flawed JCPOA, the Iran nuclear deal under the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review I agree with the President's finding that Iran is not transparently, not verifiably, and not fully implementing the agreement. I agree with the President's finding that continued sanctions relief is not in the vital security interest of the United  That is because the Obama administration's nuclear deal with Iran was a dangerous and historic mistake. The deal provided the mullahs in Tehran with roughly $100 billion in upfront sanctions relief in exchange for Iran's promise, future promise, to temporarily pause its enrichment program.  Unfortunately, the agreement contained fatally deficient verification protocols and the International Atomic Energy Agency now concedes that it has no capacity to verify that Tehran is engaged in activities which could contribute to the development of a nuclear explosive device. That is because under the terms of the agreement, the very terms of the JCPOA, international inspectors are barred from accessing Iran's military sites where elicit nuclear activities are most likely taking place.  President Obama's promise that there would be ``anytime, anywhere inspections,'' but that promise was replaced with ``managed access'' to suspect nuclear sites in which international inspectors must appeal to Iran, Russia, and China in a bureaucratic process that would take days during which Iran could remove anything covert and in violation of the agreement.  As Congressman Zeldin correctly pointed out, we don't even know what the verification protocols actually are because we haven't been able to access the secret agreement between international inspectors, non-U.inspectors, and the leadership in  But the most serious concern is not that Iran would cheat. It is that even if Iran is fully complying with this agreement, bad outcomes are guaranteed. First, Iran will be allowed an arsenal of nuclear weapons in as little as 10 years. Under the very terms of this agreement, Iran was not denied a nuclear weapon. The path was paved for Iran to have an arsenal of nuclear weapons with international sanction.  Iran was not required to dismantle key bomb-making technology. It was permitted to retain vast enrichment capacity, and it was allowed to continue research and development on advanced centrifuges, and it will be allowed to continue to acquire intercontinental ballistic missiles. Intercontinental ballistic missiles.  Why do you need intercontinental ballistic missiles if you have peaceful designs for your nuclear program?  Those of you who are listening at home across America, remember this: an intercontinental ballistic missile is not a missile designed for Tel An intercontinental ballistic missile is designed for New York City; for Washington, D.C.; for Atlanta, Georgia; for Los Angeles, California; and for Seattle, Washington; and for  Our homeland security has been jeopardized because of this fatally flawed agreement. Iran will receive a sanctions relief jackpot. They have already received upwards of $100 billion so far. In my capacity as the chairman of the subcommittee that oversees sanctions, oversees the Treasury Department's implementation of sanctions, I can say that we have heard it. We have heard the reporting that, as a result of this agreement, Iran has not become pacified. Iran has actually accelerated its support for terrorist proxies in Lebanon, Gaza, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Because Iran's neighbors know that this deal reverses a decades-long bipartisan policy blocking Iran's nuclear program, this agreement continues to risk a nuclear arms race in the broader Middle  They are apologists. There are defenders of the Iran nuclear deal, and they say it is working. They say there is evidence of dismantling of the nuclear program, but we have the benefit of almost 2 years of implementation of the deal. We have the benefit of hindsight to see if this deal is actually working.  Here are the facts. The facts are that since the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action was implemented in January of 2016, Iran has continued to sponsor Hezbollah and other radical terrorist militias in the region. Its support for the Assad regime alone, including the use of planes to airlift military supplies, has helped claim an estimated 400 lives. Last April, even President Obama suggested that the Iranians were violating the spirit of the deal by engaging in these activities.  Rather than being deterred, in October, Iran sentenced three Americans to long prison terms on bogus charges. In January of this year, the country tested a ballistic missile in violation of U.Security Council resolution 2231. In April, just as a commercial airline manufacturer was announcing new sales to Iran as a result of the sanctions relief under the JCPOA, we learned that dozens of Syrian civilians, including at least 11 children, were gassed in an Iranian-supported chemical weapons attack.  Additionally, Iran has stated that it will no longer permit inspections of its military bases. It continues to attempt to intimidate our allies, and is facilitating the imports and exports of arms.  As of February 2017, Iran has fired as many as 14 ballistic missiles, and the leaders of Iran continue to chant ``death to America,'' and pledge to wipe Israel off the face of the planet.  So where do we go from here?  As the chairman of the subcommittee that oversees enforcement of sanctions, we have been working on additional measures that can be taken, including non-nuclear sanctions consistent with the JCPOA to hold Iran accountable for its malign activities.  On April 4, we held a hearing on the effectiveness of non-nuclear sanctions against Iran, where we determined that Iran Air, a state-owned commercial airline, has used its aircraft to transport fighters and weapons throughout the Middle East on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard As a result of these findings, I wrote a letter to Treasury Secretary Mnuchin urging him to ban the sale of commercial aircraft to Iran  Similarly, I supported two appropriations amendments that would prevent the sale of aircraft to Iran and prohibit U.firms from financing such a sale.  Finally, I recently drafted a letter to the Treasury Department urging it to identify all entities it believes to have transacted business with the IRGC, a precursor to possible additional secondary sanctions.  These actions are all important and relevant in the aftermath of the President's correct decision to decertify the deal because it invites Congress to step in and offer constructive recommendations on how to address the flaws, the fatal flaws, in the These are some of those recommendations to the administration, and we hope the Treasury Department will respond accordingly.  Going forward, we must do the following to stem Iran's nuclear ambitions: We must designate the IRGC as a foreign terrorist organization. We must make permanent the sunset clauses on Iran's nuclear program and testing. This cannot be temporary prohibition of the Iran nuclear program. This must be a permanent ban on Iran ever having nuclear weapons capability and the capability of delivering those weapons.  Finally, we need to do a better job strengthening the agreement, revising the agreement, scrapping the old agreement, and actually getting to anytime, anywhere inspections. That means we have got to work with the P5+1 and our European allies to revise the JCPOA so that we mandate anytime, anywhere inspections of nuclear facilities, and so that we are guaranteed that the IAEA, that international and U.inspectors have access to all suspected sites within the territorial boundaries of  In conclusion, I want to thank Congressman Zeldin for the Special I want to thank President Trump and his administration for their leadership on stopping Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, and for the important national security imperative of revisiting this flawed Iran nuclear deal so that we can actually achieve peace in the world.  Mr.Speaker, we thank Congressman Zeldin for his leadership in pursuing this very important objective.

The Congress finds the following:       (1) On June 1, 2016, the Department of the Treasury's      Financial Crimes Enforcement Network announced a Notice of      Finding that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is a      jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern due to its      use of state-controlled financial institutions and front      companies to support the proliferation and development of      weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missiles.       (2) The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has expressed      serious concerns with the threat posed by North Korea's      proliferation and financing of WMD, and has called on FATF      members to apply effective counter-measures to protect their      financial sectors from North Korean money laundering, WMD      proliferation financing, and the financing of terrorism.       (3) In its February 2017 report, the U.Panel of Experts      concluded that--       (A) North Korea continued to access the international      financial system in support of illicit activities despite      sanctions imposed by U.Security Council Resolutions 2270      (2016) and 2321 (2016);       (B) during the reporting period, no member state had      reported taking actions to freeze North Korean assets; and       (C) sanctions evasion by North Korea, combined with      inadequate compliance by member states, had significantly      negated the impact of U.Security Council resolutions.       (4) In its September 2017 report, the U.Panel of Experts      found that--       (A) North Korea continued to violate financial sanctions by      using agents acting abroad on the country's behalf;       (B) foreign financial institutions provided correspondent      banking services to North Korean persons and front companies      for illicit purposes;       (C) foreign companies violated sanctions by maintaining      links with North Korean financial institutions; and       (D) North Korea generated at least $270 million during the      reporting period through the violation of sectoral sanctions.       (5) North Korean entities engage in significant financial      transactions through foreign bank accounts that are      maintained by non-North Korean nationals, thereby masking      account users' identity in order to access financial      services.       (6) North Korea's sixth nuclear test on September 3, 2017,      demonstrated an estimated explosive power more than 100 times      greater than that generated by its first nuclear test in      2006.       (7) North Korea has successfully tested submarine-launched      and intercontinental ballistic missiles, and is rapidly      progressing in its development of a nuclear-armed missile      that is capable of reaching United States territory.     3.

1203,topic-id,787,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, I am pleased to sponsor H.3898, the Otto Warmbier North Korea Nuclear Sanctions Act, which imposes the most far-reaching financial sanctions ever directed at North  Since 2006, North Korea has undertaken six nuclear tests and, earlier this summer, test-launched intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching United States territory. The most recent nuclear device that the country detonated on September 3 had an estimated explosive power 10 times greater than the bomb dropped at We must not allow the North to threaten a U.city with such weapons.  In short, Mr.Speaker, this bill would impose secondary sanctions on foreign financial institutions that do business with virtually anyone that trades with North In addition, H.3898 would essentially cut off Pyongyang's ability to earn hard currency through North Korean laborers working abroad, and it would use our leverage at the IMF, the World Bank, and other international financial institutions to incentivize countries to crack down on North Korea's illicit activities.[[Page H8101]]  As many of my colleagues know, North Korea is already subject to both U.and international sanctions, the latter deriving from a series of U.Security Council resolutions. These sanctions have fallen short, however, for two main reasons:  First, they have not given sufficient attention to North Korea's enablers in third countries, especially foreign banks and middlemen in China, Southeast Asia, and other parts of the world.  Second, even though U.Security Council resolutions are supposed to bind U.members to enforce them, implementation has been weak. As the U.Panel of Experts concluded earlier this year, member nations' compliance with sanctions has been so lax that North Korea retains access to the international financial system.  As the Trump administration has made clear, U.sanctions are a floor, not a ceiling, for U.action. H.3898 embodies this principle through the use of secondary sanctions.  Here is how such sanctions would work, Mr.Speaker:  The front companies and middlemen that North Korea relies on in third countries still need banks. Those banks, in turn, use correspondent or payable-through accounts held at U.financial institutions to process international transactions. It is counterproductive for U.policy to permit foreign banks to do business in America as well as business that ultimately helps North It is time for those banks to choose between aiding and abetting the North Korean Government or standing for peace with America and its allies.                              {time}  1415  H.3898 forces foreign banks to make that choice. Foreign banks can either do business benefiting North Korea or business with the United They cannot do both.  Under an executive order issued in September, the President authorized the Treasury Department to levy sanctions on foreign banks that finance North Korean trade. While this was a crucial step forward, H.3898 would widen the net still further.  Under this legislation, Congress would be codifying mandatory sanctions on foreign banks. If someone is dealing with North Korea, there is nowhere to run or hide: a foreign financial institution is subject to sanctions for doing business with you, even if that bank claims that it is not directly financing the trade.  H.3898 also covers more economic activity than any previous sanctions on North Korea, including the current U.sanctions round. That means this bill goes after banks involved with petroleum, labor, and virtually any kind of investment or North Korean use of shipping vessels.  In addition, H.3898 targets the knowledge and technological support that North Korea needs for its weapons program and hacking activities. Pyongyang's threats against cybersecurity are critical for the regime to get its hands on financing.  The goal, Mr.Speaker, is to show North Korea that the path they are on has devastating costs and leads to nowhere regardless. H.3898 provides an off-ramp for North Korea if the country wants sanctions relief, but it is up to Pyongyang to take it. Until then, the sanctions we will be passing today hold tremendous economic pain in store for the Kim Jong-un regime and its foreign enablers.  Finally, Mr.Speaker, we are honored to dedicate this bill to the memory of Otto Warmbier, a young man who traveled to North Korea to understand the country with his own eyes, and whose life was cut short by the regime's brutality. Otto was a student at the University of Virginia, my alma mater, and a special community that continues to mourn the loss of this special young man. Otto held out his hand in friendship to the people of North Korea, as we do. It is Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions, though, that threaten what Otto represented: a world of openness, understanding, and a desire for peaceful relations between our country and North It is fitting that this legislation bears Otto's name, and that its goals embody his spirit.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-10-24-pt1-PgH8099.txt,2238,WILDFIRE DISASTER FUNDING ACT,2017.0,24.0,October

President Trump's tough rhetoric and tough talk on North Korea matches a shift in policy away from strategic patience to one that uses enhanced pressure through sanctions and the credible threat of military force to give substance and meaning to our diplomacy.

H.3551 reauthorizes, for the first time in 11 years, the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism Program, also known as C- C-TPAT is a voluntary public-private sector partnership program where CBP works with the trade community to provide high-level cargo security through close cooperation with the principal stakeholders of the international supply chain, such as importers, carriers, consolidators, licensed customs brokers, and manufacturers.  Today, more than 11,400 certified partners spanning the gamut of the trade community have been accepted into the program. CBP pre-vets and certifies C-TPAT partners they consider to be low risk in exchange for benefits, such as fewer examinations and access to expedited or dedicated lanes.  This bill incorporates Democratic amendments, including one of my own that establishes a standard system for C-TPAT partners to report suspicious activity instead of the patchwork system that exists now.  Another important amendment offered by my colleague, Mr.Correa, was adopted in committee to ensure that when CBP changes up the rules and security criteria for C-TPAT, stakeholders are given adequate notice to comply.  Furthermore, I would like to thank the majority for working with us to recognize that suspension and expulsion from the C-TPAT program has serious economic and repudiation ramifications for companies. The majority agreed to include Democratic language supported by the Border Trade Alliance and other stakeholders that urges CBP not to publish suspended C-TPAT participants, as is the current practice, until appeals and complete due process is carried out. We found some cases where companies were reinstated in the appeals process, but since they were tagged as a suspended company by CBP in the Federal Register, their business suffered. This language would prevent that from reoccurring.[[Page H8056]]  Mr.Speaker, at a time when U.ports, like the Port of Los Angeles in my district, are experiencing CBP staffing shortages, the C-TPAT program helps the supply chain be more efficient and safe. I support the program's reauthorization.  Mr.Speaker, H.3551 is an important piece of legislation that has strong support on both sides of the aisle and a broad range of stakeholders.  C-TPAT offers importers and other partners a win-win situation where they voluntarily allow CBP to prescreen them in exchange for benefits, such as shorter wait times and dedicated services. The more we know about our supply chain, the safer we will be.  C-TPAT is a big way we stay informed. As such, I encourage my colleagues to support H.3551, and I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr.Speaker, the APEC Business Travel Cards Act permanently reauthorizes the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Business Travel Card This trusted-traveler program provides access to fast-track immigration lanes in airports for travelers who conduct verified business in the APEC region. APEC is a forum for 21 Pacific Rim countries, including the U.and Australia, to support sustainable economic growth and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region.  U.Customs and Border Protection started issuing cards to eligible Americans in 2014 after Congress passed the APEC Business Travel Cards Act in 2011. Today, the program facilitates travel for Americans working on behalf of 30,000 U.businesses. Under that law, the authority to issue these travel cards to Americans is set to expire on September 30, 2018.  504, the APEC Business Travel Cards Act of 2017, is supported by a diverse range of stakeholders, including the U.Chamber of Commerce, the Asia-Pacific Council of American Chambers of Commerce, the U.Council for International Business, the U.Travel Association, and the American Hotel and Lodging  On the House Homeland Security Committee, companion legislation to 504 was championed by Congresswoman Kathleen Rice of New With the leadership of Miss Rice and others, her bill was passed unanimously by our committee.  Allowing ABT cards to expire would be a mistake that puts American businesses at a disadvantage. I urge my House colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.  Mr.Speaker, 504 is an important piece of legislation that has strong support on both sides of the aisle. The ABT Card Program allows business travelers and government officials with business in APEC countries to access fast-track processing lanes at APEC airports.  The program saves an estimated 43 minutes per trip, according to U.Customs and Border Patrol, and operates entirely on user fees, costing taxpayers nothing. Importantly, it preserves authority for the Department of Homeland Security to revoke or suspend an individual's card for security reasons at any time.  This is a commonsense, bipartisan bill, and I encourage my colleagues to support 504 to ensure that the bill gets to the President's desk.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

738,topic-id,1252,"Mr.President, President Trump has been in office now for more than 9 months. For this entire time, Senate Democrats have been trying to obstruct him from doing the very job that he was elected by the American people to do. The President has laid out his agenda to create jobs, to grow the economy, and to help hard-working American taxpayers. Yet Democrats will do everything they can to stop the President from putting his team in place to accomplish these goals.  They have tried to stop the President's legislative agenda because they know that his policies will actually work. When Republican policies become law, Democrats know that the people will see how successful these Republican policies are. I think Democrats are worried that they may never win another election again once we get these policies into place. That is why we have seen a record number of delays and obstructions by the Democrats in the They have done it on legislation, and they have even blocked the President from filling some of the most basic jobs within his administration.  It started on day one. Normally, on Inauguration Day, the President gets a substantial number of people confirmed to his The idea is to let the President get his team in place so that it can hit the ground running. President Obama had six of his Cabinet Secretaries confirmed on Inauguration Day, and President Bush had seven Secretaries confirmed on Inauguration These confirmations were by voice vote, but that was not the case with President Trump--just two with rollcall votes on Inauguration  Republicans in the Senate did not do anything to try to block the Cabinet Secretaries for President Obama, for we understood that it was best to give a new President a chance and for all of us to work together when we could. With George Bush, it was seven. That is how it usually works, but not anymore--no, not with this group of Democrats in the They really were never interested in giving President Trump a chance. They really do not seem to be working together. Last January, President Trump had two people confirmed to the Cabinet on Inauguration Day--the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland They were the only two jobs that the Democrats allowed the President to fill.  In President Trump's first 9 months in office, Democrats have continued to block the way. They have allowed just 185 of his nominees to take their jobs. That is how ridiculous the Democrats have been in trying to keep President Trump from putting his team in place. By this far into the administration at the same time, President Obama had 364 nominees in place. The Democrats have blocked judges, Cabinet Secretaries, and other high-ranking officials.  Now, it is interesting because you have seen this. Many of these nominees even have Democrat support, and they are not controversial at all, but Democrats are doing everything they can to slow down the process. During President Obama's first 9 months, he had 364 confirmed. So President Obama had gotten 2 for every 1 that President Trump has gotten confirmed.  There are 81 of President Trump's nominees who have gone through the committees and another some number today. They are 81 people who have been nominated by the President for positions in the government who are just waiting right now for a vote on the Senate floor. Many of these people got through the nomination process in June but are still waiting and being blocked by Democrats in the It is outrageous.  Do Democrats really think that these are not important jobs--that they do not need people in those jobs to do the important work that they have been assigned to do?  I believe that we should confirm as many of them as possible today. There are 13 judges waiting for confirmation. There are 8 U.attorneys waiting, including the U.attorney from my home State of These are important jobs.  We all understand that there is a process that we need to go through to fill these positions--to make sure the people are vetted and to make sure they are the right people for the jobs. All of these people have followed the process. They have been doing everything they have been asked to do in that they have filled out the paperwork, filled out the disclosures, and have gone through the committees. Now it is time for the Senate to get its work done. I would say let's do it today.  Interestingly enough, in August, the Democrats finally allowed a significant number of people to be confirmed. More than 60 people were confirmed by voice vote on one day. That is the kind of thing that used to be very routine in the Senate--letting a large number of noncontroversial nominees be approved all at once. It is now time to do it again. There is a significant backlog. So I want to get these folks confirmed now. It is time to clear the deck and let these people get to work who have been nominated and vetted, who have gone through the committees and been approved.  We need to move these nominations because we have more nominations on the way. We are going to have to deal with the nominations of two Cabinet Secretaries for positions that are currently vacant. President Trump has nominated Kirstjen Nielsen to be Secretary of Homeland It is an important job, and she is very qualified for it.[[Page S6795]]  Do the Democrats plan to block her confirmation to be Secretary of Homeland Security? Do the Democrats plan to obstruct this qualified woman from doing the important job she has been nominated by President Trump to do?  The President deserves to have his team in place. The Senate has an obligation to get that work done. The Department of Homeland Security deserves to have a Secretary in place to keep us safe. That is how it has worked in the past and how it should be working now.  These people manage major Departments of the government. They manage many career workers. We know that the Washington bureaucracy has grown tremendously over the years and that it is very difficult to eliminate people who aren't doing their jobs properly. We have seen it in the scandals over the years. Remember the Gold King Mine disaster? President Obama's EPA--the group who is supposed to protect the environment--actually dumped 3 million gallons of toxic wastewater in a river in Remember the scandals involving bureaucrats in the Department of Veterans Affairs, the IRS, and the General Services Administration during the Obama administration? We need Presidential appointees in place overseeing these Federal workers to make sure that the government of the people is accountable to the American people.  The Senate needs to be involved in providing oversight through our power of advice and consent. Democrats don't want that to happen. They have been keeping the Senate from providing that oversight, dragging out the process, making sure that the bureaucrats whom they seem to have more faith in are accountable to the American people rather than those whom the American people voted for on election day.  These are important jobs, and we have qualified people ready to do the work. Democrats have delayed for 9 months. It is time to break that logjam today.  I thank the Presiding  I yield the floor.

453,topic-id,984,"Mr.President, in recent months, Americans have been hit by a string of natural disasters--from devastating hurricanes in Puerto Rico, Florida, and Texas, to catastrophic wildfires in Oregon, Montana, and Earlier this week, the Senate voted to provide urgent relief to our communities in need.  Although Colorado was fortunate this year--we could have easily had fires, but we were very fortunate, unlike Montana, this year--we know the devastation of wildfires all too well. In 2012, the Waldo Canyon fire raged for 16 days, incinerating 18,000 acres, destroying over 300 homes, and forcing the evacuation of more than 32,000 Years later, our communities are still recovering from the damage.  Out West, wildfires can be catastrophic events. Yet Washington continues to fund them differently than other major disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, or floods. When those disasters strike, we pay for emergency response from an entirely separate account. When a wildfire catches, that cost falls entirely on the U.Forest If it is a catastrophic fire, as we see now in Montana and Northern California, those costs can easily exceed the Forest Service budget for fire suppression. That forces the Forest Service to borrow funds from other accounts to make up the difference. That is something no one has to do for any other disaster in This is often at the expense of efforts to prevent the next catastrophic fire.  It stands to reason that if we spend less and less on fire prevention, which is what the Forest Service is doing every year because of the way the Congress has set this up, we are going to spend more and more on fire suppression, fighting fires, and that is what is happening. That is exactly what has happened.  In 1995, the Forest Service spent around 16 percent of its budget on fire suppression--16 percent. Last year, it spent over half of its budget. For the first time in the Forest Service's history, they spent over half their budget fighting fires. You might as well call it the fire-fighting agency, not the Forest Service agency. In fact, the number was closer to 60 percent. The Forest Service had to borrow over half a billion dollars from other accounts in the agency--accounts that are important to Colorado, Wyoming, and  While we replenished those accounts in disaster aid packages earlier this year, we once again failed to address why they were depleted in the first place. Until we do, we are going to find ourselves in the same position every year. This is no way to run a government. It makes no sense from a fiscal perspective, and it makes no sense from a public welfare perspective. This is not how we should manage our taxpayer dollars. Undercutting fire prevention is the definition of being penny wise and pound foolish. Every dollar we[[Page S6834]]spend on disaster prevention leads to $5 of savings down the road.  We need to reinvest in fire prevention and in forest mitigation. In Colorado, our forests are in terrible shape. And it is not just Colorado citizens who need to care about that; anybody who lives downstream of our rivers, which are States all across America, needs to care about the condition of those headwaters. Those headwaters that are owned by the public, entrusted in the Forest Service, are in terrible shape because of this Congress's inability to deal with this.  We have over 800 million dead standing trees in the State of Colorado alone. Our communities, our watersheds, and our infrastructure are at risk. The Forest Service knows how to do this. They know how to mitigate that--by thinning timber and managing prescribed burns. But right now, all of those projects are on hold because the Forest Service anticipates having to fight more catastrophic fires next season. This is ridiculous. This is an affront to the people of Colorado and the people of the  We have a solution. It is a simple solution. Let's pay for fire suppression the same way we pay for other disasters. Our bill, the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, would do just that. It is backed by seven Democrats and, I am very proud to say, by four Unlike a lot of issues in Washington, both parties actually agree on the solution.  I know the administration is eager to fix this problem. Secretary Perdue knows that the current system makes no sense. He said as much at his confirmation hearing and again when he invited--and I so much appreciated this; we didn't ask--a bipartisan group of Senators to the Forest Service in September to discuss this. He knows that important wildfire mitigation projects are not getting done. He wants to fix the problem, and we should. It is far past time. This makes no sense from a fiscal point of view.  I know some colleagues in this Chamber would prefer to couple our proposal with broader forest management reforms. I have been part of forest management discussions in the past, and I want to continue those discussions. In fact, in the last farm bill, we worked across the aisle to improve forest management.  Let's be clear. For years now, efforts to link broad forest management reform with a funding fix have failed. They will not pass the Each year we do nothing, we continue to shortchange fire prevention, the good people who work for the Forest Service all across the country in our States, and we needlessly expose our communities to greater risks.  We have to act--Colorado and the West cannot wait another year--and we will have a chance when Congress votes on another disaster package over the next few months. We should use that opportunity to finally fix this problem and put the Forest Service in a stronger position to prevent the next catastrophic fire.

(e) Point of Order.--       (1) In general.--When the Senate is considering a bill,      resolution, amendment, motion, amendment between the Houses,      or conference report, if a point of order is made by a      Senator against an emergency designation in that measure,      that provision making such a designation shall be stricken      from the measure and may not be offered as an amendment from      the floor.

Any such motion in the Senate      shall be debatable. In any case in which such point of order      is sustained against a conference report (or Senate amendment      derived from such conference report by operation of this      subsection), no further amendment shall be in order.

1001,topic-id,548,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the Senate amendment to 71, the budget resolution for fiscal year 2018.  Passing a budget is never easy, and it has, once again, been a challenge this year. But I am encouraged with where we are now, and I am pleased that the Senate did its work by approving a budget, one that we can support in order to unlock tax reform for the American people.  Without question, there are plenty of things that I wish were included in what the Senate passed, ideas that the House put forward earlier this month when we approved our budget. For example, I still feel strongly about addressing unsustainable mandatory spending, and that hasn't changed. The growing burden of debt caused by mandatory spending is a real problem that cannot be ignored.  We owe it to the American people to do something, to offer serious reforms that ensure government programs are financially sustainable and working well for generations to come, and I think we will tackle this important issue in the future. Really, we don't have a choice.  But despite any shortcomings of the Senate-passed budget, I am encouraged that it does reflect the shared priorities of both Moving forward with this budget is also supported by our  I want to remind my colleagues that before final passage last week, the Senate did include numerous provisions previously passed by the House, and I was proud to be involved in those negotiations with the leaders of the House, the Senate, and the White  For example, the Senate-passed budget creates a mechanism that would permit the Budget Committee chairman to adjust the budget allocations if there is future legislation signed into law that revises the BCA spending caps.  The Senate-passed budget also includes numerous improvements to the House budget's enforcement that are designed to strengthen fiscal discipline. Because we worked together to find a common ground, we can move ahead toward tax reform and expand upon the ideas in the conservative framework unveiled last month.  Throughout my nearly 7 years as a Member of the House, Republicans have talked about modernizing our outdated and overly complicated tax system, and today, we have the opportunity to take that next big step to unlock tax reform for the American people, fulfilling the promise that we made long ago to our constituents.  By advancing tax reform, we can help Americans keep more of their hard-earned paychecks; we can make it possible for most Americans to file their taxes on a simple postcard; we can level the playing field for business and help them compete better globally; and we can empower entrepreneurs and small businesses, encouraging them to create more jobs.  This budget acknowledges that our economy is in desperate need of a jolt, and the tax cuts included in the Senate-passed budget hold that promise of doing just that. Put simply, we have the opportunity to make history by reforming our tax system for the first time in nearly three decades.  President Trump is with us on this, and I agree that we must move quickly, and that is why I urge my colleagues to pass this budget today.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  0915  ",CREC-2017-10-26-pt1-PgH8230-3.txt,2063,CIVIL RIGHTS,2017.0,26.0,October

1010,topic-id,492,"Mr.Speaker, it is now my honor to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.McClintock), a member of the Budget  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, unsustainable government spending drives both taxes and debt.  The budget resolution sets the spending architecture for the fiscal year. The House version provided for $200 billion of enforceable mandatory spending reductions over 10 years and balanced within the decade. The Senate amendments gut these provisions, squandering the one opportunity Congress has each year to bring mandatory spending under control, taking us another year closer to a sovereign debt crisis. This is tragic, and I condemn it in the strongest terms.  The Senate, though, has retained just one key provision from the House budget. It makes tax reform possible this year. Tax reform is essential to economic growth, and economic growth is essential to confront our debt.  Many are alarmed that it provides for $1.5 trillion of additional debt, but this is due solely to the Senate's rules that require tax cuts to be scored only as revenue losses without taking into account economic expansion.  During the Obama years, our economy grew at an average of 1\1/2\ percent, annually. That is about half the average rate since World War Reagan averaged 3\1/2\ percent. Reagan did this by reducing the tax burdens that were crushing our economy. He slashed the top income tax rate from 70 percent down to 28 percent, and income tax receipts nearly doubled because of the economic expansion he unleashed.  Taxes driven by spending are the greatest threat to our economy today, and debt driven by spending is the greatest threat to our future. Controlling spending is currently impossible in the So it is obvious that we can't balance the budget and reduce our debt without significantly increasing economic growth; we can't increase economic growth without tax relief; and we can't get tax relief without the provisions in the Senate budget.  Arthur Laffer, the architect of the Reagan tax policy, forecasts that the corporate tax reform alone will increase GDP growth at a rate that should generate a temporary bump of 5 percent, settling down to an average of 2.6 percent over the decade. This will add $5 trillion to the American economy and directly increase revenues to all levels of government between $1.8 trillion and $2 trillion.  We have tried a static approach to tax policy during the Obama years. The economy stagnated and the debt doubled.  I remember what it was like in the Reagan era. Wages were rising and opportunities for better jobs were everywhere. There was a sense of optimism that comes with prosperity and abundance. When we abandoned these policies, we lost that prosperity to a decade of despair.  I want my kids to know what that sense of relief and optimism was like, what it feels like when morning dawns again on the American economy. This resolution starts that transformation, and I urge its adoption.  ",CREC-2017-10-26-pt1-PgH8230-3.txt,2063,BANKRUPTCY JUDGESHIP ACT OF 2017,2017.0,26.0,October

Certainly they have not received $2,500 in their pocket.  They were told they could keep their doctor, which we knew wasn't true, and the other kinds of things that were done that caused people to lose their insurance in my very own State, because we had a plan the people liked and people wanted to keep but could not because of the mandates that were put on by the Affordable Care                              {time}  0945  I want to remind my friends from the other side of the aisle that maybe the thing to do is to wait and see what really is in the plan, because the devil is in the detail, and I think you may like it enough that you perhaps will even vote for this tax plan that does give a jolt to the economy and does help the American people, especially in the lower- and middle-income, to keep more of their hard-earned dollars in their pockets.

But what is not in dispute is it will add $1.5 trillion to the national debt and up to $4 trillion in cuts to programs Americans care deeply about, like Medicaid and  There is a better way. I spent much of this last weekend in Orlando, Florida, with leaders of the American Trucking These are people who understand the infrastructure crisis America faces because they and their employees deal with it every single day. Instead of cutting transportation funding or having some mythical program without details, they are willing to step up and invest more, raising their fuel taxes--they already pay about half the total cost of the Highway Trust Fund--to be able to make a difference.  And I would hope that Congress will look at that example, listen to those people, and be able to do its part.  In no small measure, because of the leadership of many small businesses and trucking associations around the country, over half the States, since 2012, have stepped up to raise their transportation resources, and the States are seeing the benefit. They are seeing the economic impact of the construction, and it is making a difference on the ground for people and communities.  It is important that the Federal Government does its part. We need to be there for projects that are multimodal, that are multi-State, and multiyear. That Federal partnership has played a vital role since the enactment of the Interstate Highway System in 1956.  The trucking industry was able to make the point that the public is already paying the cost, about $1,500 a year extra cost for the typical family for car maintenance and congestion.  The transportation industry is paying some $63 billion of cost every year due to congestion. For about $2 a week, from the average family, we could take critical steps to make sure that we address this infrastructure funding crisis.  If people really want to have some congressional action that will put people to work at family wage jobs, not the disputed trickle-down economics, it is undisputable that every $1.2 billion invested in infrastructure creates almost 30,000 jobs.                              {time}  1015  It creates almost about $2 billion of economic activity. For each $1.2 billion invested, it will reduce the deficit $200 million.  Mr.Speaker, it is past time that this Congress stops shirking its responsibility. We ought to be in partnership not just with the truckers, but with AAA, engineers, contractors, construction unions, local government, the vast array, the largest coalition of groups dealing with a controversial issue before If we would give 2 weeks to hear from these leaders across the country of this broad coalition, the case would be made and I think Congress would finally step up and do its job.  Our partners in the private sector, in State and local government, and people in the communities can expect Congress to be a partner to make our communities more livable, to make our families safer, healthier, and more economically secure.  I hope when some of our friends from the trucking industry join us this week on Capitol Hill, that Members will listen to their case and be able to have the courage to step up and invest in[[Page H8081]]our future.

702,topic-id,609,"Mr.Speaker, the exercise my Republican friends are going through with their budget and tax cut proposal would be amusing if the consequences were not so serious.  Coming to Congress, I worked hard to earn a position on the House Ways and Means Committee, which has been the focal point for critical decisions in the past dealing with tax reform, with Social I respected its historic role and the way that its members worked together in a thoughtful and bipartisan basis.  Unfortunately, unlike what has happened for other major tax reform efforts, currently there has been no effort for laying the groundwork, working with people in both parties, dealing with the hard decisions that are necessary for tax reform that will move our country forward. My Republican friends refuse to deal with the heavy legislative lifting necessary for true reform.  In fact, my Republican friends now have given up on tax reform. They are rushing through, in a matter of days, not reform but as big a tax cut as they can possibly get, predicated on strong-arming their Members with narrow control in Congress and disregarding the fundamentals of responsible budgeting.  The budget resolution that the House will soon be considering by the Republicans to enact their tax cut via the process known as reconciliation is a fantasy. Read it carefully. It is predicated on increasing our national debt $1.5 trillion, when previously they promised that their tax reform would be budget neutral.  It is predicated on $4 trillion of unspecified budget cuts that will be concentrated on Medicare, Medicaid, and the other programs that Americans care the most deeply about.  The proof for this fantasy is the fact that even though Republicans have an ironclad grip on the appropriations process in both the House and the Senate and they don't have to worry about filibusters, they don't need any Democratic votes at all, but they still cannot summon the courage of their convictions to implement the beginning of this strategy.  It doesn't have to wait for 2 or 4 or 10 years. They could start now with the[[Page H8153]]budget cutting that they are relying upon for this fantasy budget, but they know that the American people won't stand for it and their own Members wouldn't vote for those cuts now even though there is nothing stopping them.  That is why it is absolutely essential that, even if they are modestly successful with this reckless agenda, that we take steps to prevent the resulting fiscal train wreck, because we have seen deficits explode in the past where rosy projections about economic growth and stern budget cuts fail to materialize.  The landmark 1986 tax reform legislation, the last time we had real tax reform, by the way, predicated on bipartisan cooperation and a lot of hard work, had no discernible impact on economic growth, even though it was, in fact, worth it.  As a result, I will be offering standalone legislation and amendments in the Ways and Means Committee to establish a circuit breaker that will suspend the tax cuts if the rosy projections fail to materialize. If deficits explode and budgets are not cut according to their plan, then the American people should be spared the economic chaos by calling a timeout and rolling back these reckless proposals, allowing us to catch our breath and hopefully develop better policy based on bipartisanship and facts, not fantasy.  America deserves a far-better vision than the Republican budget fantasy and the reckless tax cuts that they are pushing so hard to enact. At a minimum, we should have a circuit breaker to stop it if they can't follow through on their promises.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-25-pt1-PgH8152-2.txt,99,DISASTER RELIEF,2017.0,25.0,October
617,topic-id,999,"Mr.President, I am honored to follow my colleague from Minnesota, who has made many of the same arguments very eloquently that my colleagues have made as we approach a vote literally in the dead of night. There is a reason for the timing of this vote.  My Republican colleagues would much rather have it done past the deadline for the newspapers, out of the public eye, because most Americans would be repulsed by the idea that they are losing fundamental rights, and what could be more fundamental than the right to go to court. That is the right that will be lost to countless Americans if this vote in favor of 47 succeeds tonight. It would literally repeal the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's arbitration rule using the Congressional Review  Most Americans will discover this repugnant step when they go to their lawyer's office, and they state their grievance, their harm, their cause of action, and their lawyer looks at a contract or some other piece of paper, which has in fine print a forced arbitration clause. That forced arbitration clause, in effect, blocks the courthouse door. It denies them their day in court. It compels them to go before a group of people--often, the majority selected by the big company they want to sue. At best, the result is to give them less to remedy the wrong against them than they suffered in harm.  Often, the lawyer will say: You know, this effort is going to cost you more than you will gain. In good consciousness, I must tell you that you will not recover as much as you have to pay me, and that is because those consumers cannot join together in arbitration as they can in a class action. Often, it is because the cost of going to court individually, even if they win, will be more than they would gain in arbitration. It is done in secret, when their case is arbitrated, so others cannot be warned about a similar harm in a product or a service they are about to purchase and suffer the same harm or wrong.  A vote in favor of this resolution is a vote in favor of predatory lending. It is a vote in favor of wage theft. It is a vote in favor of sexual harassment. It is a vote in favor of medical malpractice. It is a vote in favor of denying millions of Americans a fundamental right to a day in court.  Without the promise of justice from the courts, few consumers can even think about undertaking the cost of an attorney or take on the tremendous effort of bringing those individual actions against service providers.  The harm falls, tragically, particularly on our veterans. I commend and thank Holly Petraeus for her profoundly significant work to alert our veterans and all of us to those harms. These abusive practices harm our veterans more than others because they trust the abusive pitches that come at them as they are about to leave Active Duty or sometimes while they are on Active Duty or shortly after they leave. They have no control over where they are deployed or even where they are based, but the con artists and big corporations can come after them. They know where they are. They are targets of opportunity.  In one stunning example--just to give one--documented by the New York Times not long ago, a sergeant in the Army National Guard who was serving in Iraq said that men came to his house and improperly repossessed his car, threatening his wife with jail time if she didn't give them the keys. Appallingly, this sergeant received no restitution. His case was discarded because his contract with the auto lender included a forced arbitration clause. That is the practical harm resulting from these causes.  Wells Fargo has been mentioned as an example of how contracts, in effect, are forced on people without their knowledge for accounts, contracts for insurance that were put on their loans without their knowledge.  Equifax, in the height of arrogance--the remedy offered to consumers had a forced arbitration clause as part of their acceptance of a remedy for the harm done by Equifax itself. You can't make this stuff up. You cannot create the fiction that matches this reality for abuse and harm to consumers.  Repealing this rule strips consumers of one of their only avenues of relief[[Page S6753]]from careless negligence or a slow response to harm. In the case of Equifax, unfortunately, it probably will not be the last.  The CFPB rule draws a line in the sand. It puts consumers on a level playing field. It eliminates a provision that in law school was often identified as a contract of adhesion, where one side has such power over the other that they can dictate the terms, inherently unfairly, to the consumer. It demands that those consumers be treated fairly.  Repealing this rule would allow companies like Equifax and Wells Fargo to have their run of the contracts in America, repeat the harms that have caused such widespread consumer harm, and let them off the hook. I urge my colleagues to reject this dangerous rollback of rights. It may be welcomed by some corporations, but in their hearts, as well as their minds, the vast majority of companies want to do the right thing. The outliers are the ones supporting this rule.  It would not eliminate arbitration where both sides feel it is in their mutual interests; it would simply eliminate that fine print that enables those rip-off clauses that harm our veterans--people who fight for our fundamental rights. One of those fundamental rights--access to justice--is barred by this resolution.  I hope my colleagues will reject it, enable consumers to hold financial institutions accountable, and continue the work of the CFPB in making sure that consumers really receive a fair shake when they enter into a contract.

619,topic-id,385,"I thank my colleague from Rhode Island for that very pertinent question. Before I answer it, I thank him for his service as his State's attorney general and his State's U.attorney. He has as much experience as I do, and I know he appreciates that there are countless examples of exactly the kind of predicament he has so well described.  The harm to each individual may be measured in tens of dollars, but the harm nationally to consumers may be measured in millions of dollars. If each of those consumers is forced to arbitrate, the result at best would be a few dollars to each of them, and most of them will abandon the claim because the services of an attorney or even the time they have to take to appear before a panel of arbitrators simply won't be worth it.  The harm is not only to them, as my friend and colleague from Rhode Island has implied so well, it is to the consumers of the future because without public knowledge of the defective product or the predatory lending or the sexual harassment, that same harm will happen again and again.  To take the topic of the day, sexual harassment, many of those employment clauses had the forced arbitration requirement that led to settlements and secrecy. For years and years, that harm was repeated to women who suffered because they were unaware of the harm about to befall them.  It is a human tragedy, not just a financial tragedy, that often befalls consumers because of those fine-print arbitration clauses that consumers very often never even consider because at the time they sign the contract, they are not thinking about what can go wrong; they are buying a car or a product that seems just fine, or they are entering into a new job, or, as in the case of a veteran, they are signing up for a for-profit college, and they scarcely expect they will be, in effect, victims of these forced arbitration clauses.  So the answer to my colleague's question, as he knows because he himself is such an expert in consumer protection, is a resounding yes. This rule is necessary to protect consumers against those kinds of harms, which, when added nationally, can be tremendously costly to our Nation as a whole.

809,topic-id,1277,"Mr.President, I want to begin by paying tribute to the people of Puerto Rico, who have been through unimaginable disaster--a natural disaster not of their making and a financial disaster that is not any more their fault than the hurricane they have endured. They have persevered and, indeed, now are surviving and even thriving, despite the hurdles placed in their way by the humongous storm that destroyed parts of their island. In fact, even now, at least a quarter of their water is undrinkable, more than 80 percent of their electricity is down, many of their roads are unpassable, their schools are largely closed, and their island is paralyzed or, at least, largely paralyzed as far as economic progress and job creation are concerned.  They don't deserve this fate. They are They fought in our wars. I have been privileged to spend time with the Borinqueneers and led the effort to award them a Congressional Gold Medal as a sign of their patriotism and their dedication to our country.

I want to recognize their courage, sacrifice, and service to our  The National Guard from Connecticut has gone to the island to help with National Guard from at least 13 There are thousands of them now, and they are working with men and women on the ground from FEMA, the Department of Energy, the Department of Homeland Security generally, and our military. They deserve our thanks. Yet, for all that heroic work, this Nation is failing Puerto Americans are on the verge of failing fellow  Puerto Rico has a population of about 3.4 million people, roughly the size of If the humanitarian crisis now ongoing in Puerto Rico had occurred in Connecticut, there would be an outcry and outrage of unprecedented proportion, comparable to a public surge of criticism unseen before. Yet the people of Puerto Rico endure this humanitarian crisis seemingly without response.  The President of the United States gives himself a 10. I agree. He deserves a 10 if the grading scale is 1 to 100 because barely one-tenth--in fact, less than one-tenth of what this Nation owes to Puerto Rico--has been done for them.  I flew over the island of Puerto Rico in a Sikorsky Black Hawk during a recent bipartisan trip and saw out of the side of that Black Hawk the devastation and destruction I never thought I would see in Whole towns were flattened, homes razed to the ground, community centers destroyed, power lines dangling and down. I heard from the Corps of Engineers that there is no timetable to repair those lines, to restore electricity, which is the lifeblood of civilization and essential to bare economic functioning, let alone progress going forward, which is what the island needs. From what I hear, which families have told me, the shortages of food, water, and medicine persist. The hospitals depend on generators that are sometimes nonfunctional, and medicine is lacking in those hospitals.  What is at stake in Puerto Rico is really our humanity. In the midst of this humanitarian crisis, what is challenged is our humanity, not just the legality or the protocols but our basic instinct to help fellow Americans when they need it.  This Nation should not have a double standard for disaster relief. The Americans of Puerto Rico deserve what Connecticut would receive. I have stood in Connecticut with our Puerto Rican community. We are proud of the fact that we have more Puerto Ricans per capita than any other State in the country. That community has given back to Connecticut and has contributed to our quality of life. And we are proud of all of our Puerto Ricans who came from the island in past generations or recently. I stood with Gladys Rivera, who lived in Connecticut, went to Puerto Rico, and has just come back; with the Bermudez family, who have deep ties and family there and here; with Jason Ortiz, who is in charge of the Puerto Rican And I could list many others. They have given me a picture of the humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico that speaks to my heart--families who continue to suffer and endure these hardships.  The measure we are passing today is a tiny downpayment on what is needed for Puerto It is a short-term, very small sign of what we owe. It is a downpayment that must be followed by a much bigger long-term commitment, a Marshall Plan that will enable the island to not just repair the power lines or the roads but to rebuild with different kinds of power--renewables and solar--and not be dependent on diesel or coal. It will enable them to build stronger, more resilient structures, whether homes or commercial buildings, that can withstand future hurricanes. What is needed in Puerto Rico is not just repair but true rebuilding and recovery--and not just the physical structures but the sense of financial stability and pride.  So the pittance in this supplemental for Puerto Rico is the least we can do. In fact, it is less than the least we can do because it actually adds to the debt Puerto Rico now has. It adds $5 billion to the $74 billion that is owed by Puerto It does nothing about the bankruptcy of PREPA, the power company. It in no way alleviates the financial burdens of debt; in fact, it adds to it.  Instinctively, we in this Chamber know we have an obligation to do more. There have been enough reports to fill this Record today about the courage of Puerto Rico and about the burdens it has to endure. We have seen and heard enough to know that a longer term plan is necessary, a Marshall Stronger leadership is necessary. Leadership has been lacking.  I have proposed a disaster relief czar who can cut through the redtape and the bureaucratic lack of cohesion and get this job done, someone who can tell the Corps of Engineers what the deadlines are and bring together the leadership of Puerto Rico and give them the empowering authority in resources, not just in words.  I also call for the CDC to be engaged more actively and effectively because Puerto Rico now faces a potential epidemic of mosquito-borne diseases: Dengue fever, Zika, chikungunya. The standing pools of water throughout the island--and I have seen them--pose a real public health threat at a time when the island is ill-equipped to deal with it.  I have begun working with my colleagues on a longer term plan because this measure must be followed by stronger, more robust steps. The damage done to the island was in the range of $100 billion.

It seemed to me very clear that the President and those of us who are advocating tax cuts right now are on the same wavelength, which is, let's have tax cuts for hard-working families, and let's do the other things we need to do in the Tax Code to ensure that those very same families have better jobs.  As I said on the floor of the Senate last week, there are two ways to increase take-home pay. One is to start taking less out of the paychecks people are getting now, and another one is to give them an even better paycheck in the future. We need to look at both of those ways to increase the opportunity for working families and working individuals.  We are now into the eighth year of almost no economic growth. If there is no economic growth, there is very little incentive for your job to be a better paying job than it was the previous year no matter what has happened to your other costs, and we clearly see that happening.  We are into the first year of this new administration. We are looking at 3 percent annual growth after 8 years in which growth didn't exceed 2 percent. Anytime you begin to talk like an economist, people begin to wonder: Well, what does that have to do with me? Let me just say that for taxpayers generally, for working families generally, the more growth you have, one, the more revenue that comes in that takes care of problems like the deficit. The way you take care of those problems--the best way--is to grow the economy. Two, people are much more focused on keeping the workforce they have, getting the best of the workforce that is coming on board as their workforce moves on for retirement or relocates or does other things.  Three percent economic growth is not good enough. The post-World War II average--that is more than seven decades now of average--is, I think, almost 3\1/2\ percent. There are very few economic problems in our country that wouldn't be made substantially better, including our own Federal deficit, if we see growth exceed or even get to the 70-year average. There is no reason to believe that can't happen.  Yesterday, the President was talking about the two ways to immediately relieve pressures on families. One is more take-home pay, and two is a better job that also increases take-home pay. But the first step we can achieve immediately by the kind of tax relief we need.  There have been 8 years of stagnant wages. Half of the families in the country are living paycheck to paycheck. Very few families can face an emergency that is even $500 without having to restructure what they are doing and how they are doing it. We can do a better job at this. We need more jobs. We need higher wages. And the two principal goals of this tax bill should be to do exactly that--create more wages now, more take-home pay now, and create an environment in which we are going to be more competitive. Simplifying the Tax Code is one way to meet that first impact, having a tax code that people understand better, that they think is fairer.  A tax code where people think they are being treated fairly is much more likely to be complied with than a tax code where people see that somebody else who makes the same amount of money as they make is paying a lot less taxes than they are paying. The American tax system is probably the greatest voluntary compliance. Sure, there are laws that require people to comply, but most people are never impacted by those laws. They know they could be, but the American people have shown a willingness to pay their fair share if they know that their fair share is, in fact, their fair share. A simpler tax system, a more easily understood tax system, a system that has fewer than the seven different tax brackets that people pay today are things we can and should achieve.  Doubling the standard deduction helps a lot when people look at the $12,000 deduction they have now. For a couple, as they look at that deduction and realize that deduction, that standard deduction, has doubled, suddenly, if you are a couple filing jointly, you are not paying any taxes on the first $24,000 you earn. If you are a single individual, you are not paying any taxes on the first $12,000 you earn. Keeping enough of the family-benefiting exemptions helps make the family do what the family would like to do. What if they would like to give to their church and charity? There is no discussion saying we wouldn't keep the standard charitable deduction as a deduction. There is no discussion that we wouldn't keep home mortgage as a deduction so we are encouraging homeownership or looking at how to make the child tax credit bigger rather than smaller.  Many of the early analyses of what this Tax Code would do say that for a family of four, they would pay more than they are paying now up to certain income level. Generally, that will turn out not to be the case--certainly, at the middle-income levels and below if you factor in the child tax credit, which hasn't been determined yet.  Our tax-writing committee will be looking at that child tax credit as an important addition to the individual exemptions because it costs money to raise kids. The Congress surely should understand that, appreciate that, and factor that into the deductions. Just like we are doubling the deduction for individual earners, we also have to look at what that child tax credit should look like.  Tax policies that benefit homeownership, tax policies that encourage contributing to charities and community activities and church and synagogue and mosque--your religious activities--all would continue to be a part of this Tax  Also, when talking about sending kids to school, one way to not have student debt is to encourage families to have ways to better prepare for what they, in most cases, would hope would be a goal or an expenditure their family would make. We can do things like expanding the Pell grants for poor families, but for families who don't qualify for that, we can do things that allow the deduction early on for putting money in a fund that prepares people to go to school.  Keeping well-paying jobs at home and encouraging more jobs to come here is also an important part of the goal. You can't have the highest corporate rate in the world and expect that you are going to be as competitive as you would be with other countries. A corporate rate of 35 percent, in 1986, was fairly near the middle when that rate was arrived at with President Reagan and others working on it the last time we did a tax rewrite, and right in the middle is about where we should be. However, now the situation is we see that right in the middle is no[[Page S6788]]longer 35 percent; it is about 20 percent. Ireland just revised its 15 percent rate to 8 percent. Great Britain is reducing their rate to a little less than 20 percent. They have been, I think, a little more than 20 percent. We need to be sure the products we make here and the jobs that are created here--that there is a competitive ability to sell that same product anywhere in the world, with the advantage, obviously, of being made by our great workforce but also an advantage where our tax system doesn't work us out of the marketplace, doesn't make us less competitive.  A territorial tax system will be one of the things we are going to hear talked about a lot. For most of us, that doesn't seem to have any impact. We earn our money here, we pay our taxes here, but we also want to be sure that if American companies sell products somewhere else and earn money there, that they can, should, and would bring that money back to the United States to reinvest it in the kinds of things that create jobs here.  I think this doesn't have to be all that complicated. We need to understand what the core principles are. We need to get to those core principles. We need to get this done this year so people are planning, in the first months of next year, on how to take advantage of a new, simpler, fairer, and more competitive Tax This needs to be job one of this Congress for the next few weeks. We need to get that done so job one for the country, beginning at the end of this debate, is what we can do to create more and better jobs and create more take-home pay for hard-working families.  I am joined by some of my colleagues who are going to talk about this same topic, I hope, and others. We need to be focused. I can tell, with the President's comments yesterday, he is focused on this. We are focused on this. This is a job we need to get done.  I yield the floor.

I have met with DREAMers in my State of Oregon, and tearing them away from their lives would be a tremendous loss for our communities. DREAMers like Daniel, a dedicated second grade teacher, DACA allowed him to come out of the shadows and give back to his community.  But with President Trump ending DACA, Daniel is rightly anxious about his future. He worries about the effect on his students if he is forced to leave abruptly in the middle of the school year.  When we threaten DREAMers, we put their futures at risk, but we also risk harming the many people who rely on them, like Daniel's students.  Mr.Speaker, we must work together and pass the Dream Act immediately. We just pledged, ``with liberty and justice for all.''

906,topic-id,505,"Mr.Speaker, I am pleased to be on the floor this morning to introduce bipartisan legislation with my colleague on the Education and Workforce Committee, Congressman Drew Ferguson from  Our bill, Promoting Apprenticeships Through Regional Training Networks for Employers' Required Skills Act, or PARTNERS Act, will help close the skills gap by increasing opportunities for small- and medium-sized businesses to establish apprenticeships and work-based learning programs.  When I visit communities in northwest Oregon, I hear from many Oregonians who still feel left behind because they don't have the skills they need to compete in today's economy. They are not alone. Many jobs today do not require a 4-year degree, but do require more than a high school diploma. In fact, those jobs make up about 53 percent of today's labor market, but only 43 percent of today's workers are trained at this level.  This creates a skills gap, leaving businesses struggling to find workers with appropriate skills, and workers without meaningful pathways to better paying jobs.  I hear from employers and workforce organizations about the importance of a qualified workforce. They want to identify new opportunities to strengthen skills training.  Apprenticeships and work-based learning programs are a win-win. They provide individuals with paid, on-the-job training and classroom instruction. Employers can align training with the skills they need at their workplaces, and workers can learn while they earn.  Unfortunately, small- and medium-sized businesses often lack the infrastructure and resources to establish apprenticeships or work-based learning programs on their own. So the PARTNERS Act addresses this by establishing a grant program to support the creation and expansion of industry and sector partnerships that will help small-and medium-sized businesses develop work-based learning programs and provide support programs for workers.  Industry and sector partnerships will bring together employers, education, training, labor, and community-based organizations to develop work-based learning programs that benefit workers and the economy as a whole.  In Oregon, these partnerships could address, for example, workforce development needs in rapidly growing sectors like healthcare and technology.  Under the PARTNERS Act, the partnerships would use grant funds to recruit workers, develop training curriculum, and provide workers with access to tools, work attire, transportation, childcare services, and mentorship support. These support services help businesses retain employees and help workers balance caring for and providing for their families.  Importantly, Mr.Speaker, this bill results in no additional cost to taxpayers because it authorizes the use of 50 percent of the funds deposited in the H1-B nonimmigrant petition account, and these will be used by the Department of Labor for the partnership grants. This funding source was suggested by the administration in a June 2017 executive order on apprenticeships.  Through stronger investments and work-based learning programs, we can build pathways to get more people back to work, to provide our Nation's businesses with the workforce that will improve productivity and efficiency.  I thank Mr.Ferguson for his leadership, and I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this bipartisan legislation that will help people in our districts across the country access good jobs.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-25-pt1-PgH8151-2.txt,2092,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,25.0,October
802,topic-id,1346,"Mr.President, I am grateful to be joining with a lot of my colleagues today to talk about the urgency and the importance of what has happened in the aftermath of horrific hurricanes--Hurricane Harvey more than 2 months ago and Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria over a month ago. They have wreaked havoc on millions of lives. They have destroyed billions of dollars of property. They have created pain, suffering, and loss--loss of life everywhere from Texas, to Florida, to Puerto Rico, to the U.Virgin  Right now, too many of our citizens are still living in not just unacceptable conditions for an American, but they are really living on the brink of homelessness--food and water insecurity, scarcity, and facing the ravages of poverty, where you have lost everything and you are in a dependent state, dependent upon relief aid, dependent upon your neighbors.  Thousands of families have lost everything, and I believe they have yet to receive the kind of support they deserve from their government. Governments were formed in this country. This Nation was founded on this ideal of common defense. It is literally written into our founding documents, this idea that we are coming together for the protection and the strength of our communities. Right now, we are not doing enough, and that is not the American way.  I have seen it. During the storm that hit New Jersey, Superstorm Sandy, I still remember seeing us at our best, seeing neighbors open their homes, reaching out to one another. They were Americans standing up for Americans and not worrying about what their political parties were, not worrying about the risk there might be to themselves.  In fact, I still remember, as the storm was still raging, driving around my city in an SUV, checking in. I was coming up a hill, and I got a call from the President of the United States checking in on As the hurricane was beginning to leave, as the superstorm was beginning to leave, I got a call right after that from Governor Chris Christie expressing the same empathy, the same concern, checking in to see how I was doing.  I remember coming up on a hill, and just as I was finishing the last of those two conversations--talking to the most powerful person on the planet, the President, and the most powerful person in our State, the Governor; two different parties, two different backgrounds, but they are Americans--I remember coming up to a street corner where a massive tree had fallen, had torn down lines, and I saw a person in a raincoat standing there by the lines trying to wave me by to make sure my SUV didn't hit what could have been a live wire. I pulled the car over to the side in the wind and the rain, and I saw that it was an elderly man standing there in the streets feeling as if it was his obligation to protect his community. I stood there in the rain and looked at this elderly, African-American man who was standing there trying to protect people who were driving through and thought to myself: I talked to the most powerful guy in the country. I talked to the most powerful person in my But the true power that I saw was in an American who was working to take care of his community in a time of trial.  That was the spirit that stayed with me and lifted me during this crisis when I was staying up day after day--seeing his commitment to his community.  Martin Luther King said so eloquently that the ultimate measure of a man--and I would like to expand that and change that for a second--the ultimate measure of a person is not where they stand in moments of comfort and convenience but where they stand at times of challenge and controversy. That is where we are right now.  Tens of millions of us are very comfortable right now. This is a time of comfort and convenience for many. I got up this morning, I turned on my shower, and hot water came out. When I opened my fridge, there was food there. But how can we sit idly by while there is an urgency going on of epic proportions?  Let me tell you about Puerto As my friend from Florida said, 80 percent of their island remains without power. I saw firsthand what 1 week without power did in my community. It literally led to the deaths of people--not the storm itself, but the lack of power was directly related to the deaths in the city of which I was mayor. There are people who don't have access to things we take for granted, whether it be a bank account or food. It was profoundly stated by my colleague that just access to clean water--right now, there are people who are falling ill and dying in Puerto Rico because of a lack of access to clean water. Sanitation systems, water, roads, bridges, electric grids--all of these urgently need Federal investment.  One of my staffers has a son who is a medic in the Puerto Rico National Guard, and he has told her that people in hospitals have died. The loss of life, the loss of American lives--our fellow citizens have died because of their lack of access to electricity and the lack of access to oxygen.  We are I know our character. I know our spirit. But right now, there are hundreds of thousands of people in our country who are suffering. They may not be proximate to us in geography; they may not be next to us in sight. But the spirit we need right now is the spirit of that man standing in the storm, watching over his neighbors, watching over people passing through, being there for their own.  We have work to do. We have an urgency. Where children are suffering without the basics, where schools are closed, where crops have been destroyed, where access to food has been destroyed, we have work to do. So my sense of urgency right now is believing that, as a first step, we must have a comprehensive aid package--not just to help our fellow Americans in Florida and Texas where there are urgent crises still going on. The gravity of the pain and suffering in the Virgin Islands and in Puerto Rico right now is unimaginable for those of us who are not experiencing it, and it is unacceptable for us, as Americans, not to be there for our fellow citizens.  We are just 5 days away from the fifth anniversary of the storm that hit New Jersey, and we have made great strides in New Jersey over the past 5 years. But the reality is that today in New Jersey, we are still recovering from that storm.  This is going to be a long process, an urgent process. It is going to be a process that necessitates resilience, necessitates endurance, and necessitates persistence. But it starts with this body, the Congress of the United States of America, putting together an aid package that includes direct grant funding for rebuilding our country. For Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, it[[Page S6725]]must include making sure the island is strong enough. From telecommunications, to energy sources, to schools, we must make sure that the aid package includes all that is necessary for these islands to stand up again and get to work for the many months and years to come of rebuilding.  I support my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I am encouraged by the spirit I encountered that night, having a Democratic President and Republican Governor call me as concerned But the spirit I call on tonight is that of the elderly Black guy on a street in a storm who said: The storms may howl; the rain may come; the water may rise.

594,topic-id,2660,"Mr.President, what Congress is trying to do today, this evening, as long as it takes, as long as the arms are twisted, is frankly outrageous. Our job is to look out for the people whom we serve, not to look out for Wells Fargo, not to look out for Equifax, not to look out for Wall Street banks, not to look out for corporations who scam consumers.  Forced arbitration, pure and simple, takes power away from ordinary people. It gives it to the big banks, it gives it to Equifax, it gives it to Wells Fargo, it gives it to Wall Street companies that already have an unfair advantage. We know the White House increasingly looks like a retreat for Wall Street executives. I would hope the Senate wouldn't follow suit.  Look at In early September, we learned it compromised the personal data of more than 145 million Americans'--5 million in my State, probably twice that in the Presiding Officer's State--names, dates of birth, addresses, Social Security numbers, driver's licenses, more than half the adult population of the United States of  So how did Equifax respond? By immediately trying to trick customers--their consumers, their customers--into signing away their rights to access the court system in exchange for credit monitoring.  So here is what Equifax did in simple terms. Equifax said: Oh, we will give you a free year of credit monitoring; sign right here. Oh, yeah, when you sign right here, the fine print says: but you can't ever sue us. You have to go through this forced arbitration, which of course almost nobody does, almost nobody understands, and almost no consumer ever wins. Only after Senators and consumer groups led a public outcry did they back down.  We sat in the Banking Committee and listened to the just-retired CEO of Equifax and then the next week listened to the trade association where the CEO of the trade association, who wasn't paid the tens of millions of dollars, I assume, that the retired CEO of Equifax was--the recently retired because he didn't do his job, even though he was getting all kinds of compensation. There is more on that later.  They backed down from this idea of forced arbitration because the public said: You basically have to be kidding. You are going to defraud 145 million people, and then they are going to sign something and the fine print says: Sorry, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, you can't sue us. So they backed down.  Then he said he was going to give up his bonus. That was really generous when he made in 2016 and 2017--as Senator Crapo and I in the Banking Committee talked about today--he made about $140 million in those 2 years, which is not real difficult math. There were 145 million people scammed, and the CEO, not doing his job, made $140 million, so that is about a dollar per ``scamee.'' I know that is not a word, but it sort of fits.  You would think after public shaming, Equifax would have learned its lesson. So last week Equifax again was just abusing the public trust. You wonder why people are cynical or people are skeptical. People are so frustrated about Wall Street and about financial services in this country because you have these multigazillionaires--again, in 2 years, he made $140 million. Well, you have these very wealthy executives who think they are doing us a favor because they are giving back their bonus. They already have $100 million in their pocket, and that is just in the last 2 years. Who knows how far it goes back.  So they sent a representative to testify in front of the Banking Do you know what he said when we asked him--I asked him and others asked him--he still thinks it is appropriate for Equifax and the other credit bureaus to use forced arbitration clauses that prevent Americans they have hurt from having their day in court. He seemed to learn nothing from this. Even after the huge harm Equifax has caused 145 million Americans, 5 million Ohioans, they still defend their use of forced arbitration clauses.  Why do they like them so much? Why are they willing to stand strong and to hold on to their right to forced arbitration? Because they make so much money from forced arbitration because it keeps that power relationship. When Wall Street has all the power and 145 million consumers have almost no power--that is why they like forced arbitration and that is why they are turning the heat up on all of my colleagues here to stand strong for the banks, for Wall Street, for Equifax, for Wells Fargo, for forced arbitration. That is  Let's take a look at Wells In 2013, they used a forced arbitration clause to silence a customer who had accused the company of opening fake accounts in his name. I will say that again. They used a forced arbitration clause to silence a customer who had accused the company of opening fake accounts in his name. Well, it turns out this customer was not just right, but we found out Wells Fargo opened 3.5 million of these fake accounts. Think about that. You have a relationship with a bank, and it happens to be Wells Fargo, which used to have a really good reputation as one of America's largest Wall Street banks--and neighborhood banks too. There are 6 million, if I am right, 6 million community banks, as they like to say. There are 6 million little branch offices in everybody's neighborhood.  So this bank took relationships they had with their customers, and they opened accounts pretty much for 3.5 million of their customers--accounts they never approved. Say you had a checking account with them. They went and opened another checking account in your name and didn't tell you. That is what they did.  So then they subjected their employees who opened those accounts to harsh sales goals. That is what they did--harsh sales goals. They threatened to fire anyone who didn't keep up. Here is the forced arbitration. Because Wells Fargo had the power of the forced arbitration clause, they were able to sweep this 2013 lawsuit under the rug, allowing the scandal to continue for years.  So go back to that. In 2013, if that customer didn't have that forced arbitration--which that customer didn't even know he or she signed. When they[[Page S6739]]wanted to sue, they found out they couldn't sue because they had signed, in the really small print that almost nobody reads--I am not a lawyer, and I don't know if I could understand that small print. I know many Americans can't. So that person couldn't sue.  Imagine if that person had been able to sue in an open court and then in discovery they had found out: Oh, my gosh. Wells Fargo opened 3.5 million of these accounts. Maybe we ought to do something about it. Instead, because of forced arbitration, the public didn't find out about what Wells Fargo had done until about 3 years later. So think of the damage. Maybe it wasn't 3.5 million cases--maybe they didn't open 3.5 million in 2013. Maybe it was only a million there, but every month they opened more and more and more fake accounts, false accounts, because nobody could sue because they were forced into arbitration, and arbitration always happens in a back room somewhere. Nobody really knows it is going on.  Again, think how much damage could have been prevented if that customer was allowed to take Wells Fargo to open court 4 years ago. When the scandal was finally brought to light, customers found out that forced arbitration was such a powerful tool for Wells Fargo and others and that it was all without their consent.  The Economic Policy Institute studied people who went into arbitration with Wells They found out, on average--now, most people don't even try with arbitration. They just give up because it is only a few dollars, but those courageous souls or angry customers who actually went into arbitration, ended up--they didn't just lose and not win any money from Wells Fargo, they, on the average, had to pay Wells Fargo--maybe we would call it, in layman's terms, a countersuit in some sense--they had to pay Wells Fargo an average of $11,000.  So they can't sue under Federal law. They have lost their day in court, under Federal law, because of this forced arbitration law. So they went to arbitration, and Wells Fargo, with their very smart, very well-paid lawyer--keep in mind, their CEO made about $20 million. Their really well-paid legal team does very well. So that well-paid legal team went to work, and the average customer, who had no legal team on her side or on his side, ended up paying Wells Fargo, on the average, $11,000. No wonder they love this forced arbitration law.  You heard that right, the customers ended up paying the bank. So the same bank that cheated customers into opening false accounts--they cheated, they deceived into opening false accounts and that doesn't even talk about the car insurance they made them buy down the road. That is another story. The same bank that cheated customers into opening false accounts, the customers ended up having to pay Wells Fargo for the privilege of getting scammed.  No wonder people don't trust Wall No wonder people are mad at Wells Fargo and Equifax and these companies that scam the public and these banks that--I live in Cleveland, OH, in ZIP Code 44105. My ZIP Code had more foreclosures in 2007 than any ZIP Code in the United States of America, and I see what these banks did to my neighborhood, and I see what they do to Wells Fargo accountholders, and I see what they are doing to the 145 million whom Equifax has scammed.  Studies show that Wall Street and other big companies win 93 percent of the time in arbitration. Ninety-three percent of the time in arbitration the companies win. No wonder they are fighting like hell. No wonder they have lobbied this place like we have never seen. No wonder every Wall Street firm is down here begging their Senators to stand strong with Wall Street and pass this CRA, pass this resolution to undo the rule stopping forced arbitration.  So Wells Fargo's multidecamillionaire CEO came and testified in front of the Banking Committee early this month on an entirely new scandal. This is another Wells Fargo scandal, a scandal the last CEO in front of us didn't disclose. There was a new scandal he knew about and didn't tell us about. He said that Wells Fargo plans to keep using forced arbitration. It is amazing that bank that has hurt so many Americans would continue to crusade against consumers' right to a day in court.  This vote is all about a consumer's right to a day in court, pure and simple. These forced arbitration clauses are powerful. They are everywhere. They are in student loans. They are in credit card agreements. They are in nursing home agreements, even in employment contracts.  Gretchen Carlson, the well-known FOX News anchor, was prevented from suing her employer for sexual harassment by a forced arbitration clause in her employment contract. She has been urging Senators today to vote against the repeal of the consumer bureau's rule. In her words, forced arbitration ``has silenced millions of women who otherwise may have come forward.'' With all the other things about forced arbitration, think about what she said. She says forced arbitration ``has silenced millions of women who otherwise may have come forward.''  Forced arbitration is about the biggest companies in the country, the biggest Wall Street firms and silencing customers, silencing victims. It is about giving more power to corporations. If you ask Americans if they think corporations have too much power, resoundingly, they say yes. This gives more power to those corporations that already have too much power in the lives of working  Let me tell you a story about an I will use only his first name, George is from Mentor, OH, a community east of Cleveland in Lake George's wife suffered physical and mental abuse in a nursing home. Guess what. The nursing home had an arbitration clause. It denied him and his family their day in court. This nursing home could physically and mentally abuse his wife, who was helpless in this nursing home. She couldn't really fight back. She couldn't really do much herself to stop it. They couldn't go to court because they had signed a forced arbitration clause. George didn't know what a forced arbitration clause was, I assume, until that happened.  Forced arbitration clauses were so powerful and so effective that when George went to a lawyer, his lawyer said: You don't stand a chance fighting against it because they are going to put you into forced arbitration. They are not going to give you a free day in court.  Veterans and servicemembers have a lot of experience with this issue. A big Wall Street bank called Santander was illegally repossessing cars from servicemembers all over the country several years ago. When servicemembers spoke up about their rights--special protections they earned by serving our country--Santander used forced arbitration to keep them out of court.  We talk a good game about veterans here. We are always saying how we are on the side of veterans. I have served in the Veterans' Affairs Committee longer than any Ohio Senator ever. I pay a lot of attention to these issues, and I hear all of my colleagues mouth wonderful words about how we love veterans and ought to take care of veterans. The American Legion held its national convention in August and adopted a resolution supporting the consumer bureau's rule and opposing today's attempt to repeal it. The assistant director of the American Legion's veterans employment and education division said: ``Our membership has stated unequivocally that we will not accept a future where our military veterans' financial protections are chipped away to increase the margins of the financial sector.''  These arbitration rules go after families of people in nursing homes. They go after customers who they get to sign up for things they didn't know they were signing up for. They go after people whose credit has been hacked and whose credit rating has been dinged, and they go after soldiers, airmen, sailors, and Coast Guard members. How will Members of this body look those servicemembers in the eye and explain that they chose to stand with Wall Street over our military members?  Forced arbitration hurts the 3.5 million people who had bank accounts fraudulently opened by Wells Forced arbitration hurts the 145 million Americans who had their personal data put at risk by It hurts employees who have been hurt by their employers. It hurts students who have been cheated by for-profit colleges. It hurts family members in nursing[[Page S6740]]homes. It hurts America's veterans. Forced arbitration hurts millions of Americans with student loan debt and credit cards. Damn near everybody in the country is potentially vulnerable to forced arbitration.  Who does forced arbitration help? We know that it is Wall Street banks and huge corporations that never pay the price for cheating working people. Those CEOs who make $20 million and, then, generously give up their bonuses, will not give up forced arbitration because they know that will help their bottom line. That will help their stock bounce back. That will help their dividend. That will help their compensation.  I urge my friends on the other side to ask themselves: Whose side are we on--the people we serve who get hurt by forced arbitration or Wall Street CEOs who cash in? I ask my colleagues: Choose to side with the people we serve. Vote against repeal of the consumer bureau's rule. Give some power back to regular  I yield the floor.

761,topic-id,1350,"Mr.President, healthcare for our Nation's children is something we ought to be able to all come together on, but this Congress, which has not done much of anything, is always able to find a way to help Wall Think about the middle-of-the-night vote last night, where the Vice President of the United States came to the rescue of Equifax and the rescue of Wells Fargo and the rescue of Wall Street overall. Think of the celebrations last night on Wall Street because of that tie vote, which stripped consumers of their days in court. It stripped consumers of their consumer rights.  This Congress, when it came to the Children's Health Insurance Program, allowed it to expire at the end of last month. It left millions of families afraid they will lose healthcare for their kids. Think about what this uncertainty means for parents. Trying to make sure your children are safe and healthy is enough to worry about.  Families shouldn't have to fear losing coverage for their kids because of some politicians in All of us have taxpayer-funded health insurance. Some politicians in Washington don't seem to care much about these kids.  In my State, more than 200,000-plus children have insurance under So even if something happens to their parents--even if they lose their job or their insurance--those 200,000-plus children in Ohio have insurance because of But it expired on September 30.  Governor Kasich is a I am a We stand together on[[Page S6807]]this, as we stand together protecting Medicaid and as we stand together protecting the Affordable Care He tells us that there is still a little bit of money left over in Ohio to get us through these next few weeks until Congress does its job. But that doesn't mean parents don't worry about their children possibly losing their health insurance.  Kids on CHIP are a little more likely to have asthma or a little bit more likely to have an illness, in part because they are low-income kids and they may live near a bus line and the air they breathe may not quite be so good. Or they live in Appalachia, where they might not be able to get to the doctor quickly. Those kids are more at risk, and those parents are worried, even though Governor Kasich assures them and I assure them we are going to do this.  Congress worked into the middle of the night last night and debated for hours on a giveaway to Wall They debated for hours on helping Equifax, which abused the public trust of 145 million people--5 million in my They bailed out Wells Fargo, which fraudulently attacked, for want of a better term, 3.5 million customers. Congress can bail them out, but it can't pass the Children's Health Insurance Program?  Because of CHIP, 209,000--I said more than 200,000 before; more precisely, 209,000 Ohio children have access to affordable healthcare today--healthcare they may not have received otherwise. That is the importance of this program. It used to be bipartisan until this Congress, always in its rush to help Wall Street, forgot about these children.  This program provides peace of mind for parents. Regardless of income, when a parent knows that a daughter or a son has health insurance, it provides peace of mind. They know if their child has a sore throat or earache, they don't have to wait until the child is so sick they take her to the emergency room. They won't have to hesitate or wonder if they can afford the doctor visit or antibiotic. They get the care their kids need.  Most of us in this body are parents. Most of us in this body have insurance provided by taxpayers. Wouldn't you think that this would be important enough to Leader McConnell and the leaders of this body and to President Trump and to Speaker Ryan? Wouldn't you think it would be important enough?  We all talk about loving our kids. We talk about grandchildren. Most of us are at the age where many of us have grandchildren. We don't care enough about these children as we get insurance from taxpayers. We don't care enough about these kids to do this?  It has already been 3 weeks now since CHIP expired. CHIP means a child in Cincinnati or Dayton or Portsmouth or Akron or Youngstown or Mansfield can see a family doctor when they need it, preventing a costly ambulance ride and emergency room visit. CHIP means getting vaccines and shots. It means having dental coverage. We know what happens to low-income kids who don't get good dental care.  The State of Ohio probably has enough money to help protect CHIP kids through the end of the year, but Congress needs to act now.  I have met with CHIP families across Let me tell you some stories. Josh, whom I met in Cleveland--his children were covered by CHIP when he was laid off from his job. He said, ``The ability to take health insurance out of the equation, feeling confident that my family will continue to get the same quality of care they had while I was working, was a huge weight lifted.'' Think about that.  This father, knowing that he has insurance--he had plenty of things to worry about. He lost his job. Who knows what that means about their home and their lifestyle and their family? But at least he knew he could rely on insurance--until now. Look what this Congress has failed to do.  Think about Noble from Columbus, who came to my office earlier this year with his mom to talk about how important CHIP is. Noble relies on CHIP for coverage for the five pediatric specialists he sees at one of America's great hospitals, Nationwide Children's Hospital in  My colleagues need to think about Josh and his kids in Cleveland and Noble and his mom in We need to think about the mother of a son with diabetes, worrying about whether her son will be able to see the same doctor next year or about a father with a daughter with asthma, praying she doesn't lose her inhaler on the playground because in a few months they might not have insurance to pay for that inhaler.  My wife has asthma, and I know what that means. She had a father who had health insurance through his union plan with the Illuminating Company in Northeast He worked maintenance. It was a good blue-collar job. It didn't pay enough to send her to college, but it did pay enough with good insurance that it gave them a decent lifestyle. They didn't have CHIP back then. More people had union plans. More people were protected.  We used to have CHIP until September 30, when this Congress didn't care enough to provide it. We should not be playing politics with families' lives.  Two years ago, I led the fight in this body to protect Because of that work, with the support of advocates all across Ohio--and there are so many of them across the country--we extended funding for CHIP for 2 years. Again, this was with bipartisan support, back when Congress operated that way.  We have already come a long way this year. We passed a 5-year extension of CHIP out of the Senate Finance It had every vote in that Committee, with the exception of one. I thank Senator Hatch and Senator Wyden and my colleague from Ohio, Senator Portman, and so many of our colleagues for their help with that.  But this process is taking too long. Josh and Noble and the 209,000 Ohioans and 9 million children across the country are in a situation in which their parents are unsure of whether they will have insurance through the end of the year and next year and the year after.  It is time for us to come together to ensure that the families we work for have the healthcare they need for their children.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The answer to that question is found in part through correspondent and payable-through accounts, which are tools used by North Korea to bypass the existing U.and U.sanctions against them.  Non-North Korean actors use these accounts to fund the government through shell and front companies. While these sanctions are implemented in good faith, it is time to acknowledge that sometimes they just don't work.

329,topic-id,757,"Mr.Speaker, I rise this evening to recognize the General Baptist State Convention of North Carolina on the occasion of its 150th anniversary. The story of this great Baptist convention is a testament to its founders, Reverends William Warrick, Edward Eagles, Johnson, L.Boone, B.Spicer, Grimes, John Washington, Charles Bryant, Sutton Davis, and R.Harper, the visionary men who founded the convention on October 18, 1867.  Since its founding, Mr.Speaker, great men and great women have maintained the convention's strength and viability. The General Baptist State Convention is the oldest convention of African-American Baptists in the United States of The General Baptist State Convention consists of more that 500,000 Baptist believers belonging to more than 1,400 churches, including my home church, the Jackson Chapel First Missionary Baptist Church of  The convention is subdivided into 58 associations, each presided over by a moderator. Over the last 150 years, the convention has been led by well-trained and spirit-led theologians. The current president and executive board chair is my friend Nilous Avery, II, of Salisbury, North He is the 32nd president of the convention.  Mr.Speaker, the current officers of the convention are: First Vice President At Large, Leonzo Lynch; First Vice President, Ricky Banks; Second Vice President, Vincent Terry, Sr.; Third Vice President, Reverend O.Sykes; Fourth Vice President, Reverend Prince Rivers; Recording Secretary, Reverend Curtis Donald; Assistant Recording Secretary, Reverend Matthew Rouse, III; Statistician, Nathan Scovens; Parliamentarian, Reverend Reginald The Historian is Harry White, and the hardworking Executive Secretary-Treasurer is Haywood  Mr.Speaker, the Black church in North Carolina did not begin at the end of slavery. It became more pronounced and more transparent at slavery's end, but it existed for many years. It existed for many years prior to the end of slavery.  In 1831, the North Carolina General Assembly passed a law making it a crime for any free person of color or slave to preach or exhort in public, or in any manner officiate as a preacher or a teacher in any prayer meeting or other association for worship where slaves of different families were collected together.  Can you imagine?  The punishment for preaching the gospel--beginning in 1831, it was a crime. The punishment for violation was a whipping of up to 39 lashes on the bare back.  Notwithstanding this prohibition against preaching, the Black church existed as a secret association of slaves who worshipped privately. As the antebellum period proceeded, a few of the White churches, at the urging of the North Carolina Baptist State Convention, finally allowed people of color to hold church meetings under the supervision of a White person; and, at times, a member of the White race would conduct the service.  Now, Mr.Speaker, when the Emancipation Proclamation was signed on January 1, 1863, and the 13th Amendment ratified on December 6, 1865, there were 4 million slaves who obtained their freedom; 300,000 of those lived in North The former slaves, with assistance from White northerners and the Freedmen's Bureau, began the struggle toward freedom and equality. It was the Black church that led the way. This movement consisted of Black Baptist leaders and Black Methodist leaders and other religious leaders, both Black and White, who understood the importance of the former slaves having the ability to worship and serve their God without fear.                              {time}  2015  At the end of the Civil War, the former slaves built churches throughout North Many were of the Baptist denomination, and they were erected with lightning speed.  In 1867, they came together, Mr.Speaker, at First African Baptist Church in Goldsboro, North And I have a picture of it on display. They came together at the First African Baptist Church in Goldsboro to form the General Association of Colored Baptists of North Carolina, which was the original name for the convention. And I might say, Mr.Speaker, that my grandfather, Reverend Fred Davis, would, in 1916, become the fourth pastor of this church.  Not only did Black Baptists build churches, but one of their greatest achievements was the establishment and maintenance of historic Shaw University in Raleigh, which will be discussed by my colleagues, Congressman David Price and Congresswoman Alma Adams, in just a moment.

No health insurance, no life insurance, no pension from any of his churches, he died at age 84, several days after preaching his last sermon.  Mr.Speaker, thousands of pastors have devoted their entire life to the ministry. Many are remembered, but so many of them are not.  Today, the three of us pay tribute to all of them from the floor of the United States House of  May God bless the memory of each of them for making our communities a better place to live, and may God continue to bless the General Baptist State Convention of North Carolina and its current leaders as they continue to serve God and his people of all races, creeds, and stations in life.

805,topic-id,1228,"Mr.President, I come to the floor this morning to talk about a GAO report, or a Government Accountability Office report, that is being released today, which says that the cost and impact to the Federal Government of climate change is in the billions of dollars. In fact, it is in the hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 5 years, and, over the next decade-plus, it is in the trillions of dollars.  Why is this so astounding? It is astounding because we have not had the Government Accountability Office outline for us before what the impacts of climate costs the U.taxpayers, what it costs the Federal Government, and that we are paying an astronomical cost. Right now we are discussing the supplemental, and we can see the costs of the damage we have experienced from storms, damage from wildfires, and damages from other kinds of events and how much it costs the Federal The GAO took the last 2 years to develop this report after receiving a letter from me and Senator Collins of Maine to say that we wanted to understand these costs.  Why did we do this? The Senator from Maine and I have long been advocates of looking at issues of adaptation and mitigation. We can debate all we want about what people think the impacts are of climate and what drives it. What we are here today to say is that we know that it is costing billions of dollars, and, as stewards of the taxpayers' money, we ought to do a better job at adaptation and mitigation. That is why we sent the letter, and that is why, probably 7 or 8 years ago, she and I started working to try to encourage various agencies that are most impacted by this to do a better job at adaptation and mitigation.  For us in the Pacific Northwest, we got to this point because we saw a shellfish industry almost devastated by the level of ocean acidification caused by changes in temperature. It was so[[Page S6726]]much so that we had to help the shellfish industry with science and research. If we wanted to keep a shellfish industry, we had to look at the science behind the seeding and do it at specific times when there was the right chemistry balance in the water. This incredible economy is enjoyed by so many The Washington shellfish industry that we have--five generations, six generations of families in that industry--was almost lost because of these changes.  Also, as a State that has a great deal of hydropower and very cost-efficient electricity, a 1-degree temperature change means a lot too in terms of snowpack--20 percent less snowpack. It means a lot to us for the challenges we face in keeping affordable electricity rates.  When it comes to fire, we have certainly taken it on the chin with two unbelievable back-to-back fire years, with unfortunate loss of life and billions of dollars of economic loss impacting both the Federal Government and to local communities.  What we are saying is that we can do better. We need to recognize these costs and the impact and do a better job of planning for them in the future. That is why one of the things that I have done with my colleagues--Senator Murray from Washington, Senators Risch and Crapo from Idaho, and Senators Merkley and Wyden from Oregon--was to introduce a bill to help reduce our risk when it comes to fire seasons and what we can do to better protect our communities. That is the kind of planning and adaptation that we think we need to address.  Today's report cannot be ignored. It cannot be ignored that the Federal Government is going to have to spend this much money dealing with the impacts of climate. That is what the Government Accountability Office is saying. It says we need a better plan. We need to reduce costs. We need to look at these impacts and make sure that we as a nation are putting every resource into this. Otherwise, we really will be spending trillions of dollars.  That trajectory is real. That is what the GAO report says--hundreds of billions of dollars now and trillions in the future, but if we would simply recognize these impacts and start addressing them by having agencies recognize climate and plan for it, both in terms of adaptation and mitigation, I guarantee you that we can save the taxpayers money.  I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will heed this report. This report is saying that climate is impacting us, the Federal It is costing us a great deal of money. I guarantee you that it is money we would rather have to focus on whatever issues my colleagues would like to focus on--whether it is education, job training, or any of the other issues that someone might want to address, such as healthcare. We cannot afford to continue to pay this kind of money while not dealing with climate.  Impacts and costs are only going to accelerate. That is the scary thing. The GAO report says these numbers are going to increase for the future. Can we at least sit down at the table and talk about the ways--just like on fire, just like on flooding, just like on drought--to plan strategies for how we can work together to mitigate these impacts? I guarantee you, if we don't, this bill is going to continue to rise and the conflicts are going to get worse.  If you look at this year alone--even though I am saying it is $600 billion over the next 5 to 10 years and trillions over the next 20--we will probably see $300 billion in economic impacts in Texas, Florida, and Puerto  What is the conclusion I am drawing? I think the report is very clear. The research is very clear. One thing that is happening, as the climate changes, is that there are more intense weather events. These intense weather events are presenting challenges like we have never seen before. These challenges and the devastation that caused them are something that we need to take into consideration in the future.  Certainly, we need better science. We shouldn't rely on the European weather agency to give us the best, most accurate information about storms and weather. We should do that ourselves. We should use the great research that is being done at the labs in Tennessee on climate and what we can do to best prepare our We need to come to the table when it comes to the issues of drought and plan for strategies that work and work successfully now, not wait another 20 years and have the cost be even more astronomical.  I thank my colleague from Maine for joining this effort of getting this documentation by the Government Accountability We need to take their accounting very seriously and start doing things that will help us reduce the risk, lower the cost, better protect our communities, and give the taxpayers a sense that we are not leaving them to devastation and storms every year but that we are coming up with better strategies to save lives and to save dollars.

448,topic-id,1317,"Mr.President, I rise to again highlight the importance of enacting tax reform. I listened to the Democratic leader's speech. I have heard that speech a thousand times--a thousand times how only wealthy Americans are going to benefit from anything the Republicans can come up with. Well, do you know what? Americans are smarter than that. Americans are smarter than that.  I represent a State, West Virginians who have struggling economic situations. If I were to go out on the street in West Virginia, and as I talked to individuals there, and asked them: Would you like more of your hard-earned money at the end of the day and have a tax cut and tax relief, I can guarantee you 100 percent would say: Heck, yeah. I can spend my money better at home with my priorities than what you are doing in Washington, So let's not let that argument rule the day. As I said, we are smarter than that.  Let's talk about what this bill does. This is now my fourth, actually, in a series of something I believe in, which is tax reform for everybody in this country.  My first speech described the benefits we will have in economic growth. Something that was not mentioned by the previous speaker is how we have been stagnated for so long. The economic growth will rise all boats. Every middle-class worker will benefit from this, and every small business will benefit from this. My second speech was about small businesses. Ninety-five percent of my State is small business. Last week, I highlighted the importance of passing the budget resolution to allow Congress to move forward, and we did that.  Today, I want to talk about the importance of tax reform for middle-class families and the impacts this bill will have on them, the very real impact. You know what, raising a family is very expensive today. A recent study from the Department of Agriculture found that middle-income households will spend over $230,000 raising a child. It is staggering--staggering.  The Federal Reserve found that almost half of American families are struggling right now to come up with $400 if they have an emergency expense. In West Virginia, where the median income is $41,000--hardly the wealthy--families are forced to make hard tradeoffs as they balance their checkbooks each month.  Expenses are going up. Yet most Americans haven't received a raise in years. So we need to help working families, especially those living paycheck to paycheck, and this is one of the primary goals of our tax reform. We want middle-class, middle-earned-income[[Page S6828]]folks, hard-working folks to get more in their pocket to decide what they want to do with their money. I raised three children. I know just putting shoes on your children is an expensive proposition. Maybe you want to plan for a trip or save for college. Well, to pay for childcare and to save for college at the same time is almost impossible for our young families today.  The framework we have set forward, I think, will help our families in many ways. First, it calls for a significant increase in the child tax credit. Yesterday, a number of my colleagues from the House and the Senate, joined with Ivanka Trump to highlight what an improved child tax credit would mean for working families. The tax reform proposal would allow families to take a higher per child credit, saving money on their taxes--money they have earned, money the families deserve to spend on their own, and money that could have significant impact to our families.  We will also create a $500 tax credit for families who are caring for a nonchild dependent. Many Americans find themselves in the sandwich generation, where they are not only caring for their children, they are caring for their parents at the same time. This will help those families.  Second, the proposal nearly doubles the standard deduction or the zero tax bracket. It raises it up to $24,000 for married taxpayers and up to $12,000 for single taxpayers.  What kind of impact would this have on a State like mine? Well, 83 percent of the taxpayers in West Virginia take the standard deduction. They are going to get a doubling in their standard deduction. That is more money for them to take home, to put the value of where they want to spend it with their own families. So four out of five West Virginia working families will benefit from that. That is an enormous savings, and even more taxpayers are likely to benefit, as the larger standard deduction means fewer people will itemize. We expect that figure to go up--from 83 percent up. It makes filing taxes simpler, and it makes it so our taxpayers can file on a single form without all of the extra forms, time, and money it takes.  Finally, and most importantly, families will benefit from the economic growth that tax reform will bring to our country. This is probably the biggest impact that tax reform will have for working families. We will lower the corporate rate, yes, for companies, but we have to make our companies competitive across the globe. We are not. We are not competing. What kind of effect does that have? Fewer jobs and lower wages. Companies know that if they invest in their workforce, if they invest in the wages of their workforce, they are going to have a more productive workforce to produce products, to sell products, to enhance the quality of life of their communities.  Many of these large corporations that are scattered around our country really do a lot of work in the community service parts of our country, whether it is helping with schools or whether it is helping with the baseball teams or sponsoring a robotics team. Why does that matter to working families? More than $2 trillion in profits earned by American companies is kept offshore because of the flaws in our current tax system--$2 trillion--and I think some of those estimates might be low. Shifting to a more fair and competitive system will bring those dollars back to the United Those companies want to invest in our country because they know we have the safest investments, we have the most technologically advanced and we have the best workforce, and this is great news for American families.  The White House Council of Economic Advisers estimates that lowering that tax rate--that corporate tax rate--from 35 to 20 could increase the pay for the average American by about $4,000. At my small business roundtable, when I asked, what would you do with tax relief, the first thing she said was ``raise the wages of my seven employees.''  So I think that this would be good news for working families, certainly good news for 50 percent of the West Virginia workers who work in small business. We need to make sure we work together, that we target our tax relief to middle-class families.  I say to the Acting President pro tempore, you and I were at lunch the other day with the Priority 1, the President said that this tax cut must be targeted to the middle class, the working families in this country. That is what this bill has put forward: larger tax credit, larger standard deduction, unlocking the wages by lowering the competitive tax rate. Despite our hard work, too many middle-class families are falling behind, and we want to make sure that trend stops.  So all of us, I think, can join together. This is going to go through committee. Both parties will have lots of opportunity to weigh in, and I look forward to looking into the eyes of the working men and women in my State and saying: Not only is help on the way, but help is here.  Thank you so much.  I yield the floor.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr.Speaker, snake oil is all that this Republican budget will give to the American middle class and working families.  This Republican budget before Congress is squarely aimed at ramming through a tax plan without bipartisan consensus or input. This proposed tax plan will increase our deficit, adding $1.5 trillion over the next decade, and it leaves the middle class stuck footing the bill, with an increase in their annual Federal taxes.  In fact, 80 percent of the tax cuts in this plan benefits only the wealthiest 1 percent of That means those benefits are geared towards those earning $900,000 a year or more.

26,topic-id,1824,"Madam President, I rise to address the latest mass shooting in our country. This one took place last week in my own State of Maryland, in the city of Edgewood, in Harford County, which is northeast of  In this case, the suspect gathered coworkers at his place of business, Advanced Granite Solutions, and began shooting. He killed three coworkers[[Page S6840]]and critically wounded two others who remain in critical condition at the Maryland Shock Trauma The suspect then fled to  According to an article in the Baltimore Sun, he shot an acquaintance in the head at a car dealership. The victim was in stable condition and later identified his attacker to police. The suspect was finally arrested after a brief foot chase, and police said the suspect threw a gun at them after spotting law enforcement approaching.  This terrible shooting in Maryland came a few weeks after the worst mass shooting in modern U.history, which occurred in Las Vegas, NV, on October 1. This mass shooting from a hotel room targeting concertgoers at an outdoor music festival left 58 dead and more than 500 people wounded, with dozens of victims still in the hospital today, some of whom are in critical condition. These are just staggering numbers. But I want to put a human face on this for my colleagues and talk about one Marylander who was injured in the Las Vegas attack.  The Baltimore Sun shared the story of Tina Tina is a native of Crofton in Anne Arundel County, She is a 2008 graduate of Arundel High School in She was a star soccer player in school, and she now lives in California and works at the accounting firm of Ernst and  The story begins:       Before a bullet from 32 stories above cut through her face,      Crofton native Tina Frost drove from San Diego with her      boyfriend to see one of her favorite country artists in Las      . . . Becky Frost said her 27-year-old sister had lost      her right eye and was in a Las Vegas intensive care unit      after a two-hour surgery. [She] said her bubbly and      charismatic older sister was in a coma that the family      expected to last about a week. Another sister wrote on      Facebook that the family was waiting to see the extent of the      brain damage. ``We're sticking together and praying,'' Becky      Frost said.  Tina Frost did wake up from the coma and was recently transferred to Maryland for additional surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in According to family members, she underwent a second successful surgery last week. The family's website update said: ``We are thankful Tina is still being a true fighter and warrior!''  Today, I want Tina and the entire Frost family to know that they are in our thoughts and prayers. I understand that their community has already been raising funds to help defray Tina's medical expenses for her recovery.  This is just one example of hundreds who were victimized in Las I am just heartbroken by the terror in Las With the entire country, I am grieving for the senseless loss of life and praying for the victims, their families, and all those who were injured like Tina Frost, whether by gunshots or the chaos that ensued.  Much thanks also goes to the first responders, including our police, fire, ambulance, and emergency medical workers, who saved countless lives by helping those around them and running toward danger instead of running away from it.  Thoughts and prayers console victims and their families, but actions speak much louder. We must be outraged at this latest shooting, and we must act. Congress must act. States must act. Weapons of war should not be in the hands of civilians. We see the deadly results in Las Vegas just as we have seen before in Orlando, Blacksburg, San Bernardino, Aurora, Sandy Hook, the streets of Baltimore, and elsewhere across this great country. We need to do everything in our power to stop the carnage of these shootings. How high does the death toll have to get before we enact real, bipartisan reforms that will make the American public safer and reduce the risks that come from allowing such easy access to dangerous weapons primarily designed for the battlefield? Assault weapons are not needed to hunt deer or ducks; they are only meant to kill people, and they do far too often in this country.  I urge my colleagues to be bold and fight to break the cycle of what could only be described as a callous disregard for the victims of gun violence. More talk will not save lives; only action and real change and Federal and State laws can.  This attack and others like it in recent years tear at the heart and leave us angry, frustrated, and confused. We as a nation must resolve to stop those who wish to do harm to Americans from committing, encouraging, and abetting acts of terror. We as a nation, as a community, and as an American family must take action to change minds, hearts, and finally change policies. We can stop others and save lives by taking immediate action.  I was disappointed that Congress missed yet another opportunity to enact commonsense, reasonable gun safety measures after the June 2016 shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, FL, which killed 49 people and injured 53 others. The mass shooting in Las Vegas has now sadly surpassed those numbers.  In the Las Vegas massacre, Stephen Paddock used a bump fire stock device, which allowed a semiautomatic rifle to fire at a rate similar to that of a fully automatic weapon--a rate of about nine bullets a second. Fully automatic weapons are generally illegal under current law. Paddock also stockpiled a virtual arsenal in his hotel room, as police found 23 firearms in the room. Police also found a large quantity of ammunition, including numerous high-capacity magazines capable of holding up to 100 rounds apiece.  The preliminary assessment--with the understanding that the investigation is still ongoing--from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is that the shooter legally purchased all these guns, bump stocks, and ammunition. It is outrageous that a mass shooter was legally able to purchase a device designed to convert his gun into a military-style weapon with no legitimate civilian use. It is outrageous that a mass shooter was legally able to purchase high-capacity magazine clips with no legitimate civilian use. These are weapons of war. You don't need them for hunting, and you don't need them for self-defense.  Earlier this month, I convened a roundtable meeting with law enforcement officials at the First Baptist Church of Highland Park in Prince George's County, The group included officials from the local, State, and Federal levels, including the sheriff, police chief of Prince George's County, State delegates, the State attorney general of Maryland, and representatives of the U.attorney's office.  Maryland has progressive laws on gun safety and has taken steps to ban weapons of war and high-capacity magazines that have no legitimate civil purpose. The group echoed the concern to me that if Maryland has strict laws relating to gun safety that protect both the public and police officers, what is to stop someone from driving over the border to one of our neighboring States in order to procure guns? That is why we need a strong national law to protect all Americans, and Congress should act on commonsense gun safety measures.  What can we do in Congress? I have cosponsored the Automatic Gunfire Prevention Act, which Senator Feinstein introduced. In the Las Vegas shooting, the gunman was able to unleash hundreds of rounds of gunfire on the crowd, likely by using the bump stock device.  Fully automatic guns or machine guns are already banned for civilian use under the National Firearms Act, but a loophole exists that allows for these bump stock devices, as well as similar accessories, to convert semiautomatic weapons to emulate automatic weapons. Senator Feinstein's legislation would close the loophole in current law that allows conversion devices and accessories to be available to the public. The bill bans the sale, transfer, importation, manufacturing, or possession of bump stocks, trigger cranks, or anything that accelerates a semiautomatic rifle's rate of fire. Semiautomatic rifles typically have a rate of fire of 45 to 60 rounds per minute; a bump stock could increase the semiautomatic rifle rate of fire to 700 rounds per minute or 9 per second.  I have also cosponsored the Large Capacity Ammunition Feeding Device Act, also known as the Keeping Americans Safe Act, introduced by Senator It prohibits the possession or transfer of large-capacity ammunition magazines--more than 10 rounds per magazine--with limited exceptions for law enforcement personnel. Senator Menendez's bill authorizes a buyback program for high-capacity magazines using Byrne JAG grants.  To me, these two bills represent a practical, commonsense approach to[[Page S6841]]promoting gun safety and reducing the threat of gun violence without impinging on the rights of legitimate owners.  As NBC News recently reported, more Americans have died from gunshots in the last 50 years than in all the wars in America's history. Since 1968, more than 1.5 million Americans have died in gun-related incidents, according to data from the U.Centers for Disease Control and  I have also cosponsored the Background Check Expansion Act, introduced by Senator This bill would expand Federal background checks to cover the sale and transfer of all firearms by private sellers, just as licensed dealers are required to do so under the existing Brady law, with certain limited exceptions.  Under current law, unlicensed or private sellers are not required to conduct a background check prior to transferring a firearm. This is outrageous, and Congress should act right now to close this dangerous loophole. It should not matter whether you buy a gun at a local gun store or a gun show or the internet--you should have to pass a basic background check to make sure the guns are kept out of the hands of people who should never have one.  Congress has an obligation to act. As I have indicated before, we need to act. Inaction is not an option. Many of our States have acted as well, including my own State of Maryland, but we need a national law that applies to all 50 States to ban bump stocks, prohibit the sale or transfer of high-capacity magazine clips, eliminate the private ownership of assault-type weapons, and require universal background checks for all purchasers.  The time for action is now. We cannot wait. Congress should come together and address the real problem, which is lax gun safety laws, and should pass commonsense gun safety measures to protect all Let's not wait for the next mass shooting, when we send our thoughts and prayers to victims and then stand by and pretend we are helpless and powerless to prevent another tragedy.

840,topic-id,1755,"Mr.President, earlier this week, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a hearing on an issue that I consider one of the greatest moral tests of our time in the conduct of U.foreign policy--the situation in Burma, where the Burmese military is committing ethnic cleansing and is perpetrating atrocities.  We have a humanitarian crisis. We have perpetrators who expect impunity and a situation, under the watch of the international community and the Trump administration, that is allowing for the perpetration of atrocities.  Ethnic cleansing is defined by the United Nations Commission of Experts as ``rendering an area ethnically homogenous by using force or intimidation to remove persons of given groups from an area.'' Half of the population of the Rohingya in Burma have left--600,000 people out of 1.2 million. I might add that, of those who remain, many are dislocated. There has been a systematic burning of their villages. This didn't just start. It has been a campaign that has gone on for a long period of time, since a 1982 law that denies the Rohingya citizenship, even though they have been residents for generations.  The Rohingya are denied freedom of movement. They are denied freedom of education. They are denied healthcare. This has been a systematic effort to destroy an ethnic community.  We have seen this happen far too long in too many places around the world. Once again, we see this happening today in Once again, this is the expectation: Well, it is far away; we will just let it go along.  The Senate should be outraged about what is happening. We need to see the international community come together and say: No, we will not let this continue. We will hold accountable those who are responsible for these actions, we will provide humanitarian need immediately, and we will stop this type of conduct in a civilized society. This just cannot occur.  In fact, I think what is transpiring in the Rakhine State today is genocide. I know there will be some discussion about whether it is genocide or not based upon technical definitions. Yet what we see in Burma today clearly meets the definition of ``deliberately inflicting on a group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.'' That is what is happening in Burma, and that is genocide.  The Burmese military is clearly trying to destroy the Rohingya population. For decades, the Burmese Government has systemically repressed the Rohingya people. This is a fact, and they have deliberately failed to integrate the population into the general population. As the U.High Commissioner for Human Rights correctly stated, the ``decades of persistent and systematic human rights violations . . . have almost certainly contribute[d] to the nurturing of violent extremism, with everyone ultimately losing.'' They complain about extremism. Yet they are creating it.  In my opinion, we are witnessing a military-sponsored ethnic cleansing campaign on the Rohingya, and it will take significant engagement from the international community, at the highest levels and in partnership with the Burmese civilian government, to address and to hold the perpetrators accountable for these horrific acts.  Seventy-five years ago, the world and the United States could have claimed ignorance or lack of information as an excuse for inaction in the face of crimes against humanity, genocide, and barbarism. Today, we have no excuse.  Unfortunately, the Rohingya crisis is not the only vexing challenge Burma faces. The Burmese military continues to hold significant influence in politics and in the economy. The peace process, which sought to end a longstanding civil war in the country, has stalled. There are significant reports of human rights issues such as human trafficking, free speech infringement, and political repression. The military control Burma today. That is unacceptable, and that is why we imposed sanctions, because of military control. Sanction relief was given for what? So that people could be ethnically cleansed?  I was pleased to hear State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi committed to implementing all of Kofi Annan's Rakhine State recommendations and to ensure that the Rohingya, who have fled in the face of brutal military repression, have a right to return to their homes. However, she must continue to make this a top priority and work with the international community to provide both the safety of the Rohingya left in Burma and those who want to come home. It is going to be difficult since their villages have been destroyed. Are they going to live in camps? Will they have protection? Will they be safe? If the past is any indication, we have real challenges ahead of us.  Although I would count myself among those who have been disappointed with the civilian authorities and think they should have been more vocal, I am keenly aware of the real limits of their power and ability to[[Page S6843]]govern under the current Burmese Constitution and the military's control of a large portion of Burma's economy.  We have a challenge on our hands in Burma, and we need to be engaged. But the civilian leadership must take responsibility and must speak out. Too often, the international community has done too little, waited too long, or been caught unprepared by events that should not have surprised us. We continue to forget the lessons of the past and fail to live up to the post-Holocaust pledge of ``never again.'' Ignoring the genocide war crimes and crimes against humanity that continue to rage around the world sends a message to the global community that atrocity crimes are tolerable. We must respond robustly to the crisis unfolding in Burma because it is the right thing to do and because it is in our national interest to do so.  The United Nations is calling the military campaign ``a textbook example of ethnic cleansing'' against Rohingya From credible human rights organizations and newspapers, there are consistent accounts of widespread extrajudicial killings, arson, rape, and other atrocities. At least 288 villages have been decimated, according to Human Rights Watch, which has used satellite imagery as evidence of the devastation caused by the so-called ``clearance operations.''  These current attacks on the Rohingya follow decades of state-led persecution and dehumanization. Government efforts to deny Rohingya citizenship rights, to restrict their freedom of movement and the practice of their faith, and to deny their basic human rights have all been identified as precursors to a genocide.  The U.Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights found that the attacks were executed in a well-organized, coordinated, and systematic manner by the Myanmar Security Forces, often supported by the armed Rakhine They have described the attacks as a ``cynical ploy to forcibly transfer large numbers of people without possibility of return.''  There were also appalling acts of sexual violence, which clearly amount to crimes against humanity and/or acts of genocide that must not be forgotten. Women and girls, some as young as 5, were raped by men in uniform in front of their families. U.and other health workers said that after this most recent August 2017 military crackdown, they treated dozens of Rohingya women and girls who escaped to Bangladesh for injuries consistent with violent sexual attacks.  One woman told Human Rights Watch that she and four other women were taken to a hut, slashed with knives, and sexually assaulted. The soldiers then set the hut on fire. She was the only one to escape alive. Another woman who was raped still has injuries from the machete attack and beatings that accompanied the rape and said she barely managed to escape from a burning house.  I also want to draw attention to the needs of the survivors, their families, and communities. There is an acute lack of healthcare available to the survivors, including reproductive health, psychosocial, and other critical services.  Seventy-five years ago, the world--and the United States--could have said they did not know what is happening. Today we do. Today we have no excuse. Instead, the international community must hold the perpetrators accountable. In addition, to date, no real progress has been made either holding perpetrators of serious violations accountable or in addressing the root causes underlying the situation in Therefore, there is an urgent need to act.  The strong statements by Ambassador Haley and last month by the Vice President must be followed up with action. The administration should lead efforts for action in the Security The Security Council should insist that persons responsible for grave abuses be held accountable for their crimes. It also should press the Burmese authority to cooperate with the U.factfinding mission established by the United Nations Human Rights Council and grant unfettered access to its staff to Burma, including the Rakhine  We need to know what is happening on the ground. We need to know that in order to protect people and to get the evidence necessary to hold the perpetrators accountable. The Council should send a clear message that it stands ready to take additional steps to ensure justice, including through the International Criminal Court, and urge member states to pursue other mechanisms that might provide justice for recent abuses.  I should also add that Bangladesh deserves credit for keeping its borders open to the influx of refugees--600,000 have fled to Bangladesh, and they kept their borders open. Bangladesh has been one of the few bright spots in the current crisis and should continue to honor its promise to build shelters for new arrivals, accelerate humanitarian assistance, and provide the needed medical service for this traumatized group.  I also believe the United States needs to reevaluate our policy and approach to We need to have a policy in regard to Burma that we understand, that addresses these human rights violations, that reevaluates our approach for our relationship with the Burmese military, and that relooks at how to best use sanctions as a way to seek additional leverage with the Burmese Government and military.  I am working with a number of my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, on legislation to seek to clarify U.policy and to address some of these issues.  As the President prepares for his upcoming trip to the ASEAN Summit in the region, Congress will be watching closely to see if he makes Burma and human rights a top priority during this trip and to see what he and his administration choose to undertake in the coming days to address the tragedy unfolding in Rakhine  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

132,topic-id,460,"Mr.Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment that would create an exception in the legislation for consent decrees or settlement agreements entered into pursuant to the Meese policy.  For those unfamiliar, the Meese policy prohibits the Department of Justice from undertaking a regulatory action through a settlement. More specifically, the Meese policy directs departments and agencies not to enter into a consent decree if it would act as a so-called end run, around the regular rulemaking process or constrain an agency head from exercising its discretionary authority in the future.  Any departure from these rules must be approved by the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, or the Associate Attorney General beforehand.  Edwin Meese, the former Attorney General for the Reagan administration, wrote a memo articulating this policy in 1986, out of a concern for the abuse of settlements by agencies. Now, the Department of Justice later codified it in 1991, in the Code of Federal Regulations.[[Page H8206]]  Simply put, there is a law already on the books that prevents the Department of Justice or other agencies from abusing consent decrees and settlement agreements used by Federal agencies, and it is working.  In February of this year, the Government Accountability Office, the GAO, determined that Department officials negotiating settlement terms are covered by the Meese policy. The GAO's report noted that any settlement would only include a commitment to perform an action already mandated by law.  So if you are scoring along at home, what I am saying is this: there is a needless overlap between this bill that we are considering, H.469, and the Meese policy in regard to the scope of settlements. There is also redundancy with existing laws in terms of protecting the interests of third parties.  If I may be so bold, I would like to say that persons with only a nodding acquaintance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure already know that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24 allows affected parties to intervene in litigation if they feel their interests are not properly represented in the case.  Moreover, even if a rule was promulgated by a settlement agreement, the Administrative Procedure Act would still mandate notice-and-comment procedures for the rule. Simply put, this is a bill that is a solution in search of a problem, and my amendment underscores that fact.  If I may be so bold, I would like to say that here in America we have actual real problems that merit our attention here in this House, such as why we haven't had an infrastructure bill leading to high-paying American jobs. We need actual solutions to actual problems, not theoretical ones like in this bill. That is why I have offered this amendment.  Mr.Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.

759,topic-id,567,"Mr.President, as you know, the Children's Health Insurance Program expired on September 30, in large part because we spent much of this year and the days leading up to that date debating the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, instead of focusing on bipartisan priorities like the Children's Health Insurance As a result, the program known as CHIP expired and the health of 9 million children, including some 340,000 Pennsylvania children, are now at risk.  CHIP is not just a bipartisan program but a successful program with a Pennsylvania history. It was modeled after a State program in Pennsylvania that was signed into law by my father when he served as Governor in the early 1990s. The program provides affordable health insurance to children whose family incomes mean they don't qualify for Medicaid but still struggle to find affordable health insurance options. It is a program that working families rely upon and that provides peace of mind to parents.  Many families turn to CHIP during times of economic hardship, such as when a parent loses his or her job. At such a stressful time, I have heard from parents over and over how they have peace of mind knowing that their children will get the healthcare they need.  Some parents who rely upon CHIP for their children are, in fact, students, working and going to school so they can make that leap into stable, middle-class life. They may not have a job with health insurance or they may not be able to afford the insurance, but they know their children will get the healthcare they need.  Regardless of what drives families to the CHIP program, it is thanks in large part to CHIP that the United States of America has the highest rate of insured children in our Nation's history. According to the Census Bureau, 95.5 percent of children had health insurance in 2016. CHIP is also a popular program, as repeated studies have demonstrated. Parents think CHIP is a valuable program, and they are satisfied with the coverage and with the care their children receive.  Unless the Senate acts and acts very soon, we will have betrayed all of those children and all of those families. There is no reason for CHIP to have expired and no reason why we shouldn't pass the bill right now, if not in the next couple of days--certainly, in the next 2 or 3 weeks--to ensure that not one single child loses his or her health insurance.  We have taken important steps to extend the program. The Finance Committee marked up the bipartisan Keep Kids' Insurance Dependable and Secure Act of 2017, known by the acronym K-I-D-S, or The KIDS Act came out of the Finance Committee, which reauthorizes CHIP for 5 years, and that happened some 3 weeks ago. I am proud to be a cosponsor of that bill.  So it is time to act. We have a commonsense, bipartisan, successful bill in the Senate that is ready to go. It is out of the Finance So I would urge my colleagues to join me and to join others who have come to the floor today and on earlier days to take swift action to pass the KIDS  I yield the floor.

273,topic-id,831,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.469, an unwarranted and costly intrusion into Congress' powers under Article I of the Constitution that will undermine the enforcement of statutory deadlines.  When passing laws, Congress routinely establishes mandatory deadlines for agency action. These statutory deadlines serve several purposes. They establish congressional priorities, attempt to reduce undue delay in an agency's compliance with the law, and communicate the importance of a legal requirement to the public. But because agency resources are limited, there is widespread noncompliance with statutory deadlines, as the Administrative Conference of the United States has long observed.  Accordingly, a plaintiff with standing may file a lawsuit to complete a schedule for an agency to complete an action required by Congress, often referred to as a ``deadline suit.'' As the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office, the GAO, reported earlier this year, ``Most deadline suits are resolved through a negotiated settlement agreement because, in the majority of them, it is undisputed that a statutory deadline was missed,'' and there was no legal defense to the lawsuit.  But proponents of H.469 assert that these settlements undercut applicable administrative law and short-circuit review of new regulations. This premise is based on a report by the Chamber of Commerce that the so-called sue and settle process is increasingly being used as a technique to shape agencies' regulatory agendas. This concern, however, is unsupported by any independent evidence and has been debunked by the  In two reports on deadline suits, the GAO has found that, ``the settlement agreements did not affect the substantive basis or procedural rulemaking requirements,'' of the agencies it studied.  In its December 2014 report on deadline lawsuits involving the Environmental Protection Agency, the GAO determined that none of the settlements finalized under the Obama administration ``included terms that finalized the substantive outcome of a rule.'' The GAO underscored this point in the title of its report: ``Impact of Deadline Suits on EPA's Rulemaking is Limited.''  In its February 2017 report on deadline suits involving the Endangered Species Act, the GAO found that ``the settlement agreements did not affect the substantive basis or procedural rulemaking requirements the agencies were to follow in completing the actions, such as providing opportunities for public notice and comment on proposed listing rules.''  Leading experts have also debunked the Chamber's sue and settle narrative. John Cruden, a senior career official at the Justice Department for more than two decades during two Republican and two Democratic administrations, testified on a substantially identical bill that he was ``not aware of any instance of a settlement that could remotely be described as collusive, but that the Justice Department vigorously represented the Federal agency, defending the agency's legal position, and obtaining in any settlement the best possible terms that were consistent with the controlling law.''  Other administrative law experts, such as Robert Weissman, the president of Public Citizen, have similarly testified that sue and settlement allegations are patently false.  This bill is also unnecessary because current law and agency practice already restrict the use of settlement policy to shape regulatory priorities. During its exhaustive review of deadline litigation, the GAO found that the Justice Department is guided by the Meese memo of 1986, when litigating deadline suits. This policy, as the GAO noted earlier this year, limits the settlement of a deadline suit to ``only include a commitment to perform a mandatory action by an agreed upon schedule and would not otherwise predetermine or prescribe a specific substantive outcome for the actions to be completed by the agencies.''  The Meese memo was codified in 1991, in the Code of Federal Regulations, and applies to settlement policy today. The Meese policy primarily restricts agencies from using settlement policy to contravene the law or congressional intent.                              {time}  1630  As the majority noted in its report on a substantially identical version of the bill considered last Congress, this policy is grounded in separation of powers concerns. There is no evidence that agencies do not follow this policy, and the majority's witnesses in prior hearings on this proposal have been unable to provide examples of settlements that violate the Meese policies.  H.469 is also wasteful and undermines Congress' powers under Article I of the Congress, not agencies, establish regulatory priorities through statutes. Agencies do not have discretion to pick and choose regulatory priorities where Congress has expressly instructed that certain actions be undertaken by a specific date. By imposing a series of onerous procedures that will constrain the use of settlements to resolve a Federal agency's noncompliance with the law, H.469 erodes the constitutional function of the legislative branch.

Just to remind folks, there were two reports done by the GAO--I have them in my hand; they are thick--that, in fact, undermine the suggestion that there is any such problem.  In response to requests from the Republican committee chairs, the Government Accountability Office has twice concluded that agencies cannot and do not circumvent the rulemaking system through settlements relating to statutory deadlines.  Finally, we received testimony earlier this year from Attorney General Jeff Sessions' Justice Department that current agency policy, which was codified in 1991, prohibits circumventing the rulemaking process through deadline lawsuits. We have heard similar testimony from career Justice Department officials in prior administrations.

284,topic-id,444,"Mr.Chairman, I think it is very important to say at the outset this is not about clarifying anything. This is about a major change in policy.  This amendment will permit the publication of a victim's sensitive information, such as the individual's name and case history, on the internet. This overrides the Privacy  So let's be clear about what this is. This is not a clarification. This is a major change in policy.  This amendment will make a bad bill even worse. It specifies that the Privacy Act does not prohibit the publication of a victim's sensitive information, such as his or her name and case history.  Under current law, the Treasury Department cannot, for the purposes of the Judgment Fund, publish the sensitive information of individuals who are victims of government abuse or misconduct, such as a name or case history. This is because the Privacy Act requires an individual's consent prior to publishing their name or other sensitive information.  Although proponents of this amendment may claim that this information is, in some instances, already publicly available, the Supreme Court has recognized that a person's privacy interests and their personal information collected in government records does not automatically dissolve because such information may be available to the public already in some other format. Individuals have the right to control the dissemination of their own personal information. This amendment makes it clear that the bill will infringe on an individual's personal privacy if he or she is compensated from the Judgment  Moreover, this amendment does not further the public interest in government transparency. Publishing an individual person's name on the internet sheds no significant light on the inner workings of government and has no value; and so, to the contrary, it will result in potentially grave harassment or even intimidation.  Revealing this information is an unwarranted intrusion on personal privacy of individuals harmed by government misconduct, which could include victims of medical malpractice as well as racial and sexual discrimination. In effect, it revictimizes the victims of government misconduct or abuse--a terrible result.  So, therefore, I oppose this amendment which does not do anything to improve the bill and, in fact, makes it considerably worse.  Mr.Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment. And if you vote for it, recognize that you will have to go home and tell your constituents that you have agreed to a serious invasion of their personal privacy and that it will allow individuals who are victims of government misconduct to have that personal information put on the internet and shared with millions of people all over the world.

1130,topic-id,556,"Mr.Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr.Chair, I rise in opposition to H.732, the inaptly titled Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act of 2017, which would flatly ban the enforcement of any settlement agreement that seeks to remedy the general harms caused by unlawful conduct.  This prohibition would broadly apply to all civil and criminal settlements with limited exception, encroaching on the Justice Department's longstanding legal authority to negotiate and enter settlement agreements.  Since its establishment in 1870, the Justice Department has possessed plenary authority to litigate on behalf of the government in all civil and criminal litigation except as otherwise provided by law.  Since at least as early as 1888, the Supreme Court has upheld this broad grant of authority, holding that it extends to settling litigation on behalf of the government or making enforcement decisions in light of priorities and resources.  In Heckler v. Chaney, for example, the Court held in 1985 that, in many cases, enforcement decision within the Justice Department's expertise make it ``far better equipped than the courts to deal with the many variables involved in the proper ordering of its priorities.''  This rationale also extends to the terms of settlement agreements, which ``involve numerous complicated technical issues as well as important judgments respecting the use of limited prosecutorial resources'' and are ``best left in the hands of expert agencies and prosecutors, rather than dictated by Congress or the Federal courts,'' as environmental law professor Joel Mintz has noted.  H.732 undermines this longstanding policy by strictly curtailing the enforcement discretion of the Justice Department and the other enforcement agencies when resolving a party's civil or criminal liability on behalf of the Federal  As the Justice Department observed last Congress in the context of a substantively similar bill, ``limiting the Department's discretion to negotiate appropriate terms of settlement, which are voluntary and agreed to by the parties, may result in fewer settlement agreements, protracted litigation, and delays for victims who need the relief.''  Without this discretionary authority, the Department concluded that, ``the government may not be able to adequately address the full scope of the harms that a defendant's illegal actions caused.''  In contrary to the arguments of the gentleman from Virginia, despite 2 years of investigation by the Judiciary Committee into the Justice Department's use of settlement agreements, no evidence was found to show that the mortgage fraud settlements contain terms that were politically motivated. But we did learn that the sole mission of the Justice Department's settlements under the prior administration was to aid the families whose economic security was jeopardized by reckless Wall Street behavior and prevent them from losing their homes due to fraudulent mortgage practices.  There are many examples where generalized harm is impossible to calculate or impractical to quantify in the courts. Without this ability by the Justice Department to enter into these settlement agreements, corporate wrongdoers are going to be free to do whatever they want.  I give you one example: Deepwater Horizon, which destroyed the coastline. As part of that settlement, there was State-based cleanup that was provided. There was funding for the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation for remediation; things that were directly responsive to the harm caused. But you couldn't quantify to an individual person, and that is what this legislation will prevent.  Mr.Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this measure.

So this is really about respecting the ability of the court to assess the propriety of a judgment. And I think there was a very famous decision where one of the courts said the purpose of the Clean Water Act was not to endow the Treasury, but to prevent harm. So the idea is not just to generate money for the government, but to actually remediate and respond to the harm that was caused by the corporate wrongdoer.

1173,topic-id,624,"Mr.Chair, I rise in support of my amendment, which would exempt from H.732 any settlement agreement that directs funds to reduce the effects of the mortgage foreclosure crisis through foreclosure prevention assistance programs.  There is little debate that predatory and fraudulent activity in the residential mortgage securities market was the primary cause of the mortgage foreclosure crisis.  As U.District Court Judge Max Cogburn observed in 2014, one need not ``be an expert in economics to take notice that it was the trading of toxic RMBS''--residential mortgage-backed securities--``between financial institutions that nearly brought down the banking system in 2008.''  The financial crisis blighted entire cities and communities, resulting in more than 13 million Americans losing their homes between 2006 and 2014, an average of 850,000 per year.  Beyond the life-changing hardship and stress placed on families by unlawful conduct in the housing market, the exponential rise in foreclosures imposed significant external costs on families and communities across the  Fraudulent activity in the housing market depressed home and commercial real estate values, undermined economic development and municipal revenue, deprived communities of public services, and resulted in increases of violent crime in communities of significant foreclosure activity.  Leading studies have also documented the contagious effects of foreclosures, and not just the neighborhood immediately affected by the foreclosures, but nearby vicinities as well, underscoring the diffuse and systemic impacts of unlawful mortgage securities practices.  In response to the financial crisis, President Obama announced in 2012, the creation of an investigatory unit within the Justice Department to: `` . . . hold accountable those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners, and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans.''  This unit secured more than $40 billion in civil penalties, compensation, and consumer relief through settlement with five financial institutions for alleged misconduct involving the packaging, marketing, and sale of residential mortgage-backed securities.  Geoffrey Graber, who directed this effort within the Justice Department,[[Page H8124]]testified in 2015 that these settlements meaningfully addressed the vicious cycle of harm caused by fraud in the housing market by achieving accountability from financial institutions that engaged in wrongdoing related to residential mortgage-backed securities, and to the extent possible, bringing some measure of relief to homeowners who suffered as a result of the financial crisis.  In addition to civil penalties, these settlements included statements of fact describing the pervasive fraud that permeated the mortgage market. In just one example, a bank employee stated that he would not be surprised if half of these loans went down, and that the banks should start praying.  The settlements also included consumer relief provisions designed to enable many Americans to stay in their homes by directing funds to distressed homeowners, community reinvestment and stabilization, and income-based lending for borrowers who lost homes to foreclosure.  The Department's settlement with Citigroup and Bank of America additionally directed $50 million in funds to charitable housing council programs and legal aid organizations to provide counsel to homeowners entitled to relief under the settlement because they were directly affected by the fraudulent and predatory conduct of the settling banks.  As the Center for American Progress has noted, these funds account for less than 1 percent of the overall amount of each settlement, and will support services provided by housing counselors and other trusted intermediaries that enable consumers to access the consumer relief to which they are entitled under the settlements.  We should be doing everything in our power to keep American families in their homes and off the streets, not letting big banks off the hook for their predatory and fraudulent practices, and so I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment that will address this very important issue.

As our Nation begins to recover and rebuild from the devastation of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate, as well as from the wildfires that are sweeping across the West, we cannot ignore the impact of climate change on our public health, our environment, and our economy. Most of the past focus of the impact of climate change has been on public health and the environment--important to be sure--but there has not been nearly enough analysis of the consequences for our economy and for the Federal budget, in particular.  In 2007, I first became interested in the cost of climate change when Senator Joe Lieberman and I headed the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs We commissioned a report by the GAO to look at the fiscal risk of climate change for both the Flood Insurance Program and the Federal Crop Insurance Our request was an attempt to sound the alarm that there were very significant fiscal consequences to the Federal Government for failing to take action.  The report found that the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Homeland Security can and should do better jobs of assessing the fiscal impacts that unchecked global warming will have on the taxpayer-funded Federal Crop Insurance Corporation and the National Flood Insurance In addition, the report revealed that insurance programs had not developed a long-term strategy to deal with the effects of global climate change, putting them far behind private insurers that have incorporated these risks into their overall assessments.  According to a 2014 GAO report, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, and the Risk Management Agency commissioned some climate change studies in order to better prepare for potential climate effects.  To build upon this important work, 2 years ago, Senator Cantwell and I asked the GAO to conduct a comprehensive study on the costs and risks to the U.Government from climate change and to evaluate policy actions that could be taken by the Federal Government to address these financial consequences.

The GAO estimates that, by the year 2039, climate change will cost U.taxpayers more than $1 trillion. In just this past year alone, the economic losses will, almost certainly, exceed $300 billion.  In Maine, our economy is inextricably linked to the environment. We are experiencing a real change in sea life, which has serious implications for the livelihoods of many people in our State, including those who work in our iconic lobster industry. With warming waters, lobsters are migrating into deeper waters, which poses more risks to our lobstermen and lobersterwomen. Additionally, Casco Bay, which is where Portland is located, has experienced an invasion of green crabs, which are not native to Maine and are devastating some of our other sea life population. This change in the Maine waters could be detrimental to our State's economy.[[Page S6727]]  I am also very concerned about the excessively high rate of asthma in my According to public health physicians, this is due to air pollution that comes into our Now, Maine is not a coal-burning State, but the emissions from other States are causing the changes in sea life and are also contributing to the public health epidemic of a very high rate of asthma. The fact is, Maine is located at the end of our Nation's tailpipe, and we get emissions blown in from other States, which affects our economy and the health of our citizens.  The Federal Government cannot afford the billions of dollars in additional funding that is going to be needed if we do not take into account and start acting on the serious consequences of climate change. Spending more than $300 billion each year, in response to severe weather events that are connected to warming waters and producing stronger hurricanes, is simply not a solution.  I hope the release of this new GAO analysis will encourage all of us to think more broadly about this issue, take a harder look at the economic consequences of climate change, and then use this analysis to inform Federal policy. We need to support practices and policies that promote resilience and reduce risk and exposure to weather-related losses for the Federal Government, for States, and for local communities.

908,topic-id,481,"Mr.President, throughout our Nation's history, young Americans have left the comfort and security of home in order to preserve our freedom and to extend the blessings of freedom to others. We set aside Veterans Day to express our gratitude.  One such veteran is Mr.Richard Lincoln of Wayne, Although the story of his service in Italy during World War II is extraordinary, the virtues of courage, sacrifice, and devotion to duty it demonstrates describe the character of American patriots in all places and at all times.  Now 91 years of age, Mr.Lincoln entered the U.Army in 1943 when he was just 17. He served with the legendary 88th Infantry Division, the first all-draftee division to serve in combat during the war. The 88th, known as the Fighting Blue Devils, proved that with rigorous training, able leadership, and unflagging determination, peace-loving Americans could stand up to a battle-hardened, militaristic enemy.  The 88th played a key role at the Battle of Anzio, the long, costly, and critically important amphibious landing on the Italian coast in January of 1944 that eventually led to the liberation of Mr.Lincoln served as a first scout, an extremely dangerous assignment in a forward position under constant fire, to locate enemy artillery positions. When the Allies liberated Rome on June 4, 1944, the all-draftee[[Page S6813]]88th was the first division to enter the city. It was Mr.Lincoln's 18th birthday. He later was awarded the Bronze Star for his heroism during that grueling campaign.  Victory came at a steep price. Between the Battle of Anzio and the German surrender in May of 1945, the Fighting Blue Devils spent 344 days in combat, with nearly 3,000 killed and more than 9,200 wounded.  After returning home, Mr.Lincoln raised a family, served his community, and never forgot his comrades. Until he suffered a stroke that hampered his mobility, he marched in 58 consecutive Memorial Day parades in his hometown. He never rode in a ceremonial car; he always marched.  In a speech to the Association of the U.Army on October 9, Defense Secretary James Mattis discussed the serious current threats to peace and security facing our Nation and the world. He told the story of Richard Lincoln to underscore his point that Americans are always willing and able to meet any challenge.  On October 14, family and friends gathered around Mr.Lincoln at the Maine Veterans' Home in Augusta, where he was presented with a personal letter from Secretary Mattis and a book on the Battle of Anzio, inscribed by both Secretary Mattis and former Defense Secretary William Cohen, Maine's former  Secretary Mattis's handwritten note to Mr.Lincoln includes these words: ``You have the respect and affection of today's military. You and your brothers-in-arms are the pride of our country.'' I am honored to join Secretary Mattis and all grateful Americans in thanking Mr.Richard Lincoln and all of the men and women who serve our country.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-25-pt1-PgS6812-4.txt,2121,CUBAN AIRPORT SECURITY ACT OF 2017,2017.0,25.0,October

276,topic-id,686,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I am very pleased to be here to support--well, I don't think it is going to be support. It is really more in opposition to this so-called Sunshine for Regulations and Regulatory Decrees and Settlements  Well, why? Well, because it is anticonsumer.  Well, why? Because it is antienvironment.  Well, why? Because it is antiprivacy.  Not surprisingly, a broad consortium of more than 150 organizations strenuously oppose this bill, including some of our best nonprofits: the National Resources Defense Council, for example; the Sierra Club, for another example; Public Citizen; and a lot of labor organizations and other groups.  Title I of this bill, for example, has one goal: it is to discourage the use of settlement agreements and consent decrees that compel agencies to follow the law.  When enacting new statutes, Congress routinely establishes deadlines for agency action, particularly when it involves urgent public health and safety concerns. When agencies fail to meet these deadlines, a party with standing may file a lawsuit under section 7 of the Administrative Procedure Act to ensure that the agency performs this mandatory, nondiscretionary duty. By delaying the enforcement of statutory deadlines, the bill, however, jeopardizes public health and safety, which explains why the previous Obama administration issued a veto threat to similar legislation considered only last  Title I imposes nearly impossible hurdles for agencies seeking to resolve the deadline lawsuits and gives opponents of regulation multiple opportunities to stifle agency regulatory actions.  With respect to consent decrees concerning a rulemaking, an agency would be forced to go through two public comment periods--one for the consent decree, and one for the rulemaking that results from the consent decree--doubling the agency's effort. In addition, it would allow any affected party to intervene in opposition to a proposed settlement agreement or consent decree.  Contrary to the claims of those who support this measure, the Government Accountability Office has found no evidence that these deadline lawsuits are collusive. As the Justice Department, which represents most Federal agencies, acknowledged earlier this year, these agencies are left with few defenses, if any, to these lawsuits.  I am also concerned that H.469 will inevitably generate more litigation that will result in millions of dollars of additional transactional costs, all of which will be borne by you know who--the American taxpayer.  For example, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, in its analysis of the bill's predecessor from the last Congress, concluded:       The measure would impose millions of dollars in additional      costs, most of which would be incurred because the litigation      involving consent decrees and settlement agreements would      probably take longer under the bill, and agencies would face      additional administrative requirements.  That is a quotation. In other words, Title I of this bill is a costly solution, again, in search of a problem.  Now, Title II of the bill isn't much better. For instance, Title II overrides the Privacy Act to require publication of sensitive personal information of victims of government abuse or unlawful conduct, which raises serious privacy concerns.  Although proponents of this measure argue it will increase government transparency, its real effect will be to force the Treasury Department to publish, on the Internet, the names of individual victims of government misconduct compensated for their claims by the Judgment Fund, including victims of race and sex discrimination, and so, in effect, revictimizing victims harmed by the Federal  Finally, Title III would facilitate the ability of the House majority to intervene in pending cases where the Justice Department has already determined that it will not defend the constitutionality of a Federal law.  Not only do these provisions raise possible separation of powers concerns, it is unclear why they are even needed.  This measure has not ever been the subject of a single hearing or markup by the Judiciary Committee of the House of As a result, there has not been any opportunity to consider these critical issues and to analyze the ramifications presented by Title  For all of these reasons, I must, accordingly, urge my colleagues to oppose H.469.

286,topic-id,358,"Mr.Chairman, my amendment would exempt from H.469 settlement agreements and consent decrees intended to prevent discrimination based on race, religion, national origin, or other protected category.  Given the often systemic nature of discriminatory conduct, settlement[[Page H8203]]agreements and consent decrees provide an invaluable means to provide for general relief for non-identifiable victims and to prevent future discriminatory acts.  In particular, they are instrumental in enforcing critical civil rights protections in a wide variety of cases, including voting rights violations and predatory lending practices based on race. Other examples include the use of consent decrees by the Justice Department to address unconstitutional police pattern or practice activities.  For example, in 2003, the City of Detroit entered into a consent decree with the Justice Department concerning the inappropriate use of force and arrest practices by the city's police department. As a result of this decree, the police department implemented vastly improved practices that have substantially reduced the incidence of fatalities caused by law enforcement activities, a goal that the Judiciary Committee Chairman Goodlatte and I very much endorse.  According to the department's civil rights division, these decrees facilitate institutional reforms, such as improving systems for supervising officers and holding them accountable for misconduct, as well as ensuring officers have the policy guidance, training, equipment, and other resources necessary for constitutional and effective policing.  Unfortunately, H.469 would make the use of such remedies exceedingly difficult by subjecting them to numerous procedural and potentially meritless court challenges.  A particularly concerning provision of this bill is its broad and ill-defined authorization allowing virtually anyone to intervene with respect to a proposed settlement agreement or consent decree.  For example, imagine a proposed settlement agreement intended to restrict a city's school district from discriminating against Under the bill, any anti-Muslim or neo-Nazi organization could petition the court to intervene for the purpose of opposing such agreement on the ground that it ``would affect'' such person.  This is just one of the many fundamental problems presented by this thoroughly flawed and, I think, harmful measure, and, so, accordingly, I ask my colleagues here to join me in opposing H.469.

393,topic-id,672,"Mr.Speaker, in my role as a member of the House Committee on the Judiciary, I have always taken a serious view of my oversight of the Federal Bureau of It is vitally important that we keep a close watch on the activities of law enforcement, especially regarding their operations in domestic intelligence gathering. In the wake of September 11th attacks, a time of crisis when civil liberties can be viewed as a luxury, it was important to ensure that all Americans could rely on the Constitution to both protect our rights and protect public safety.  As we all know, the FBI has a long, troubling history of using its broad investigatory powers to vulnerable or dissenting groups in our society. As a long-serving member, I was here in Congress when the reports of the FBI's surveillance activities against African-American groups involved in the struggle for civil rights first surfaced in the press.  Centralized operations under COINTELPRO officially began in August 1956 with a program designed to ``increase factionalism, cause disruption and win defections'' inside American Communist Tactics included anonymous phone calls, IRS audits, and the creation of documents that would divide the American communist organization internally. An October 1956 memo from Hoover reclassified the FBI's ongoing surveillance of black leaders, including it within COINTELPRO, with the justification that the movement was infiltrated by communists.  In 1956, Hoover sent an open letter denouncing T.R.Howard, a civil rights leader, surgeon, and wealthy entrepreneur in Mississippi who had criticized FBI inaction in solving recent murders of George Lee, Emmett Till, and other black people in the When the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), was founded in 1957, the FBI began to monitor and target the group almost immediately, focusing particularly on Bayard Rustin, Stanley Levison, and, eventually, Martin Luther King, During the 1960's Director Edgar Hoover also used COINTELPRO to spy on and attempt to discredit civil rights activists and members of the Black Panther  After the 1963 March on Washington, Hoover singled out King as a major target for Soon after, the FBI was systematically bugging King's home and his hotel rooms, as they were now aware that King was growing in stature daily as the leader among leaders of the Civil Rights Amidst the urban unrest of July-August 1967, the FBI began ``COINTELPRO--BLACK HATE'', which focused on King and the SCLC as well as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), the Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM), the Deacons for Defense and Justice, Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), and the Nation of BLACK HATE established the so-called Ghetto Informant Program and instructed 23 FBI offices to ``disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize the activities of black-nationalist hate type organizations.''  The program was successfully kept secret until 1971, when the Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI burgled an FBI field office in Media, Pennsylvania, took several dossiers, and exposed the program by passing this material to news agencies. In 1976, the ``Church Committee'' (Frank Church-Idaho) launched a major investigation of the FBI and Journalists and historians speculate that the government has not fully released the many dossiers and documents related to the program.  Against this backdrop, the Congressional Black Caucus is justified in its concern about the FBI's investigation of African-American political organizations. The coining of the phrase ``Black Identity Extremists'' and claims with ``high confidence'' that these groups are likely to target law enforcement based on ``perceptions of police brutality against African Americans'' takes us back to claims about groups like the Black Panthers in the 1960's.  While it is important that the FBI monitor all threats domestic, its activities around the American Muslim community and efforts to ``combat violent extremism'' have raised questions about tactics and constitutional norms. The CBC has called for an FBI briefing on the origins on this research and the Bureau's intended next steps.

1124,topic-id,459,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, the Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act would prohibit the Federal Government from entering into or enforcing any settlement agreement requiring donations to remediate harms that are not ``directly and proximately'' caused by a wrongdoer's unlawful conduct.  I, regretfully, oppose this measure for several reasons. To begin with, the bill would prohibit these types of settlement agreements even though they have been successfully used to remedy various harms, particularly those caused by reckless corporate actors.  For example, these settlement agreements helped facilitate an effective and comprehensive response to the predatory and fraudulent mortgage lending activities of financial institutions that nearly caused the economic collapse of our Nation, and that led to the Great  In fact, settlement agreements with two of these culpable financial institutions, Bank of America and Citigroup, required a donation of less than 1 percent of the overall settlement amount to fund foreclosure prevention and remediation programs to help harmed consumers.  Now, contrary to the majority's claim, the Justice Department did not use any of these settlement agreements to fund active groups. Notwithstanding the production of hundreds of pages of documents by the Justice Department, along with hundreds of pages of documents produced by private parties, we have not seen a shred of evidence that the government included unlawful or politically motivated terms in its settlement agreements with Bank of America or  The majority also asserts that these settlement agreements are used by the Justice Department and other agencies to circumvent the congressional appropriations process. But existing law already prevents agencies from augmenting their own funds.  By law, donations included in settlement agreements must have a clear nexus to the prosecutorial objectives of the enforcement agency. And both the Government Accountability Office and the Congressional Research Service have concluded that settlement agreements providing for secondary remediation do not violate Congress' constitutional power of the purse.  Finally, H.732 would prevent the remediation of systemic harms in civil and criminal enforcement actions.  These settlement agreements allow parties to resolve their civil or criminal liability by voluntarily remediating the harms caused by their unlawful conduct. For some types of unlawful conduct, such as discrimination based on race or religion, secondary remediation of harms may be the only remedy available for systemic violations of the law.                              {time}  1515  The victims of such conduct are typically not themselves parties to the underlying action. Therefore, secondary remediation in the form of voluntary compliance and training programs serves as an important tool in these cases to protect victims of discrimination. Yet H.732 would effectively prohibit such relief.  Given these serious problems and some others presented by the bill, I strongly am led to oppose H.732.[[Page H8109]]  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

This bill is, in effect, a gift to lawbreakers that comes at the expense of families and communities impacted by injuries that cannot be addressed by direct restitution, and so I have to ask: Why are we giving a gift to lawbreakers in the guise of H.732?

1166,topic-id,305,"Mr.Chair, Members of the House, this amendment makes a bad bill even worse. To begin with, it would prohibit cy-pres distributions pursuant to which parties attempt to find the next best use of funds that remain after a class action settlement has been finally administered. Cy-pres is especially important in actions where the recovery is so small for an individual class member that he or she may not bother to make a claim or where a distribution is not practical.  For example, courts under cy-pres may permit unclaimed settlement funds to provide indirect compensation to the class, such as future price reductions or remediation efforts. As a result of this amendment, however, the unclaimed settlement funds would be returned to the very entities that caused the injury in the first place. Simply put, this amendment would benefit the wrongdoers to the detriment of the victims they harmed.  In addition, this amendment would restrict the amount of compensation a victim could receive under a settlement agreement to the extent the victim was actually harmed by the wrongdoer. The amendment completely ignores the pragmatic realities of systemic harms, such as widespread long-term or latent environmental damage like lead-contaminated public water drinking systems--think of Flint, Michigan--where the extent of a victim's exposure to such harms may be difficult and, perhaps, even impossible to quantify.  In a letter opposed to this amendment, a group of public interest organizations, including Earthjustice, Public Citizen, Alliance for Justice, the Center for Justice & Democracy, and the American Association for Justice, said it is terrible public policy because wrongdoers would benefit from a windfall for cheating and harming consumers, undoing the accountability or deterrence function of the entire settlement. This is absolutely the wrong result, and so I urge that this amendment be rejected.  Mr.Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

1179,topic-id,342,"Mr.Chairman, my amendment would exempt from H.732 settlement agreements that direct funds to remediate the indirect but catastrophic effects of unlawful conduct resulting in lead contamination in public drinking water.  Lead contamination in public drinking water is potentially a national public health crisis as older cities continue to rely on aging lead pipes for the delivery of public drinking water.  A report from the American Water Works Association estimates that this problem could potentially affect millions of water service lines. For example, Highland Park, located in my district, has been dealing with issues resulting from aging lead pipes. Just last month, officials closed public water fountains and fixtures due to unsafe samples of lead in public drinking water.  The well-publicized Flint water crisis is another painful example of the disastrous consequences of lead contamination in public drinking water.[[Page H8125]]  The director of the pediatric residents at Hurley Children's Hospital in Flint wrote: ``To understand the contamination of this city, think about drinking water through a straw coated in lead. As you sip, lead particles flake off into the water and are ingested. Flint's children have been drinking water through lead-coated straws.''  The Flint water crisis has generated numerous lawsuits by individuals, local and State agencies, and public interest organizations such as the Natural Resources Defense Council and the American Civil Liberties  While these cases tend to involve numerous victims directly affected by unlawful conduct, they can also affect the interests of persons who are not parties to the case or are likely to receive compensation for unlawful conduct.  Given the systemic nature of lead contamination in drinking water, settlement agreements resolving civil and criminal liability related to the Flint water crisis may require setting aside funds for unidentifiable victims, directing payments to address generalized harm, or establishing an environmental compliance program to avoid lead contamination in the future.  Unfortunately, these entirely legitimate forms of indirect remediation of environmental harms would be prohibited by H.732.  Mr.Chair, accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-10-24-pt1-PgH8107.txt,229,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,24.0,October

While some States have enough money in their accounts to carry them through to the end of the year or just beyond, the uncertainty about when or if CHIP funds will be reauthorized is causing chaos, concern, and anxiety across the country. Some States will have to start issuing notices to households that they will face the loss of CHIP coverage. Imagine the unnecessary fear this will bring to parents and families and struggling households across the country as they are facing other challenges in their life.  This is totally unnecessary. We can stop this uncertainty right now and bring needed stability for parents, children, and States and show some kind of leadership from our Federal I am a proud cosponsor of the bipartisan KIDS Act, 1827, being led by Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah and Senator Ron Wyden of This KIDS Act would extend funding for CHIP for 5 years. I urge the Senate to do right by America's children and America's working families and swiftly take up and pass this bill.  While we are on the topic of programs desperately in need of reauthorization, I also want to draw attention to the expiration of the Community Health Center Fund, which ensures access to cost-effective primary and preventive care for 26 million patients across the country. In my home State of Delaware, about 50,000 Delawareans benefit from several community health centers that are widely respected, well run, and provide affordable, accessible, and preventive healthcare in communities up and down my Funding for this critical program also lapsed more than 3 weeks ago, and now, sadly, community health centers across my State and across the country are struggling to make key decisions--decisions like signing new leases or signing on new medical personnel to positions. Without certainty that the Federal Government will authorize their funding, how can we expect health centers to plan, to provide services, and to provide preventive healthcare that improves health and strengthens our community?  We should do everything we can to swiftly pass a 5-year reauthorization for funding for community health centers, such as the bipartisan bill that Senator Blunt of Missouri and Senator Stabenow of Michigan have introduced, the Community Health Investment, Modernization, and Excellence Act of 2017, 1899, which I am proud to support.  Folks, I urge that we work together in a bipartisan way. We should not be using children's access to healthcare as a bargaining chip. We should be taking up these two bills to provide reauthorization, funding, and certainty immediately for both CHC and CHIP funding now and without hesitation.  With that, I yield the floor.

629,topic-id,1389,"Mr.President, I know, for people watching this debate, it is easy to be confused. You hear the Democratic leader claiming that this is about the people who have no power, fighting against the most powerful institutions this country has to offer in their, somehow, trying to disadvantage them when, in fact, the opposite is true.  In situations like this, it is frequently a good thing to follow the money. The reason the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau wants to ban arbitration as a means of alternative dispute resolution is that the trial lawyers, who benefit from the huge attorneys' fees awards, do not like the idea that they are, basically, being boxed out of that dispute resolution system; whereas, we know from the studies that have been done that consumers actually benefit from a cheaper, more efficient, more timely way of resolving disputes with financial institutions with which they may have disagreements.  Back in the eighties, I still remember when I was a district judge in San Antonio, Warren Burger, the Chief Justice of the U.Supreme Court, made the point that it was so expensive and so time-consuming for individual citizens to resolve their disputes in courts of law that we needed what we all called an alternative dispute resolution system that was able to resolve these disputes in a more timely, more cost-effective sort of way, recognizing that very few people could afford to pay a lawyer an hourly fee or even a contingent fee for protracted civil litigation. Basically, ordinary consumers were frozen out of the dispute resolution process and were denied their day in court.  That system actually worked pretty well, including arbitration, which, according to a Federal statute--the Federal Arbitration Act--is an impartial tribunal that, basically, decides these disputes in an efficient, cost-effective sort of way. In fact, we know from the studies that have been done that consumers actually benefit more from arbitration than they do as members of a class in class action lawsuits, where consumers typically get pennies on the dollar and the class counsel, the lawyers involved, are, perhaps, awarded millions of dollars.  You have to ask the question: Whose benefit is that for? Is it really for the consumers or is it for the lawyers? I think the answer is pretty clear. It is not for the consumers. So, when I hear our friend across the aisle, the distinguished Democratic leader, cry crocodile tears for consumers, really, those are for the class action lawyers who are not part of the arbitration process.  I think it is really important to make that point, which is that every single study that has been done shows that consumers actually benefit from arbitration compared to ordinary litigation. Not everybody can afford to be O.Simpson and hire the very best lawyers in America and try a case for weeks on end at a cost of millions of dollars. It just, simply, does not work that way for most people. So this is a very efficient, cost-effective, fair way to resolve those disputes in a way that consumers benefit.  I do not understand, honestly, our colleagues across the aisle, except for their desire to demonize banks and large financial institutions, but it is not just large banks and financial institutions; it is community banks. We are talking about contractual arbitration provisions, which allow consumers to benefit from a means to resolve disputes with their local community banks, and they do not often involve huge amounts of money. Typically, lawyers are not going to be interested in a claim that do not involve much money, which is why most often, when one does get litigated, it is in the context of a class action, in which they aggregate all of these claims for thousands of people. Then, as we know, typically, it ends in some sort of settlement from which the consumers get coupons--frequently, no money--and the class lawyers reap millions of dollars.  Our colleagues across the aisle act as if they have the better part of this argument when, actually, they are arguing on behalf of one of the narrowest, wealthiest special interests in America today, and that is the trial lawyers. They act as if they are the friend of the consumer when they are actually arguing to the detriment of the consumer, because the consumer benefits from this less expensive, more efficient, more timely resolution of disputes with financial institutions, which is through contractual arbitration.  There is the fact that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is sort of an anomaly in our system, is accountable to no one and not susceptible to oversight by Congress because of the way it was created. It is not even funded by appropriations of Congress as other government agencies are. It is really a rogue agency in so many ways--not accountable to the American people, not subject to the oversight of Congress, not dependent upon Congress for the appropriations to, basically, do its work. So, when it overreaches like this and essentially outlaws this efficient, cost-effective, impartial way of resolving civil disputes, this is, perhaps, the greatest demonstration of the abuse that was wrought by the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in the first place.  When consumers benefit and trial lawyers do not, I don't know how you can justify the arguments on the other side, except to say that they are the party of the trial bar and that they really don't care about the consumers because they realize that consumers will end up with pennies on the dollar and that they would actually be better off in using the arbitration provisions in these contracts that are subject to the Federal Arbitration Actually, this is a Federal law that mandates the procedures by which these arbitration panels are created. It is not as if the banks get to choose who sits on the arbitration panels. It is not as if they get to pick the judges in the cases. These are nonpartisan arbitrators who will decide the facts in law and let the chips fall where they may.  I, for one, am not buying the crocodile tears of our friends across the aisle. They are not arguing in favor of the consumer; they are arguing on behalf of the trial bar, which gets rich on these cases.  It is not just the fact that this handful of cases from which the lawyers get rich solves the problem, because there are many people who have legitimate disputes that need to be resolved from which the lawyers just simply turn away and say that that case will not get me enough money to justify my involvement. So guess what. You are out of luck. Good luck in finding a lawyer to litigate your case for $100 or $200. You are just not going to get a chance to do that. If a class action lawyer will not take the case, you are out of luck. I guess our friends across the aisle do not care.  As for the fact that consumers could get recourse through arbitration in their using the Federal Arbitration Act--from an impartial panel that will decide what the facts are and grant awards without having to go to the expense and time associated with ordinary litigation--they, simply, do not really care about that.  I would say, notwithstanding the dystopian view of our friends across the aisle that, somehow, this is a great conspiracy against the forgotten man and woman in our country, the opposite is actually true. What they are trying to do is advocate for the rich[[Page S6756]]and the powerful--the trial lawyers in America--and against the best interests of the consumer, who benefits from this contractual arbitration provision.  I hope that our colleagues will not be persuaded by the arguments on the other side, because there is just, simply, no factual basis for them. I hope that in a little while here, when we vote on this congressional resolution of disapproval, we will have a solid vote in the disapproving of this ban on the use of alternative dispute resolution to resolve disputes, because a ``no'' vote, basically, is a vote on behalf of the rich and the powerful--the trial lawyers in America--who get enriched by the status quo in the absence of an alternative dispute resolution system.

730,topic-id,2034,"Mr.President, I know people watching and perhaps reading the newspaper, watching cable TV, and listening to talk radio think nothing ever happens here in Washington, DC, and they would be wrong. Certainly, we can always do better, and I am disappointed we haven't been more successful, but there are some measures we can make in the right direction in important pieces of legislation that make a very profound difference in people's lives.  Today I want to talk about a problem that, thanks to a bill passed by the Senate on Monday, we are helping to solve. This has to do with the untested rape kit backlog in our country.  Years ago, thanks to a courageous woman named Debbie Smith, I became a lot better informed about the nature of this problem: rape kits, the forensic evidence that is taken in sexual assault cases but which remained in evidence lockers in police stations untested or was sent to laboratories and never processed. At one point, it was estimated that there were as many as 400,000 untested rape kits in our country.  As the Presiding Officer knows, this is powerful evidence because of DNA testing. We can literally almost say with certainty whether there is a match between the DNA of a suspect and that in a rape kit. This forensic evidence is collected following a sexual assault. Similarly, we can decide and determine whether there is no match whatsoever and, frankly, exclude somebody who is a potential suspect from being the guilty party by using this same powerful forensic evidence.  It is also important not just to solve the crime at hand but also to get sexual predators off the streets because we know this type of offender is likely to strike time and time and time again. The experts tell us that when opportunities don't provide themselves for sexual offenders to go after adults, frequently they will even go after children. So this is very important evidence.  As we know, there is typically a statute of limitations that after a period of time a case cannot be prosecuted, but it is really important, as I mentioned, to continue to test as many rape kits as we possibly can to get serial offenders off the streets and to determine whether somebody has been charged or suspected of a crime and is in fact innocent.[[Page S6786]]  Thanks to courageous people like Debbie Smith, for whom we have named the Debbie Smith Act, as well as great bipartisan cooperation in the Senate, we have provided funding for the testing of rape kits at the State and local level, which has been supplemented by the Texas Legislature and other State legislatures.  In Houston a few years ago, our mayor felt so strongly about this that they took this on as a citywide project, with incredible results. They found a number of hits of previously unsolved crimes, and they were able to bring peace of mind to a lot of people who had been living under a cloud of unsolved crime when they processed these unprocessed rape kits.  Nationally, the problem is still big, with as many as 175,000 rape kits that still haven't been analyzed, and this is something we need to continue to attack. It is down from 400,000 at one point, was the estimate, down to 175,000, but that is still unacceptable.  Victims of sexual assault, scarred by painful memories and physical trauma, can't afford to wait for funding that is easier to come by. They need their stories to be heard, the evidence to be tested, and the results expedited. Federal, State, and local officials owe them those things. If we dawdle, those cases go cold, and they are the ones who bear the scars and the pain of these unresolved crimes.  That is why the Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence Reporting Act, called the SAFER Act, is so important. That is the bill I mentioned a moment ago that we passed in the Senate on It reauthorizes a program created in 2013 that has helped law enforcement reduce the national rape kit backlog. I thank my friend and colleague, Representative Ted Poe over in the House, for sponsoring the House version.  The original legislation increased the amount of funds spent on untested kits by 35 percent and allowed 5 to 7 percent of them to be used on audits of existing law enforcement programs. These audits, in turn, uncovered tens of thousands of untested kits across the country, each with evidence that could be used to bring an offender to justice. The new bill passed by the Senate this week goes further. It ensures that pediatric forensic nurses are available for training so that, once they complete it, they are better equipped to respond promptly and appropriately to children suffering from abuse.  Finally, the bill extends the sunset provision of the SAFER Program, which will ensure the longevity of a program with a proven history of success.  I am grateful to have a wide range of bipartisan support, including the senior Senator from Minnesota, as well as the senior Senators from Nevada and Colorado, who are original cosponsors. This is a good example of legislation that is bipartisan and that makes progress toward solving a very real problem in our country. But, as so often we find the case, there is not much reporting on it, much attention paid, but it is worth noting here on the Senate floor that bipartisan progress on important legislation that helps people's lives become better is being done here in the                            CORRECTIONS Act  Mr.President, I also want to bring up another important piece of legislation I reintroduced this last week, the Corrections Oversight, Recidivism Reduction, and Eliminating Cost to Taxpayers in Our National System Let me call it the CORRECTIONS Act for short because that is a mouthful. I am grateful to my Democratic cosponsor, the junior Senator from Rhode Island, Mr.Whitehouse, for joining me on what is, like the SAFER Act, significant bipartisan legislation.  My home State of Texas has a well-deserved reputation for being tough on crime, but we have also learned over time that it is important to be smart on crime too. We successfully implemented statewide criminal justice reforms that help low-risk offenders become productive members of society once they reenter civil society from prison, and the State is focused on the important role rehabilitation can play.  I am not naive enough to think that every person who is imprisoned behind bars, having been convicted of a criminal offense, is going to take advantage of the opportunity to right their path and to get on with their life, but some will, and given the proper assessments and incentives, we have found that this sort of approach works.  The CORRECTIONS Act that Senator Whitehouse and I have introduced builds off of the State models that have worked in Rhode Island, Georgia, Texas, Louisiana, and elsewhere, and it requires the Bureau of Prisons to provide programs that partner with faith-based and community-based organizations to better prepare these men and women to become law-abiding and active members of society. I hope the Senate can follow Texas's lead and implement these commonsense, bipartisan reforms.  This bill achieves a number of objectives, which I will mention briefly.  First, it requires the Department of Justice to develop risk-assessment tools to evaluate the recidivism potential of all eligible offenders.  Second, it refocuses resources on those offenders most likely to commit future crimes and allows lower risk inmates to serve their sentences under less restrictive conditions, thus reducing prison costs, so the taxpayer wins too.  Third, the bill expands programming--such as substance abuse treatment and vocational training--that has been proven to reduce recidivism.  Fourth, it requires the Bureau of Prisons to foster partnerships with faith-based and nonprofit and community-based organizations in order to deliver a broad spectrum of programming to prisoners.  Next, it allows inmates who successfully complete recidivism-reduction programs to earn credit toward time in prerelease custody, while eliminating eligibility for inmates convicted of serious crimes.  Additionally, the bill requires the Department of Justice to implement inmate reentry pilot projects across the country and to study their effects so that we can gain a better understanding of what works and what doesn't work when it comes to offenders' reintegration into society.  Finally, the CORRECTIONS Act creates a national commission to review every aspect of our criminal justice system. The last review of this type was done in 1965. And while I think Congress--certainly this is within our wheelhouse, but we probably don't have the bandwidth to do this, which is why this national commission is so important to be able to report back to Congress and make recommendations to us.  We know one thing for sure: that when people serve their sentence and they are released from prison, they are going to reenter society. Why wouldn't we want to make sure those who are willing to deal with their addiction, to learn a skill, to get a GED, and to otherwise improve their lives--why wouldn't we want to make sure they are better prepared when they reenter civil society? Otherwise, they are left with this turnstile of crime where they go from prison, to the community, to committing another crime, to another conviction, and back to prison again.  Our focus should be on helping individuals find a productive path as contributing members of society, and that involves making sure returning to prison doesn't happen because there is no alternative. By implementing job training, drug rehabilitation, and mental health treatment, we can focus and save taxpayer dollars, lower crime and incarceration rates, decrease recidivism, and most importantly, we can help people change their own lives for the better.  Joining State and local officials at the forefront of this are groups like Prison Fellowship and the Texas Public Policy Foundation, which create programs for inmates, such as the Prison Entrepreneurship Program--or PEP for short--which teaches prisoners how to start and manage their own businesses when they begin life on the outside. You would be amazed by individuals who started their own businesses through the PEP program and turned their lives around in the process through the mentorship and fellowship that these programs provide.  I hope we can learn from the laboratories of democracy, known as the States, where we implemented successful criminal justice reform programs--this time, in our prison system--where we will all benefit. Taxpayers benefit because we will have to incarcerate fewer people because they won't continue this cycle of release, offend, and[[Page S6787]]reincarceration--at least a certain percentage of them won't. We can help people whose lives are in a tailspin because of drug or alcohol addiction or who feel as though they are on a dead-end street because they simply don't have the job skills or the education in order to compete in the economy.  I hope we can follow the lead of successful experiments in our States, such as Texas, and implement these commonsense, bipartisan reforms in our Federal prison system.  Mr.President, let me say in conclusion that I know the administration is very interested in engaging on criminal justice reform. Last year, we worked on a sentencing and prison reform bill that unfortunately seems to not be going anywhere. While the prison reform component of it seems to have a consensus of support here in the Congress and I think could pass and be signed into law, the sentencing reform piece is a little more controversial and I know divides even the Republican conference, and I am not sure what it does with the Democratic conference. But I believe we ought to start on a step-by-step basis, get what we can get done, and get it to the President for his signature, while providing these tools to inmates who are incarcerated through the Bureau of Prisons, and then keep working on the other parts on which we perhaps have not yet been able to build consensus.  I hope our colleagues will work with us on this important piece of legislation as we work to reform our criminal justice system in ways that make sense and that save taxpayer dollars.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from                               Tax Reform  ",CREC-2017-10-25-pt1-PgS6781.txt,1692,STOP SETTLEMENT SLUSH FUNDS ACT OF 2017,2017.0,25.0,October
808,topic-id,1241,"Mr.President, soon the Senate will pass a supplemental appropriations bill that provides much needed relief for folks across the country who are recovering from hurricane and wildfire devastation. While some of these resources will impact Texans who are recovering from Hurricane Harvey, I stress that much more will be needed in my  I will make one point abundantly clear, which is that Harvey has not been permanently handled in It is not over and done with, and it is not time to just move on. There was the storm, and now there is the storm after the storm.  Nearly 2 months after the hurricane--the most extreme rain event in U.history--many Texans are still waiting for normalcy to return to their debris-littered lawns and their torn-up living rooms, to their daily routines, their workplaces, their children's schools. The waters may have receded, but their troubles have not.  I have read, for example, about people having to wait 2, 3, or 4 hours before they can actually even speak to Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, representatives, who themselves are overwhelmed with requests that are related not only to Hurricane Harvey but to Hurricane Irma's devastation in Florida and to Maria's flooding in Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Never before do I remember a series of natural disasters hitting our Nation in such quick succession.  Yet I know, even as the inspectors are still evaluating damaged properties--moving as quickly as they can--FEMA is hiring hundreds of additional staff in the next few weeks to help with the backlog. I am hopeful this will help my fellow Texans, who have grown frustrated and discouraged by the procedural hurdles. As of Sunday, three shelters remain open in Texas, and over 60,000 people are living in hotels because their homes--reeking of mold--are still not ready, and they will not be for months.  A teacher I heard about is living on a cot in her classroom while her house undergoes repairs. The mayor of Rockport, one of the most devastated communities along the gulf coast, has said that perhaps one-third of the destroyed areas in his town may never be rebuilt. Hundreds of businesses have yet to reopen, and if they don't, it will make matters much tougher on local residents than they already are. The number of houses yet to be repaired is even larger than the number of businesses. The mayor of Port Aransas says that 75 percent of the homes in his community--three-quarters, just imagine--were severely damaged or destroyed. These are just a few of the reasons the situation demands ongoing attention, as well as the full extent of government resources.  Last month Congress got started--that was before subsequent hurricanes occurred--and the first wave of disaster relief was $15.25 billion. Then the House passed the second wave, a $36.5 billion disaster relief package to replenish FEMA's nearly depleted coffers and to address the National Flood Insurance Program, which should help pay some Texas claims.  Here in the Senate, the cloture vote on this second wave was yesterday, and I am glad we moved to end debate. It is clear to me that Texas will need significant additional Federal assistance for our recovery efforts. As I have told folks back home, we don't expect to be treated any better than anyone else, but we are not going to be treated any worse.  Last week, I spoke with President Trump and OMB Director Rick Mulvaney, and they made a commitment to me that there would be another funding request coming over in mid-November that would include Texas-specific hurricane relief. I realize that the folks impacted by Irma and Maria are also reeling, as well, and we want to make sure that we are locking arms with all of our colleagues who represent the areas hit by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, and also those hit by the wildfires out We are working together.  I appreciate the President's pledge, and I will continue to work with Senator Cruz and with Governor Abbott to make sure that Texas has what it needs, not only to make a full recovery but a timely one as well.                               Tax Reform  Mr.President, at lunch, the President of the United States will be joining us to discuss a different but very important topic, and that is Federal tax reform. We want to make sure that hard-working Americans get to keep more of what they earn in their paycheck and that we can help them improve their standard of living by reducing their tax burden.  We passed a budget resolution last week that was step one to getting where we need to be. So I am excited the President is joining us today, and I look forward to hearing his ideas. It is important that we all pull together to accomplish this joint goal. We appreciate his engagement on the issue, which has been clear from day one.                  Congressional Review Act Resolution  Finally, Mr.President, I would like to bring up one additional matter that we will be voting on soon, and that is the repeal of the recent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule, which governs how community banks, among others, resolve disputes with consumers. This rule that the CFPB issued bans using arbitration. Arbitration is a widely accepted method of resolving disputes between consumers and banks and other financial institutions, and it actually increases the benefit that flows to the consumer, as opposed to the alternatives, which are class action lawsuits that enrich lawyers, whereas consumers get pennies on the dollar.  The CFPB's own data shows that the rule would transfer hundreds of millions of dollars from businesses to plaintiffs' lawyers over the next 5 years. According to a recent Treasury report, the rule could generate 3,000 additional class action lawsuits over the next 5 years, costing businesses $500 million in defense fees alone and obviously enriching those who would benefit more than the consumers themselves; that is, their lawyers.  The CFPB data itself shows that the vast majority of class action lawsuits delivered next to no relief to the class in question--consumers. And the Treasury report found that the agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, failed to consider much less onerous alternatives, like increased disclosure or a more limited ban.  I have been around long enough to remember that back in the eighties there was a movement called alternative dispute resolution, led by the Chief Justice of the U.Supreme Court, who pointed out that while access to courts was absolutely critical, unfortunately, because of the delay and expense of litigation, alternative dispute resolution mechanisms could actually benefit consumers more if they chose to resort to those alternative dispute mechanisms, and that is exactly what arbitration is. I believe that the CFPB has gone above and beyond its authority in eliminating this very meaningful way for consumers to get compensated when they get involved in disputes with their bank or other financial institutions, and there is no reason for us to enrich a class of lawyers who bring these lawsuits and see consumers end[[Page S6728]]up with pennies on the dollar, which is what the status quo would permit.  Thankfully, we have the power of the Congressional Review Act to overturn the rule, as the House has already done. I urge my colleagues to repeal the CFPB arbitration rule so that we can get rid of this harmful regulation, which imposes obvious costs and offers invisible benefits.  I yield the floor.

411,topic-id,534,"Madam President, today, together with my colleague Senator Jim Risch, I wish to recognize the service of MG Gary Sayler as he retires from leading the Idaho National Guard this month.  With more than 40 years of his distinguished 45-year military career dedicated to the Idaho National Guard, Major General Sayler has served Idaho in a variety of leadership capacities, including 7 years as Idaho's adjutant general. Under Major General Sayler's direction as commander, the 124th Fighter Wing played vital roles in numerous overseas missions, including Operation Provide Comfort in 1994, Operation Allied Force in 1999, and Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003 and 2004. He subsequently served as assistant adjutant general from 2004 to 2010 before being appointed as adjutant general for the Idaho National Guard in 2010, during the fighter wing's ongoing missions in the Middle East in Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Inherent Resolve, and Operation Freedom's The 124th Fighter Wing has received numerous accolades under his steady guidance. These include the prestigious Spaatz Trophy in 2016 and again in 2017; the Governor's Outstanding Unit Award; and the U.Air Force Outstanding Unit  Major General Sayler has built on his extensive experience to lead with practical knowledge. His educational background includes a bachelor of science in history and education at North Dakota State University in 1971 and later courses at the Air Command and Staff College, Weapons School, and Air War Major General Sayler began his first assignment in the U.Air Force in Thailand, flying combat missions in Southeast Asia before joining the Idaho Air National Guard in 1977 as a weapons systems officer for the 124th Tactical Reconnaissance With a master navigator rating, he has extensive experience flying multiple aircrafts and has logged more than 4,100 flight hours. These include 392 combat hours that also account for his combat missions flying the F4-G over Iraq during Operations Southern Watch and Provide His promotions and list of major awards and decorations that he has earned for his outstanding service are extensive and include the Legion of Merit, the Meritorious Service Medal, and the Air Medal with silver oakleaf cluster.  Based on these accomplishments, Major General Sayler has provided reasoned and experienced council as we have worked together to address the needs of the Idaho National Guard, including protecting and advancing the flying mission at Gowen Field as an exemplary force within the National Guard for generations to come. While visionary in his goals for the Idaho National Guard, a hallmark of Major General Sayler's leadership has been his high regard for the servicemembers he leads and their families. In addition to the attention and support he has devoted to Idaho guardsmen and their families, Major General Sayler has also been instrumental in forging enduring relationships with the local communities and Native Tribes undergirding Gowen These bonds will likely propel the Idaho National Guard and Idaho communities forward for years to come.[[Page S6847]]  We congratulate Major General Sayler on a distinguished and exemplary career serving our Nation and leading the Idaho National Idaho has benefited greatly from his steady, astute leadership.

595,topic-id,682,"Mr.President, we are having a very interesting and, obviously, intense debate tonight about arbitration clauses in financial contracts. Those who oppose the resolution that is on the floor tonight would have you think that the battle is over whether or not to stop what they call forced arbitration clauses in contracts.  The real issue is whether we will try to force the resolution of disputes in financial resolution into class action lawsuits. This is a question about whether we should force dispute resolution mechanisms into class actions. In fact, let me read the actual language of the rule that we are debating. It doesn't say anything about forced arbitration clauses. In fact, the rule doesn't stop arbitration clauses in contracts. It stops protections in arbitration clauses against class action litigation. Let's read what the actual rule says: The CFPB rule prohibits a company from relying in any way on a predispute arbitration agreement with respect to any aspect of a class action that concerns any consumer financial product or service.  In other words, the entire purpose of this rule is to promote class action litigation and to stop arbitration resolution when there is a dispute. Specifically, the rule requires any predispute arbitration agreement to include this specific language. In other words, people and companies are required to put this language into their agreements. This tells you what the dispute is about.  The language mandated by this rule is this: We agree that neither we nor anyone else will rely on this agreement to stop you from being part of a class action case in a court. You may file a class action in court or you may be a member of a class action filed by someone else.  It is about as clear as it could be. The issue here is this: Do we force the resolution of disagreements or disputes in financial transactions into class action litigation?  This is a rule to benefit the plaintiff's bar.  The rule also requires that companies that go through arbitration must submit records of arbitration cases to the CFPB within 60 days of those records.  Some have raised the argument that arbitration agreements gag consumers, including, as was suggested, saying that, were it not for arbitration agreements, the Wells Fargo fake accounts scandal would have been discovered earlier. The only thing confidential in arbitration is what is brought as specific evidence in that arbitration proceeding. The clauses in the law permit people to discuss the claims they are bringing and the company and the individual, if they choose to discuss them.  Nothing stopped anyone from talking publically about what was going on at Wells Arbitration keeps evidence confidential for the protection of consumers, but it does not keep them from speaking out about it.  Further, if judges believe that clauses do that, they often find them unconstitutional, as they stop consumers from speaking out. In fact, if you think about it, what generated the public understanding of the Wells Fargo circumstance, if I recall correctly, was a Los Angeles Times news article. It was the CFPB itself that failed, apparently, to read the news and understand what was going on at Wells That was the reason that we saw it take so long for any action to take place--not an arbitration agreement.  In addition, those who are attacking arbitration agreements seem to make the case that arbitration agreements stop consumers from having options. The CFPB's own study said: The clear majority of arbitration clauses within our review specifically recognize and allow access to small claims court as an alternative to arbitration.  Let's just be clear. Arbitration clauses don't gag consumers. They don't stop them from speaking out about what they see going wrong. They don't force them out of the courts if they want to go into a small claims court. The only thing they do that is being objected to here is that they try to force them to not agree to go into a class action lawsuit. It is literally that question that is the biggest issue that we are dealing with here.  ",CREC-2017-10-24-pt1-PgS6738-2.txt,250,BUDGET AND TAX REFORM,2017.0,24.0,October

602,topic-id,2077,"Let me reclaim my time, and the Senator can respond on his own time.  Let me clarify. As I indicated, even the CFPB, in its own study, said that most of the contracts--not all companies use the same contract--already allow two actions: 1, to go to small claims court or, 2, to go to arbitration. What the agreements don't allow is class action litigation. The specific and only restriction of the rule we are debating tonight is about whether class action litigation should be incentivized by taking out the ability of companies to insist that not be an alternative.  There is one restriction that we are debating here, and that is whether it is appropriate to allow companies to negotiate away class action litigation.  On July 10, the CFPB finalized its rule, as I have said, specifically prohibiting the use of predispute arbitration agreements that prevent consumers from participating in class action lawsuits.  The Dodd-Frank Act--the statute under which the CFPB was created--also set forth when the CFPB was authorized to prohibit, impose conditions upon, or limit the use of such agreements; namely, if the CFPB finds--and this is what they are required by law to find--that any such action was, 1, in the public interest and for the protection of consumers and, 2, consistent with the CFPB study's findings.  It is clear that the CFPB failed the legal requirements on both counts. In 2015 the CFPB released its final study and report on predispute arbitration to To say that the study was flawed is an understatement. It was panned for its questionable analysis,[[Page S6741]]data, and conclusions by the public, by academics, by consumers, by businesses, by Federal regulators, and by Members of Congress who noted that it could make consumers worse off by removing access to an important dispute resolution tool.  I will spend a few minutes delineating some of the valid criticisms, since the study was the basis and the legal requirement for the final rule. First, the study only compared class action settlements with arbitration awards. By only looking at arbitration awards and not consumer recovery in arbitration settlements that occur before awards, the CFPB ignored substantial evidence of arbitration agreements benefiting consumers.  The analogy that comes to mind is thinking about how much money you have in the bank by looking at your checking account, while ignoring what is in your savings account. Given this methodological flaw, it is difficult to make apples-to-apples comparisons about class action versus arbitration, but the Wall Street Journal's editorial board made a helpful observation: ``Of the 562 class actions the CFPB studied, none went to trial.'' Let me read that again: ``None went to trial.'' Most were dismissed by a judge or withdrawn by the plaintiffs or settled out of class.       The putative class victims received benefits in fewer than      20 percent of the cases, and the average cash recovery was--     wait for it--$32. Lawyers took an average 24 percent cut of      the cash payments, about $424 million in cases that settled.       Meanwhile, consumers were awarded relief in 32 of the 158      arbitration disputes the bureau examined--  These are arbitration results now--     and rewards averaged $5,389--or about 57 percent of every      dollar claimed. Consumers who used arbitration received      relief on average in two months after filing their claim.      Class-action members had to wait two years.  Clearly, the CFPB cherry-picked the information it liked and omitted what it did not like. The CFPB and its advocates of the rule also argue that the rule restores a consumer's day in court. But, again, the CFPB's study explicitly states that no class actions filed during the time period that the CFPB studied from 2010 to 2012 even went to trial.  The study added that most arbitration agreements in consumer financial contracts contain a ``small claims court carve-out,'' which provides the parties with a contractual right to pursue a claim in small claims court.  The CFPB claims that the rule will deter companies from bad behavior in the face of an increase in class action lawsuits. Yet there is no evidence to that effect.  A report released by the Treasury Department this week notes that ``after years of study, the Bureau has identified no evidence indicating that firms that do not use arbitration clauses treat their customers better or have higher levels of compliance with the law.''  The truth is, rather than deterring companies from bad behavior, this rule will encourage frivolous lawsuits that companies feel compelled to settle, shifting hundreds of millions of dollars from businesses to plaintiff attorneys.  Many Members of Congress have weighed in on both the CFPB's arbitration study and how the final rule was developed. In 2015, 86 Members of the House and Senate wrote to Director Cordray asking that he reopen the arbitration study due to concerns about the Bureau's process. In 2016, 140 Members of the House and Senate again wrote to Director Cordray, raising concerns about the CFPB's proposed rule and asking the Bureau to reexamine their approach to arbitration. Unfortunately, the final rule was still issued without addressing any of the concerns identified.  Federal financial regulators have raised a number of concerns with the assumptions used in the development of the rule and the lack of consideration for alternative approaches. Recently, the Treasury Department issued an analysis that concluded that the CFPB did not sufficiently substantiate with any quantitative assessment its assumption that the current level of compliance in consumer financial markets is ``generally sub-optimal,'' which means that the CFPB has not adequately demonstrated the rule will solve the assumed problem it set out to fix.  Treasury also noted the CFPB could have considered less costly alternatives, including more effectively informing consumers, clearer disclosure, or more targeted regulation. However, it failed to do so, opting instead for an all-or-nothing approach, which, again, is specifically designed to generate a phenomenal increase in class action litigation.  The Acting Comptroller of the Currency has also raised serious concerns with the rule and asked for the opportunity to review the CFPB's data and analysis to determine the potential impact of the rule. According to a recent letter by the Acting Comptroller of the Currency:       Eliminating the use of this tool could result in less      effective consumer protection and remedies, while simply      enriching class-action lawyers.       At the same time, the proposal may potentially decrease the      products and services offered to their consumers, while      increasing their costs.  The CFPB attempted to estimate the increase in costs, albeit incompletely, that are associated with this final rule and that could be passed onto consumers. The CFPB estimates in its final rule that the companies will incur $2.6 billion of additional fees and settlements over the next 5 years, $330 million of which will go directly to plaintiff lawyers. As astounding as these numbers are, the estimate includes only Federal court cases and fails to include State court cases.  Treasury's analysis also notes that the CFPB appears to understate the share of class actions dismissed by the courts, thus failing to adequately consider the costs of meritless cases. According to Treasury, assuming that just 10 percent of class action cases are meritless, ``the Rule would have to reduce harm to consumers by $500 million per year to demonstrate any net benefit to society. The Rule does not come close to making that showing.''  The OCC recently shed more light on how the CFPB's final rule could impact the cost of consumer credit. While the CFPB said that it could not identify any evidence to that effect, it did concede that ``this does not mean that no pass-through [to consumers] occurred; it only means that the analysis did not provide evidence of it'' and that ``most providers will pass through at least portions of some of the costs.''  Using the same data, the OCC conducted its own analysis and found ``a strong probability of a significant increase in the cost of credit cards as a result of eliminating arbitration clauses.''  In fact, the OCC found an 88-percent chance that the total cost of credit will increase and a 56-percent chance that costs will increase by at least 3 percent.  As Acting Comptroller Noreika noted, that means that a consumer, living week to week, could see credit card rates jump from an average of 12.5 percent to nearly 16 percent. He correctly added that ``to the extent the CFPB's arbitration rule is being undermined, it is undermined by the CFPB's own data and the working paper on which the CFPB relied.''  Community banks and credit unions across this Nation are raising concerns with the rule. The Independent Community Bankers Association opposes the arbitration rule because:       Community banks are relationship lenders, many of which      have served their communities for multiple generations.      A reputation for fair dealing is essential for their      success, and abusive consumer practices have absolutely no      place in their business model. Community banks invest      heavily in resolving customer complaints amicably and on a      timely basis.  In addition, the Credit Union National Administration, or CUNA, opposes the arbitration rule because ``[a]mong the many consumer protections associated with the mission of credit unions is the high-quality service they provide to their members, which has prompted a successful system for quickly and amicably resolving disputes in the limited instances where they arise.''  While the CFPB claims that many community banks and credit unions do not even have these clauses, I have heard from many small financial institutions that this rule would have a significant impact on their operations.  On July 25, by a vote of 231 to 190, the House voted to overturn this rule. The administration weighed in on the House's efforts, saying: ``This legislation would protect consumer choices[[Page S6742]]by eliminating a costly and burdensome regulation and reining in the bureaucracy and inadvisable regulatory actions of the CFPB.''  It is alarming that the CFPB moved forward with a final rule in this manner, especially in light of the numerous concerns expressed. The CFPB could have made recommendations to improve the arbitration process or arbitration clauses if it identified concerns.  Aside from the substantive concerns about this specific rule, it brings the CFPB's own structure and accountability into focus. The CFPB is unlike any other Federal agency. Since its creation, we have argued that far too much power is invested in the CFPB Director without any effective checks or balances.  Last year, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the CFPB, as it is currently structured, is unconstitutional. The ruling stated that Congress erred in creating a far-reaching agency that is led by a single In particular, the ruling noted that ``the CFPB's concentration of enormous executive power in a single, unaccountable, unchecked Director not only departs from subtle historical practice, but also poses a far greater risk to arbitrary decision-making and abuse of power.''  The Director is further insulated by being able to automatically withdraw funds from the Federal Reserve, rather than being required to justify the CFPB's annual funding needs to  The court's decision mirrored arguments from Members of Congress that the Director has wide-ranging power with little oversight and is a gross departure from the settled historical practice of having multimember commissions at agencies to keep them in check. In fact, the Senate repeatedly urged the prior administration to impose checks on the  In 2011, 44 Senators wrote to the administration expressing concern about the lack of accountability in the structure of the In 2013, 43 Senators wrote to the administration once again. In each instance, we advocated for the establishment of proper checks and balances for the agency, which, had they been imposed, almost certainly would have avoided this crisis rule that we see coming out.  Some of the specific checks and balances for which we advocated included replacing the single Director with a bipartisan commission to run the CFPB, subjecting the CFPB to congressional appropriations, and establishing safety-and-soundness checks for prudential regulators. Nevertheless, despite our efforts, this agency remains just as powerful and unaccountable today, and this rule is just the most recent demonstration of its continued lack of accountability.  Now the Senate has the opportunity to take another step toward holding this agency accountable. The CFPB failed to demonstrate that consumers will fare better in light of its arbitration rule. In fact, they may be worse off.  I urge my colleagues to help ensure that consumers maintain access to quick, inexpensive, and efficient mechanisms of dispute resolution by overturning this rule.  Thank you.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-10-24-pt1-PgS6738-2.txt,250,COUNTRY BEFORE PARTY AND PATRIOTISM BEFORE POLITICS,2017.0,24.0,October

610,topic-id,1901,"Mr.President, while we have a little bit of open time in between speakers, I thought I might respond to some of the things that have been said.  Those who are opposing this resolution tonight continue to put it as though this were a case of trying to stop consumers from having an adequate way to access dispute resolution and make it look like it is the big guys against the little guys. First of all, this rule we are talking about only applies to financial institutions. It doesn't apply in all the other kinds of cases that have been thrown out here tonight. If you want to look at the financial institutions that are the most concerned about this rule, it is the little guys. It is the credit unions. It is the local community banks that are pleading with us to stop this abusive rule. I just think that part of the record needs to be set straight.  Again, I am going to lay out what this debate is really about. This debate is not about trying to help facilitate banks and credit card companies and others in cramming down some solution on consumers. It is about trying to facilitate pushing dispute resolution into class action litigation. This is a very clear move to drive our dispute resolution in this country into class litigation.  I am going to give a little bit of history, but before I do that, I want to again read to the folks who are listening in on this debate what this rule exactly does. You would think from all of the debate that it stops consumers from going to court or that it forces consumers to use an abusive arbitration process. It is very clear. This rule[[Page S6746]]prohibits a company from relying in any way on a predispute arbitration agreement with respect to any aspect of a class action that concerns any consumer financial product or service.  The rule goes further. Remember that the ones that are the most worried about this are the credit unions and the small banks. Every agreement they enter into has to contain this language. This tells you what the fight is about.  We agree that neither we nor anyone else will rely on this agreement to stop you from being part of a class action case in court.  That is the rule we are talking about. You may file a class action in court or you may be a member of a class action filed by someone else. Are we fighting against a mandate--basically, a rule that is going to drive decisions and dispute resolutions into class action litigation? Yes, we are. We are fighting to protect the current system, which is one that has worked for years and years. I am going to get into that system. In fact, I will get into it right now. Let's compare class action litigation with arbitration as one of the alternatives.  In fact, before I make that comparison, let me point out that the CFPB's own study shows that the clear majority of arbitration clauses they studied allow access to small claims court as an alternative to arbitration. There is no effort to say to the consumer, if you want to, you can go to small claims court. In the United States, the limit in small claims is different in each It ranges from $3,000 to $15,000, but I would say the most common level is about $10,000 of a claim. So a consumer who has any kind of a claim up to about $10,000 can go to a small claims court.  Let's compare arbitration with class action litigation.  How much does the consumer recover? In a class action, the average is $32 per person. In arbitration, the average is $5,389 per person.  How long does it take to get the recovery? In a class action, it is 23 months, on average. In arbitration, it is 5 months, on average.  How many of them actually go to trial? Now, this is interesting because you think of a class action as your day in court. Remember that those who argued earlier tonight were telling consumers they were not going to get their day in court. The number of class action lawsuits that went to court were zero. Class action litigation is a mechanism to drive settlements. As for the number of arbitration suits that went to court, 32 percent reached a decision on the merits. That was not an actual court case, but it was a resolution by a decision maker. With regard to settlements, 12 percent classwide are made. In arbitration, 57 achieve settlement.  Here is one of the striking ones. How much is paid in attorneys' fees? In a class action, according to this study, which is the CFPB's study, $424 million goes to attorneys' fees. There were no attorneys' fees under the arbitration. There were some arbitration fees, and I will get to that in a minute, but they were nowhere close. By the way, this number, the $424 million that went into attorneys' fees, is the reason we are having our debate tonight. This rule seeks to drive this decision-making model into this zone.  As for estimated additional class action costs for covered companies, it is $2.6 billion for class actions and none for arbitration.  Some have said this is just an example of the Republicans trying to help Wells Fargo out. First of all, I am the chairman of the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs We have held hearings on the Wells Fargo situation and continue to look at it very closely. Senators from both parties take it very seriously and are working to find a resolution, but when it comes to the question of whether Wells Fargo used arbitration agreements to avoid liability, these are the facts.  Wells Fargo, which was found to have opened millions of unauthorized accounts in the names of its consumers, agreed to settle this for $142 million--twice as much as the projected consumer loss. They made that agreement because arbitrating them in individual disputes would have cost much more. The argument that Wells Fargo is the example of what we are working to try to facilitate here is just not true.  As I said, let's talk a little bit about arbitration. On the floor tonight, arbitration has been characterized as this terrible, devilish idea that has been designed by Big Business in America to try to push the little guy out of a fair chance at recovery in a dispute. The Acting Comptroller of the Currency, who heads the independent Bureau of the Treasury, which is in charge of supervising and regulating national banks, has raised serious concerns.  In his recent letter, he indicates that arbitration can be an effective alternative dispute resolution mechanism that can provide better outcomes for consumers and financial service providers without the high costs associated with litigation.  That is key. In fact, if you look at history, nearly a century ago, Congress made private agreements to resolve disputes through arbitration valid, irrevocable, and enforceable under a Federal law, which is called the Federal Arbitration This was a decision by this Congress nearly 100 years ago that said we have to find a way that is fair to resolve disputes that is not so expensive as the current dispute resolution models we have, namely, litigation. This longstanding Federal policy in favor of private dispute resolution serves the twin purposes of economic efficiency and freedom of contract.  Some have said this just lets banks get away with cheating their customers, but the opposite is true. Eliminating the use of this tool could result in less effective consumer protection and fewer remedies while simply enriching class action lawyers. At the same time, the proposal may potentially decrease the products and services offered to consumers while increasing their costs.  The Wall Street Journal's editorial board similarly noted that arbitration has allowed consumers to easily resolve disputes by phone or online without their having an attorney.  As I have said, virtually every consumer who does not like this solution has the alternative to go to small claims court. The question here is whether we will facilitate pushing consumers out of the choice of arbitration. If the law is changed, which is what this rule seeks to do, then the disincentive for financial institutions to rely on arbitration will be seriously injured. The worry we have--and the intent of this rule--is that it will drive dispute resolution into class action litigation. That is what this whole dispute here tonight is about.  One of my colleagues tried to characterize arbitration as this system in which this company hires these decision makers, these arbitration judges, and that the judges are going to be biased because the judges are bought by the companies that use them for the arbitration. That is not an accurate description of what arbitration is.  There is actually a Federal law, which I have already referenced, which sets up the parameters in which arbitration operates, and there is an American Arbitration Association that administers it. When a person chooses to go into arbitration, what happens is that the whole system that takes over is administered not by the company but by the AAA, and under the American Arbitration Association's procedures, it appoints an arbitrator. The implication made earlier was that the arbitrator always rules for the company because that is the company that hires him.  Here is the truth. In the appointments of 1,847 disputes that the CFPB studied, arbitrators were appointed in 975 that involved 477 different arbitrators. In 704 of those disputes, the AAA appointed arbitrators who had also been in other financial disputes. Some of these arbitrators get picked a couple of times, but they are not picked by the company, and they are not beholden to the company. That is one of the reasons we set up the Federal arbitration system the way it is.  My point is, the effort to try to characterize this as some devious system that has been created to try to stop consumers from having access to fairness is simply false. We have a very fair system that has been working for over 100 years in this country. It has been litigated and litigated because those who want litigation to be the norm hate it. They do not want arbitration to work, but the reality is, it has worked wonderfully, and it has survived the litigation assaults.  Now those who want to drive decision making more into the courts and more[[Page S6747]]into class action litigation have been able to get a willing, listening ear in the Director of the CFPB, who, as I have said earlier, has no accountability to Congress, who does not even look to Congress for his budget, and is obviously on the side of the litigation bar, which wants to, once again, drive our decision-making system into a litigation mode.  That is the debate we are having. That is the argument tonight. Anyone who tries to say this is an effort by your local credit union, your local community bank, or your large credit card company to try to stop consumers from having adequate access to dispute resolution is mischaracterizing what the debate tonight is about.  I encourage all of my colleagues to reject this inappropriate and, frankly, expensive and dangerous rule.

632,topic-id,658,"Mr.President, just for everybody's information, I am going to speak for just 2 or 3 minutes and then yield back our time, and then Senator Brown will do the same, and then we will proceed to a vote.  I just want to make clear what we are talking about here. You have heard a lot of talk tonight about how this is trying to stop the forced arbitration. You have heard that word a lot. Let's make it really clear what the debate is about.  Using the CFPB's own study--I am quoting the CFPB now--``the clear majority of the arbitration clauses within our review specifically recognize--and allow--access to small claims courts as an alternative to arbitration.'' So this notion that we are here fighting tonight about whether people who have small claims don't have any outlet except arbitration is simply false. That is a false orchestration of what the argument is.  What is the argument? Well, why don't we look at the rule and see what the rule says again? And now I am quoting specifically from the CFPB rule. It prohibits a company from relying ``in any way''--it doesn't say forced arbitration--from relying ``in any way on a pre-dispute arbitration agreement . . . with respect to any aspect of a class action.''  It goes on, and the rule actually states specific language that people[[Page S6760]]have to put in their contracts. What is that language? This rule requires people to ``agree that neither we nor anyone else will rely on this agreement to stop you from being part of a class action case in court.''  So the issue here, Mr.President, is not forced arbitration. Even existing arbitration clauses allow alternatives. The issue here is the CFPB's effort to force dispute resolution into class action litigation.  Some have talked here tonight about how we are trying to stop access to the courtroom. Well, first of all, I think that argument is belied again by the CFPB's own study that explicitly states that no class actions filed during the time period that the CFPB studied even went to trial. So this argument falls on its own face.  Meanwhile, let's look again at what the difference between arbitration and forced class actions does. In arbitration, a decision on the merits was reached in 32 percent of the disputes filed, where, as I indicated, zero of the class action cases even went to trial. In addition, according to the CFPB's own study, most arbitration agreements and consumer financial contracts contain a small claims court carve-out.  Given the methodological flaws in the CFPB's study, it is difficult to make apples-to-apples comparisons about class action versus arbitration, but the Wall Street Journal's editorial board made this observation:       Of the 562 class actions the CFPB studied, none went to      trial. Most were dismissed by a judge, withdrawn by the      plaintiffs or settled out of class.  I will conclude with just the numbers that we have already talked about many times tonight.  What is the comparison between arbitration and class action litigation? That is the issue tonight. What is the comparison? The average recovery for the consumer in a class action case is $32. The average recovery in an arbitration is $5,389. It takes 2 years for the class action to take place; 5 months for the arbitration. In 12 percent of the class action matters did they even reach settlements. In 60 percent, they reached them in arbitration. Attorneys' fees: $424 million in class action cases; virtually no attorneys' fees in arbitration cases.  The point here is exactly this: The debate tonight is not, as many would have you believe, over whether we are forcing arbitration. Even the arbitration clause in the current system creates options for consumers to go into small claims courts. The vote here tonight is whether to force dispute resolution into class action litigation, and that is what we need to decide with tonight's vote.

734,topic-id,3413,"Madam President, I rise today at a time of extraordinary opportunity. The American people have entrusted us with something that, historically, is quite rare: a Republican President, Republican control of every executive agency, and Republican majorities in both Houses of Now it is incumbent on us to stand up and lead, to deliver on the promises we made to do what we told the American people we would do.  We have before us right now an opportunity for historic tax cuts. Just last week, this body voted out a budget resolution that is the vehicle for adopting tax cuts. I urge every Member of this body to come together in support of a strong, bold tax plan that cuts taxes on every working man and women and that brings back jobs and economic growth.  Growth is really fundamental to every other challenge we have in this country. If you look historically, since World War II, our economy has grown on average about 3.3 percent a year. Yet, from 2008 to today, we have grown only 1.2 percent a year--about a third of the historic rate of growth.  If we don't turn that around, none of our other problems are solvable. If you care about the national debt, if you care about the deficit, if you care about rebuilding and strengthening our military, if you care about strengthening and improving Social Security and Medicare so that they are there for the next generations, we have to have growth. With economic growth, every one of those is possible. Without growth--if we stay mired in the stagnant Obama 1- and 2-percent GDP growth, none of those problems are solvable.  Growth is foundational. I would like to lay out three principles and then seven key elements that I think should guide this body in tax reform. 1 is growth. When we are adopting tax cuts, we should focus directly on jobs and economic growth and focus on the reforms that produce jobs, that expand[[Page S6790]]economic growth, that grow our economy, that create more opportunity, and that raise wages.  Working men and women in this country are hurting. We need wages going up. We need more jobs. We need young people coming out of school with two, three, four, or five job opportunities. That is what tax cuts are all about. 1, we start with growth.  I will point out that we can do this. From 2008 to 2012, the economy grew 0.9 percent a year--less than 1 percent a year on average. If you look back in history to the previous 4-year period when growth averaged less than 1 percent a year, it was 1978 to 1982. It was coming out of the Jimmy Carter administration. It was the same failed economic policies--high taxes, high regulation, high spending, and high debt.  In 1981 Ronald Reagan came into the White The Reagan Presidency focused front and center on tax cuts, with major tax cuts in 1981, and then following it up in 1986 with major tax reform.  And what happened? When Reagan came in 1981 with across-the-board tax cuts and tax cuts for everybody, Democrats screamed, the media screamed, and yet the economy took off.  The fourth year of the Reagan Presidency, GDP growth wasn't 3 percent. It wasn't 4 percent. It wasn't 5 percent. It wasn't even 6 percent. It was 7.2 percent in 1984--7.2 percent, those are numbers you hear in the developing world. Those are numbers you hear in China and  All of our learned economists who are so world weary and all of our media reporters who are so world weary tell us: No, no, no, that kind of growth is not possible in America anymore. Accept the new normal of 1 and 2 percent of stagnancy, of young people buried in student loans, of people hurting. Accept that as the new normal.  That is nonsense. If we want to see Reagan-style growth, we need a Reagan-style tax cut--an unapologetic, unabashed tax cut that focuses on jobs.  The second big principle is simplicity. There is an old rule, KISS, or ``keep it simple, stupid,'' which is particularly powerful when it comes to tax reform. Bold simplicity has enormous power and, in particular, allowing every American to fill out their taxes on a postcard. I believe that should be an integral element of what we pass. It is what I have been pressing for many years, and what I would continue to urge my colleagues here in the Senate and in the House to do, which is to simplify the Tax Code so that we don't spend millions and millions of hours and paperwork wasted on compliance. Make it a postcard. Make it simple.  Then the third objective is fairness. We want a tax system that is fair, that isn't arbitrary, that isn't Washington picking winners and losers and deciding: OK, this industry we like; so you can do This industry we don't like; so you are going to hurt. We are going to pick between them.  We need to cut everybody's taxes.  Last week, I debated Bernie Sanders on CNN on tax reform. Bernie, to his credit, was very candid. He said he wanted to raise your taxes. If you are a taxpayer, your taxes are going up under Bernie and the Democrats' vision.  My vision is every bit as simple on the other side. If you are a taxpayer, I want to cut your taxes. That is what we need to do--to cut taxes fairly, across the board for every American, to reduce the burden from Washington, and to create jobs and economic opportunity.  I would note that, in that debate with Bernie, there was one exchange that I thought was particularly notable. Bernie, as you know, when he ran in Vermont did not run as a Rather, he ran telling the voters he was a socialist. I asked a simple question: What is the difference between a socialist and a Democrat on taxes?  He sat there for several seconds in silence and said: I don't know the answer to that.  My response was: Neither do  One side of this Chamber wants to raise your taxes if you are a taxpayer. The other side of this Chamber wants to cut your taxes if you are a taxpayer. That is a simple choice for the American people.  What are the elements that should reflect those principles? There are seven critical elements: 1, I believe we should create a simple, low, flat rate. Currently, there are seven individual rates with the top rate at nearly 40 percent. Ideally, what I believe we should have is one simple, low, flat tax.  When I was campaigning for President, I campaigned on a simple, flat tax of 10 percent for every individual and every family in this country, 16 percent as a business flat tax, and to abolish every other Federal tax, to abolish the corporate income tax, to abolish the death tax, to abolish the alternative minimum tax, and to abolish the payroll tax. Everyone pays a simple, flat 10 percent for individuals and 16 percent for businesses. Simplicity has power.  It may be the case that we don't have the votes to go to a simple, flat tax today. If that is where we are, if we don't have the votes to do it today, then the closer we get to that the better. If we can't get to a simple, flat tax, then going from seven brackets to three is an improvement, and going from three to two is even better, and going from two to one would be even better than that. We need to press consistently for a low, simple, flat rate that is fair for everyone.  The second element, which we talked about just a minute ago, is filing your taxes on a postcard. Let me tell you the most wonderful aspect of that simplicity. It is not the billions of hours, it is not the billions of dollars that are saved. The best aspects of filing your taxes on a postcard are actually the physical dimensions of the postcard. It means that Congress can't add a bunch of new things. Even if we tried to put it in four-point font, eventually you will run out of space on the postcard. The reason a postcard is so important is it imposes a discipline on the Federal Government that it can't carve out a special loophole for every favored or disfavored group because it is simple and flat and fair for everybody.  3, allow immediate expensing. What does expensing mean? It means that if a business makes a capital expenditure, right now, they physically have to amortize it over a number of years. Instead, what we should do is allow full and immediate expensing.  If a farmer in the Presiding Officer's home State of Iowa buys a new tractor, that farmer should be able to expense it immediately, that year. If a steel factory buys new equipment and hires new workers to operate that equipment, that steel factory should be able to expense that new equipment immediately. If a diner buys new kitchen equipment and hires new cooks and waiters and waitresses, the owner of that small business should be able to expense that capital expenditure. And why is that? The reason is the first principle I started with--growth.  If you care about jobs and economic growth, expensing is a powerful engine for jobs and economic growth. It creates millions of new jobs because that capital has to be spent in the United It has to be spent here. That tractor is in the United States; that steel equipment is in the United States; that diner with the cooking equipment is in the United States, which means those jobs are in the United  I would note, by the way, the people who particularly benefit from immediate expensing are the working men and women of this country--the men and women with callouses on their hands, the men and women, frankly, who gave Donald Trump the victory in November of 2016 or the union workers whom, sadly, the Democratic Party has abandoned.  There was a time when the Democratic Party styled themselves as the party of the working man and woman. That time has been long since forgotten. The Democratic Party now listens to California environmentalist billionaires and ignores the plight of steelworkers, oilfield workers, farmers, ranchers, taxicab drivers, truckdrivers, waiters, and waitresses--the men and women who are working hard for their families. That is who the Republican Party should be fighting for--the working men and women of this country. Immediate expensing impacts working men and women, particularly in heavy manufacturing.  The fourth element is a lower corporate rate. We are seeing, and we have seen over the last 8 years, companies leaving America and moving their headquarters, moving their legal domicile to other countries. Why is that? Because the United States has the[[Page S6791]]highest corporate tax rate of any developed country in the world. We have created a tax environment that tells American businesses: If you simply get the heck out of Dodge, if you simply move somewhere other than America, immediately your profitability will jump because our corporate tax rate is higher and, in some instances, more than twice as high as our competitors.  Look at Ireland used to have high corporate taxes. They cut their corporate tax rate. Then they cut it again, and they are seeing businesses flood into Ireland because of the low corporate tax rate, and they bring with them jobs.  Our focus should be jobs. If we cut the corporate rate so that it is low--so that it is at least as low as our competitors and ideally even lower--we will create an environment where more businesses want to do business in America where there are more jobs.  I am reminded of Hillary Clinton, who said during the Presidential campaign season: Don't let anybody tell you that corporations or businesses create jobs. Even in the world of politics, that was a particularly asinine statement. The last time I checked, you get a job from going to work for a business--unless you start your own business. You either start your own business or you go to work for another business. That is what gives you jobs. We need to create that environment.  In recent years, we have talked about corporate inversions, companies fleeing Our friends on the Democratic side of the aisle have all these ideas to punish the companies that flee Their approach is: We are going to tax you so high that you can't do business in this country, and then, when you try to survive, we are going to punish you on top of that with fines and penalties. It is actually reminiscent of their approach to ObamaCare, where they fine people who can't afford insurance after driving premiums through the roof.  It is a much better idea to cut our corporate tax rate. Let's create a tax and regulatory environment in America so that businesses want to be here and create jobs. It is my hope that 3, 5, 10 years from now, other countries--European countries and Asian countries--are complaining about corporate inversions because their companies are fleeing their countries and coming to American, because there is no place on Earth better to do business than America, because we will have honored our commitment on tax reform and cut taxes and created an environment where businesses can thrive.  5, encourage repatriation. Right now, Federal tax law subjects American businesses to punitive double taxation at the highest rates in the developed world if they bring capital back here from overseas. U.companies have roughly $2.7 trillion in capital overseas, and our tax system inextricably incentivizes them to keep the money overseas, which means--what do they do with the money overseas? It means they build factories in China, in Mexico, in India, and countries overseas that aren't America, and then they hire people overseas. Why? Because if they bring the capital back here and hire Americans, our tax punishes them. That doesn't make any sense.  I want to see that $2.7 trillion come back to I want to see that money back in this country. I want to see new factories, I want to see new stores, I want to see new businesses, and I want to see new jobs. We need to encourage repatriation, not put a punitive tax on the money coming back. Do you want to talk about patriotism? There is a reason it is called repatriation. It is patriotic to use that money to hire  Our Democratic friends just want to yell and scream and insult them. That is not the right answer. People are going to respond to rational incentives. If you punish companies for bringing money back to America, they are going to respond rationally by not doing that. Let's change our tax system so we don't punish them for bringing jobs back to  The sixth element, end the death tax. The death tax is one of the most unfair aspects of the Federal tax system. The death tax also happens to be the very favorite tax our friends on the Democratic side of the aisle love to demagogue. I have heard over past weeks attack after attack after attack on the death tax--that it is about the superrich.  Here is a secret that the Democrats will never tell you. The superrich don't pay the death tax. By and large, they manage to avoid the tax with remarkable success rates. They hire armies of accountants and lawyers. Do you think George Soros will pay the death tax? Hold your breath, and let me know how that works out. It doesn't impact the superrich.  The death tax actually generates very little revenue for the Federal Who gets hit by the death tax? It is the farmers, it is the ranchers, and it is the small business owners. In the debate last week with Bernie Sanders, Bernie said that this doesn't affect farmers at all.  The Presiding Officer and I have both spoken with an awful lot of farmers in Iowa and in I have heard farmer after farmer after farmer lament the death tax because of what happens when the patriarch, when the farmer, passes away and passes the farm on to the next generation. Over and over again, the next generation is forced to sell the farm just to pay Uncle They have already paid taxes once; they pay taxes when they earn their money. The death tax says that for having the temerity to die, we are going to tax you again at a punitive rate. Death should not be a taxable event. That is not fair. It shouldn't be the case that when you die, the two people you get to see are the undertaker and the taxman.  We see farms that are sold, that are broken up; we see ranches that are sold, that are broken up; we see small businesses that are sold, that are broken up because the next generation that wants to run the small business, wants to keep the jobs, suddenly has a massive Federal tax bill. They don't have the fancy lawyers and accountants who, like the superrich, help them avoid the tax. So they get hit with the full force of the death tax.  If you care about jobs and economic growth, why do you want a small business owner to be forced to sell the factory just to pay the tax bill? This means the employees all get laid off; they lose their jobs. It is much better to have those small businesses growing, to have those farmers prospering, and to have those ranchers prospering.  The final element is that we need to end the alternative minimum tax. The AMT is a totally second set of taxation. Every year, it is growing the number of people who are hit by it, and it just adds complexity to the code.  We should focus on growth, simplicity, and fairness. If we do that, if we focus on bringing back jobs, we have the ability to have a tremendous impact on our country.  Finally, I want to make a plea to the Members of our conference, to the We may get some Democrats to support us on tax reform. It is possible. We may get one or two. Sadly, we are in a different world than we used to be. In 1981 and 1986, Democrats actually used to be willing to work with Republicans on taxes.  Tip O'Neill, a Democrat, was Speaker of the House when Reagan passed massive tax cuts. Bill Bradley in this body, a liberal New Jersey Democrat, helped lead the effort for tax reform. There are no Tip O'Neills or Bill Bradleys left. There is not a single Democrat leading the fight for tax reform--not a one.  You may get one or two Democrats at the end of the day who cast a vote after everything is done because they are afraid of the electoral consequences in But I will make a prediction right now that if we don't have 50 votes on this side of the aisle, not a single Democrat will provide the 50th vote. They might be the 52nd or 53rd vote, but we ain't getting vote 50 from that side of the aisle, which means that for tax reform to happen, our conference has to get our act together. We have 52 Republicans, and we have to get 50 on the same page.  Listen, we are at a time when we are seeing personality battles, and we are seeing nastiness. This is a strange time in politics. Any three Republicans can torpedo tax reform. I am making a plea to all 52: Don't be selfish and petulant. Don't put personal animosities above the good of the country.  We were elected by the voters to do a job. Let's do the job. Let's honor the promises we made. Let's cut taxes, bring back jobs, bring back economic growth, and demonstrate to the voters[[Page S6792]]there is a reason they elected Republican majorities.  If we don't, if we can't get our act together, then I fear the consequences will be catastrophic, both as a policy matter and a political matter.

1103,topic-id,682,"Mr.Speaker, I rise this morning because the House must continue its work to reform and reauthorize the We have got to pass H.2997, the 21st Century AIRR  Thirty years ago--30 years ago--the FAA identified the need to modernize or upgrade the Nation's antiquated World War II era air traffic control system. This is a system, at the time, that used radar technology and paper strips for communications between controllers. They literally would take these paper slips and hand them from one controller to the next controller to the next controller as aircraft not only moved through the airwaves, but were moving through the airport systems.  Now, over the last 30 years, Canada, Australia, and many in the EU have changed to this GPS system. We have got countries all across the globe going to GPS, or decades ago have already switched. It is when they go through our airspace, we still use this old radar technology.  Now, during this time, we have upgraded GPS systems. We all carry around handheld devices that use GPS: the Wave app, Google app. There are many different mapping platforms that allow you to get through cities, towns, the countryside. If there is an accident, there is a delay, it allows you to get around it and move through so that we can actually have greater efficiencies on the road.  But 30 years have gone by, and today, after spending $7 billion, the FAA still uses this outdated radar technology, moving from beacon to beacon, getting passed along as you travel across the United And, yes, our air traffic control system still passes these little pieces of paper from one to the next to the next. Oftentimes, if you travel around, you will go through areas where you are not captured by the radar at all, while other countries continue with this GPS system.  This outdated air traffic control system negatively impacts the entire flying public. An outdated ATC means route inefficiencies, which means higher costs, which yields more congestion in our skies and sitting on our tarmacs.  I would like to see a system where you don't leave the gate to go sit on the runway until you know that you actually have a slot and are moving into the air and have a direct flight to your point. But today, you will see many airlines that will sit you out on the tarmac waiting for a slot.  More congestion is a direct factor of flight delays and canceled flights. The reforms in this bill will provide more on-time departures and arrivals and less canceled flights.  This bill is for the average flier. It doesn't matter which airline you take, we ought to have an air traffic control system that serves them all with a GPS system that allows you to get from point A to point B without the time delays.  This also has the Air Improvement Program fully funded, which actually increases the Airport Improvement Program from $3.3 billion to $4 billion. It has the ability to upgrade our airports.  Mr.Speaker, I also served my country in the Air Force for 16 years. As a veteran, I know that national security comes first. The 21st Century AIRR Act does not jeopardize the interaction between the Department of Defense and air traffic control; in fact, it strengthens it. The Federal Government retains exclusive sovereignty and control of the airspace, and the President maintains critical authority to assume control of the airspace during emergencies in times of war.  The time to bring up the bill, H.3997, the 21st Century AIRR Act, is now. The public has waited way too long. We have been bypassed by other countries. If we can identify it 30 years ago that we had World War II technology, we ought to recognize it today and stop passing these little pieces of paper back and forth through our air traffic control systems.  Let's upgrade our systems, let's create efficiencies, and let's get people moving across this country in an efficient manner where they are not sitting on tarmacs waiting for flight delays.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-25-pt1-PgH8148.txt,1995,INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING EMERGENCY RESPONSE BY DETECTING,2017.0,25.0,October

I would first like to thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel for their leadership on the committee in bringing this resolution forward. I would like to thank my friend from Florida, Congressman Bilirakis, for working with me on this resolution. I thank as well Chairman Ros-Lehtinen for her leadership on the subcommittee and ensuring that we have the opportunity to move forward together.  Mr.Speaker, in 2013, almost exactly 1 year after a Hezbollah suicide bomber blew up a bus in Bulgaria, killing mostly Israeli tourists, the European Union took action to finally designate[[Page H8193]]Hezbollah a terrorist organization. However, they only designated what they called Hezbollah's military wing as a terror group and not its political wing.  The United States has been clear that this was a false distinction then and it remains a false distinction today. Hezbollah is one unified terrorist organization, and it is led by the terrorist, Hassan It is one unified Hezbollah that is responsible for the horrific acts of terror against Europeans, Americans, Israelis, and others across the Middle East and around the globe.  It is one unified Hezbollah that has helped prop up the Assad regime, and it is complicit in the death of half a million Syrians and the dissolving of a once thriving nation. So this one unified Hezbollah should be designated as a terrorist organization so we can increase international cooperation to isolate and dismantle this group.  This morning, Mr.Speaker, the Middle East and North Africa Subcommittee held a hearing on next steps for our Iran policy. There, I noted that 2 days ago we marked a solemn anniversary, because 34 years ago, on October 23, two Hezbollah suicide bombers blew themselves up at the Marine Corps barracks in Beirut, killing over 300 U.and French servicemembers, peacekeepers, and civilians. That attack, like so many of Hezbollah's deadly terrorist activities over the past several decades, was sponsored and directed by  While our Nation built a memorial honoring the victims of that attack, Tehran built a monument honoring the perpetrators of that attack. A full EU designation of Hezbollah now would help demonstrate Europe's commitment to cracking down on Iran's use of proxy terror groups, destabilizing the region, and attacking Western interests.  Now, I understand that the EU has legal concerns about this designation since Hezbollah has infiltrated Lebanon's political system. However, I would just offer this observation. The terrorist organization Hamas operates as a political party in Gaza, yet the EU still rightly lists the entirety of Hamas as a terror organization. That has not impacted their ability to support Gaza reconstruction, just as designating Hezbollah would not prevent them from supporting Syrian refugees in  Last year, the Gulf Cooperation Council and the Arab League both designated Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. They made no distinction between the military and political wing, despite Lebanon being a member of the Arab I hope the EU took note of that.

Mr.Speaker, it is good to be on the floor with my friend and colleague from Florida to speak in support of H.3329, an important bipartisan effort brought forward by Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel, an important measure to further combat Hezbollah's terrorist activity.  We made great strides 2 years ago when we passed the Hezbollah International Financing Act, which has already begun to sever the terror group[[Page H8191]]from its funding sources. However, it is clear that more needs to be done.  The new bill will further restrict Hezbollah's ability to recruit and fundraise by targeting foreign state sponsors, including Iran, while also increasing pressure on banks and other international financial institutions that serve  It is important to remember why it is in America's interest to combat Hezbollah terrorism. Not that anyone here or at home needs a reminder, we all remember, or we have all learned about, the 1983 attacks in Beirut on our Embassy and the Marine Corps barracks that killed hundreds of Americans; the attacks in Argentina on the Israeli Embassy in 1992, and the AMIA Jewish center in 1994 that, in total, killed over 100 more; the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia; and more recent attacks in Europe, including the 2012 bus bombing of Israeli tourists in  But it has been Hezbollah's support for the horrific Assad regime in Syria that has led even Arab governments in the region to acknowledge Hezbollah's dangerous role as an Iranian terror proxy. Last year, the Gulf Cooperation Council and the Arab League took the dynamic step of designating Hezbollah as a terrorist organization.  Yet, even while Hezbollah is focused on the war in Syria, its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, continues to vow Israel's destruction, a threat Israel's leaders don't take lightly, given two previous wars and intelligence suggesting Hezbollah now has over 150,000 missiles and rockets in Lebanon aimed at every corner of Israel's map.  In a future war, Israeli defense officials fear that Hezbollah will launch over a thousand rockets a day with the capacity to hit civilians in Israel's north, across Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and even in the southernmost city,  This is made all the more troubling by reports that Iran, in addition to transferring advanced precision-guided missiles to Hezbollah, is now helping the terror group set up indigenous missile development facilities in both Syria and  These are unacceptable developments.

It is about doing all that and hoping that, at this time of the year, here at Halloween, that they can trick American middle-class families into believing that a little of those tax benefits will trickle down to them.

741,topic-id,951,"Mr.President, for years, I have been calling on Democrats and Republicans to work together to improve the healthcare law. There are some, like me, who recognize the benefits of the existing healthcare law, as well as the areas that need fixing, and I have proposed that we partner together to strengthen our healthcare system.  For the first time, we have legislation in the Senate that has broad bipartisan support and would improve issues with our healthcare system by stabilizing the individual marketplace and lowering premiums for This is what I have long pushed for. Today, it is more important than ever that we act to pass this bipartisan legislation. I would like to take a few minutes to explain why.  Beginning next week, on November 1, millions of Americans, including Hoosiers, can sign up for healthcare coverage through the individual marketplace. Unfortunately, as consumers prepare to shop for health insurance plans, there is uncertainty and instability in the marketplace and confusion and higher prices for consumers. That wasn't the case earlier this year, as both public and private analyses showed that individual marketplaces were relatively stable and improving.  For the last 10 months, though, the administration has worked to make it harder for Americans to access affordable healthcare and destabilized the markets. For many months, the administration refused to commit to continuing important cost-sharing reduction payments that reduce costs for consumers and, even worse, played politics with these payments. This culminated with the administration's announcement earlier this month that it would discontinue cost-sharing reduction payments. This decision came only weeks before open enrollment.  There is no disputing a simple fact: The administration's actions created uncertainty for insurers, causing some to significantly raise rates and others to leave the market altogether. As a result, many Americans will be forced to pay more for healthcare plans through the individual marketplace.  For example, CareSource, an insurance company that offers insurance to Hoosiers through the individual marketplace, told me earlier this year that rates would rise 2.2 percent if the Federal Government committed to continuing cost-sharing reduction payments. Because the administration refused to do so, rates for CareSource plans are on average now 20 percent higher for Hoosiers than last year.  Centene, the other insurer offering coverage in the marketplace, will have average rate increases of nearly 36 percent. In addition to higher rates, it will be harder for Hoosiers to find help enrolling in healthcare plans because the administration slashed 82 percent of Navigator Program funding for my home State of Indiana--the deepest cut of any State in the country.  Consumers also have a shorter period to enroll than in past years. The administration plans to do maintenance and shut down HealthCare.gov for 12 hours on all but one Sunday throughout the open enrollment period.  It does not have to be this way. As I have said for years, there is another path--a bipartisan path. We should work in a bipartisan manner to improve our healthcare system, all Americans working together. I have pressed the administration to commit to providing stability for health insurance markets and to working together on bipartisan solutions that reduce healthcare costs and ensure access to quality medical care.  Over the past several months, I have engaged in bipartisan conversations in meetings with my colleagues to discuss ways we can partner together to stabilize our healthcare markets. We have talked to a range of healthcare experts. There has been a good-faith effort to find common ground on steps we can take to lower costs for families. That is what we should be doing.  After participating in this effort, I was pleased that Senators Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray reached a bipartisan agreement last week. It makes improvements to our healthcare system and helps reduce costs for our families.  I am proud to cosponsor this legislation. It continues cost-sharing reduction payments that reduce consumers' deductibles. It also reduces copays for two years and restores funding to help Americans navigate signing up for health insurance. It enables more flexibility for States without undermining essential health benefits or harming people who have preexisting conditions.  If this legislation came to a vote today, I am confident it would receive more than the 60 votes needed to pass in the It has wide-ranging support from both Democrats and It has bipartisan support, not only in the Senate but also from Republican and Democratic Governors all across the country. We have heard from groups, including the American Medical Association, the U.Chamber of Commerce, and AARP, urging Congress to move forward on this proposal because it is common sense. It benefits families. It helps stabilize the insurance markets.  It is our job to protect families from unnecessary increases in the cost of healthcare, particularly those within our control. We have an opportunity to do that with the bipartisan Alexander-Murray agreement that we achieved by working together.  The healthcare debate should not be a political game. The stakes are way too high for that because healthcare impacts the well-being and the economic security of millions of  I have said over and over that the American people expect us to work together to try and make life a little bit better. At the very least, we should do no harm. The Alexander-Murray agreement not only provides relief for families, it actually helps put them in a better place. There is no doubt we have more work to do, but this proposal is an important first step. Let's strengthen the healthcare system and make healthcare more affordable with this bipartisan solution.  I yield back.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.[[Page S6797]]  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

613,topic-id,1455,"Mr.President, I come today to speak out in opposition of this misguided effort to overturn the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's arbitration rule, which protects the rights of consumers and protects our brave servicemembers and veterans from being taken advantage of by unscrupulous financial institutions.  It was only a couple of weeks ago that we had the CEO of Equifax here on Capitol Hill, testifying about how his company had failed to protect Americans' private financial information and put more than 140 million consumers at risk of fraud or worse. That wasn't too long after we had the CEO of Wells Fargo here, testifying about how his company had defrauded millions of consumers by forcing them into accounts and fees they had never signed up for and, certainly, had not agreed to.  The American people were outraged by these scandals, and with good reason. Both of these companies had committed serious wrongdoings, and they admitted it. But that still didn't stop either from trying to shield themselves from the legal liability their own actions had risked.  Both of these companies tried to prevent the people they had taken advantage of from holding them accountable in court by using what is known as forced arbitration clauses. They thought--and it seems they were right--that if they could stop people from suing them for their wrongdoing and, instead, force them into private arbitration that heavily favored megabusinesses at the expense of consumers, they would have a better shot at saving money for their company. They didn't care about consumer rights or even justice. They just wanted to make as much money as they could--legally or illegally--and then get out of Dodge as cleanly as possible.  But because the American people were so outraged by these scandals, we noticed what they were trying to do. The actions of both companies caused an uproar that ultimately led them to back down and ensure that American consumers didn't have to give up their right to a day in court just for doing business with these companies. Those sorts of forced arbitration clauses were exactly what the CFPB was trying to stop when it implemented the rule my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are trying to repeal tonight. Wells Fargo's and Equifax's attempts to force consumers into mandatory arbitration clauses should have been a lesson, but I guess those working to reverse this rule here tonight didn't learn it.  It is common to hear stories throughout my State of Illinois--and throughout the military community--of servicemembers being taken advantage of through predatory loans, scams, abuses, and fraud. That is because Active-Duty servicemembers are particularly vulnerable consumers, especially when they are deployed. They get a guaranteed paycheck, but they also have limited time to read their credit card statements and keep up with security breaches to see if their identities have been stolen. They are too busy carrying out their mission.  Servicemembers are also frequently on the move between deployments and base relocations, often separated from their spouses and their families for long periods of time. Despite that, they still need to wire money when emergencies happen. They still need to pay bills, and their focus isn't always on whether a loan they took out has hidden fees or if a company is charging them a higher rate than they are supposed to. What they are focused on, and rightly so, is carrying out their mission, often in places like  Corporations and scam artists know this, and they take advantage of it. The CFPB's forced arbitration rule could help protect our servicemembers from this sort of abuse. It seems that a few of my colleagues want to make it harder for military families to get by, and that is a shame.  Abusive corporate practices, left unchecked, not only cause incredible financial difficulty for servicemembers and their families, but they also have national security implications, directly impacting military readiness. In the military, bad credit can affect your security clearance and advancement. When the DOD loses qualified servicemembers because of financial instability, they also lose mission capability and the significant investments made in that person's training. This is an expensive loss. DOD estimates that each separation from service costs taxpayers more than $57,000.  Corporate abuse also causes personal difficulties. When someone is deployed, the last thing they should have to worry about is whether their house is going to be foreclosed on or their car is going to be repossessed because they were a victim of a scam. When they are going to battle or heading out on a mission, the last thing our troops should be thinking about is how a company took advantage of the fact that they were out of the country--and how there is so very little they can do about it  Unfortunately, this isn't a hypothetical issue. Servicemembers get taken advantage of all the time, and we have seen countless times how their ability to file lawsuits holds bad actors accountable. Not too long ago, the banks Santander and Wells Fargo paid tens of millions to resolve lawsuits that were filed because they were illegally repossessing servicemembers' cars. JPMorgan Chase paid $27 million to settle a lawsuit from servicemembers who were being overcharged for mortgages. And student loan servicer[[Page S6751]]Navient paid 78,000 servicemembers $60 million after overcharging them on their student loans. In each of these instances, servicemembers, sometimes with the help of government, filed a lawsuit to get relief and hold these financial actors accountable. When companies force our servicemembers--or any consumer--into arbitration, military families lose the right to hold wrongdoers accountable.  That is what happened to Archie Hudson, a disabled veteran, father of two, and husband from Waynesboro, A few years ago, Archie requested a loan from Wells Fargo to replace his home's windows. Instead, he received a Wells Fargo credit card along with sky-high interest rates and a forced arbitration clause hidden in the fine print. He didn't realize it at the time, like the millions of others that Wells Fargo scammed, but it ultimately helped to ruin his credit. When Archie tried to get his day in court, he was, instead, forced into an arbitration proceeding that favors lenders over consumers. He is not alone. The vast majority of people who have been forced into arbitration could tell you that the system is rigged.  When the CFPB first looked into this issue, they found that when consumers file an arbitration claim against a company that takes advantage of them, they have to pay an average of $161 in filing fees, and they almost always lose.  Companies, on the other hand, won a whopping 91 percent of the time that they go into arbitration against consumers. On average, the consumer then had to pay $7,725 in damages to further pad corporate profits.  Banks sometimes try to defend these clauses by saying that the reduced legal liability helps them reduce costs for consumers, but there is absolutely no evidence that is true. In fact, when companies have added these forced arbitration clauses in the past, the evidence suggests that they never reduce costs for consumers. These clauses simply mean bigger profit margins for those banks that break the law.  There is a reason so many military veterans service organizations like the American Legion, the Air Force Association, the Marine Corps League, the National Guard Association, the Vietnam Veterans of America, and groups like the AARP oppose this effort. Remember, arbitration isn't about saving lawyers' fees or decreasing costs to consumers. It is there to protect the interests of banks over consumers.  Look, I am not naive. I get that companies--especially banks--are in the business of making money. It makes sense that they would want to force all their customers into arbitration because that saves them money. But why on Earth would my colleagues in the Senate go along and help them rob servicemembers and consumers of their rights to go to court? Why would we allow bad actors to get off scot-free?  If they believe that our servicemembers are unfairly getting rich off suing companies that wrong them, they should say that. If they believe companies that break the law should be shielded from having to answer for their illegal actions in court, they should say that. We shouldn't let them hide behind cutting regulations. I am all for cutting needless redtape, but the arbitration rule is an example of a regulation that actually helps It helps our servicemembers and our military families.  A vote to overturn the arbitration rule is a vote against our military and against those who wake up every single day to serve and protect the greatest Nation on the face of the  Thank you.

126,topic-id,1709,"Mr.President, the Rohingya are one of many ethnic groups, largely Muslim, who have been living for centuries in Burma and now in Myanmar, with the majority of them in the western coastal Rakhine  Deep-seated misconceptions about their roots and faith have led to decades of discrimination, about which many of us are aware because of press reports. They have been denied citizenship, had their movement restricted, and have been deprived of basic healthcare. It is no wonder that the Rohingya people are considered to be one of the most persecuted minorities in the world.  Today, as a result of a military crackdown against them in the Rakhine State--an overzealous, disproportionate response to attacks on security outposts by some militants last October and then again this August--countless Rohingya have been brutally killed, and more than 600,000 have fled to overwhelmed and desperate camps in neighboring  The scorched-earth tactic by the Burmese military has left hundreds of villages literally burned to the ground, and the reports of rape, starvation, mass killing--even reports of security forces burning people, babies, alive--have been horrifying. Satellite images and maps indicate that the destruction by the Burmese military is not episodic, it is systematic.  In Bangladesh, aid groups have been unable to keep up with the influx of refugees. The unprecedented scale of the crisis and the lack of infrastructure in the makeshift camps have created significant gaps in access to food, medical care, and even safety and shelter.  The international community has condemned the violence against the Rohingya, and rightly so.  Countries around the world--reputable international human rights organizations such as the Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and even the U.N.--have denounced the military's campaign against the  In a speech to the U.Human Rights Council in Geneva last month, the U.High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, called the Burmese military operation against the Rohingya people ``a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.''  Many of my colleagues in this Chamber joined me when I introduced 250 to condemn these atrocities, and a large group of us also wrote to the administration recently to urge Secretary Tillerson and Administrator Green to help resolve the crisis and provide critically needed aid.  Just yesterday, in a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, my friend and colleague, Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland, labeled the crisis a ``genocide.'' Yet Aung San Suu Kyi, the de facto leader of Burma, the Nobel laureate, has largely done and said too little.  I have followed Aung San Suu Kyi over the years. I joined many of my colleagues in praising her struggle for democracy. After 15 years under house arrest, she and the National League for Democracy won a landslide victory in the first national vote since Burma's transition to civilian rule in 2015, more than two decades after her party was denied its victory in the 1990 election.  I admired her so much for her nonviolent struggle for political freedom and human rights. And while I recognize she still has a fragile relationship with the Burmese military, which still has considerable power, I am sadly disappointed in her lack of leadership when it comes to the plight of the Rohingya people--her fellow countrymen--men and women who are in a desperate situation.  She claims she is committed to restoring peace and the rule of law. Yet she has spoken of so-called allegations and counterallegations instead of addressing the widespread, well-documented abuses by her own country's security forces.  I was glad that Aung San Suu Kyi in 2016 appointed investigators, led by former U.Secretary General Kofi Annan, who recommended this summer that Burma review a 1982 law that strips most Rohingya of citizenship. Yet the Burmese Government has yet to implement any of the Commission's recommendations and further continues to deny access to the Rakhine State to other U.investigators, journalists, and NGO groups. Some officials have even accused the Rohingya of faking rape and faking the burning of their own homes. What a preposterous claim.  I recognize the dramatic progress Burma has made over the years. It will take a long time to overcome many of the challenges in such a young democracy, and I understand that Aung San Suu Kyi, as State Counselor, has a limited role under the power-sharing agreement with her military, which has largely been responsible for the violence I have described. But I would urge her to live up to her own words upon delivering her Nobel Peace Prize lecture in 2012 to address the historic and brutal suppression of the Rohingya and support ethnic reconciliation in In fact, Aung San Suu Kyi quoted the following passages from the preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the U.General Assembly in 1948, as the answer to why she fought for democracy and human rights in her home country in She said:       [D]isregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in      barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind,      and the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy      freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want      has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common      people,       [I]t is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have      recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and      oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule      of law.  These are wise words used by Aung San Suu Kyi when she received her Nobel They are words that apply today to this crisis within her own country.  I am committed to doing what I can in Congress to hold those in the Burmese military personally accountable for the reprehensible human rights violations against the  I want to note that I have also had the opportunity over the October recess to meet with some members of the Rohingya community who have resettled in my home State of Illinois over the years.  About 1,500 Rohingya people live in the Chicagoland area. Among them is Nasir He helped found the Rohingya Culture Center in Chicago--the first Rohingya community center in The center helps provide a safe, familiar space for Rohingya people new to the country, as well as critically needed resources, such as translators, ESL and computer classes, help with paperwork, and much more.  When I met Nasir and the other members of the community about a week ago with my wife, they told me about the phone calls and photos they receive late at night from family and friends fleeing the violence, looking for safety in Bangladesh.[[Page S6822]]  I also heard from community members who recently returned from a medical mission to They showed me the photos they brought back. One food line to feed refugees was literally 1 mile long. Healthcare is limited. Safe drinking water is limited. Cholera is detected. It is a horrible situation for these people who have been tossed out of Myanmar and now are trying just to survive nearby The stories are horrific, and they are all the same.  Here is an image of this exodus that was printed in the New York It shows families fleeing Burma across the border to Bangladesh with smoke rising in the background from the villages that they lived in being burned.  The stories I heard were of helpless, poor families walking on foot through jungles, crowding in boats along the Naf River, leaving behind everything with accountings of rape, killing, and arson by the Burmese military. They arrive in Bangladesh sick, exhausted, and desperately in need of the most basic things--food, clean water, medicine, a safe space to rest their heads.  Here is another image, which is heartbreaking. It is an indication of what happens in the refugee camps when food arrives, this time in a camp known as Cox's Bazar in  A UNICEF report last week stated that 58 percent of the refugees who have poured into Cox's Bazar are children, noting that they are in hell on They are acutely malnourished, they need clean water and vaccines, and they are at risk of exploitation by traffickers. This is unacceptable.  I understand that Bangladesh and Burma have discussed a repatriation plan recently, but many refugees don't have any documents. They were literally burned out of their homes. We need to call on the U.High Commissioner for Filippo Grandi was in my office last week, and he stressed how important it is for us to speak up and to help on this issue, that we ensure the voluntary right of return and we ensure the safety of those who do return and we make sure that the paper requirements for return are reasonable for people who are literally homeless and stateless at this moment.  Many are wary of returning without an assurance of full citizenship, given the risk of further persecution or the threat of being placed in camps in Myanmar when they return. I don't blame them, because the atrocities committed against the Rohingya over the past months and weeks are not new by any means.  Nasir Zakaria in Chicago told me that more than three decades ago, when he was only 14, he was kidnapped by militants targeting the Rohingya in He never saw his parents again.  Nasir eventually escaped to Bangladesh, made his way to Malaysia, where he worked for 18 years in construction before he finally made it to the United States with a green card in 2013. He learned English, worked as a dishwasher in a hotel near Chicago, supported his wife and three children, met others in the community, and helped to create the Rohingya Center that I visited.  Here is a picture of Nasir Zakaria with his son, Mohamed, in their Chicago apartment. You can see the American flag in the background. He is very proud of this Nation that he now calls home.  The Rohingya Culture Center provides critical resources to more than 400 families in the Chicago area, one of the largest concentrations of Rohingya refugees in More than three decades after Nasir first escaped Burma, the Rohingya continue to be attacked and demonized.  Let me close by saying that we met today with the Myanmar Seven Senators sat down with him and expressed the sentiments that I have included in this statement.

398,topic-id,1824,"Mr.President, I want to thank my colleague and the Democratic leader, Senator Schumer, for his statement on this Trump tax plan. I think he really has summarized in his statement the concerns many of us have.  We are concerned that the Trump tax plan will do several things. It will cut funds for education in America at a time when we need it now more than ever to prepare our people for the jobs of the future. It endangers Medicare, a program that for almost 50 million Americans is critical for the healthcare they receive. At the same time, it is going to dramatically increase the deficit. For so long, we have heard from the Republicans that their 1 issue was cutting the deficit, and now they come up with a tax plan that will increase the size of our deficit. Finally, of course, all of this is being done to create tax breaks for the wealthy and the biggest corporations in  Here are the simple facts: As a percentage of our gross domestic product, corporate profits in America have never been higher. Corporate profits have never been higher. As a percentage of the gross domestic product, corporate Federal taxes paid have never been lower. Profits never higher, taxes never lower, and the Trump tax plan says: Let's cut corporate taxes even more, and then let's cut taxes on the[[Page S6780]]wealthiest people even more. That is not a fair tax plan. It is not a fair tax reform.  The Trump tax plan sadly rewards the biggest corporations and the wealthiest individuals at the cost of cutting education, endangering Medicare, and unfortunately increasing the deficit, to be paid for by our children. The tax break for the wealthiest people in the Trump tax plan doesn't go to the rich. It doesn't even go to the very rich. It goes to the superrich--the superrich. Who am I talking about? The one-tenth of 1 percent. The highest incomes in America--way beyond the rich. It is not a person who drives a big limousine; it is a person who is never going to drive the rest of their lives and owns a big yacht. Those folks--the one-tenth of 1 percent--get 40 percent of all the tax breaks in the Trump tax plan. That may be good news for the President and his colleagues and friends and even his family; it is not good news for working To think that we would cut education, endanger Medicare, and increase the deficit to give that level of income, the wealthiest people in our country, such a tax break is hard to imagine.  Sadly, one of the provisions in the Trump tax plan creates an incentive for companies to move jobs overseas, because they will have a lower tax rate if they do. Think about that. A President who has told us over and over again that we want to ``make America great again'' creates a tax program to incentivize businesses to locate overseas and make their profits overseas. That makes no sense whatsoever, but that is the Trump tax plan. I am glad Senator Schumer brought that up.                                  DACA  Mr.President, let me address the issue of the It is one that I have spoken to many times before, and I would like to address it at this point.  On September 5, about 7 weeks ago today, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the Trump administration's repeal of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, better known as  DACA provided temporary legal status to immigrant students if they registered with the government, paid a fee, went through a criminal background check and a national security check, and did that on a renewable basis every 2 years.  The young people protected by that Executive order are known as They came to the United States as children, brought here by their parents. They grew up in our schools, singing our ``Star-Spangled Banner,'' pledging allegiance to the only flag they have ever known. Seven years ago, I asked President Obama, in a letter that I sent with then-Republican-Senator Dick Lugar, to create a program to protect these young people and give them a chance to earn their way into legal status. The President responded to our request, and almost 800,000 have signed up.  Now, with President Trump's announcement that he is going to eliminate this program, the clock is ticking. By March 5, 2018, every workday for the following 2 years, approximately 1,400 of these Dreamers protected by DACA will lose their work permits and will be subject to deportation. Mr.President, 1,400 a day who signed up for this program, as of March 5 next year, will hear the clock ticking. Teachers will be forced to leave their students, nurses to leave their patients, first responders to leave their posts, and soldiers who are willing to fight for their country will be forced to leave the Army if this happens. It is an outcome that none of us want to see, I hope.  It isn't just a looming humanitarian crisis; it is economic too. The nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy says that DACA-eligible individuals contribute about $2 billion a year to our economy. They are working. They are going to school. These are productive people who against the odds have succeeded in life and want to do more.  The Cato Institute--no liberal think tank--estimates that ending DACA and deporting DACA recipients would cost $60 billion and result in a $280 billion reduction in economic growth over the next 10 years.  Poll after poll shows overwhelming bipartisan support for the Even FOX News--no liberal media outlet--recently found that 79 percent of Americans support a path to citizenship for Dreamers--79 percent. What percentage of Republicans support it? According to the FOX poll, 63 percent of Donald Trump voters believe that Dreamers should be given a chance at citizenship.  The answer is clear: We need to pass the DREAM Act, and we need to do it before we leave Washington in the next few weeks. It was 16 years ago that I first introduced it. We have had our ups and downs. We have passed it at some time on the floor of the Senate and then again in the House of Representatives but never quite at the same moment so that it became the law of the land.  Over the years, I have told over 100 stories about the This is another one I want to share with you. This is a story about William William was 6 years old when his family moved to the United States from He grew up in Boston and then moved to In high school, he was an honor student. He graduated with a 3.8 He was an athlete, playing high school soccer and football. He is now a student at the University of Central He has a 3.5 He will graduate in the spring of 2019 with a bachelor's degree in criminal justice.  He is working full time to support himself. Because he is a DACA recipient, he isn't eligible for any Federal financial assistance to go to college. He has to work his way through school, and he is doing it. His dream is that he wants to be part of America's military. Then, after serving his country, he wants to be an officer with his local police department. Thanks to DACA, he is on his way.  Last year, he enlisted in the Army through the MAVNI In this photo, he is shown with his recruiter from his enlistment ceremony. The MAVNI Program allows immigrants like him, who are vital to the national interest, to enlist in the Armed More than 800 DACA recipients with these critical skills have had their dream come true. They have volunteered to serve America in our military.  Some Trump administration officials have claimed that DACA recipients are taking jobs away from But William and hundreds more like him have vital skills that our military desperately needs, and they want him to serve our country. William, along with many Dreamers, is now waiting to ship to basic training. He continues his undergraduate studies and is working full time while waiting for his first chance to serve.  He wrote me a letter, and here is what he said: ``My desire to serve this nation and help people, to pay back my dues for everything I have received from this great country, and to lead by example by showing my fellow DACA members that anything is possible with hard work, perseverance, and dedication.''  Is there any doubt in anyone's mind that this young man, William, desperate to serve our country and to be a law enforcement officer, will be an asset to the United States, a source of pride for all of us? Of course not. If DACA goes away and is not replaced, if this young man loses that opportunity, America will lose an important part of its future.  I was at the Phoenix Military Academy, one of six military academies within the Chicago public schools, just last week. I am proud to say that our Chicago public school system hosts the largest ROTC Program in America, with 10,000 cadets from school to school. It turns out that many of them are DACA They want to serve our country just like I was joined by COL Daniel Baggio, who runs the Junior ROTC His grandfather was an immigrant who served in the U.Army during World War Colonel Baggio certainly understands the important role immigrants play in our Armed  William Medeiros and other Dreamers have so much to give America, but without the Dream Act, William and hundreds of other immigrants with skills that are vital to the national interest will literally be kicked out of the Thousands of Junior ROTC cadets in Chicago will never realize their dream of volunteering to enlist in America's military. They want to serve. They are willing to risk their lives for our country. How can we let them down?[[Page S6781]]  When we introduced the Dream Act, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said: ``The moment of reckoning is coming.'' It is coming in a manner of days and weeks. I implore my colleagues and both sides of the aisle: Don't let that young man down. Don't let down the hundreds of thousands who just want a chance to prove themselves and earn their way into legal status. We can do this.  Many people are skeptical as to whether Congress can get anything done on a bipartisan basis. I am not skeptical. I believe it can. I believe that we can work together. I have sat down with a lot of conservative Republican Senators in my office--Senators I never dreamed I would be sitting with, discussing this issue, and now we want to make sure we get this job done.

606,topic-id,374,"Mr.President, this vote really gives the U.Senate a choice. On one side, we have the biggest banks in America, financial institutions, which are arguing that you as a consumer, as someone who uses their banks, should be basically signing an arbitration clause that denies you the freedom to go to court. On the other side, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has argued these financial institutions are misusing this power, denying people access to courts, and it should come to an end. That is the choice.  I think I know who is going to win. I am not sure if the party on the other side of the aisle would have called this issue if they didn't already have it lined up for the financial institutions. I know many on the other side, maybe most, hate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau like the devil hates holy water.

And, as always, I want to thank Chairman Royce for his leadership.  This is the first of three measures that we are considering today to crack down on the terrorist group, I have been focused on this challenge for a long time. More than a decade ago, I wrote a law to get Syria out of Lebanon and, with it, Syria's support for  But this is a group made up of extremists, and they will always try to find new ways to gather resources and spread their reach, all in aid of its dangerous and violent agenda, which is undermining Lebanon's political independence; supporting Iran's activities, aggressive activities throughout the region; fueling chaos and war in Syria; and threatening our ally,  We need to do everything in our power to isolate We need to crack down on its recruiters and financiers. We need to cut off its supply of weapons, and we need to silence its propaganda machine.  The three measures we will now consider will help us meet this challenge. The first is a new sanctions bill aimed at Hezbollah's use of innocent civilians as human shields. It would ban entry into the United States to anyone who uses human shields on behalf of Hezbollah, and it would freeze whatever assets they have in the United  This bill would call upon our Ambassador to the U.to push for multilateral sanctions for the same behavior, and it would require the administration to keep Congress apprised about whether certain Hezbollah leaders would be caught up in the web of these sanctions.  It is a good bill and a piece of a broader strategy to cut the legs out from under this odious group.  You know, some our friends in Europe like to say: Well, there are really two parts of One is the military wing, and one is the humanitarian wing, and the so-called humanitarian wing takes care of people who are in trouble, who need aid, who need help, and that is the way the story goes.  The fact is, a terrorist organization is a terrorist organization. You cannot cut it in half and say one wing is good and the other wing is not. A terrorist organization is not good. A terrorist organization kills innocent people. A terrorist organization doesn't want peace, they want war, they want killing, they want people to continue to suffer. So let us remember, Hezbollah is a terrorist group.  Hezbollah is primarily financed by Assad was losing the war in Syria on at least two occasions, and, on those times, Syria had an infusion of Hezbollah fighters sent by Iran on the side of the Assad regime to prop up And after they did it, the Russians came in and propped up  So let's remember the hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians who have been murdered in Syria in the Syria civil war. That is Hezbollah, a terrorist organization--bombs in Israel against innocent civilians, bombs every place else.  We cannot sit idly by.

119,topic-id,499,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time to close the way I always do.  Mr.Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues on both sides for their hard work on this bill. I want to remind my colleagues that, just a few years ago when the last war was raging in Gaza, the other terrorist group, Hamas, used civilians as human shields. We had a resolution on the floor of this House condemning it, and I was very, very proud that that resolution passed unanimously.  We need to condemn these terrorist groups no matter what they do, but when they use people as human shields--innocent people--and then try to blame the other side for the death, it is not something that we can countenance or stand for at all. I hope that we rise to the occasion this time, as well, because I can think of nothing more despicable than using innocent civilians as human shields.  These bomb factories are built in mosques, they are built in schools, and they are built in playgrounds. They are built where children are. They are built because they are daring Israel and the United States to go after them when we know that there will be human casualties. It is really a despicable position.  Here you have two terrorists groups, Hezbollah and One is Shia; one is It doesn't matter. They are both out to kill people. They are both out to terrorize people. They are both out to do the opposite of what we try to do in the United States: lifting people up.  They need to be stopped, and this Congress needs to keep sending strong messages with teeth behind them to the world that we will not sit idly by and allow these terrorist activities to happen.  Using civilians as human shields is really the lowest of the low. The fact that Hezbollah would put innocent men, women, and children in harm's way as human shields tells you everything you need to know about this organization. It is a cowardly practice by a gruesome group, and it cannot and shall not be tolerated.  This measure puts us on record again condemning this terrorist group, and it gives the administration more tools to deal with one of Hezbollah's worst tools, more tools to deal with Hezbollah to stop its terrorist activities. So I urge a bipartisan ``yes'' vote.  I thank Chairman Royce again for his collaboration with us on both sides of the aisle. That is one of the great things about the Foreign Affairs Committee because we realize that partisanship stops at the water's edge.

Let me again thank Chairman Royce for his leadership and for his hard work on this bill. I am glad to be the lead Democratic cosponsor of this legislation, which builds on a law that Ed Royce and I wrote in 2015.  One of the best ways to stop Hezbollah's dangerous activity is to cut off its financing, which is what we tried to do 2 years ago. We went after Hezbollah's financial patrons, including But again, this is a group that, if you block one path forward, they will do what it takes to find another way around.

After all, Iran's support for Hezbollah is outside the scope of the  But it is not just In recent years, we have seen Moscow step up its support of Hezbollah, particularly on the battlefields of Syria, where Russia has supplied Hezbollah with weapons. It is really outrageous. Russia claims to be fighting so-called terrorists as they bomb schools, hospitals, and marketplaces. Yet Russian weapons are ending up in Hezbollah hands.  Let me be clear: Hezbollah is a terrorist group. It is as simple as that. Chairman Royce and I have said this many times. The Russia-Hezbollah relationship threatens to undermine global antiterrorism efforts.  This bill sends a message that any government in cahoots with Hezbollah, anyone who wants to do business with this terrorist group or support its violent aims, is going to face the consequences.  This is a timely bill. Iran is building weapons factories in southern Lebanon that would be buried far underground, out of Israel's reach. The missiles that will come off that assembly line are more precise and have a longer range, putting virtually the whole of Israel in their sights.  Iran's and Hezbollah's presence in Syria, particularly in the south, right on Israel's borders, is a very serious concern. I worry about the deescalation zones the United States helped to establish in southern We don't want those zones to become hotbeds of  Several weeks ago, I was in Israel, and we trekked up to the border between Israel and At the border, as far as the eye can see, when you are in Israel and you are looking down at Lebanon, you see a number of flags. Are they the Lebanese flag? It is the Hezbollah flag.  Hezbollah has virtually taken over large parts of Lebanon, strangling the Lebanese people as well. The Lebanese people are suffering under a brutal terrorist group that is embedded in a society that disallows them to act as a free and open society.  My heart really goes out to the Lebanese people, who have a terrorist group virtually sitting in their lap, refusing to move, and putting them in all kinds of danger.  These areas have the potential to create a safe haven for Hezbollah and Iranian actors. They will stoke existing tensions and could create a corridor from Tehran to the Mediterranean through Iraq, Syria, and This would present a major shift in the regional balance of power, and it would present threats to Israel that it could not ignore.  If these deescalation zones end up empowering Iran and Hezbollah, then we will have betrayed our ally, Israel, at the most critical moment. That is why we are passing this bill.  I, again, thank Chairman Royce for his continued strong leadership on this issue. I strongly support this measure.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

1099,topic-id,691,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of this measure.  Let me thank our chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, my friend, Ed Royce from California, for his work moving this bill. I was pleased to join him as the lead Democratic cosponsor when we introduced this bill in March of this year.  I stand by his entire statement that he has just made. We have an absolute meeting of the minds on this bill, and that is why we were able to get 323 cosponsors on both sides of the aisle, because people understand and realize the threat that Iran poses to us, to the world, and to our allies.  The Foreign Affairs Committee has been hard at work this year devising new tools and approaches for dealing with the threat of There is no doubt that Iran must be one of our major priorities in our foreign policy, the world's most prolific state sponsor of terrorism, a serial abuser of human rights, a lifeline for the murderous[[Page H8176]]Assad regime in Syria, and the challenge we are dealing with today: Iran's illicit development of ballistic missiles.  The chairman and I share the view that when it comes to the nuclear deal, which we both opposed, the best path forward is to enforce the hell out of it even while we work to hold Iran's feet to the fire on all these other harmful activities.  We passed a tough sanctions bill last summer to crack down on Iran, as well as North Korea and While the bill before us today basically contains very similar provisions which we dealt with then and, as the chairman explained, we go one step further here, I am always eager to find even more ways to dial up pressure on the regime in Tehran, which is a malevolent regime, which is a regime that sponsors terrorism, which is a regime that is hostile to the United States, hostile to our ally Israel, and hostile to our other allies in the Middle But I worry that the administration isn't taking this problem seriously.  So far, the White House hasn't fully implemented the previous bill we sent to the The White House's approach to the nuclear deal sends a bad message to allies and adversaries around the world that the United States might not live up to its word. Rather than extracting more concessions with Iran, which I believe may be possible by working hard to build a strong multilateral coalition, the course of this may instead push Iran to leave the deal and resume work on a bomb. We can never allow that to happen.  So I am happy that we keep passing the sanctions bills, but Congress' role can only go so far. It is up to the administration to lay out its goals, devise a strategy, and implement the tough sanctions Congress has passed. It is more than 60 days since we passed the sanctions bill, and the President has not implemented it. According to the bill, which the President signed, it was supposed to be implemented within 60 days, so it sends a mixed message.  Talking tough is not enough. Congress sends a bill to the White House, the President signs it, it really should be implemented. So I want to urge the President and the administration to listen to this Congress in a bipartisan way. We passed this bill. It needs to be implemented, and it needs to be passed and implemented again.  In the meantime, I am happy to support this bill. I think this shows that we need to work together when it comes to Iran in a bipartisan way to show that there is really not a shred of difference, that we will not stand for Iran's aggression, we will not stand for the mullahs threatening us, we will not stand for Iran stomping on its own people.  Mr.Speaker, I again thank the chairman for his leadership on this issue. I urge my friends on both sides of the aisle to support it, and I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr.Speaker, as we have shown again and again, and you can tell with all the comments that were made here, there is support on both sides of the aisle for holding Iran accountable for its dangerous behavior.  While today's bill is similar to the bipartisan sanctions Congress passed during the summer, the direction we are moving today with this bill is the right one: going after Iran for something outside the scope of the nuclear deal.  When the nuclear deal was negotiated, we were told very clearly that it would not prevent us, would not stop us from slapping sanctions on Iran for other things, other things like support of terrorism or ballistic missiles, or all the troublemaking activities that they do.  This is what we are doing today. We are slapping sanctions on Iran for its behavior. We are slapping sanctions on Iran because we are not going to stand for their doing whatever they please and helping terrorism, suppressing rights of its people, and being a general threat to the United                              {time}  1500  So I hope that we can get a strong, bipartisan, overwhelming vote for this bill the way we did in the bill that Chairman Royce and I introduced 3[[Page H8178]]months ago, again, which gave the President 60 days to identify sanctions, which was not done beyond the 60 days, and I hope that the administration forthwith does that now.  So I think this is an important measure. I think it is an important measure to have a strong bipartisan vote because we have to show the Iranians that, while we may disagree on certain things, there is no disagreement on the fact that we regard Iran as the largest state sponsor of terrorism.

454,topic-id,1135,"Mr.President, while I am disappointed that we didn't continue the tradition of alternating speakers, I am glad that I got to hear both of the previous speakers.  I used to work with the Senators from Colorado to make sure that there were pictures taken annually from the same spots to show the way the trees are dying. There was an infestation that was causing this. The only reason we don't still take those pictures is all the trees are dead. You can't show that it is spreading when they are all dead. They need to be cleaned up, and I am glad there is work being done on forest management.  On healthcare, there is some effort being made between Senator Alexander and Senator Murray to get a bipartisan bill, but what we need to do around here is get some of the appointments finished up so that the President can have the people in place to solve these problems. We are having to spend 30 hours on the cloture of a district judge. I have never heard of that. I have been here 21 years now, and I have never heard of that. We have to get the appointments through. That is one of our prime jobs--to provide advice and consent for the President--and it is not happening on a timely basis.  We have had to do 44 cloture motions on different people for the administration. At this point in President Obama's first term, that had only happened five times. With the previous President, it hadn't happened at all, and the previous one, it had only happened once. Already 44 times this year, it has taken us around 30 hours to get somebody through the process, and we have hundreds waiting to get through the process. That is one of our primary jobs. If we can't get those through the process, it is pretty hard for us to do the legislation we need to do.                        Veterans Choice Program  Today, Mr.President, I rise to express my serious concerns on behalf of our Nation's veterans. This is a huge problem in Wyoming is the least populated State in the If it is a huge problem there, it has to be even greater in States across the country, and I am sure it is a problem in all of them.  In 2014, we learned that several veterans died in Arizona--a lot of veterans died in Arizona while staff at the Phoenix VA medical center entered false information about their wait times and appointments. They kept getting delayed. Later that year, we found that such scheduling manipulation was widespread, including in my home State of Congress responded by creating the Veterans Choice Program to help veterans get care in their communities and to get it promptly.  Unfortunately, Wyoming veterans are continuing to experience delays and limited access to care. I have heard from many Wyoming veterans who have been unable to receive the care they need and many providers who have been unable to get reimbursed for medical services. Some doctors and facilities have ended their participation in VA Choice because it is taking too long to get reimbursed or they are unable to get reimbursed at all and they are having to do a tremendous amount of paperwork in order to even get to that final reimbursement. Sometimes when they finally get payment, the check is made out to the wrong provider. Time and again, I hear reports of how difficult it is to get simple answers, let alone care or provider reimbursement, from the VA and the contractor administering the program in  The consequences of this poorly run program are ultimately borne by the veterans. In a frontier State like Wyoming, losing access to one specialist can mean losing access to the only specialist in the area.  Sadly, Wyoming veterans continue to tell me about these problems because the situation isn't getting any better--that is in spite of my having the Secretary in my office and then having him bring his staff in, who had provided the terrible statistics that they were working from.  One such veteran was waiting for a surgery followup and cancer screening and can't go to the same doctor now because VA Choice never paid them. Another veteran was not able to access vision care. Another could not access necessary neurological care because of reimbursement issues. I have even been contacted by veterans who are worried that they will go into collections because of claims that have not been paid by the Choice Program--not by them but by the Choice  Without improvements to the program, our veterans will have to continue to wait for needed care, and their quality of life will continue to be negatively impacted.  I mentioned before that we are the least populated State in the country, and we have so many problems that I send a weekly list to the I can't imagine what it is like in a high-population  We created VA Choice to better serve the healthcare needs of veterans, not to create a new source of uncertainty about whether they will be able to get the care they need. That is unacceptable. It defeats the entire purpose of the program. Until Congress steps in to improve the program, more providers will drop out of the program and more veterans will be harmed. These men and women have given our country so much, and they deserve quality care in an efficient manner. Their providers need to be paid on time so our veterans can get the treatment they need. When[[Page S6835]]the system fails those who never failed us, trust degrades. We can do better than this. We must do better than this.  I know my colleagues on the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs are working hard to solve these issues. I am working with them to make sure that any new version of community care for our veterans takes into account the unique challenges that rural and frontier healthcare networks face. We hold the highest debt to our veterans. Let's repay that honor and honor their selfless service by providing them with the care they deserve.  The veterans program was considered to be one of the best-run healthcare programs anywhere, and I heard nothing but compliments about it until the problem in Arizona, and then we found that the system had changed. That might be an indication of what could happen if we went to Federal healthcare for all, but this is one area that needs to be straightened out. It was a prime example of good care, and it isn't. We have to get it restored for our veterans.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

714,topic-id,476,"Mr.President, I rise today to introduce the ``Breast Density and Mammography Reporting Act,'' a simple, yet potentially life-saving solution to ensure that women receive their own medical information. I thank Senator Heller for working with me on this bipartisan bill and I appreciate Representatives DeLauro and Fitzpatrick for introducing a House companion to this legislation.  We have accomplished so much in the treatment and diagnosis of breast cancer, and it still continues to be the second leading cause of death for women in the United States and the leading cause of cancer death among Hispanic women. Mammograms have aided tremendously in early detection efforts, helping many more women survive this diagnosis.  For women with dense breast tissue, however, a mammogram may not be capturing the whole picture. Dense breast tissue and cancer tumors look similar on a mammogram and make cancer harder to detect in women with higher breast density. Unfortunately, many women are never told about their tissue density on the report they receive after their screening, even though it is assessed and reported to their health care provider. This leaves women unaware their mammogram could be missing signs of cancer. If a patient doesn't have information to begin with, how would she know to ask her doctor about what additional screening might be right for her?  There is currently no Federal requirement for women to receive notice that they have dense breast tissue on their mammogram report. This bill would require that women be informed on the mammogram report, something they already receive, if they have dense breast tissue, as well as a recommendation that they talk with their health care provider to discuss any questions and if they might benefit from additional screening. The bill also requires the Department of Health and Human Services to focus on research and improved screening for patients with dense breast tissue.  The bill does not impact State laws and simply sets a minimum Federal standard on a report that women already receive. Any State wishing to have additional reporting requirements would be able to do so. Withholding from women their own medical information just does not make sense. Having access to your breast tissue density could mean the difference between catching breast cancer early and surviving, or waiting until it's too late.

766,topic-id,707,"Mr.President, the Senate is currently considering the nomination of Scott Palk to a lifetime appointment as a Federal district court judge on the Western District of I voted against Mr.Palk's nomination in the Judiciary Committee, and I will oppose his nomination on the floor.  While his nomination was pending for a lifetime appointment to be a Federal judge, Mr.Palk changed his membership with the National Rifle Association to take out a life membership in the organization. When I asked Mr.Palk about this change, he asserted he expects to maintain this ``lifetime member'' status, even if he is confirmed, and he refused to commit to recuse himself from any cases where the National Rifle Association has taken a legal position.  What I find disconcerting about this is Federal judges must be impartial. Federal judges must not have any appearance of conflicts of interest. When individuals come before a court, they need to trust that their case will be heard fairly and on the merits.  Every American must believe that they will get a fair, unbiased hearing no matter who their judge is. Federal judges must follow applicable laws and regulations that severely limit the kinds of organizations they can participate in.  For example, the code of conduct for Federal Judges says, ``[A] judge should not participate in extrajudicial activities that detract from the dignity of the judge's office, interfere with the performance of the judge's official duties, reflect adversely on the judge's impartiality, lead to frequent disqualification, or violate the limitations set forth below.''  That is why members of the Senate Judiciary Committee often ask judicial nominees at their hearings what steps they will take to prepare for the bench. It is the committee's duty to determine whether a nominee is prepared to leave their former roles and personal beliefs at the door and instead serve in an impartial arbiter.  In fact, when nominated for lifetime appointments, most nominees try to rid themselves of conflicts and limit their affiliations, especially with advocacy organizations. However, Mr.Palk not only chose to maintain his membership with the NRA, he chose to extend his membership for life.[[Page S6809]]  The fact that we are considering this nominee, given this issue with his background, just 3 weeks after the Las Vegas shooting, should really give us all a reason to pause. Las Vegas is now the deadliest mass shooting committed by an individual in the United It has only been a year since the Pulse Nightclub massacre in Orlando, which was previously the deadliest mass shooting in our Nation's history. It has been only 5 years since 20 6-year-olds and 6 adults were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, What happened after each of those shootings?  After Sandy Hook, the NRA opposed any legislation that would have restricted high-capacity magazines or military-style assault rifles.  After the Pulse Nightclub shooting, the NRA opposed any legislation to expand background checks on gun buyers or to prevent gun sales to people on terrorist watch lists.  After the Las Vegas shooting, the NRA, despite initial statements to the contrary, has come out opposed to any legislation to ban ``bump-fire stocks,'' even though such devices allow guns to function as machineguns, which are already banned under the law.  The NRA has never supported any commonsense gun legislation. The NRA's views on gun control issues could not be clearer, which is why it is so problematic that a judicial nominee chose to double-down on his NRA membership while his nomination was pending, rather than extricate himself from his prior commitments and then refuse to commit to recusing himself on cases where the NRA has made its views abundantly clear. This should trouble all of us.  Our job in evaluating judicial nominees is to ensure our Federal courts are an independent part of our system of checks and balances. To do that, we need confidence that judicial nominees will safeguard their own impartiality. I think all of my colleagues feel that way.  That is not what Mr.Palk has done. Instead of taking steps to separate himself from strong political views, he has proactively taken steps to increase his commitment to specific views of the law.  I will vote against Mr.Palk's nomination and urge my colleagues to do the same.  ",CREC-2017-10-25-pt1-PgS6781.txt,1332,STOP SETTLEMENT SLUSH FUNDS ACT OF 2017,2017.0,25.0,October

I think that this is a very important step in doing something that this Nation needs, and that is for the United States Congress and the President to pass tax reform.  For way too long, our national economy has languished at a GDP growth that is far below historical averages. One of the most important things that we have got to do is to grow our economy because that leads to families being successful, rising wages, being able to have careers for themselves and their family members, and I believe that tax reform unlocks the American economy in a way that we haven't seen in decades.  For far too long, we have looked at our Tax Code only through a set of domestic lenses and only looked at the rates; and we get into these ridiculous debates about the top bracket versus the lowest bracket, and we divide our But, for the first time, we are approaching our Tax Code through a set of global lenses that really give our American economy a chance to be competitive on the world stage.  It is not simply about cutting rates. It is not simply about giving a break to one group or another and to get away from this rhetoric. It is about creating the most vibrant place in the world to do business by reforming the Code and creating fairness.  If we do that and our American families succeed, and we see people moving from poverty into the middle class, and from the middle class up, and we see entrepreneurs, and we see new businesses and innovation, we are going to see growth in our economy like we have not seen in a generation.  The importance of that is it will give us the tools that we need to address the single biggest driver of our debt, and that is mandatory spending. And this body must have the political courage and integrity, along with the Senate, to address mandatory spending, to have an honest conversation about Social Security, about Medicare, about Medicaid, and, most importantly, about welfare entitlement reform, because we can no longer trap generation after generation in poverty.

He was a football standout at Pennsbury and was named best defensive player of the year his senior year. He also wrestled. He played soccer, baseball, and could throw a Frisbee a mile.  Above all, Luke loved to be with his family and with his friends, and it was his tight-knit group who supported Luke as he battled the increasingly common enemy of opioid addiction.  On May 17, 2017, Luke lost his battle with this disease after many difficult years of trying to return to normal.  Throughout his fight, like so many, he was haunted by shame, loss of self-worth, and the stigma of being addicted to opioids. This pain was shared by his friends and family, affecting the entire community, who just wanted to help, to see Luke be  As he tried to work his way towards recovery, Luke's parents, Maureen and John, discovered the genesis of his addiction: a prescription opioid pill given to him on his first day in high school. It progressed further when he was offered opioids after football game wins during his junior and senior year in high school. Ultimately, he was offered and accepted the invitation to try heroin.  Imagine the difficulty for this family and millions like them. At first, Luke's family was dumbfounded, angry, and hurt. They had no idea the difficulty he was facing.  They mobilized to support Luke by placing him into a local rehabilitation facility, but later found out that their insurance would not cover inpatient treatment, so they sold their car for his initial recovery. However, when Luke came home, the people, places, and things from his old life triggered a relapse.  His parents hoped that a facility in Florida would remove these triggers from Luke's life and put him on the road to recovery. After several months of recovery in Florida, Luke was forced to find another place to live. This was the move, Mr.Speaker, that he was not ready to make. He died a few days later, before he had fully unpacked the few belongings that he had.

October 17, 2017.       Congressman Fitzpatrick: Thank you for speaking with me at      the David's New Day event last weekend. Your support for the      opioid crisis has been more than welcome. The recent news,      spurred by the 60 Minutes investigation, suggests that there      are very deep rooted issues that need to be addresses to      fully confront this issue. In short, you and your colleagues      have much work to do. If there is anything we can do to help,      please let me know.       I have included my son's story below to go along with the      funeral card I gave you. I hope putting names, faces and      stories to the cause will help drive the needed change.       John Luke Johnson, always known as Luke or Lukey or Duke,      was a handsome athlete with piercing blue eyes. He was known      for his quirky sense of humor and ``chill'' demeanor. He      loved his dog Ethel (aka Ed Rendell)--she was just as quirky      as Luke--and It never ceased to amaze me how gentle and kind      Luke was to Ethel and all animals. He was a good athlete,      playing football (named Pennsbury's best defensive player his      senior year), wrestled, played soccer and baseball. He could      throw a Frisbee a mile. He loved to be with his friends. He      had more friends than I could count. But, his best friends--     Tyler (an Army Ranger), Fardin (a college student) and      Christian D (recent college grad), Christian H (a college      student) he loved most. Like his family, these friends      supported and loved Luke; despite the pain and battle that      comes with addiction, they stuck around until the very end.      In Luke, we lost that good guy next door--that guy that      everyone loved and enjoyed being with.       One May 17th, 2017, our son Luke lost his battle with this      terrible disease only after suffering for a few, very      difficult years trying to return to ``normal''. Throughout      his battle he was haunted by shame, a loss of self-worth and      the stigma of being an addict. This pain was shared by his      family and friends. Our aspirations for him and the      aspirations he had for himself were replaced by the day to      day struggle against the emotional and physiological damage      caused by this disease.       During the process of recovery, we learned about Luke's      path to becoming an addict. It started with a female friend      giving him a pill (an opioid) to try his first day of high      school. She passed away of an overdose last year. It[[Page H8084]]     progressed further with a mom rewarding football players with      opioids after game wins during his junior and senior year.      Ultimately, he was offered and accepted the invitation to try      heroin.       Until Luke found himself fully addicted and came to us for      help, the indications were almost silent. He had the normal      ups and downs of a teen and at times indulged in alcohol and      smoked pot. While we had many discussions about making good      choices and the implications of drug and alcohol abuse, we      were not aware of the opioid use and the changes to his      brain. We are confident Luke was not aware of the permanency      of his actions and what he would ultimately have to battle.       Initially, we were dumbfounded, angry and hurt. Our      understanding was limited to the stereo-type junkie from the      70's and the ``just say no'' Dare program information we      received during the elementary school assemblies. We had no      clue about how the drug had changed his brain and the very      real difficulty he was in. We were quickly enlightened by our      daughter Alex, who had recently studied this in college.       We mobilized to support Luke by placing him into a local      facility. Our insurance would not cover inpatient treatment      (we were told only after a relapse) and we sold our car and      scraped up the 20k it cost for his initial recovery. After a      24 day stay, Luke came home but soon returned to using--     despite meetings and drug tests the triggers ``people places      and things'', we learned, were very real.       We found a place in Florida for Luke and assumed that being      away from the triggers was best for He lasted 3 or 4      months and returned home only to use again. After several      months, Luke found another place and was in recovery and      clean for 9 months. After the facility in Florida changed      ownership (and the new staff now cared more for insurance      money than keeping their charges clean), Luke was forced to      find another place to live. This was a move he was not ready      to make. He died a few days later, before he had fully      unpacked the few belongings he had.       After Luke's death, we established the Luke's HEROin ME      foundation. The goal of the foundation is to help with the      awareness, education and to destigmatize opioid addiction;      ultimately, so others can save their While we have much      more to do, we have made progress in our local high school,      have shared Luke's story on radio, in the press and have      begun to organize events to meet our goals. We will push to      have a national standard that can be applied uniformly across      the country. We need to have more standards for rehab      facilities, many of which have become corrupt machines that      fuel relapse and overdose deaths.       With opioid overdose (and the more recent introduction of      fentanyl and carfentanil into commonly used drugs) as the      leading cause of death among our young people, we have little      choice.

299,topic-id,399,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, as communities across my district and across our Nation continue to deal with the crisis of opioid abuse and addiction, it is incomprehensible to imagine a synthetic drug up to 50 times stronger than heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine.  Fentanyl is a manufactured opioid which, in its illicit versions, has contributed to tens of thousands of deaths. This fact is especially concerning, given that this drug can be ordered online and delivered via mail or express consignment couriers from places like  Fentanyl is highly potent in trace amounts, and this problem is exacerbated due to fentanyl being extremely difficult for our authorities to detect. That is why Congresswoman Tsongas and I introduced the INTERDICT Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation that provides U.Customs and Border Protection access to the most effective chemical screening devices and scientific support to detect and intercept synthetic opioids before they can cause more harm.  Mr.Speaker, the INTERDICT Act will ensure that CBP will have additional portable chemical screening devices available at ports of entry and mail and express consignment facilities, along with additional fixed chemical screening devices available in CBP laboratories.  It also provides CBP with sufficient resources, personnel, and facilities, including scientists available at all hours, to interpret screening test results from the field and authorizes, based upon professional expertise, the appropriation of $9 million for hundreds of new screening devices, laboratory equipment, facilities, and personnel for support during all operational hours.  Combined, the additional chemical screening devices, scientists, and other resources will help safeguard CBP field personnel from exposure to fentanyl and other deadly synthetic opioids and narcotics and prevent their unlawful importation.  As an EMT and former Federal drug prosecutor, I have seen firsthand the devastating impact of addiction in our communities and understand the increased danger added by synthetic opioids like fentanyl. Illicit fentanyl being trafficked into the United States poses a continued threat to the American people.  By passing this legislation, this body can follow through on its promise to the American people and align our policy with the President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis, which has prioritized regulating the flow of fentanyl in its interim report.

354,topic-id,3049,"Mr.President, I rise today to address a matter that has been very much on my mind. At a moment when it seems that our democracy is more defined by our discord and our dysfunction than by our own values and principles, let me begin by noting a somewhat obvious point that these offices that we hold are not ours indefinitely. We are not here simply to mark time. Sustained incumbency is certainly not the point of seeking office, and there are times when we must risk our careers in favor of our principles. Now is such a time.  It must also be said that I rise today with no small measure of regret--regret because of the state of our disunion, regret because of the disrepair and destructiveness of our politics, regret because of the indecency of our discourse, regret because of the coarseness of our leadership, regret for the compromise of our moral authority, and by ``our,'' I mean all of our complicity in this alarming and dangerous state of affairs.  It is time for our complicity and our accommodation of the unacceptable to end. In this century, a new phrase has entered the language to describe the accommodation of a new and undesirable order, that phrase being the ``new normal.'' But we must never adjust to the present coarseness of our national dialogue with the tone set at the top. We must never regard as normal the regular and casual undermining of our democratic norms and ideals. We must never meekly accept the daily sundering of our country, the personal attacks, the threats against principles, freedoms, and institutions, the flagrant disregard for truth and decency, the reckless provocations, most often for the pettiest and most personal reasons, reasons having nothing whatsoever to do with the fortunes of the people whom we have been elected to serve. None of these appalling features of our current politics should ever be regarded as normal. We must never allow ourselves to lapse into thinking that is just the way things are now. If we simply become inured to this condition, thinking that it is just politics as usual, then Heaven help us.  Without fear of the consequences and without consideration of the rules of what is politically safe or palatable, we must stop pretending that the degradation of our politics and the conduct of some in our executive branch are normal. They are not normal. Reckless, outrageous, and undignified behavior has become excused and countenanced as ``telling it like it is'' when it is actually just reckless, outrageous, and undignified.  When such behavior emanates from the top of our government, it is something else. It is dangerous to a democracy. Such behavior does not project strength, because our strength comes from our values. It instead projects a corruption of the spirit and weakness.  It is often said that children are watching. Well, they are. And what are we going to do about that? When the next generation asks us ``Why didn't you do something? Why didn't you speak up?'' what are we going to say? Mr.President, I rise today to say ``enough.''  We must dedicate ourselves to making sure that the anomalous never becomes the normal. With respect and humility, I must say that we have fooled ourselves for long enough that a pivot to governing is right around the corner, a return to civility and stability right behind it. We know better than that. By now, we all know better than that.  Here, today, I stand to say that we would better serve the country and better fulfill the obligations under the Constitution by adhering to our article I ``old normal''--Mr.Madison's doctrine of the separation of powers. This genius innovation, which affirms Madison's status as a true visionary and for which Madison argued in Federalist 51, held that the equal branches of our government would balance and counteract each other when necessary. ``Ambition counteracts ambition,'' he wrote. But what happens if ambition fails to counteract ambition? What happens if stability fails to assert itself in the face of chaos and instability or if decency fails to call out indecency?  Were the shoe on the other foot, would we Republicans meekly accept such behavior on display from dominant Democrats? Of course we wouldn't, and we would be wrong if we did.  When we remain silent and fail to act when we know that silence and inaction are the wrong things to do because of political considerations, because we might make enemies, because we might alienate the base, because we might provoke a primary challenge, because ad infinitum, ad nauseam, when we succumb to those considerations in spite of what should be greater considerations and imperatives in defense of our institutions and our liberty, we dishonor our principles and forsake our obligations. Those things are far more important than politics.  I am aware that more politically savvy people than I will caution against such talk. I am aware that there is a segment of my party that believes anything short of complete and unquestioning loyalty to a President who belongs to my party is unacceptable and suspect. If I have been critical, it is not because I relish criticizing the behavior of the President of the United If I have been critical, it is because I believe it is my obligation to do so as a matter of duty of conscience.  The notion that one should stay silent as the norms and values that keep America strong are undermined and as the alliances and agreements that ensure the stability of the entire world are routinely threatened by the level of thought that goes into 140 characters, the notion that we should say or do nothing in the face of such mercurial behavior is ahistoric and, I believe, profoundly misguided.  A Republican President named Roosevelt had this to say about the President and a citizen's relationship to the office:       The President is merely the most important among a large      number of public servants. He should be supported or opposed      exactly to the degree which is warranted by his good conduct      or bad conduct, his efficiency or inefficiency in rendering      loyal, able, and disinterested service to the Nation as a      whole.       Therefore, it is absolutely necessary that there should be      full liberty to tell the truth about his acts, and this means      that it is exactly as necessary to blame him when he does      wrong as to praise him when he does right. Any other attitude      in an American citizen is both base and servile.  President Roosevelt continued:       To announce that there must be no criticism of the      President, or that we are to stand by a President, right or      wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally      treasonable to the American public.  Acting on conscience and principle is the manner in which we express our moral selves, and, as such, loyalty to conscience and principle should supersede loyalty to any man or party.  We can all be forgiven for failing in that measure from time to time. I certainly put myself at the top of the list of those who fall short in this regard. I am holier than none.  But too often, we rush not to salvage principle but to forgive and excuse our failures so that we might accommodate them and go right on failing until the accommodation itself becomes our principle.  In that way and over time, we can justify almost any behavior and sacrifice any principle. I am afraid this is where we now find ourselves.  When a leader correctly identifies real hurt and insecurity in our country, and instead of addressing it goes to look for someone to blame, there is perhaps nothing more devastating to a pluralistic society. Leadership knows that most often a good place to start in assigning blame is to look somewhat closer to home. Leadership knows where the buck stops, humility helps, and character counts.  Leadership does not knowingly encourage or feed ugly or debased appetites in us. Leadership lives by the American creed, ``E Pluribus Unum''--``From many, one.'' American leadership looks to the world, and just as Lincoln did, sees the family of man. Humanity is not a zero-sum game. When we have been at our most prosperous, we have been at our most principled, and when we do well, the rest of the world does well.  These articles of civic faith have been critical to the American identity for as long as we have been alive. They are our birthright and our obligation.[[Page S6736]]We must guard them jealously and pass them on for as long as the calendar has days. To betray them or to be unserious in their defense is a betrayal of the fundamental obligations of American leadership, and to behave as if they don't matter is simply not who we are.  Now the efficacy of American leadership around the globe has come into question. When the United States emerged from World War II, we contributed about half of the world's economic activity. It would have been easy to secure our dominance, keeping those countries that had been defeated or greatly weakened during the war in their place. We didn't do that. It would have been easy to focus inward. We resisted those impulses. Instead, we financed reconstruction of shattered countries and created international organizations and institutions that have helped provide security and foster prosperity around the world for more than 70 years.  Now, it seems that we, the architects of this visionary, rules-based world order that has brought so much freedom and prosperity, are the ones most eager to abandon it. The implications of this abandonment are profound, and the beneficiaries of this rather radical departure in the American approach to the world are the ideological enemies of our values.  Despotism loves a vacuum, and our allies are now looking elsewhere for leadership. Why are they doing this? None of this is normal. What do we, as U.Senators, have to say about it? The principles that underlie our politics, the values of our founding, are too vital to our identity and to our survival to allow them to be compromised by the requirements of politics because politics can make us silent when we should speak, and silence can equal complicity.  I have children and grandchildren to answer to, and so I will not be complicit or silent. I have decided I will be better able to represent the people of Arizona and to better serve my country and my conscience by freeing myself of the political considerations that consume far too much bandwidth and would cause me to compromise far too many principles.  To that end, I am announcing today that my service in the Senate will conclude at the end of my term in early January 2019. It is clear, at this moment, that a traditional conservative who believes in limited government and free markets, who is devoted to free trade, who is pro-immigration has a narrower and narrower path to nomination in the Republican Party--the party that has so long defined itself by its belief in those things.  It is also clear to me, for the moment, that we have given up on the core principles in favor of a more viscerally satisfying anger and resentment. To be clear, the anger and resentment that the people feel at the royal mess we have created are justified, but anger and resentment are not a governing philosophy.  There is an undeniable potency to a populist appeal, but mischaracterizing or misunderstanding our problems and giving in to the impulse to scapegoat and belittle threatens to turn us into a fearful, backward-looking people. In the case of the Republican Party, those things also threaten to turn us into a fearful, backward-looking minority party.  We were not made great as a country by indulging in or even exalting our worst impulses, turning against ourselves, glorifying in the things that divide us, and calling fake things true and true things fake, and we did not become the beacon of freedom in the darkest corners of the world by flouting our institutions and failing to understand just how hard-won and vulnerable they are.  This spell will eventually break. That is my belief. We will return to ourselves once more, and I say, the sooner the better because to have a healthy government, we must also have healthy and functioning parties. We must respect each other again in an atmosphere of shared facts and shared values, comity, and good faith. We must argue our positions fervently and never be afraid to compromise. We must assume the best of our fellow man and always look for the good. Until that day comes, we must be unafraid to stand up and speak out as if our country depends on it because it does.  I plan to spend the remaining 14 months of my Senate term doing just that. The graveyard is full of indispensable men and women. None of us here is indispensable, nor were even the great figures of history who toiled at these very desks in this very Chamber to shape the country we have inherited. What is indispensable are the values they consecrated in Philadelphia and in this place--values which have endured and will endure for so long as men and women wish to remain free. What is indispensable is what we do here in defense of those values. A political career does not mean much if we are complicit in undermining these values.  I thank my colleagues for indulging me here today. I will close by borrowing the words of President Lincoln, who knew more about healthy enmity and preserving our founding values than any other American who has ever lived. His words from his first inaugural were a prayer in his time and are no less in ours:       We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies.      Though passion may have strained, it must not break the bonds      of our affection. The mystic chords of memory will swell when      again touched, as surely as they will be, by the better      angels of our nature.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.  (Applause, Senators rising.)  The PRESIDING The majority leader.                   Thanking the Senator from Arizona  Mr.Mr.President, colleagues, we regret to hear that our friend from Arizona will conclude his Senate service at the end of his 6-year term.  I would like to say, on behalf of myself and I think many of my colleagues, we just witnessed a speech from a very fine man--a man who clearly brings high principles to the office every day and does what he believes is in the best interest of Arizona and the country.  I am grateful the Senator from Arizona will be here for another year and a half. We have big things to try to accomplish for the American people. From my perspective, the Senator from Arizona has been a great team player, always trying to get a constructive outcome no matter what the issue before us.  So I thank the Senator from Arizona for his service, which will continue, thankfully, for another year and a half, and for the opportunity to listen to his remarks today  The PRESIDING The senior Senator from  Mr.Mr.President, it is very hard for me to add to the eloquence of my dear friend from Arizona, but I do want to say it has been one of the great honors of my life to have the opportunity to serve with a man of integrity, of honor, decency, and commitment to not only Arizona but the United States of  I have seen Jeff Flake stand up for what he believes in, knowing full well that there would be a political price to pay. I have seen him stand up for his family. I have seen him stand up for his forbearers who were the early settlers of the State of In fact, there is a place called Snowflake, AZ, and obviously the ``Flake'' part comes from his direct predecessor.  It is the Flake family and families like them who came and worked and slaved and raised families and made Arizona what it is, and it has never had a more deserving son than Jeff Flake and his beautiful wife Cheryl and children.  So I would just like to say, Jeff, I have known you now for a number of years. I know you have served Arizona and the country, and there is one thing I am absolutely sure of, and that is you will continue that service, which is part of your family. It is part of your view of It is part of your willingness and desire to serve One of the great privileges of my life has been to have the opportunity to know you and serve with you.  As we look, all of us, at some point at our time that we have spent here--whether it be short or whether it be long--we look back and we think about what we could have done, what we should have done, what we might have done, the mistakes we made, and the things we are proud of. Well, when the Flake service to this country in this Senate is reviewed, it will be one of honor, of brilliance and patriotism and love of country.[[Page S6737]]  I thank you.

Mr.Speaker, I have been astounded by the rhetoric that we have heard from the other side for a plan that they haven't really seen. They are making up their facts as they go along to suit their wishes.  Mr.Speaker, I support the fiscal year 2018 budget resolution. While I think the Senate's version falls far short of the great work we did in the House and our budget, it is still the key thing that we need to have to move forward with tax reform for the American people.  Our tax reform plan includes tax cuts for the working class Americans who have been struggling for the last several years under a broken Tax  It also makes America's businesses the most competitive in the world instead of having to struggle with the world's least competitive tax system.

268,topic-id,1341,"Mr.President, I rise today to remember and celebrate the life of my friend, Senator Paul  Paul led a lot of fights in the Senate on behalf of working families and those without a voice. He didn't back down even when a fight seemed unwinnable. He told voters exactly what he believed even when it wasn't popular. It was by taking such positions that Minnesotans, whether they agreed with him or not, always knew where he stood.  In the final days of the 2002 campaign, he told Minnesotans:       I don't represent the big oil companies, I don't represent      the big pharmaceutical companies . . . they already have      great representation in It's the rest of the      people that need it. I represent the people of  But Paul also knew full well that standing up to powerful interests could have steep political costs. His career in the Senate was bookended by votes on going to war in Both of his votes were unpopular, but Paul stood on principle, not on politics. His maiden speech, the first speech he gave as a Senator, was in opposition to the first Gulf war, and one of the last Senate votes he cast was against the second war in  He was facing a tough reelection challenge at the time of his vote, and he knew it might cost him his seat, and he told friends so. But to have voted otherwise, he said, would have violated the principles that guided his career. So he voted his conscience and put political considerations aside, just as he did throughout his time in public office.  Then, just 11 days before election day, his plane went down, taking not only Paul and Sheila, his wife, but their daughter Marcia, campaign staffers Tom Lapic, Mary McEvoy, and Will McLaughlin, as well as pilots Richard Conry and Michael  Since coming to the Senate, I have learned how well regarded Paul was around the Capitol, not only by Senators from both sides of the aisle but also by Capitol police officers, whom he knew by name, and the elevator operators, for whom he always made time.  Paul's legislative work continues to make a profound difference in the lives of millions of Among his accomplishments are his pioneering efforts, along with Republican Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico, on mental health parity, which ensures that copays and deductibles for addiction and mental health services are on par with payments for other medical services. The law was jointly named for Paul and Senator Domenici, and it passed in late 2008, 6 years after Paul's death.  After I was seated in 2009, one of the first things I did was to work with Paul's son David on getting the final rules written to implement Wellstone-That work inspired me to later push for investments in school mental health services, to help students and their families who need those services.  Paul also led the David-and-Goliath effort to stop bankruptcy legislation that favored big banks and credit card companies over working families. Despite going up against a wide range of special interests with huge lobbying power and lots of money, he successfully held off passage of the bill during his lifetime.  He also took on special interests when he stood against oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife He believed, like I do, that the long-term consequences of endangering the home of indigenous people and a pristine habitat for wildlife far outweighed ``a short-term speculative supply of oil that will not . . . help consumers.'' Because of Paul and others in the Senate, the Wildlife Refuge, at least for now, remains pristine.  Paul also had an amazing and special relationship with Sheila, who became an important partner in his Senate work. She became a leading advocate for survivors of domestic violence, spending years raising awareness about the issue and the need to address its causes. Former Senator and Vice President Joe Biden said Sheila deserves as much credit as any lawmaker for passage of the landmark Violence Against Women Since the law's enactment, incidents of domestic violence have been reduced significantly. It was a landmark achievement.  My constituents remember Paul fondly. They leave notes and mementos for him at the quiet memorial site honoring him just off of Highway 53, near Eveleth, They leave them for his wife Sheila, too, and for the others who died with them exactly 15 years ago tomorrow, when their plane tragically crashed just miles from the Eveleth-Virginia Municipal  I have been to the memorial site, and I have seen how deeply and personally Paul touched people in Minnesota and across the country. He inspired them not only as a U.Senator for 12 years but also as a Carleton College professor who encouraged a generation of students to take action in their communities. He did so as a fiery organizer who stood up for Minnesota farmers and for working families and insisted on giving them a voice and a seat at the table. He never lost the tenacious spirit that led him to be a collegiate wrestling champion--he is in the college wrestling hall of fame--and he brought that same approach to standing up for He stood strong against injustice, even when it[[Page S6775]]twice meant being arrested. It wasn't because he wanted to break the law, but because he thought it was necessary to bring about change for the better.  He also had a special way of connecting with people. Former Senator Tom Harkin said at a memorial service for Paul that he ``made a miner up in the Iron Range know he was as important . . . as the president of the United States.'' That is how Paul voted in the Senate, too, putting ordinary Minnesotans ahead of politics, money, and influence.  The last time I saw Paul was at a 2002 campaign event in Paul, just weeks before he died. He was locked in a bitter struggle for reelection. Despite being in a grueling fight for his political life, the first thing he said to me was, ``How's your mom?'' That was  I had just come from my mom's nursing home in Minneapolis, where she had a picture of Paul on her wall that said: ``Phoebe, keep fighting.'' She wasn't doing very well. I told Paul that she had dementia--some sporadic dementia--and that day I couldn't have a conversation with her. He put his hand on my shoulder and said: ``Touch means so much. Touch means so much.''  The next day, I went to the nursing home, and I took my mom out into the garden, in a wheelchair. She was having a bad day again, but I put my arm around her as we sat. It was a beautiful day. I don't know if it meant anything to her, but it sure meant everything to me.  Paul's life and his work meant a lot to me too. His examples as a tireless, passionate champion for working families, for veterans, for farmers, and for those who simply needed a voice have inspired my own time in the I keep Paul's picture and his Senate name plate in my office behind me as a reminder at my desk every day. Every day I serve, I think back to Paul's words. This is what Paul said:       Politics is not about power. Politics is not about money.      Politics is not about winning for the sake of winning.      Politics is about the improvement of people's lives.  While Paul isn't here with us today, his legacy lives on in so many ways. It lives on in the generations of students and activists he trained and inspired in It lives on in the policies he fought for here in the Senate, for access to mental health care, for a clean environment, and for making sure that working families get a fair shot. It lives on in the countless lives that he touched, like mine and my mom's.  Paul made us all better, and I hope his legacy will continue to inspire us well into the future.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-24-pt1-PgS6774-4.txt,1969,STOP SETTLEMENT SLUSH FUNDS ACT OF 2017,2017.0,24.0,October

452,topic-id,1192,"Mr.President, I rise today to talk about the urgent need for action on the Children's Health Insurance Program and other vital safety net programs.  On September 30 of this year, 3 weeks ago, funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, expired, and funding for community health centers also expired, as did funding for the National Health Service These three cornerstone programs provide essential health services to hundreds of thousands of my constituents and to millions of people across the country.  Although these programs have historically secured strong bipartisan support and, ostensibly, still do today, the Republican majority has not moved these bills forward toward passage, and it is really time to act.  My home State of Minnesota is one of the first States to exhaust its funding for its Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, a program that covers 125,000 low-income children and 1,700 pregnant women.  While the Federal Government has provided some emergency stop-gap funding, that, too, is slated to run out by the end of Minnesota has a long tradition of insuring coverage to vulnerable populations. So coverage for low-income children will continue, no matter what. However, over the next few weeks, if CHIP funding is not reauthorized, the State will have to decide whether it will take extraordinary measures and incur significant financial losses to continue providing coverage for vital services, like prenatal and postnatal care for the pregnant women, whose coverage is currently funded by This is a terrible[[Page S6833]]choice that States shouldn't have to make, and it doesn't have to be that way.  Minnesota is not alone. Five other States and the District of Columbia will see their funding dry up by December, and 25 more States will exhaust their funding by early next year.  Pretty soon, thousands of families could receive notices informing them that their coverage will be terminated. Imagine for a second what that moment would feel like. You have a son or a daughter with a serious medical condition, and, perhaps, they are even in the hospital. You find out that their health insurance is going to be cut off because the Republican-controlled Congress couldn't get its act together to continue funding for a bipartisan program that has been in existence for decades. I would be livid. That is why we have to act now.  For most of this year, the Republican majority has been consumed with destructive and counterproductive debates focused on repealing They have done little else. That meant that not only did we blow past the funding deadline for the Children's Health Insurance Program, but we also blew through the funding deadlines for community health centers and the National Health Service Corps program. Now this critical reauthorization is on hold because Republicans can't agree on how to pay for it. This comes just a week after Republicans in the Senate endorsed the budget to increase the debt by up to $1.5 trillion over 10 years for tax cuts that will largely benefit the wealthiest In fact, the Tax Policy Center estimates that 80 percent of benefits of the Republican tax plan would go to the top 1 percent of income earners in this country.  This is truly a case of the absurd. When it comes to providing healthcare for needy children and keeping Americans healthy, Republicans are saying they can't do it unless it is paid for, and, often, that means making cuts to other safety net programs in which vulnerable individuals rely. But when it comes to tax cuts for the wealthy, which costs many, many, many, many times more than the cost of providing children with health insurance, my Republican colleagues are perfectly happy to do that without demands for offsets and, instead, adding costs to the debt. This is not responsible budgeting, and it is not just kids that stand to lose under this type of budgeting approach. Let me tell you about the other programs at risk in my State of  In Minnesota, there are more than 70 community health center clinics that receive a total of $27 million in funding to care for the uninsured and the underinsured in the If this funding is not reauthorized soon, these community health centers and the patients they serve are going to experience serious losses and not just financial losses.  Take, for example, Sawtooth Mountain Clinic, which provides care to some of the most isolated and rural counties up in the northeastern corner of my State, in the Sawtooth reports that it would lose up to $1 million, which would force them to cut back on staff and services, having a drastic ripple effect across the entire community.  The CEO of the clinic in Grand Marais explains:       We are the only clinic and providers in all of Cook      County--  Parenthetically, that is a big county--     and also one of the only providers serving the Grand Portage      band.  That is the band of the Chippewa or       Since 1965, Congress has provided this stable and      critically important funding that supports our isolated and      rural communities. Congress needs to do its work and needs to      act now.  Similarly, without funding for the National Health Service Corps--this is what the program does. It provides financial support and loan repayment for clinicians who practice in underserved areas. I know the Presiding Officer must be interested in that, as Alaska has some underserved areas and needs providers to serve in those areas. Many providers, including those in greater Minnesota, will not be able to recruit or hire new staff.  In a recent news article, the chief executive of a Minneapolis-based network of clinics stated that the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program offered him a unique bargaining chip against the larger health systems. Without this program, he believes he wouldn't be able to successfully compete for providers.  Look, I recognize how we got here and where the time and energy has been spent over the last few months, and I am proud that we were able to abide by the will of the people and successfully stop the effort to repeal the ACA and strip healthcare from millions of people. I would hope that we would recognize that we have here historically bipartisan legislation to reauthorize funding for children's health insurance coverage and other safety net programs. It is incumbent upon us to act, and act now. We have to reauthorize these programs so that Minnesotans and millions of the families across the country are not unnecessarily and unfairly harmed as a result of our inaction.  In the same news story I referred to earlier, the CEO of NorthPoint Health & Wellness, another safety net clinic in Minnesota, stated:       There is a high degree of anxiety for staff and for some of      our patients. . . . I think Congress understands that we are      vital to the safety net and they have to continue to support      the community health centers.  Let's work together to pass this legislation so we don't let these clinics and the patients they serve down. It is time to act, and time to act now.

616,topic-id,1117,"Mr.President, I rise to discuss the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's recently finalized rule to limit the use of predispute, forced arbitration clauses in contracts for financial services and products. I strongly oppose the Congressional Review Act resolution to dismantle this vital consumer protection.  Forced arbitration clauses force individuals to sign away their right to go to court as a condition of buying a product or a service, and they allow corporate America to take advantage of a shadow justice system that is inherently biased toward the corporation and offers no meaningful appeals process. To put it bluntly, these clauses serve one purpose and one purpose alone, to help make sure the giant corporations still come out on top if they have wronged consumers.  Thankfully, we started to make some progress in addressing forced arbitration. Five years ago, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau began an intensive study of forced arbitration clauses in consumer financial services contracts for things like credit cards, savings accounts, and private student loans. The study confirmed that forced arbitration stacks the deck against consumers and in favor of powerful corporations. Of the 341 reviewed cases of forced arbitration in which consumers made claims against financial institutions, the CFPB found that consumers obtained relief in just 32 disputes. That is 32 out of 341--9 percent of the time.  By contrast, of the 244 cases of forced arbitration in which companies made claims against their customers, the companies obtained relief in 227 of them or 93 percent of the time. For the consumers who did obtain relief, the CFPB found they won far less than they had claimed, while the companies that obtained relief recovered nearly the entirety of their claim.  The study also demonstrated how giant financial institutions have learned to pair forced arbitration clauses with class action bans to shutter the courtroom doors on groups of individuals with small claims. Once blocked from going to court as a class, most people drop their claims entirely because they lack the financial means or will to fight a corporation in arbitration as an individual, where outcomes are seemingly predetermined in favor of the corporation.  Although millions of financial consumers are covered by forced arbitration clauses and class action waivers, the CFPB found, on average, that only 25 consumers with claims of less than $1,000 pursue arbitration annually. Think about it. That is just license for corporations to rip you off $20, $30 at a time. It is license.  Finally, forced arbitration is shrouded in secrecy, which shortchanges current and prospective customers of information that may affect their financial decisions. Between confidentiality requirements contained in many forced[[Page S6752]]arbitration agreements and the secretive nature of the arbitration proceeding itself, financial institutions use force arbitration agreements to shield themselves from accountability to the courts and to the public eye.  Let's take the Wells Fargo scandal. Just last year, the public was shocked to learn that over the course of 5 years, Wells Fargo employees had been incentivized to open millions of sham accounts in the names of Wells Fargo customers, including over 31,000 in my State of Then the bank charged the customers for those accounts without their permission. One reason this fraudulent practice was able to continue for so many years is because Wells Fargo's customer account agreement included and continues to include, yes, a forced arbitration clause.  When customers discovered and attempted to sue Wells Fargo for the sham accounts, the company forced them into arbitration, having successfully argued that any dispute arising from the sham account was covered by the arbitration clause in the agreement for the real account.  Let me say that again. Wells Fargo successfully argued that any dispute arising from the sham account was covered by the arbitration clause in the agreement for the real account. That is what we are voting on here.  If these claims--some of which date back to 2013--had been able to proceed to court rather than in private, forced arbitration, other Wells Fargo customers would have been alerted to the wrongdoing and may have been able to save themselves and thousands of others from being ripped off and prevented damage to their credit. That really matters to people. A bad credit score can mean the difference between getting a mortgage and not getting a mortgage, getting a car loan or not, or even getting a job or not  Fortunately, a few months ago, the CFPB issued a rule to ban financial institutions from preventing their customers from banding together to seek justice in a public court of law. This is good news for consumers who have been scammed by payday lenders, debt relief companies, or big banks like Wells Fargo; it is good news for our servicemembers and veterans who wish to vindicate their rights under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act; and it is good news for small businesses, community banks, and credit unions that have been forced to compete with powerful corporations that are pocketing billions in stolen money from consumers.  Let's be very clear about what the rule doesn't do because I think there has been some misinformation put out there. The rule is not about banning arbitration altogether, and the rule does not prevent a consumer from pursuing arbitration if he or she wants to, assuming the corporation also wants to go to arbitration. Instead, the rule simply takes the ``forced'' out of ``forced arbitration'' and gives the consumers a real choice again to pursue a claim of wrongdoing in arbitration or band together with similarly harmed consumers to seek justice in a public court of law.  Now the big banks and financial institutions--including Equifax, the massive credit bureau that put 143 million Americans' private information at risk--are trying to kill the rule, and they are far too close to getting their way.  As long as I have been in the Senate, I have been fighting to end forced arbitration. I have always said my efforts are about reopening the courtroom doors because they should never have been closed in the first place.  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to see the CFPB's rule for exactly what it is, a commonsense way to restore transparency and accountability in our Nation's financial system and to level the field between Wall Street and consumers. We must allow the CFPB to move forward in implementing this critical consumer protection.  I ask you to please join me in showing strong support for the CFPB's rule, knowing what is in the rule, knowing what this is about, and then opposing the special interests that are attempting to take this rule away.

749,topic-id,787,"Mr.President, I rise to talk about the devastation in Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands and the need to rebuild the electric grid in a more resilient and sustainable way.  Over the last few months, communities around the country have been devastated by natural disasters. We have had terrible hurricanes in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.Virgin Islands, as well as tragic wildfires across the These communities need immediate help, and that is why the disaster supplemental appropriations bill we passed yesterday is so important. I am glad this bill provides nearly $19 billion to replenish FEMA's emergency disaster accounts that help communities start to rebuild, but it is just a downpayment. As we know, it will take a lot more Federal assistance.  One thing we need to focus on is the electric grid. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria demonstrated the risks the electric grid faces from extreme weather. The communities hardest hit in Texas and Florida underwent days--sometimes much longer--without any power, and when this happens, it is a serious risk to the safety and health of everyone in the area.  Now, American citizens in Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands are facing a major humanitarian crisis, and the Federal Government needs to do everything it can to assist.  More than a month after Hurricane Maria hit, only 25 percent of Puerto Rico has access to electricity, and it will take many months to get power back to those communities. That is completely unacceptable. Without electricity, pumping stations can't supply drinking water to households. In fact, 25 percent of the island still lacks access to potable water. Without electricity, wastewater treatment facilities can't operate, which means raw sewage is contaminating rivers and streams. Without electricity, cell towers cease to function, making communication with first responders difficult. Without a stable electric grid, hospitals have to rely on backup power to keep lifesaving equipment working. That backup power is often diesel generators that require fuel, which is in short supply.  Given the dire situation, it is no surprise that we have already seen tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans leave the island, with nearly 60,000 arriving in Florida alone.  The majority of the transmission and distribution lines were destroyed in Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin We need to rebuild them, and I think we can all agree they should be rebuilt to withstand the next disaster. So let's rebuild the electric grid in a more resilient and sustainable way that reduces future threats and future costs. I have been talking with my Republican colleagues and members of the administration, and everyone agrees this is a good idea. That is why I want to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to include language in the next supplemental disaster aid package that does exactly this.  I am talking about investing in a more modern and more decentralized[[Page S6801]]grid so that not everyone is relying on a handful of powerplants that can go down. Decentralized energy resources operating in microgrids are more likely to remain functioning during and after storms. There are many instances of distributed energy keeping important facilities online after natural disasters, including the Texas Medical Center, which is the largest medical complex in the world, which has a combined heat and power plant that kept running during Hurricane That is because during extreme weather, these technologies can go into island mode or operate independent of the grid.  Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands have some of the highest electricity prices in the United States, and that is because they rely on oil, coal, and gas that must be shipped from the mainland. While these islands do not have fossil fuels, do you know what they do have? Lots of And the rapidly declining costs of distributed clean energy technologies such as solar, wind, energy efficiency, and battery storage, in many instances make them more affordable than existing power generation, which means these clean energy technologies could help reduce prices.  These investments will also save money in the long run. In 2005, the National Institute of Building Sciences completed a study for FEMA that found that every dollar invested in disaster preparedness and resilience saves $4 in future avoided losses. We know we are going to see more hurricanes and extreme weather events, so let's rebuild in such a way that impacts are not as severe the next time around. Let's protect people and save taxpayer money.  That is my message: Let's protect people, and let's all save taxpayer money and do the thing that makes sense.  Thank you.

832,topic-id,803,"Mr.President, I rise to talk about the recent terrorist attack in  On October 14, a truck filled with explosives detonated in a crowded district in Mogadishu--Somalia's capital. The blast was especially devastating because the truck blew up next to a fuel tanker, causing a massive fireball and leveling structures, including the nearby Safari Hotel, which collapsed and trapped many people under its rubble. According to Somali authorities, the target of the attack may have been the city's international airport which also houses many  This is the worst terrorist attack in Somalia's history. Three hundred fifty-eight people were killed, hundreds have been injured, and dozens are still missing.  As a Minnesota Senator, I represent the largest Somali-American population in the For Minnesota, this wasn't just a massive attack overseas. It affected every one of my estimated 74,000 Somali-American constituents.  Among those killed is Ahmed He was from Bloomington, He had attended Normandale Community College and Metropolitan State He left behind his wife and three children.  Another Somali-American who was killed in the blast was Mohamoud He had lived in Ohio and had moved back to Somalia about 2 years ago. He was a young man with a bright future, working at the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management in  There was Abukar He lived in Virginia before moving back to Somalia, where he worked in the Ministry of Commerce and He was killed along with his wife, Shadiye They left behind seven children who are between the ages of 3 and 20.  Hundreds of others perished in that heinous attack. They all have their own stories. They left behind their wives, their husbands, their children, their friends, their parents.  Somalia is one of the most, if not the most, fragile nations on It has been an incredibly difficult country to[[Page S6844]]govern ever since the civil war tore the country apart in 1991. It suffers from the massive displacement of people, hundreds of thousands of refugees, lack of sufficient public services, and warring factions and clans. To make matters worse, a severe drought has ravaged Somalia, leaving 6 million people--half of the nation's population--facing food shortages. The combination of instability, lack of security, and shortage of goods and services has enabled terrorist groups like al-Shabaab--widely believed to be the culprit in this attack--to gain a foothold in  We have to have a comprehensive strategy to help the people of One component of that strategy is to help Somalis root out terrorism. The Government of Somalia has announced its intent to step up the fight against al-The United States has and will continue to aid those efforts, as will the African Union Mission in Somalia--a multinational peacekeeping force that is supported by the United  At the same time, we have to erode and eliminate the conditions that enable terrorist groups to thrive. That means redoubling our efforts to help stabilize fragile nations. That means supporting good governance, reducing extreme inequality, and helping marginalized, disenfranchised individuals who are preyed upon time and again by terrorist recruiters.  It is more important than ever that we fully fund our international programs that support these efforts, for humanitarian and security reasons. Unfortunately, the administration's 2018 budget proposal does the opposite. It includes a 30-percent cut to programs that seek to bring stability, rule of law, and humanitarian assistance to places that need it the most. The administration's budget is making the world, and us, less safe. And I want to urge the President to rethink his approach to foreign aid.  My colleagues, Senators John McCain and Tim Kaine, put it this way in a recent op-ed they coauthored, saying:       Today, 80 percent of our assistance provides relief and      promotes stability in conflict zones and states on the verge      of collapse. There are U.Agency for International      Development programs in many of the countries most plagued by      terrorism, including Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria, Mali,      Yemen and We're saving lives and creating partners      to help address the instability that produces the threats our      military risks life and limb to fight.  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues and the American people to not forget about the terrible tragedy in I urge everyone to keep Somali victims and other victims of terror acts throughout the world in their thoughts and prayers.  The world needs to know that the United States will continue to support Somalia and other nations that are fighting those who are wreaking havoc on their nations. But we have to remember that we will all be more successful when we combine military efforts with diplomatic and humanitarian ones. While we cannot bring back those who perished, if we focus on rooting out the conditions that give rise to terrorism, we can have a shot at averting the next one.  Thank you.

111,topic-id,639,"Mr.Speaker, today I rise in support of H.3342, the Sanctioning Hizballah's Illicit Use of Civilians as Defenseless Shields  First and foremost, I would like to thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel for their steadfast support of this effort and their broader leadership, not only in the Middle East and as it pertains to rolling back Iran's influence in their terrorist proxies, foremost among them Hezbollah, but also as it pertains to making the case[[Page H8181]]for American leadership in the world, making the case for why American leadership, buttressed by its strong alliances, is a sound investment in our safety here at home.  I would also like to thank my friend and colleague, Tom Suozzi, for his tireless work to make this bill a reality. He and his staff have been a pleasure to work with every step along the way, and I think he is a perfect example of someone who is here and unafraid to reach across the aisle when it comes to doing what is right for the country.  Mr.Speaker, this bill comes at an extremely important time, when Iran and its proxies, such as Hezbollah, are making a concerted push on the ground in the Middle East against the United States, our allies, and our interests.  This isn't a new phenomenon, of course. Since its founding in the early 1980s, Hezbollah has been one of the most dangerous and destructive forces throughout the greater Middle With the exception of al-Qaida, no foreign terrorist organization has killed more Americans than                              {time}  1515  With the support of the Iranian Government and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hezbollah has engaged in a sustained campaign of terrorism and violence, including against the United States and  Congress, along with the United Nations, has repeatedly documented Hezbollah's numerous violations of international law, including employing human shields throughout the 2006 conflict; concealing an arsenal that has grown to over 150,000 missiles and other destabilizing weapons provided by the Syrian and Iranian Governments in southern Lebanon, often beneath civilian infrastructure; and maintaining an armed military force within Lebanon's sovereign territory in direct violation of numerous U.Security Council resolutions, thus preventing Lebanon from exerting its lawful control over its internationally recognized borders.  The State Department designated Hezbollah as a foreign terrorist organization in 1997, leading to the creation of a sanctions regime against the group. Despite these sanctions, Hezbollah has continued to expand its military capabilities due in large part to extensive Iranian financial support. The State Department has continually expressed alarm at Hezbollah's capabilities and influence, describing the group in 2010 as ``the most technically capable terrorist group in the world.'' In 2013, State Department noted the increasing tempo of Hezbollah's terrorist activities.  Despite its extensive track record of terror, Hezbollah has yet to be specifically sanctioned by the United States for its barbaric practice of using defenseless civilians as human shields. The Shields Act finally changes that and finally punishes Hezbollah for these atrocities.  Just a few of the measures included in the Shields Act include: identifying and sanctioning Hezbollah members and those acting on behalf of Hezbollah who are complicit in or responsible for ordering or directing the use of human shields; identifying and sanctioning foreign persons, agencies, or instrumentalities of foreign states who have provided, attempted to provide, or facilitated provision of material support to identified individuals; and invoking financial penalties blocking real estate transactions, and leveraging powers ascribed by the International Emergency Economic Powers  In short and in sum, the Shields Act is a vital and bipartisan bill that advances American interest, punishes those who support and enable the barbaric practice of using human shields, and protects our allies in the region.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this critical legislation, and I thank the chairman again for his help and leadership.

958,topic-id,2158,"Mr.Speaker, an interesting week out ahead. As we begin this week, as we look at the budget for the United States of America, as we look and prepare to deal with the tax cut issue, we really ought to start that discussion with a clear understanding of what our goal is.  I often use this when I talk here on the floor because it is foundational. It is foundational to what I believe we should use to test the various pieces of legislation that come before us. This[[Page H8133]]would certainly be applicable as we look at the question of the Republican budget, which will be on the floor in the next couple of days, perhaps as early as tomorrow, and, of course, the tax cuts beyond.  Here it is. This is from Franklin Delano Roosevelt--This is actually etched into the marble at the memorial for Franklin Delano I came across it one day, and I think it is a very good criteria to judge.  Franklin Delano Roosevelt said: ``The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.''  Using this as the criteria to judge the Republican budget and the upcoming tax reform or tax cuts, we would have to judge both as a miserable failure. We are looking at a situation in which somewhere between $2.5 trillion to $5 trillion of revenue will be removed from the Federal That is about somewhere between $250 billion a year to $500 billion of revenue.  It doesn't mean a thing until you translate that into real programs. Keep in mind that to reduce the revenue of the Federal Government somewhere around $500 billion a year, you would have to remove 80 percent of the total money spent by the Department of Defense in all of the wars and all of the programs that they do in order to make up for that lost revenue.  Alternatively, you would have to reduce almost all of the other discretionary funding. No, we wouldn't build a wall. In fact, we would have to fire all of the immigration authorities. The TSA would no longer be in our airports. There would no longer be any educational programs. There would be no programs dealing with all of the Coast There would be no programs for the Department of Homeland Security or the Department of  $500 billion of reduced revenue is possible as a result of both the budget, as well as the tax proposals that are coming before the House and the Senate in the days ahead. It may be just half that so we don't have to reduce all of those programs.  This is a monumental, critical issue upon which, if we were to use this as the criteria to judge it, we would say: Wait a minute. What about national defense?  Or we would say: Wait a minute. What about all of those programs that are necessary for our children, like the School Lunch Program?  It is critical that we analyze this carefully.  What does it do for the wealthy?  Well, let's take a look at that.  Now, given that the proposals are not yet defined down to the line and the text--but we do know from a general outline of our Speaker's previous proposals when he ran the budget here in the House and when he was the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee; and we have also President Trump's proposal--if it is the Ryan-McConnell-Trump proposal--it is the billionaires-first tax plan. It cuts the taxes for th wealthy. Eighty percent of the $2\1/2\ trillion to $5 trillion reduction winds up in the hands of the top 1 percent of  At the same time, what does it do for the rest of the public?  Well, if you take a look at the detail in the budget that did pass this House and will be up for a vote in the very near future, it reduces Medicare and Medicaid by as much as $2 trillion. So you have got a reduction in revenue to be made up by a $2 trillion cut in Medicaid and  Who receives Medicaid?  Across the United States, it is the working poor, and 60 percent of the total Medicaid budget is for seniors in nursing homes.  So what we have here is a tax policy that cuts the taxes for the wealthiest of America's, the great 1 percent. They get 80 percent of the tax reductions. The rest of the public, 99 percent, will somehow share in the remaining 20 percent of reductions.  Sounds like a bad deal?  It certainly is, if you are to compare that against what Franklin Delano Roosevelt said should be our criteria for judging legislation.  Now, it will be argued that the middle class will receive a tax cut. Well, some, perhaps, but not many. The majority of the middle class will actually receive a tax increase.  How does that happen?  The elimination of the deductions, State and local taxes, and other gimmicks that they have in it. So a family of four making somewhere around $50,000 could see their tax bill increase by as much as 380 percent.  Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What are we talking about here?  We are talking about a tax plan that does not even come close to meeting this criteria of judgment.  Does it do more for the wealthy?  Oh, yes. Oh, yes. We are talking about trillions of dollars of tax reductions for the corporations and the superwealthy.  And what does the rest of the country get for those who have little?  They get even less.  So what we have here, when you consider that they are proposing as much as a $2 trillion reduction in Medicare--we are talking about the healthcare system for seniors--and Medicaid--the healthcare system for, again, seniors in nursing homes--about 60 percent of that money goes to those seniors. The remaining 40 percent goes to the working poor and the poor.  That alone, together with this transfer of the tax reductions for the superwealthy, amount to the largest transfer of wealth ever in any legislation that has been proposed, and hopefully will not pass, but has been proposed in this It is even a greater transfer of wealth than we saw in the effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care  Beware, Be wary. The hucksters are promising something that they are only going to deliver to the superwealthy and to American corporations.  One more point I would like to make here is that often you will hear the argument that cutting corporate taxes will somehow lead to more jobs and that the employees will receive more benefits. Well, it turns out that a cut in corporate tax rates actually comes back to the top 1 percent. They will receive about 34 percent of the tax reductions that go to corporations.  I have heard this argued by our Treasury Secretary, that if we are somehow to cut corporate tax rates, we will see the corporations investing in their workers.  Wouldn't that be great?  So we cut the corporate tax rate from some 35 percent down to 10 percent, or maybe 15 percent, as our President has suggested. All of those reduced taxes will flow to the corporation's bottom line after tax profits will increase, and, wow, they will create jobs, they will pay higher wages.  What are the facts? What are the facts here?  Well, first of all, most of it will not wind up in the pockets of the workers. It will wind up in the top 20 percent of taxpayers, of which 34 percent of that will be the top 1 percent. So, once again, if you look at the corporate tax reductions, it is going to wind up benefiting the wealthy, not the workers.  There is another fact out there. In the 1970s, American corporations would invest about 50 percent--maybe slightly more than 50 percent--in capital improvements, building new factories, expanding the work floor, expanding the workers, workers' wages, benefits, and research and development. It is right there.  If you take a look at the Fortune 500 in the 1970s, well over 50 percent was reinvested in American jobs, American workers, expanding the factory floor, expanding the business, expanding research and development, and growing the corporation.  A remarkable and extremely important thing happened beginning in the 1980s, at about the time of the Reagan tax cuts, and continuing on, and is in place today. That has shifted.  Today, American corporations do not invest in America, they don't invest in new capital, and they don't invest in R&Ninety percent of the after-tax profits in the Fortune 500--most of the Fortune 500, or many of them--wind up in stock buybacks and executive salaries or overseas, not in American jobs.  If you are wondering why the American middle class has seen a flat and actually declining share of the GDP, it is because American corporations have shifted from investing in American jobs, American planting equipment, research and development; and they have shifted into manipulating their stock[[Page H8134]]price by buying back their own stock, using the after-tax profits, some 90 percent of it, for executive salaries and for stock buyback.                              {time}  1830  If you have got 100 stocks out there and they are valued at $10 apiece, you buy back 50 percent of the stock, guess what. You have doubled the stock price. By creating more jobs? By creating more profit. By increasing wages? By R&D? By manipulating your stock price by buying back that stock.  Now, maybe there is somebody who would like to debate this point. Come on down. Let's debate it.  The reality is just as I said. It is laid out there.  Oh, there is another fact. One of America's largest corporations, the CEO said: Not to worry. You reduce my company's tax rate, and I will invest in our workers. I will invest in new plant and equipment.  In the last 8 years, the tax rate for AT&T is about 8 percent--not 35 percent, not 20 percent, not 15 percent, but 8 percent--and yet during that period of time, AT&T laid off 80,000 workers.  So you are going to tell me lowering a major American corporation's tax rate is somehow going to lead to more employment, more jobs? Then tell me why AT&T, that has an effective tax rate of 8 percent over a 7-, 8-year period of time, laid off 80,000 people. So let's argue this point. Let's see what is going on here.  We have before the House of Representatives and the Senate a fundamental question: Are we going to transfer even more wealth to the superwealthy by reducing their taxes and pushing off to the working men and women of America, the middle class, a higher burden?  Along with that, we either increase the deficit by $2.5 trillion or $5 trillion, depending upon how this finalizes--that is the tax reduction; that is the lost revenue to the Federal Government--or are we going to make massive cuts?  I am telling you what our Republican colleagues are promising us. Massive tax cuts for the superwealthy. The top 1 percent will get 80 percent of the tax reduction benefits, the remaining 99 percent of Americans will have to figure out how to share the small remaining 20 percent.  The probability associated with those tax cuts, a significant reduction in programs that serve seniors--Medicaid, in nursing homes, the working poor, the Medicaid expansion program wiped out, Medicare reductions, all of these things--and quite possibly reductions in children's health programs, school programs, school lunch programs, environmental support programs, clean water programs, transportation programs, all the rest. So a tax cut for the wealthy is going to be a burden on American workers.  Once again, if it happens, it will be the largest transfer of wealth from the working men and women of America to the superwealthy, as if we already do not have income inequality in It can be calculated that the income inequality in America today is the greatest it has been in any country for the last 500 years, dating back to when Spain was ripping off the Western Hemisphere taking all the gold, all the silver, anything else they could find, and transferring it to the Spanish Government, to the King and the Queen and their favorite folks. Income inequality is real.  There are many, many pieces of this puzzle that we need to understand. One of them is the way in which certain States that have heavy burdens because they are urbanized States will be particularly impacted by the proposals that we have seen.  Joining me tonight is the Representative from one of those States, New  Mr.Payne, would you like to comment on this extraordinary transfer once again that is in this piece of legislation, the way it harms your State and my State?

960,topic-id,392,"Mr.Payne, thank you so very much. You made a very, very important point, and it is one I know your State and Representatives from your State are very aware of, and we are in  You said that for New Jersey here, you pay $1 in taxes to the Federal Government and you get back 77 cents. It turns out that California is in the same situation. We pay $1. I think we get back somewhere around the same, 70 percent back from the Federal  Similarly, the other States, upper Midwest, this area, Nebraska, Colorado, Minnesota, these States also wind up paying more. Then over here, Illinois and New York, Massachusetts, it looks like, and New Jersey down here, Connecticut, also, these States wind up paying more.  It turns out that the program proposed by the Republicans is to further harm these particular States by taking away--these are high cost They have big populations, and they have expenses that are associated with those large populations.  They, the Republicans, want to eliminate the State and local tax deduction, which, as you said, not only burdens the individuals, but it is going[[Page H8135]]to be seriously harming these particular Already, these States are paying more.  If they are successful, they, the Republicans, are successful in eliminating the State and local taxes, the tax burden on these particular States, the big States, is going to go up, and the benefit will continue to flow to the States with lower populations. And you can see that on this map, because the rest of the Nation is red, meaning they receive more money than they pay in taxes.  So this is a particular problem. I am not going to say this is the only problem because you raised the issue, also, of the top 1 percent getting 80 percent of the tax break, but this is a very interesting map that is really not understood by our colleagues here.  Down here in Alabama and Mississippi, Louisiana, Florida, and so forth, relatively low tax States, they are actually subsidized by the high tax States; and so the elimination of State and local taxes increases the taxes on the high cost States already, who are already paying more than they are getting back from the Federal Government, so their burden is further increased.  We have got a fight on our hands.  ",CREC-2017-10-24-pt1-PgH8132-6.txt,1973,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY BUREAU,2017.0,24.0,October
962,topic-id,2202,"Well, exactly so. This proposal that is going to be before the House very soon will simply make this inequality between the States even worse.  Now, in Texas, this horrible problem down here in Houston, terrible--similarly, with Florida--there will be even greater money flowing to those States that have seen these natural disasters, and so this is probably going to get even more so. If they are successful in doing away with the State and local tax deduction, this will become even more onerous for people in my                              {time}  1845  Frankly, I cannot understand how my Republican colleagues from California could possibly support something that would substantially increase their constituents' taxes. So we will see.  It is an interesting map. I came across it not too long ago, and I think I will use it even more.  I appreciate and thank Mr.Payne for joining us tonight. I am going to keep putting this back up here.  What are we here for?  The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have little.  I am going to toss another thing up here. Included in this Republican program is the elimination of the estate tax.  If you want the wealthy to get even wealthier, then you move forward with the proposal that would shift the tax burden to the working men and women and away from those who are superwealthy. It has been said in an article in The New York Times that our President, under these proposals that he has put forward together with Mr.Ryan and Senator McConnell, that he would receive a billion-dollar reduction in taxes.  We don't have his tax returns so it is hard to say that that is the case, but based upon past tax returns, it appears as though, yeah, one of the beneficiaries of all of this tax reduction is the President and his His Cabinet is made up of some of the wealthiest people in America, and they are not only going to receive a huge tax cut if it were to go forward and as proposed today, the 400 highest income taxpayers whose incomes average more than $300 million a year--and I think that is probably most of the Cabinet, and certainly the President has been in that if he is not there today--that range of income would get an average tax cut of at least $15 million. That is enough for a few rounds of golf.  There is another piece of this puzzle, and I want to put this one up here. We are going to hear a lot of discussion about the estate tax and how somehow the estate tax harms American families, particularly American farmers.  Now, I represent a very large agricultural district, and I said let's do some research and see across the broad breadth of Is it the American farmers that are harmed by the estate tax?  It turns out that, yeah, there are some American farmers that are going to have to pay estate tax. There are 50 of them. There are 50 American farm families that would now be burdened by the current estate tax. Thousands upon thousands, millions of small farmers out there that the estate tax will never even come close to touching. It is $5.6 million of estate value for one, the spouse--another 5,000--so you have got $11.2 million for the family. It turns out it affects, perhaps, 50 families across The estate tax itself really only affects 5,200 families.  When you hear all this talk about the death tax or the estate tax, as it is really called, ask the question: Who does that affect?  Well, it certainly affects at least the President, Mr.It affects the President and many members of his I can think of four right off who would be burdened by having to pay the estate tax. It is about $20 billion a year that is involved here.  So you have got 2.7 million estates of which just two-tenths of 1 percent would actually be affected by the estate tax. So don't get all excited, America, about eliminating the death tax, unless you want to see the programs on which you depend: education, childcare, children school lunch programs--if you are worried about the border, you are worried about the Homeland Security agency and their ability to provide those men and women. So it is about $20 billion a year that would be eliminated from the Federal tax base if the estate tax were to disappear.  If you care at all about income inequality, then you better keep the estate tax. Eliminate the estate tax, then the rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer, and we will see even greater income inequality in the years ahead. So we have got some very heavy lifting to do here over the next couple of weeks.  Before I come back and end this with Franklin Delano Roosevelt, I would just say that the Democrats in this House and in the Senate really want to have tax reform. We want to reform the tax system. We know that the corporate tax rate of 35 percent is the highest in the world, or at least the industrialized world, and it does need to be reduced.  We also know that there are very few corporations that actually pay the 35 percent. They are clearly burdened by a higher tax rate. We want to lower that tax rate. We want to do it in a way that encourages investment in the United States; that we go back to those days in the 1970s and early 1980s, when American corporations actually invested in expanding their business in the United States; that they would invest in capital formation, in plant and equipment, and hiring workers and paying higher wages, and engaging in research and development. There are ways we can do this in corporate tax reform.  For example, we could provide a faster write-off depreciation for investment in American research and development, in American factories, in plant and equipment. We might even structure it in such a way that we would provide an immediate 1-year or 2-year write-off depreciation of capital equipment placed in American factories that was made in If you want to buy Chinese equipment for your factory, well, you are going to have to depreciate that over 15 years.  There are ways in which--some very simple ways in which we can encourage corporations to invest in America by modifying the depreciation schedules. If it is an American-made piece of equipment, a Caterpillar tractor that is[[Page H8136]]manufactured in America, write it off in 1 year.  You want to buy a Kubota manufactured in Japan?  You can write that off in 10 years.  In other words, a positive encouragement for American-made equipment is just one of many examples. As we bring down the corporate tax rate, we build into it very specific things to build the American economy. There are other things, and certainly the wages are part of this, R&D, and all of the other elements. We Democrats want to engage with our Republican colleagues in that kind of tax reform.  On the personal income tax side, yes, we are willing to talk about the tax rates, but we don't want to see the tax cut benefit go to the superwealthy that are already doing extraordinarily well. We want that benefit to go to the working men and women of We can expand their deductibles, and the Republicans are talking about that, but it is done in a limited way. And when you add back into it the elimination of State and local income tax and other things that they are talking about doing, it turns out that a very limited number of middle-income and low-income taxpayers are going to benefit, and many will find their taxes go up. We think that is wrong.  As we look at this on the personal income tax side, we want to make sure that we are able to structure those personal income tax changes in such a way as to simplify, absolutely, and eliminate a lot of scurrilous deductions that only benefit the rich and the wealthy, and come to a program that is simpler, more straightforward, and really benefits the great American middle class, or as the President likes to say, let's make the middle class great again. We can do that through tax policy. That is what we want to do.  I am telling you where we are headed today. We are headed today in a program in which our Republican colleagues are going to ignore our Democratic participation in this democracy, and they are going to ram through their own version of tax reform, which is simply a monumental tax decrease for American corporations, many of which are offshoring jobs. I can come back to that in a moment, and the high-income Americans as their taxes are reduced and their estate tax is eliminated. We think that is wrong, but they are not asking us how we can work together. They are not asking us to work with them.  They have structured it through the budget deal that they can do it with 51 votes in the Senate, totally ignoring the Democratic Senators, and here in the House of Representatives, following a tradition that has been underway for several years now of simply writing a tax bill on their own, writing a repeal on their own, and ignoring the Democrats who we believe have a better deal for  We believe that there is a better deal, that we can increase American pay by writing a corporate Tax Code that encourages investment in America, that encourages investment in workers, in worker training, worker preparation, and all the technical skills that a modern American economy needs. Yes, we do know there is a better way in writing the Tax We also know that we can write a Tax Code that would lower the cost for those American corporations, businesses, and farmers who are investing in I have given some of those ideas already here a moment ago.  Finally, we know that there is a better deal for Americans when we provide the tools for the 21st century, and this has to do with those tools of training and retraining so that the American workers are prepared to take the jobs that are out there.  How do you repair that robot that has replaced you on the manufacturing floor? How do you repair it? How do you program it?  That is a skill set that Americans are going to need.  In my area, we have pharmaceutical companies that are technologically driven. Their laboratories need to be staffed by American workers who understand the intricacies of biology and the biotechnical industry, which is emerging in my district and in That is a skill set.  We know that there is a better deal for We know that there is a better way for tax reform. We know that there is a necessity in America to build the infrastructure, the foundation of economic growth. But we also know that if our Republican friends are successful in reducing Federal revenues by somewhere between $2.5 trillion to $5 trillion, this is their proposal, revenues reduced by that, we will not have money for training American workers. We will not have money for the infrastructure investments, which are necessary to repair our bridges, build our roads, our airports and the like so that we have a foundation upon which the economy will grow. We know that.  We have to persuade our Republican colleagues, so we are going to have to rely on the American people, just as we relied upon you when the repeal and replace legislation was before the House of Representatives and the  The American public said: Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. This is a bad deal, not a better deal, but a bad deal for  So the tax reform or the tax cuts that are before us in the next weeks--the next 4 weeks--are a bad deal for Americans, and we are going to have to rely upon the American public becoming aware of what is going on here in Washington, and then speaking out and saying: No, no. Time out, folks. You are not going to screw us again. You are not going to do that again. We don't want the wealthy to get wealthier while we get poorer.  So the American public, I would expect, will say, ``No, no way,'' just as they did when the great repeal and replace legislation was before Congress just a month ago.  Mr.Speaker, I have covered the issue for the night, but I want us all to remember that the test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is, rather, whether we provide enough for those who have too little. It is etched in the monument and the marble of the FDR Memorial, and it is a pretty good test of our progress here.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-24-pt1-PgH8132-6.txt,1973,PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR,2017.0,24.0,October
752,topic-id,1063,"Mr.President, I come to the floor this afternoon to talk about the Healthcare Tax Relief Act, legislation I introduced to delay the health insurance tax that was created by the Affordable Care  This tax is often referred to as the HIT tax. The HIT tax imposes fees on health insurance coverage to consumers. It is a pretty simple business concept that this HIT tax results in. If a fee increases on an insurance policy and the fee goes up--there is a fee charged to the company that issues this insurance policy--then that fee gets passed on to the consumer. It is the consumer, then, who pays the fee in the form of higher health insurance costs.  As is the case with most excise taxes, whether it is an excise tax on food or beverage or any other item of personal good, if this health insurance tax takes effect, costs will be passed on to consumers directly in the form of higher premiums. That is confirmed by the Congressional Budget  This is one of the cost drivers that was built into the Affordable Care This health insurance tax would directly increase the premiums of the consumer's insurance product. This tax was supposed to begin a few years back in 2014. It was going to start at $8 billion, and by 2018 the tax would reach $14.3 billion. However, Congress recognized that this tax was going to have a significant impact on the price of coverage and, as a result, suspended the tax from taking effect in 2017. Without congressional action to delay or stop or prevent this ObamaCare tax from taking place again, this tax will take effect in 2018.  According to nonpartisan actuarial analysis conducted by Oliver Wyman,[[Page S6803]]an estimated 157 million Americans will be affected by this massive tax. Even more middle-income earners across this country, 157 million Americans and working Americans, are expected to shoulder the weight of this tax.  Oliver Wyman estimated that premiums will rise by 3 percent in each year; 2018, 2019, and 2020. That is 3 percent each year. That is 9 percent over 3 years.  To put this in simple perspective, in Colorado alone, premiums in the individual market rose by 34 percent from plan year 2017 to plan year 2018. Adding an additional 3 percent every year for those 3 years would leave those on the individual market paying nearly 43.3 percent, on average, more year to year if combined with the 2018 increases at the end of that 3-year, 9-percent increase run.  What is more, according to the Department of Health and Human Services, the average individual market premiums have increased by 105 percent from 2013 to 2017. Think about that. When the Affordable Care Act passed, when ObamaCare was passed, a promise was made that the average family would see a decrease in their healthcare costs of $2,500 per family, but, instead, from 2013 to 2017, they saw a 105-percent increase in costs. If the health insurance tax takes effect, as planned by ObamaCare, then we would see another 9-percent increase over the next several years on top of that.  Without congressional action to delay this tax, estimates show that costs will rise between $200 and $300 annually for individuals and $500 annually for families. That is a $200 to $300 increase for individuals and a $500 increase annually for families.  To put that into some perspective, 25 percent of Americans don't have access--emergency access--to $100. In an emergency, 25 percent of Americans don't have immediate access to $100. Yet here we are talking about a mandated law--you have to have insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act--but this law would then increase costs $200 to $300 on an individual and $500 annually for families.  Statistics from the Federal Reserve show how much of a hardship this would create. The Federal Reserve found that 46 percent of Americans did not have enough money to cover a $400 emergency expense. Yet the ObamaCare HIT tax would increase family insurance costs by $500. Forty-six percent of Americans don't have access to $400 in an emergency. Yet the ObamaCare HIT tax would increase it by $500.  This tax has the potential to push over half of Americans into financial ruin, and it would be negligent for Congress to allow this tax to take effect. The financial threat this tax imposes on hard-working families is a far cry from that bold promise that was made to reduce costs by $2,500 per family--one of the biggest Pinocchios, so to speak, of the Affordable Care At a time when we know that almost half of Americans could not shoulder a $400 emergency expense, it would simply be irresponsible to allow this ObamaCare HIT tax to take effect.  Furthermore, the impacts of this tax touch our seniors who have earned their benefits as well. For seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans--and Medicare Advantage is one of the most popular aspects of Medicare--premiums are expected to rise by roughly $370 a year per enrollee if Congress doesn't find a resolution. In many cases, these are fixed-income individuals who would see their premiums increase $370 a year because of the ObamaCare HIT tax.  In addition, seniors enrolled in Medicare Part D prescription drug plans can expect their premiums to increase as well. Hit them on their Medicare plans and hit them on the prescription drug plans--higher costs due to this ObamaCare HIT tax.  Even more, the impacts of the health insurance tax have large-scale consequences in the workplace as well. A study by the National Federation of Independent Business found that allowing the HIT tax to take effect could result in job losses for as many as 283,000 people by 2023. This tax could have the impact of costing 286,000 jobs by 2023. Research and analysis from our most respected actuaries continue to validate the negative consequences of the health insurance tax.  On behalf of all hard-working Americans, I call upon my colleagues in the Senate to join me in cosponsoring this commonsense piece of legislation, the Healthcare Tax Relief Healthcare plans are being finalized right now for the 2018 rate year, and it is urgent for Congress to take action so that consumers are not saddled with yet one more cost that they can't afford.

While I hold Mr.Rohrabacher in great esteem, I would submit that they haven't degenerated, because that implies at some point that Hezbollah didn't engage in such reprehensible behavior.  So the bipartisan actions led by Ranking Member Engel and Chairman Royce today bring us to where, indeed, we need to be by virtue of the reality of the world in which we live. Hezbollah does not exist but for the largess of Iran and the monies funneled by the Iranian regime.  The Hezbollah missiles, which Member Frankel eloquently spoke of, are, indeed, Iranian missiles, and the ICBMs that Iran is developing that we seek to curtail stem from a failure to include a prohibition on ICBM development in the JCPOA under which this Congress and this administration now labor.  I would note for the Record, for the Members, and for those who might be viewing at home that U.Security Council Resolution 1929 of 2010, which included signatures from the Russians and the Chinese, said that Iran was forbidden from engaging in missile development.

As one of Montana's foremost political scientists, Craig Wilson was well known across the State and across both sides of the aisle.  For 34 years, Professor Wilson spent his days in front of students in a classroom at Montana State University Billings, helping them understand the world in which they lived.  He conducted reliable and respected surveys that engaged Montanans on issues that mattered most to them. His method was honest and straightforward, a welcome approach in today's politics.  Craig was a loving husband to Kristianne, a proud father of Collin and Evan, and a doting grandfather to Blair and  Wilson was an educator in and out of the classroom. He was dearly loved and will be missed.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-25-pt1-PgH8209-2.txt,99999999999999,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY BUREAU,2017.0,25.0,October
63,topic-id,6739,"Mr.Speaker, I do greatly appreciate my friend across the aisle. Mr.Garamendi made some good points. For example, the people speak, and we are thankful they do. And that is why, when the Democratic House Members and Democratic Senate Members voted to pass something known as ObamaCare--it is hard to call it the Affordable Care Act because it has come at the cost of some people's lives, their doctors, their insurance policies, their medicines they needed--but the American people did speak, and they said, ``Not again,'' and they put Democrats out of the majority as a result of that bill.  As I explained to some of my colleagues in the Republican Conference who were saying that the Speaker is the one who got us the majority back, I pointed out in conference, if you look at the polls, it is very clear. No one person got us the majority back in November 2010. The Democrats got the Republicans the majority back.  The polls back then showed that we were not trusted any more than we had been so much in the past, as they were, the voters were just upset with the Democrats passing a bill they didn't want, that the Democrats had not read, and didn't know what it said, and they were going to have to pass it to find out what was in it.  And they were lied to repeatedly. You can keep your insurance if you like it. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor, and all those. Turns out they knew in advance--not all of the people here, but the people in the Obama administration who kept saying it, they knew they were lying because they knew people would not keep their insurance whether they liked it or not; they would not keep their doctors if they liked them as they may well not be in the network and probably wouldn't be in many networks.  So it is so true that the people speak, and thank goodness they do. And then they have returned, not only Republicans to majorities in the House, repeatedly, on the promise of repealing[[Page H8137]]ObamaCare, but also gave the Senate the majority twice now on the promise to repeal ObamaCare and, unfortunately, the Senate has not delivered.  We passed a bill here in the House, it was after much wailing and gnashing of teeth, and a terrible bill at first that would have allowed premiums to continue to go up. Some say, yeah, but you should have voted for it; it would give the President some wind at his back.  But when the American people found out that premiums were going to continue to go up, their deductibles would continue to go up, the insurance companies would continue to get bailouts after record profit years, they were not going to be returning Republicans to the majority.  So it is still very critical that we keep our promises and we take a lesson from the actual planks of the platform that got our great President elected: number one, build a wall and secure the border; number two, repeal ObamaCare; number three, we would have tax reform. Those seem to be the three biggest promises that most all of us made on our side of the aisle.  The reason ObamaCare was not, at least the majority of it, repealed was because the Senate could not bring itself to act because there were some Senators who decided that, after winning their election, promising in the primary and general election that if you elect me, I will be the one who can get ObamaCare repealed, they decided to break that pledge, break that repeated promise.  So the thing I am grateful to the President--well, actually a number of things, but one is that he continues to say: We are not done. We are not through. We are going to repeal at least most of  We have got to. People have got to have relief. They have got to. They cannot continue on like they are.  Obviously, we can see now, in hindsight, ObamaCare was designed to fail. Unfortunately, the insurance companies did not realize that when they signed on to ObamaCare, they were signing on to their death warrants; that the designers were counting on insurance companies to have people at the top who were so overwhelmed with greed they would not see the end coming as it came barreling toward them. They would be busy making record profits, getting bailouts, until the American people said we can't stand it anymore. The insurance companies had record profits and still got bailed out.  We never thought we would say this, but surely the government would be better than these greedy insurance companies; and that would be the end of the insurance companies.  And sure, some of the insurance executives would have taken their golden parachute and their millions after record profits and dropped out before the industry that made them rich ceased to exist, but that day is still coming if we don't act; and the American people would then be resolved to have much worse healthcare than the VA because the government would be the only game in town.  I know, from talking to one legislator in England, I was surprised. I thought everybody was mandated to be part of the government healthcare there. And it was true, but he said that his wife had had cancer, and, fortunately for them, they could afford to pay the private insurance above the ridiculously wasteful insurance the Britons have.  I remember looking at the numbers back in 2010, when we were debating ObamaCare, and seeing at that time that someone who was diagnosed with breast cancer at a similar time in the staging of cancer, breast cancer, as someone in the U.S., as someone in England, that the American had a 20 percent better chance of surviving than the British citizen under British healthcare did. That is terrifying to some of us. We don't want the kind of healthcare England has.  So if you have a wife and three daughters, like I do, the chances are much better that you will lose one of them if you have British-type healthcare.  I have one guy from Tyler, who lives in Tyler, was from Canada originally, said, his father was put on the list to have bypass surgery in Canada, and after 2 years of waiting, he died. It kind of sounds like the VA and the problems that have been experienced by some of our veterans.  But I would submit, if those who have laid down much of their lives for their country in our armed services are treated the way many of our veterans have been treated, then you can't expect that American citizens that have never offered to lay down their life for their country would be treated much better.  We need to get off the track we are on. We need to return healthcare back to the control of a patient and a doctor, and get the insurance companies and the government out from between the patient and the doctor. We can do that with the kind of thing the President has been talking about, health savings accounts.  Instead of paying $1,000 a month to an insurance company, put $800 or $900 in a health savings account; start building this huge healthcare, health savings account. And sure, there will be some people who are chronically ill or chronically poor. Those who don't have to be chronically poor, that could work, as we found out when welfare reform took place in the mid-nineties by the first Republican majority in many decades; as they found out, statistics showed, and there is a graph I saw at a conference in Harvard, for the first time since welfare began, 1995, after the work requirement kicked in for welfare, up through 2005, single moms' income, when adjusted for inflation, for the first time since welfare began, had an increase--that was incredible--when the government encouraged individuals to reach their potential, instead of luring them away from their potential with welfare when they could have had a job, that people do a lot better.  It is terribly unfortunate, though, that the lessons learned in the mid-nineties, including getting to balanced budgets, over the objections of the Clinton administration. President Clinton didn't want balanced budgets, but, eventually, the Republican Congress forced him when they had enough to override his veto, so he signed them.  And now, all these years later, when people don't remember, President Clinton likes to take credit for having the first balanced budget in years. Well, the Republicans took him, figuratively, kicking and screaming and, obviously, now, he is proud that they did, though they don't get the credit for it.  Well, we need to encourage people to reach their potential--that is the job of government--not luring them away from their potential. We should be encouraging the best healthcare that could be had.  We don't need insurance companies managing all our healthcare. We don't need the government managing all our healthcare. We need individuals managing their own healthcare.  If somebody wants to volunteer and say, ``Here's all my income for the rest of my life. Government, you manage, tell me what I can have and not have in the way of surgeries or healthcare or medicine,'' well, we ought to make a place for them to do that. But for the rest of us who would rather make our own decisions about our healthcare, we could do that.  But one of the things, and I put it in the bill that I filed back in 2009--I was encouraged by former Speaker Newt Gingrich, and he said: You have got to put your ideas into a bill, get it scored.  CBO refused to score it for many months. Former Speaker Gingrich thought if I had gotten it scored, that it could have changed the debate on healthcare.  But CBO dutifully did the bidding of Speaker Pelosi, scored their bills, refused to score mine, and so we didn't have the score.  And let's face it. CBO, on ObamaCare scoring, their margin of error apparently is somewhere, plus or minus, 250 to 400 percent; so why should they score anything anyway? But that is another matter.  But if the health insurance companies and the government don't manage all our healthcare, who would do that? Well, we would do that. If somebody's chronically poor and cannot provide for themselves, we can help them. But for those who can, they should.  If you put that kind of money in a health savings account, where it can never be used for anything but healthcare, not like retirement, where you can pull it out and pay a 40 percent tax, leave it in there. It can only be used for healthcare.  Give the individual a debit card that is coded that will only pay for medical[[Page H8138]]expenses, medicine, crutches, doctors' appointments. Then most people would have enough built up in their health savings account by the time they are 65 or 70, they not only would not want government participation in decisions about their healthcare, but they wouldn't need it, and we could make our own decisions, after consulting with physicians. That saves healthcare.  The last 100 years of healthcare, some medical historians say, have been the only 100 years in American history where people had a better chance of getting well after seeing a doctor than of getting worse.                              {time}  1915  Even just over 200 years ago, the man without whom there would be no free America, George Washington, he was bled to death. The last bleeder was his very good friend, Craik, who had been with him through so many things. He thought he was helping him, and he was bleeding him to death, preventing him from getting well.  But here, 200 years later, doctors are actually curing disease, curing things we thought were incurable. We had the best healthcare that could ever been found at any time in history anywhere in the world, and we have done a great deal to destroy it since the passing of  People have found out they lost their insurance. They are paying more than they ever dreamed they would pay. And, yes, there are some who are paying minimal amounts, and some are getting subsidies, but the President had to make up some law in order to pay out some of the things he did.  Because of all of the distraction with ObamaCare, perhaps that is why the Obama administration dropped the ball on following through regarding Russia's efforts to sidetrack American politics.  This article from John Solomon and Alison Spann, October 22, in The Hill: ``FBI Watched, Then Acted As Russian Spy Moved Closer to Hillary Clinton.''  It says: ``As Hillary Clinton was beginning her job as President Obama's chief diplomat, Federal agents observed as multiple arms of Vladimir Putin's machine unleashed an influence campaign designed to win access to the new Secretary of State, her husband, Bill Clinton, and members of their inner circle, according to interviews and once-sealed FBI records.  ``Some of the activities FBI agents gathered evidence about in 2009 and 2010 were covert and illegal.  ``A female Russian spy posing as an American accountant, for instance, used a false identity to burrow her way into the employ of a major Democratic donor in hopes of gaining intelligence on Hillary Clinton's Department, records show. The spy was arrested and deported as she moved closer to getting inside State, agents said.  ``Other activities were perfectly legal and sitting in plain view, such as when a subsidiary of Russia's state-controlled nuclear energy company hired a Washington firm to lobby the Obama administration. At the time it was hired, the firm was providing hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in pro bono support to Bill Clinton's global charitable initiative, and it legally helped the Russian company secure Federal decisions that led to billions in new U.commercial nuclear business, records show.  ``Agents were surprised by the timing and size of a $500,000 check that a Kremlin-linked bank provided Bill Clinton''--that is the former President, and although none of the mainstream media would ever say this, Democrat Bill Clinton--``with for a single speech in the summer of 2010. The payday came just weeks after Hillary Clinton helped arrange for American executives to travel to Moscow to support Putin's efforts to build his own country's version of Silicon Valley, agents said.  ``There is no evidence in any of the public records that the FBI believed that the Clintons or anyone close to them did anything illegal.''  Yeah, that is pretty understandable that The Hill would say that and that the FBI would make sure those records were not available.  The article goes on. It says: ``But there's definitive evidence the Russians were seeking their influence with a specific eye on the State  `` `There is not one shred of doubt from the evidence that we had that the Russians had set their sights on Hillary Clinton's circle, because she was the quarterback of the Obama-Russia reset strategy and the assumed successor to Obama as President,' said a source familiar with the FBI's evidence at the time. . . .''  ``That source pointed to an October 2009 communication intercepted by the FBI in which Russian handlers instructed two of their spies specifically to gather nonpublic information on the State  `` `Send more info on current international affairs vital for R., highlight U.approach,' part of the message to the spies read, using the country's first initial to refer to ` . . . Try to single out tidbits unknown publicly but revealed in private by sources closer to State Department, government, major think tanks.' ''  This isn't in the article, but that might also mean, if the State Department Secretary had a server through which classified information was sent and it is not very well protected, gee, grab all of the information from that server that you can. Shouldn't be hard to hack them. That had to have been part of the thinking of the They surely figured out that Secretary of State Clinton was using different sources for her emails.  The article goes on: ``The Clintons, by that time, had set up several new vehicles that included a multimillion-dollar speechmaking business, the family foundation, and a global charitable initiative, all of which proved attractive to the Russians as Hillary Clinton took over  `` `In the end, some of this just comes down to what it always does in Washington: donations, lobbying, contracts, and influence--even for Russia,' said Frank Figliuzzi, former FBI assistant director for counterintelligence.  ``Figliuzzi supervised the post-arrest declassification and release of records from a 10-year operation that unmasked a major Russian spy ring in 2010. It was one of the most important U.counterintelligence victories against Russia in history, and famous for nabbing the glamorous spy-turned-model Anna  ``While Chapman dominated the headlines surrounding that spy ring, another Russian woman posing as a mundane New Jersey accountant named Cynthia Murphy was closing in on accessing Secretary Clinton's Department, according to records and interviews.  ``For most of the 10 years, the ring of Russian spies that included Chapman and Murphy acted as sleepers, spending a `great deal of time collecting information and passing it on' to their handlers inside Russia's SVR spy agency, FBI record state.''  Inserting parenthetically here, also, we now know, due to the great investigating work of Luke Rosiak with The Daily Caller, who apparently has done much more investigation into Imran Awan, the Awan family, and IT or computer workers, some of whom apparently didn't do any work but who were making the maximum amount of money that anybody can make working on the Hill for Congress, as I believe Luke testified or indicated in a prior meeting, he indicated that actually every time one of the Awan family added enough part-time work for Members of Congress with their computers, they would add another family member to start getting part-time until they built up to the $160,000 or so level.  But in any event, we now know that, apparently, Imran Awan copied dozens of Democratic Members of Congress' servers into one place so that all of those servers could easily be accessed by someone who did not have permission to access those Congress Members' computer systems and servers.  It is interesting that that was occurring for him as a Pakistani native. He became a citizen but, at the time he began working on Capitol Hill, was here by visa working for Members, Democratic Members of  But how interesting that the Russians were doing everything they could to get any information, not just classified, but any inside information, stuff like you would find in emails, for example. And now we are finding all of this out about the Awan brothers, and his wife and a couple of people, one of whom quit because he was doing too much of the work and not getting as much pay as the others.  But it is incredible that it was after President Obama left office we started[[Page H8139]]hearing all of this screaming about how the Russians were trying to affect elections. And who knew about that? Well, Robert Mueller, former FBI Director knew all about it because he was the FBI as this stuff was being investigated. Wouldn't it be nice if he had said something about that previously?  But if he had talked about it previously, he might not--and I am sure, in fact, would not--have gotten an appointment to be special counsel to investigate potential ties by the U.Government with Russia, specifically, the Trump campaign, or the Trump support ring, those who were supporting Donald Trump as a candidate.  But then again, Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein might have appointed Mueller, because it turns out he was involved in the investigation back then. Wouldn't it have been nice if Rosenstein or Mueller had had the moral fiber and the ethical fiber to say: ``You know what? The AG has recused himself, but, actually, I was involved in this stuff back under the Obama administration investigating all this, and I had developed opinions, made statements back in those days--weren't public.''  And if Mueller had done the same thing: ``I was head of the We were investigating ties to Hillary Clinton, efforts to get in touch with and utilize the Clinton Foundation, Hillary Clinton.''  Wouldn't it have been nice if that information had come from Robert Mueller or Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein before Rosenstein appointed Mueller, because those two people would not even be involved at all, I don't believe, had we known the extent of their involvement in the investigation into Russia before, when they were with the Obama administration. But they didn't disclose that.  And I think it is a little insidious, myself, on the very day that James Comey testified on Capitol Hill that there were no known ties between President Trump and the Russians, the collusion that was talked about, there were no ties, no evidence of that, it was the same day it was leaked, apparently by Mueller or his staff, that now they were investigating obstruction by the Trump administration.  Now, why would that get leaked the very night that James Comey testified there were no known ties, no evidence of any collusion between President Trump and the Russians? Well, because if there was no evidence to support what Mueller had been appointed to investigate, then President Trump would have had every right and it would have made sense to say: ``Okay, Mr.Mueller, it sure would have been nice if you had disclosed the reasons that you should have been disqualified to accept this special counsel job. But even though you didn't, there is no reason for you to be special counsel because there is no evidence, according to this FBI Director, so we don't need you anymore.''                              {time}  1930  But by Mueller or his clan leaking out that now we are investigating President Trump for obstruction of justice, that set him up in a position that President Trump could not afford to fire him, or else it would look like Nixon's Saturday Night Massacre before they had a chance to come after him. So, clearly, former FBI Director Mueller who, in my opinion, did more damage to the structure of the FBI than anyone since Edgar Hoover, ran off thousands of years of experience from the FBI and spent millions of dollars on programs that didn't work out. Apparently he got rid of a lot of people that would not say yes to him all the time. He also--let's give him credit--he did purge the FBI training materials of anything that offended radical  I would submit there is a reason why when an FBI agent was finally sent out to talk to the older Tsarnaev brother after Russia had reported twice--actually doing America a favor--hey, this guy has been radicalized. Do they look at where he had been to see that he had been in areas that were very radical and what he was like?  They sent out an FBI agent to talk to him. According to Director Mueller, in essence, he indicated he was not a terrorist, so that was good enough for them. But they went the extra mile and asked his mother if he was a terrorist, and, in essence, she indicated he was a good boy and not a terrorist. That was good enough for the new Mueller FBI that had purged itself of the ability to know what a radical Islamist looked like.  When I asked about their going out to the mosque to investigate whether Tsarnaev had been radicalized, of course, again, they purged their training materials, they didn't know what to ask. They didn't know whether to ask if he had been memorizing verses of the Koran, what verses those were. Kim Jensen, who had a 700-page program to teach FBI agents about what to look for in radical Islamists, under Mueller, was ordered to destroy all of those. Fortunately, there was an extra copy. As I understand it, the FBI is now trying to teach some of the higher-level agents exactly what a radical Islamist is. But if Mr.McMaster has his way, that won't last much longer.  But, nonetheless, Director Mueller, as head of the FBI, as one intelligence official told me, they were blinded of the ability to see the enemy--the enemy being radical Islamists who want to destroy our Nation, destroy our freedom, and kill us. They don't know what to look for, thanks to Director  Of course, as the Washingtonian article pointed out in 2013, basically Mueller and Comey were joined at the hip, that if the world was on fire, Mueller would be the last one standing beside Comey, protecting him, with him, supporting him, whatever. Which, by the way, is another reason, if Mr.Mueller had been as ethical and moral as he should have been, he should have disclosed immediately: I can't accept this special counsel role because James Comey is a friend. He sees me as a mentor. We talked, including about his testimony he was going to give before We are just too close, and he is a central witness to all of this. I can't do it.  Unfortunately, Director Mueller did not take that position not feeling that he needed to do that, because, after all, it is a great job. It pays a lot of money. He can hire anybody he wants to and hire good Democratic supporters, as he has. For people who hate Republicans, this will be a great job. Apparently it is. He just basically makes up whatever he wants to investigate anytime he sees fit, and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein should have been disqualified and not been able to appoint special counsel had the Attorney General known what all he had been involved in previously. He certainly is not going to fire Mueller, as he should.  Going over to a different article, this is from National Review by Andrew McCarthy, October 21. Andrew McCarthy is the former prosecutor of The Blind Sheikh that masterminded the first World Trade Center attack in 1993 during Democrat Bill Clinton's  Andrew McCarthy says: ``Not only the Clintons are implicated in a uranium deal with the Russians that compromised national security interests. Let's put the Uranium One scandal in perspective: the cool half-million bucks the Putin regime funneled to Bill Clinton was five times the amount it spent on those Facebook ads--the ones the media-Democrat complex ludicrously suggests swung the 2016 Presidential election to Donald The Facebook-ad buy, which started in June 2015--before Donald Trump entered the race--was more leftwing agitprop, ads pushing hysteria on racism, immigration, guns, et cetera, than electioneering. The Clintons' own longtime political strategist Mark Penn estimates that just $6,500 went to actual electioneering. You read that right: $6,500. By contrast, the staggering $500,000 payday from a Kremlin-tied Russian bank for a single speech was part of a multimillion-dollar influence-peddling scheme to enrich the former President and his wife, then-Secretary of State Hillary At the time, Russia was plotting--successfully--to secure U.Government approval for its acquisition of Uranium One, and with it, tens of billions of dollars in U.uranium reserves.  ``Here is the kicker: the Uranium One scandal is not only, or even principally, a Clinton scandal. It is an Obama administration scandal. The Clintons were just doing what the Clintons do: cashing in on their `public service.' The Obama administration, with Secretary Clinton at the forefront but hardly alone, was knowingly compromising American national security interests.[[Page H8140]]The administration green-lighted the transfer of control over one-fifth of American uranium mining capacity to Russia, a hostile regime--and specifically to Russia's state-controlled nuclear-energy conglomerate, Worse, at the time the administration approved the transfer, it knew that Rosatom's American subsidiary was engaged in a lucrative racketeering enterprise that had already committed felony extortion, fraud, and money-laundering offenses.''  It is not in the article, but it does raise the question: Gee, I wonder if the Obama administration or Director Mueller of the FBI, knowing all these things apparently, did anybody bother to tell Secretary Clinto about the situation and that the entity that they were being courted by was actually tied to felony extortion, fraud, and money-laundering offenses?  I thought the Obama administration was pretty close-knit. It seemed like they would have surely told Secretary of State Clinton who had access to classified information. We know because she put it on her server that wasn't classified.  But it looks like somebody would have told the Secretary of State: Hey, this outfit that is courting you has ties to the people paying your husband half a million dollars for one speech, paying $145 million or so to the Clinton Foundation, these folks are bad folks.  Surely somebody in the Obama administration would have told them. Well, we don't know, and, certainly, Director Muller is not going to investigate any inappropriate actions that he or James Comey or Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein took or didn't take.  The article goes on to say: ``The Obama administration also knew that congressional Republicans were trying to stop the transfer. Consequently, the Justice Department concealed what it knew.''  That being from congressional Republicans who were trying to stop the transfer.  In fact, ``the DOJ allowed the racketeering enterprise to continue compromising the American uranium industry rather than commencing a prosecution that would have scotched the transfer. Prosecutors waited 4 years before quietly pleading the case out for a song, in violation of Justice Department charging guidelines. Meanwhile, the administration stonewalled Congress, reportedly threatening an informant who wanted to go public.  ``Obama's `reset,' to understand what happened here, we need to go back to the beginning. The first-tier military arsenal of Putin's Russia belies its status as a third-rate economic power. For well over a decade, the regime has thus sought to develop and exploit its capacity as a nuclear-energy producer. Naively viewing Russia as a `strategic partner' rather than a malevolent competitor, the Bush administration made a nuclear-cooperation agreement with the Kremlin in May of 2008.  ``That blunder, however, was tabled before Congress could consider it. That is because Russia, being Russia, invaded In 2009, notwithstanding this aggression, which continues to this day with Russia's occupation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton signaled the new administration's determination to `reset' relations with In this reset, renewed cooperation and commerce in nuclear energy would be central. There had been such cooperation and commerce since the Soviet Union imploded. In 1992, the administration of President George Bush agreed with the nascent Russian Federation that U.nuclear providers would be permitted to purchase uranium from Russia's disassembled nuclear warheads, after it had been down-blended from its highly enriched weapons-grade level.  ``The Russian commercial agent responsible for the sale and transportation of this uranium to the U.is the Kremlin-controlled company `Tenex,' formally, JSC Tenex is a subsidiary of Tenex, and by extension, Rosatom, have an American arm called `Tenam USA.' Tenam is based in Bethesda, Around the time President Obama came to power, the Russian official in charge of Tenam was Vadim The Obama administration reportedly issued a visa for Mikerin in 2010, but a racketeering investigation led by the FBI determined that he was already operating here in 2009. The racketeering scheme as Tenam's general director, Mikerin was responsible for arranging and managing Rosatom/Tenex's contracts with American uranium purchasers.  ``This gave him tremendous leverage over the U.companies. With the assistance of several confederates, Mikerin used this leverage to extort and defraud the U.contractors into paying inflated prices for uranium. They then laundered the proceeds through shell companies and secret bank accounts in Latvia, Cyprus, Switzerland, and the Seychelle Islands--though sometimes transactions were handled in cash, with the skim divided into envelopes stuffed with thousands of dollars in cash. The inflated payments served two purposes: they enriched Kremlin-connected energy officials in the U.and in Russia to the tune of millions of dollars; and they compromised the American companies that paid the bribes, rendering players in U.nuclear energy--a sector critical to national security--vulnerable to blackmail by But Mikerin had a problem.  ``To further the Kremlin's push for nuclear-energy expansion, he had been seeking to retain a lobbyist--from whom he planned to extort kickbacks, just as he did with the U.energy companies. With the help of an associate connected to Russian organized-crime groups, Mikerin found his lobbyist. The man's name has not been disclosed, but we know he is now represented by Victoria Toensing, a well-respected Washington lawyer, formerly a Federal prosecutor and counsel to the Senate Intelligence                              {time}  1945  ``When Mikerin solicited him in 2009, the lobbyist was uncomfortable, worried that the proposal would land him on the wrong side of the law. So he contacted the FBI to reveal what he knew. From then on, the Bureau and Justice Department permitted him to participate in the Russian racketeering scheme as a `confidential source'--and he is thus known as `CS-1' in affidavits the government, years later, presented to Federal court in order to obtain search and arrest warrants. At the time this unidentified man became an informant, the FBI was led by Director Robert Mueller, who is now the special counsel investigating whether Trump colluded with Russia,'' which we keep hearing there is no evidence of.  ``The investigation was centered in Maryland, Tenam's home base. There, the U.Attorney was Obama appointee Rod Rosenstein--now President Trump's Deputy Attorney General, and the man who appointed Mueller as special counsel to investigate  ``Because of CS-1, the FBI was able to understand and monitor the racketeering enterprise almost from the start. By mid-May 2010, it could already prove the scheme and three separate extortionate payments Mikerin had squeezed out of the informant.  ``Equally important: According to reporting by John Solomon and Alison Spann in The Hill''--which we were just speaking about--``the informant learned through conversations with Mikerin and others that Russian nuclear officials were trying to ingratiate themselves with the Clintons.''  It goes on and on, Mr.Speaker, but it is clear this definitely needs investigation. It needs investigation as to the propriety of the actions of Robert Mueller, FBI It needs investigation into the propriety of the actions by Deputy Attorney General Rod  We need a special counsel. If the current Attorney General considers himself recused, there is only one person who has the power to make that appointment, and that is the President of the United States, from whom the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein derive their power to appoint special counsel.  The President needs to appoint somebody to investigate this mess, because I guess former Secretary Clinton knew with authority when she said the Russians were clearly trying to hack and to influence this election. Yes, they sure were.  It appears they were doing more to influence the Clintons and the Obama administration than they were even the American people: $500,000 to Bill Clinton himself and only $6,500 to the[[Page H8141]]ads to try to affect the American people.  So this really does need to be investigated. I know Congress really hasn't gotten into it in any depth, but if Congress is to do that, it has got to take a page out of Judicial Watch's notebook, and that is you have got to be willing to go to court and demand people produce evidence, produce people.  We can't just continue to be obstructed the way we have allowed the IRS Director to do after he has obfuscated, lied to Congress, and I believe perjured himself, after Lois Lerner appears certainly to have committed crimes, to me, and we have let her get away with such apparent criminal activity.  But in the few minutes I have left, in addition to this scourge upon the United States that we find out was going on during the Obama administration, there is a tremendous irony that is playing out, and it is reflected in the article by J.Dyer, October 10.  The article is titled: ``NFL meltdown blows the dam on MSM's centralized media model.''  I thought about this. I did not realize, but Colin Kaepernick first began to kneel down after he apparently has also supported a group that wants to kill cops and thinks cops should be killed, the people who are protecting us and allowing us to continue safely in our way of life and our freedom.  He doesn't have that respect. He knelt. He had nothing but contempt for America's police and for those protecting He did not appreciate America, which was bringing him millions of dollars. Just contempt. Apparently, his belief is there is racism in America, though he was adopted by, as I understand it, a White family.  But he started this, and the American people didn't like it. After 9/11 particularly, they realized: You know what? We owe so much to first responders and to law enforcement that have been willing to lay down their lives for us against enemies, foreign and domestic. And they continue, as police around the country, law enforcement, continue to be willing to lay down their lives for Americans and our way of life, our freedom. We appreciated that after 9/11.  After my 4 years in the Army, when we were sometimes ordered not to wear our uniform because of hatred for people in uniform after Vietnam, I didn't think we would ever come to a day when people would again appreciate our military. But that also came out in amazing ways after 9/11.  As evil and hateful as the actions were that day in an effort to kill as many innocent people as these radical Islamists could, we saw the good in We saw the good in first responders. We saw the good in our military. We saw men and women willing to evidence the greatest love, as Jesus said, willing to lay down their lives for their fellow  Yet, during the last administration, somehow the President normally took the wrong side. He spoke up before the evidence was in and often derided the wrong people. I just can't believe that our President for those last 8 years set us back so many years in race relations. It is incredible. I thought we were beyond that, but we got set back many years.  Huge numbers of Americans didn't appreciate the way the Obama administration set us back in race relations. For the first time, we had a President and First Lady who had not normally been proud as The First Lady said she was finally proud of  I have been proud of America all my life. I was not proud of the activities of some Americans have been a force for good in the world since it came into existence. This article points out that, actually, that started something, because then other NFL players, as we have heard, didn't even realize what Colin Kaepernick was actually kneeling for. It is interesting to hear their explanations. They are not sure. They just have contempt for something, so they kneel during the national anthem.  It has so affected many Americans that many of us are not watching the NFL like we used to. It used to be a priority. I was always glad to get home from church and turn on the NFL, maybe see the Dallas I haven't been doing that. It hasn't been a priority. Colin Kaepernick started that.  Now, as this article points out, the one thing that allowed the mainstream media to bundle all kinds of programming that they forced cable companies or dish companies to take was the It was the big breadwinner that forced cable companies and satellite companies to take programming they really didn't want. But if you wanted the NFL, you had to take what the networks were bundling.  Now that the NFL is not turning into the cash cow it once was, and viewership and attendance drops, and, therefore, advertising dollars are plummeting, it may just be that that act of taking a knee back when it first started ends up leading to the liberal mainstream media not force-feeding Americans liberal pablum that they have been able to do for years. Wouldn't that be an ironic result of one player taking a knee?  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

84,topic-id,6080,"Mr.Speaker, it is interesting, when I am watching the news or looking at a newspaper, I can see what kind of pictures are there in the news story, and having been at press conferences where print media that is extremely slanted will come up, the photographer from such media source will come up and get right in front and then start taking pictures and have their camera on nonstop, just click, click, click, second after second. So you know they have got 100, 200 pictures.  It is easy to know what they are doing. They are taking as many pictures as fast as they can. And you know that they are going to go through and they are going to take the picture in which your mouth is in the most contorted position, or where it looks like you are saying a word that would be inappropriate for an elected official to say. You know that is the picture they are going to put up, trying to make you look as stupid as possible before you ever read the article.  For some of us, it is not difficult to make us look stupid. We can't help our looks. But you just know before you ever read the article, when you look at the picture, whether it is going to be a fair and objective article, or whether it is going to be totally skewed and totally subjective.  I notice that, too, sometimes when friends across the aisle come with blown-up pictures. I can look at the pictures and tell whether it is going to be a fair and objective dissertation I am going to hear from my fellow Representatives across the aisle. But it is true of Republicans as well. I just don't see those type of skewed pictures very often at all, if at all, from the But, anyway, it seems to be a good rule of thumb. You look at the pictures and you can tell whether it is going to be fair or it is going to be a total hit piece.  I have been very interested, though, to watch during the course of this last 9, 10 months as we come through 2017, the story nonstop from Representatives across the aisle has been about Russia, Russia, It sounds a bit like Sean Hannity, Russia, Russia, Russia, yes, but I don't mind sounding like somebody I greatly admire.  But isn't it interesting that in the revelations that have been coming out in the last few days, our friends across the aisle have not been as anxious to run down and talk about Russia?  But somebody needs to talk about it. I have been talking about it for quite some time, and for most of this year I have been pointing out that we actually need a special prosecutor, a special counsel to investigate former FBI Director Comey and to investigate the Clinton ties to Russia and the over $100 million in contributions that came from stakeholders, apparently, of Uranium It is just absolutely incredible.  What is amazing, though, there are bound to be so many fingers going out emanating from that deal that we have not seen or heard of. We didn't know what was going on, and now we know that the FBI headed by Director Robert Mueller, at the same time that he was purging the FBI training materials of anything that offended radical Islamists that want to kill us, at the same time he was not investigating properly tips about the older Tsarnaev being radicalized that he was going to kill people. Let's face it, when we get a tip that somebody has been radicalized as an Islamist, it means they are likely going to commit a terrorist act and try to take innocent lives, as Tsarnaev and his brother did.  The FBI didn't properly investigate. They didn't know what to ask. They didn't know how to investigate whether or not somebody had been radicalized because Robert Mueller had purged the training materials so they couldn't know what to ask, how to know if somebody has been radicalized, or they are a peace-loving Muslim, or they are radical  Mueller prevented that from happening because he was so taken up with the idea of being friendly and neighborly, he called it his outreach program. He even testified before our Judiciary Committee years ago after I was there about--he kept wanting to make the point that the Muslim community is exactly like every other community. Again, the Muslim community is just like every other community.  He kept making that point over and over as Democrats asked him questions. And then he talked about his lovely outreach program with CAIR--the Council on American-Islamic Relations--that has ties that were named as codefendants supporting terrorism with those who were actually convicted of supporting terrorism.  Yet, even though the FBI had the evidence that convicted these supporting terrorists, and even though there was plenty of evidence that the people who he was trying to be friends with had radical terrorist ties, he continued his so-called outreach program[[Page H8263]]as people were plotting to kill Americans among those that he was trying to have meals with and be friendly with.  But I asked him the question: You keep saying that the Muslim community here in America is just like every other community, and you keep bragging about your outreach program with the Muslim community. So I would like to ask you, Director Mueller, how was your outreach program going with Jews, Catholics, Baptists, and other religious groups? How is that outreach going? How is your outreach going with the Buddhists and the Confucianists?  Anyway, that was the basic question I asked. Of course, he was taken aback and he couldn't explain because eventually we got the truth. There is no outreach program like that that the FBI had with any other religious group.  So it is kind of disingenuous, if not to say dishonest, to say that a group that requires special attention and coddling is somehow exactly like every other group in No, they require special attention, at least that is what Robert Mueller thought.  I don't think any religious group that believes in our Constitution and supports our Constitution requires any such special attention, as Robert Mueller was giving the outreach partner CAIR that has done so much damage to America and continues to undermine evidence to find, arrest, and convict radical  It is normally like clockwork. As soon as a radical Islamist has committed a terrorist act, it really is like clockwork. You can count on CAIR--C-A-I-R; not the kind that actually helps people around the world, but CAIR--to be out there with the news conference saying: This guy was not one of us.  But at some point, I hope that people who are Muslims will quit listening to CAIR and will listen to the words of a much wiser individual, President el-Sisi in Egypt, who stood in a room with imams and told them: We have got to get our religion back away from the radicals, or they are going to destroy it.  That is a courageous man, and I don't find that kind of courage among the people who have these press conferences to deflect instead of helping us find and capture the radical Islamists before they kill too many people. They are out there trying to make it appear that they are not really radical Islamists; that they are something else. No, they are radical They clearly are.  I was kind of saddened that General Kelly ended up being the chief of staff for President Trump because I thought he was starting out to do a superb job as Secretary of Homeland  It turns out, as some of us had warned, that during the Obama administration, all of this blather about countering violent extremism, CVE, that found its way into legislation that this body passed: Oh, let's don't call it ``fighting radical Islamists.'' Call it, ``countering violent extremism.''  Well, some of us had figured out the game, and Michele Bachmann was one of those people. Yes, it is not countering violent extremism. It is fighting radical Thank God President Trump is now occupying the Oval He understood that ISIS was not just a JV team. They are people who are radical Islamists and they would love to kill as many Americans as possible. They didn't need to have their groups denigrated. They needed to have their groups destroyed.  These were not people who were going to be rehabilitated. They were radical extremists that actually believe with all of their heart that they win a place in paradise by killing innocent people.  If you really want to go back to why there is an English translation copy of the Koran in the Library of Congress that was purchased, owned by Thomas Jefferson, it was because he was negotiating with the radical Islamists, the Barbary pirates in North He was so well-educated, so well-read, he couldn't understand why the Barbary pirates, who were radical Islamists, kept attacking American ships.  As he indicated: We are not a threat to you. We don't even have a Navy to speak of. We are not your enemy. We don't understand why you keep attacking American ships.  And he was told that, under their belief system, those Islamists believed they went to paradise if they died killing what we would consider innocent people and they consider people worthy of death; they would go to paradise.  Jefferson, as well-read as he was, he couldn't believe that there was any religion anywhere in the world that believed you could go to Heaven or paradise if you are killed while you are killing innocent, unsuspecting people who are not military. They are not a threat to the radical Islamists's life, yet they thought they were going to go to paradise and have 70-some-odd virgins or so waiting for them. He couldn't believe it. So that is when he got his own copy of the Koran, because he just couldn't believe there was a religion that believed you could go to paradise if you are killing innocent people.  Hopefully that will set the record straight with some folks who thought it showed how open-minded Thomas Jefferson was. Actually, he was quite open-minded. Some have tried to denigrate him because he had slaves. The man made plenty of mistakes, and one of them was an egregious wrong he did upon John                              {time}  1230  They had been friends for years. It was Adams who asked him to do the first draft of the Declaration of Jefferson was wise enough that, when he did the first draft of the Declaration of Independence, if you look at the different grievances that he set out as to why they should be independent from England, the longest paragraph of the grievance was about how King George allowed slavery to ever start in  At the time, Virginia had a law making it illegal to free your own slaves, so he was law-abiding. But he believed that one of the worst things that ever happened to America was King George's allowing slavery to start and exist in this country and that it was going to cause massive problems that would be very difficult to cure. He was exactly right on all fronts.  There are some even claiming that George Washington should have his name removed from schools or public places when the fact is there would be no free America without George Washington having lived at the time he did. I believe with all my heart that George Washington was the man for such a time as that. There has never been a man in all of history who led a military in a revolution, won the revolution, and then tendered his resignation, as we see down the Hall, his outreached hand. I think it is the most important scene in all of the It is a massive mural. He is handing in his resignation. He sought no further power.  He could have been king of America or an emperor. There were a couple of coups they tried to involve him in. He stopped them. Anybody else in the world we know from history would not have done what he did. He was reluctant to take any power, yet because of his humility and his focus on creating a free and independent land, we have a free and independent land.  Yes, he had slaves, but he was dealing with a Virginia where there was a law against freeing the slaves. But even so, he put in his will that their slaves would be free upon the death of his wife. Certainly, there are better ways to have done that. He was trying to abide by the law.  We have such an incredible history with people like Some of us were attending an address by an author who had researched and done a biography on Benjamin Franklin, over at the Library of Congress, we were hearing. Someone asked him: Is there anybody you can think of in modern America who reminds you of Ben Franklin? He said: Actually, we have got many people who are witty, clever, and very inventive. Yes, Ben Franklin was an absolutely incredible man.  Of course, I am paraphrasing. But he said: It wasn't like he was George There was only one of those, just only one of those.  We had the director of The Society of the Cincinnati speak at the Library of Congress on one occasion. He was asked--since most biographers, the more they dig into the background of an individual, and he had studied Washington every year of his adult life--did he come to a point where he had less respect for Washington because of all of the details he discerned about Washington's life.[[Page H8264]]  He indicated that he could honestly say that, in addition to knowing more about Washington every year of his adult life, that he had more respect, admiration, and awe of George Washington with each passing year, with every bit of information he learned. That is the kind of incredible history we have, the kind of selflessness.  People say, oh, yeah, but Washington, look at the big payoff he got. He didn't take a salary, but, boy, did he take a lot of money after the  Actually, he didn't take a salary. He didn't take a payoff. He was reimbursed some of his out-of-pocket expenses. He had been paying for spies to work for the country. He had paid so much out of his own pocket, and he was only seeking part of what had come out of pocket knowing that, if the Revolution failed, not only would he have been killed, but, obviously, his family would not have had all that money he spent.  So I think that kind of puts in perspective, when we start looking at people who are willing to sell off America's national security for millions of dollars--well, you have to admire their appreciation for large amounts of money, but not at the price of selling our safety.  So, for all this year, I have been saying that Robert Mueller should never have accepted the role of special counsel because we knew that James Comey was such a close and dear friend of his, and Comey was a witness central to this investigation. He could not be a fair arbiter, a fair investigator. If he had been properly morally inclined, he should have said: I can't be the special counsel because I am too close--especially to Comey--to these people.  Comey, himself, testified that, before he testified up here at Congress, he talked to There is a 2013 Washingtonian article that was just a long, glowing piece on Comey that, in effect, if the world were burning down, the one person Comey would know would be right there with him would be Robert Mueller standing with him. These guys were so close. He looked at Mueller as a mentor. They were really tight.  The question in my mind, because of that tightness, since we know Comey leaked in order to, as he said, try to get a special counsel, that Mueller encouraged him to do that: Was Mueller behind this setup to get a special counsel so he could be appointed and start making massive amounts of money and hire all of these Republican-hating Democrats, contributors to Hillary Clinton, some of them?  Wow, what a great setup for a guy who obviously held grudges against some This is somebody who should not have been appointed, even though he was appointed to be Director of the FBI by George  Obviously, George Bush was trying hard to pick the right people and taking other advice like his father's mistake in appointing David Wow, what a disaster that appointment turned out to be. He turned out to be a wolf in sheep's clothing, appearing to act as one thing when we saw his teeth as he went to the Supreme  Edith Jones and David Souter came under consideration. I have been told they were both sitting in the White House as President H.Bush tried to figure out which one to appoint. If he had appointed Edith Jones, history would be totally different, and we would not have either Justice Kagan or Justice Sotomayor because whom he appointed would never have resigned during President Obama's So those kinds of mistakes have long-reaching effects.  But President Bush appointed And the more I find out, unlike the director of The Society of the Cincinnati finding out about Washington and growing in awe and admiration, the more I find out about Robert Mueller, the more concerned I am. The disclosures this week about what this man knew, what this man was involved in, and what he did--I thought he was accepting the role of special counsel because of some possible revenge motive: he had a dislike for some Republicans, loved the idea of doing what Patrick Fitzgerald did, who happened to be not just a friend of James Comey; he was the godfather of a Comey child.  Of course, we found out later that Comey recommended to Attorney General Ashcroft he should recuse himself so that he could appoint the godfather of his child, Patrick Fitzgerald, to be the special counsel. We found out this year, well, Comey leaked information--which may or may not have been a crime; it needs to be investigated--in order to get a special counsel appointed.  So he is using the same type of manipulative behavior as he did to get the godfather of his child appointed special counsel in order to get the one guy who would be with him through thick and thin, no matter how bad things got, Robert Mueller, get him appointed special counsel.  I had no idea that Robert Mueller had been involved and been Director of the FBI as they investigated Russia's efforts to corner the market on uranium and to spend millions and millions of dollars to acquire United States uranium. He is Director of the They are investigating this.  Even knowing that, it appears that he and now-Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein actually covered up their investigation so that people would not get upset with Secretary Hillary Clinton for being an approver of the deal of selling America's uranium to an enemy of the United  According to all the Democrats, for all this year, Russia, Russia, Russia is this big horrible enemy, and how dare anybody do business with them. It turns out that, actually, they were the ones who were involved in this terribly sordid business of selling our national security to the  The FBI had investigated. They had all of this information, and they even had an FBI informant, as Mueller knew as Director of the The informant had been working with the It was an undercover operation, perhaps the most important one the FBI had going on at that time.  They did have the operation going on under Director Mueller of creating a fictitious case against Senator Ted Stevens, Republican from Alaska, in which they created evidence. They conspired to hide evidence that completely didn't just exonerate Ted Stevens; it showed that he was law abiding. They hid that evidence, and they manufactured a case that would cost him his Senate seat.  The loss of his Senate seat ended up putting him on a small plane that crashed, and he lost his life. As far as I know, there were no ties of the plane crash to Mueller, but Mueller was the FBI  Thank God that there was an FBI agent involved in that investigation and that, after Ted Stevens was convicted, he couldn't stand it. His conscience would not allow him to sit quietly by after the FBI and the U.Attorney--but this FBI lead agent, under Director Mueller as Director, just fabricated a case.  It turns out not only did Ted Stevens not accept hundreds of thousands of dollars of improvements to his home without paying for them, he paid more, hundreds of thousands more, than the improvements were worth. Apparently, there was even evidence that they covered up where the contractor is saying: Look, Ted, you are paying more than we are charging you.  Stevens would say: Look, I am constantly being watched. People don't like my political positions, so I have got to be so far above and beyond ethical and moral that I have got to pay more. Just accept the checks for overpayment.  The guy is overpaying, and yet they came after him knowing that this was an innocent man. They prosecuted him and convicted him.  So after the whistleblower FBI agent comes forward under Director Mueller's leadership, what happened? The informant was ordered to be kept from investigating any criminal cases, which meant he had no job at the He went ahead and did as he was being pushed to do.                              {time}  1245  He went ahead and resigned. Thank God for a man with a conscience like that.  His affidavit made clear that the lead agent had manufactured evidence and hid evidence from the defense counsel, because they had come in with warrants and taken everything: computer drives, thumb drives, documentary evidence, and gone to the bank and gotten his documents. He did not have any evidence to show you how innocent he was, because the FBI had taken it.[[Page H8265]]  I know FBI agents who are the most honest people I have ever met. We have thousands of them in this country. Thank God for them.  But what happened under Director Mueller's leadership?  Well, the whistleblower that exposed the fraudulent misconduct gets run out of the FBI, under Director  And what happened to the one who fabricated the evidence, fabricated the case, hid evidence that showed Ted Stevens' innocence?  When Mueller is Director, that FBI agent continued to get accolades and be moved on to investigate some of the most important cases the FBI had. That was Director  He also had a policy he created called the 5-year up-or-out policy, which an article in The Wall Street Journal pointed out years ago. It ended up destroying or running off thousands and thousands of years of experience from the FBI, weakening this incredible investigative body that, until Mueller got there, was the best investigative body in all of  But after running off thousands of thousands of years of experienced FBI agents so that he could have less experienced agents--agents who would not have the experience to say: But, Mr.Director, that would be a mistake, which was done in 1985 or 1992, and it didn't work out--no, he had people with no experience.  I know from being a prosecutor that right out of law school you are ready to put the bad guys away. You are going to push the line to the limit. You are going to do your job, salute the flag, and it always helps to have experienced people around to say: Look, I know you mean well. That is not a good idea.  Mueller liked to run those people off. He spent millions of dollars that some agents pointed out was being wasted on programs that were wasteful and ineffective.  Now that we know what is coming out this week, I am surprised how naive I continue to be. I thought Mueller accepted the job of special counsel to investigate the Russia-Trump alleged relationship because it would be a great job and he could carry out vendettas that he might have. That was so naive.  Now we know that he had an investigation of He had an undercover informant for years working on the case and that he covered up that investigation, along with Rod Rosenstein, so that Hillary Clinton could make this deal, approve the deal.  And yes, there were other people who approved the deal. I believe that Attorney General Eric Holder also approved the deal and also helped covered up the investigation to show the investigation would show, from all the indications, that Russia was committing crimes in America to get ahold of our uranium.  Knowing that, if that investigation were made public, there is no way Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder could have approved the deal that was selling off 20, 25 percent of America's uranium to She could never have done that.  If she hadn't done that, there is not any doubt in some of our minds that the investors, the stockholders, ultimately, of Uranium One certainly would not have contributed over $100 million to the Clinton Foundation, and Russia would not have been paying half a million dollars for one short speech--remarkably, it is hard to believe from the State of the Union Addresses he gave, but he actually could give a short speech and get half a million dollars for one short speech.  He didn't get paid that much for other speeches. What was so special? Could it be that Hillary Clinton was so critical in persuading others to sign onto allowing Uranium One to get so much of our uranium? Gee, perhaps that is why Russia was so emboldened?  Then we find out there is more than that. The Democratic National Committee, we are told, were helping pay for this dossier that just created the most lurid, ridiculous allegations against Donald Trump as a candidate, trying to destroy his  Not only that, the DNC was involved, and the Clinton campaign may have been involved, and the FBI gets involved with that, and it appears they may have used the DNC to pay for manufactured evidence that was absolutely false and that could be used to get the FBI, under Mueller's control and the U.Attorney's Office, under Rosenstein's control, to go after the Trump campaign and possibly get wiretaps, based on the DNC Fusion GPS manufactured evidence.  So going back to Mueller accepting the appointment as special counsel and Comey possibly committing a crime the way he went about leaking private information to The New York Times, it appears, if you look at his contacts and who reported what from The New York Times and what could have only been known by James Comey--it is possible he did it six other times--it is possible James Comey committed crimes in one or all of those six other leaking occasions, if he was the source, as it appears he may very well have been.  Now, it becomes more clear in my naivety in thinking Mueller had personal motivation, including getting paid for a job he would love to do to go after people he didn't like in the Republican Party, including Donald But now it is becoming more clear. Comey needed Mueller to be a special counsel, and he admitted it in testimony here. He leaked information, which may have been a crime, in order to get a special counsel that he had to have known was going to be Robert Mueller, his friend joined at the hip, and that his other friend, Robert Rosenstein, would certainly appoint Mueller, because Rosenstein and Mueller were involved in covering up the FBI's investigation of Russia and their efforts to get uranium.  If Mueller and Rosenstein hadn't covered up that and helped seal that information and gotten the informant to agree to a nondisclosure agreement, then Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation would be short megamillions that they received as a result--it certainly appears--of the uranium transfer from the U.to  So, Mueller and Rosenstein and Comey all needed Mueller to be appointed, and Mueller needed to accept appointment as special counsel, because he had to cover up the cover-up that he and Rosenstein had been involved in years earlier in order to facilitate the deal that was made to sell off our national security.  President Trump had this great plank in his platform as he ran for President that we need to bring in money that Americans have earned overseas back into the United Well, it has never been here, but bring it into the United  But these American citizens and American companies have had to leave it in foreign banks and in foreign businesses in foreign countries because, in some countries, they pay 50, 60, 70 percent tax on it. If they bring it into the United States, they will be required to pay probably 40 percent, plus penalty and interest. So 35, 39 percent, plus penalty and interest. They can't afford to do that or they would be paying more tax than the money they earned. So they had to leave it in foreign countries and in foreign banks.  Former FDIC Chairman Isaacs came to the Hill back when this doofus named Henry Paulson was telling us we had to give him $700 billion so he could buy mortgage-backed securities and save our economy.  In our private conference call--I will never forget--he said: I have got to have $700 billion to buy these mortgage-backed securities because nobody knows what they are worth and only the government has the wherewithal to buy those. Hold them until they get value back, and that will save all these banks and keep them from going under, which would destroy the United States economy and take us back to a day worse than September of 1929. So you have got to give me $700 billion to buy these mortgage-backed securities.  When we were allowed to punch in and ask a question, somebody in my party beat me to the question, and it was this: Secretary Paulson, if nobody knows what these mortgage-backed securities are worth, how do you know you need $700 billion to buy them?  I will never forget his answer: ``We just needed a really big number.''  When I heard that, I knew that this bozo did not need $700 billion. We shouldn't have trusted him as Secretary of But he got his $700 billion. Between him and Geithner, they bailed out their friends, they bailed out the big banks while the community banks were being punished. They had to borrow money at regular[[Page H8266]]rate, and they made sure that their friends, the investment banks that brought us to the brink of ruin, got money for nothing. In fact, they got big bailouts. That was a bad day in American history.  Isaacs had the idea that you don't need to take taxpayer money. If you will just say the United States Congress should pass a bill that says anything we declare to be a troubled company or a troubled asset, if that is invested in by American companies, American individuals who have earned money overseas, never brought it into the country, if they will bring that money from those foreign countries and invest it in what Congress labels as troubled, they will pay no tax on bringing that money into the country. Then we will probably have a trillion dollars come in. You won't need the $700 billion in taxpayer money or borrowed money from China to bail out the banks. You will have Americans who will invest in those with money they earned overseas. You don't need It won't be the government getting into bed with the big banks and the terrible precedent that will set. That was a great idea.  But Paulson was so determined to let his enemies like Lehman Brothers go bankrupt without help and to allow his company Goldman Sachs to be the big dog, that he didn't want to do Isaacs' idea, and he convinced enough Members of the House, both Republican and Democrat, to give him $700 billion, because he needed a really big number.  Well, President Trump had that similar idea: let's allow American money to come into America that is earned overseas, and that will get our economy going. Americans will bring this money in, and it will be great for the economy. That is what we need to get the economy going.  Well, little did we know that, years before, candidate Donald Trump had the idea of bringing in American-earned money from foreign countries to get our economy going. Yet Hillary Clinton had the idea of selling off our national security to get megamillions to go to the Clinton Foundation, her and her husband's bank account, to get the economy going in                              {time}  1300  Wow, that was a great idea, wasn't it?  We sell off some of our national security to bring in foreign money, specifically, Russian money to get our economy going. And if she had been elected President, then the cover up that Mueller and Rosenstein did of the original investigation into Russia's efforts to corruptly buy American uranium and corner the market, that would continue to be covered up.  Wow, what a great deal. Even though Hillary Clinton did not win the election, Donald Trump did. And they got Donald Trump's Attorney General to recuse himself so that Rosenstein, a guy that participated in covering up the original FBI investigation, could appoint someone else who helped cover up that original uranium investigation with the Russians and make him special counsel so that not only would he make a lot of money and get to work with lots of people he liked that hated Trump and loved Hillary, but he could also cover up the prior coverup, even though Hillary didn't get elected. Amazing the kind of stuff that is coming out now.  The work that John Solomon and The Hill have done has been extraordinary. I have got an article from October 25: ``FBI informant in Obama-era Russian nuclear bribery was cleared to testify before Congress.''  That is great news. Despite Mueller and Rosenstein's efforts to keep their prior Russian investigation that they covered up so that the Russia uranium deal could go through, wow, we may actually get to find out about that now that the FBI informant has been cleared under the current Justice Department, under Jeff We will get to find out more about that Russia effort to corner the market using U.uranium.  An article from FOX News: ``Gag order lifted: DOJ says informant can speak to Congress on Uranium One, Russia bribery case with Clinton links.''  And then I was glad to see a friend down the hall, Chuck Grassley, a senator there from He is calling for special counsel in the Uranium One scandal. Of course, that is appropriate.  The FOX News article: ``Clinton mum on Fusion GPS scandal as Dems' dossier denials pile up.'' That is from October 26.  So now there are indications the Democrat National Committee, a Member actually paid for this fictitious dossier that could be used to get warrants to investigate political opponents in a Presidential race. This is incredible. Absolutely incredible.  Even going back to Tammany Hall, as far as I can recall, they didn't have an FBI Director and an Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General that had helped cover up a prior investigation so that their friends could make millions of dollars.  Let's see. There is an article in The New York Times from Jo Becker and Don Van Natta, This goes back January 31 of 2008. It indicates: ``Late on September 6, 2005, a private plane carrying the Canadian mining financier, Frank Giustra, touched down in Almaty, a ruggedly picturesque city in southeast Several hundred miles to the west, a fortune awaited: highly coveted deposits of uranium that could fuel nuclear reactors around the world.

275,topic-id,693,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, our system of government is a tripartite one, with each branch having certain defined functions delegated to it. The Congress is charged with writing the laws, the President with executing the laws, and the judiciary with interpreting them.  The Constitution divides powers between the branches in this manner in order to guard against the abuse of power by any one branch. The separation of powers is at the core of the fundamental premise of our constitutional design that a limited government, divided into three branches exercising enumerated powers, is necessary to protect individual liberty and the rule of law.  Unfortunately, over the last several decades, Congress has allowed its powers to gradually be chipped away at by the other branches. By allowing its powers to be diminished, Congress, especially this House, effectively is permitting the people to be deprived of their most responsive voice in the Federal Through the legislation before us today and other legislation that the House has actively pursued in recent years, we can begin to[[Page H8196]]reestablish and enforce the limits on the authority of the other two branches.  Although no package of bills by itself can rebuild Congress' institutional strength and restore the Constitution's integrity, it is absolutely necessary that Congress begin reasserting the powers that it has ceded to the other branches. This package of bills promotes the restoration of Congress' Article I powers.  The first bill in the package addresses executive branch negotiated regulatory decrees and settlements. Over the past several decades, consent decrees and settlement agreements increasingly have been used in Federal litigation to allow the executive branch to write new law in ways that give short shrift to the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, Regulatory Flexibility Act, and other laws by which Congress has prescribed how agencies must conduct rulemaking.  While the executive does have some regulatory authority, these settlements and consent decrees have been used to aggrandize that authority and shift regulatory priorities under the cloak of judicial authority. This subverts the boundaries both the Constitution and Congress have placed on administrative authority.  The Sunshine for Regulations and Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act limits the ability of the executive branch to collude with plaintiffs to abuse consent decrees and settlement agreements in a manner that allows the executive to thwart laws written by Congress and increases the power of the judiciary beyond its constitutional limits.  The second bill in the package, the Judgment Fund Transparency Act, increases transparency over Federal spending by requiring the Treasury Department to publish data on settlements and court-offered judgments entered against the Federal  One of Congress' core powers is the authority to authorize and appropriate money from the In order to properly exercise this power, Congress needs to know how the bill it has appropriated is being spent.  This bill will allow Congress to better scrutinize and understand where Federal taxpayer dollars are going. Only through the transparency this bill provides can Congress make the executive and the judiciary more accountable for the money that comes out of the Judgment  The final bill in the package, the Article I Amicus and Intervention Act, makes clear Congress' ability to defend and assert its institutional interests in litigation that puts the powers and responsibilities of Congress into question.  Currently, when the executive branch declines to pursue litigation in defense of an act of Congress, it is not required to give Congress notice sufficient to allow the House or Senate to defend the lawsuit before court filing deadlines have expired. In addition, the House of Representatives, unlike the Senate, does not have a statutory right to intervene or file amicus briefs in cases questioning congressional authority. This legislation ensures that both Houses of Congress have adequate time and a right to intervene in litigation that questions congressional authority.  We cannot continue to abdicate our powers and responsibilities to the other branches of government, weakening the separation of powers enshrined in our Constitution and threatening the very liberty divide powers were designed to protect.  Mr.Chair, I ask my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.

928,topic-id,667,"Mr.Speaker, although the power of Congress to investigate is not set forth in any particular clause in the Constitution, congressional investigations trace their roots back to the earliest days of our In fact, what is thought to be the first congressional investigation occurred in 1792, when the House appointed a select committee to investigate the massacre of American troops under the command of Major General Arthur The resolution authorizing that investigation stated that the committee shall ``be empowered to call for such persons, papers, and records, as may be necessary to assist their inquiries.''  Upon learning of the investigation, President Washington assembled his cabinet to seek their counsel. His cabinet, which included Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, unanimously concluded that the House had every right to conduct its inquiry and request papers from the President Washington directed that the relevant papers be provided to the House and the War and Treasury Departments provided voluminous records to the committee.  Unfortunately, not all congressional investigations are met with the cooperation the first investigation received. Rather, sometimes Congress and its committees must rely on another inherent power derived from the Constitution to investigate effectively--the congressional subpoena power.  As the Supreme Court has observed, although ``there is no [constitutional] provision expressly investing either house with the power to make investigations and exact testimony . . . the power of inquiry--with process to enforce it--is an essential and appropriate auxiliary to the legislative function. . . . Experience has taught that mere requests for information often are unavailing . . . so some means of compulsion are essential to obtain what is needed.''  That means of compulsion is often a subpoena issued by a congressional committee backstopped by a civil action filed in federal district court. In recent years, the House and its committees have pursued two such civil actions, including one filed by this Committee, to enforce compliance with congressional subpoenas.  The legislation we are considering today, the Congressional Subpoena Compliance and Enforcement Act, codifies and strengthens the existing civil enforcement mechanisms thereby reinforcing the powers granted Congress in Article I of the This legislation creates a statutory framework for compliance with and enforcement of congressional subpoenas through a few targeted changes to federal law.  First, the bill puts in place a statutory requirement that recipients comply with congressional subpoenas. Second, the bill statutorily requires subpoena recipients to provide a congressional committee with a privilege log if they assert a legal privilege as a reason for withholding subpoenaed materials. Finally, the bill provides that congressional subpoena enforcement cases are to receive expedited review in the federal courts and that a congressional committee may request that a subpoena enforcement case be heard by a three-judge panel of the district court, with direct appeal to the Supreme  While it is true that some of what is addressed by the bill is currently covered through negotiation with subpoena recipients and is recognized in the precedents of courts in the D.Circuit, the current statutory requirements related to compliance with and enforcement of a committee subpoena are limited. Indeed, the existing civil subpoena enforcement statute only covers the Senate and does not apply to Senate subpoenas issued to the Executive It is time that we put in place a statutorily created, expedited civil enforcement mechanism for congressional subpoenas. Relying on the existing framework to enforce congressional subpoenas has proved to be an inadequate means of protecting congressional prerogatives.

1123,topic-id,680,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Last Congress, the House Judiciary Committee commenced an investigation into the Obama Justice Department's pattern or practice of requiring settling defendants to donate money to third-party groups. In its final 2 years, the Obama DOJ directed nearly $1 billion to third parties entirely outside of Congress' spending and oversight authority.  All along, the Obama Justice Department strained to deny the obvious problem: that mandatory donation provisions create opportunities to play favorites. Deputy Associate Attorney General Geoffrey Graber testified that the Department was not ``in the business of picking and choosing which organization may or may not receive any funding under the agreement.''  But internal DOJ documents tell a different story. They show that, contrary to Graber's sworn testimony, the donation provisions were structured to aid the Obama administration's political friends and exclude conservative groups.  From the outset, Graber's boss, Associate Attorney General Tony West, was keenly interested in choosing the organizations that would receive settlement money. In the lead-up to the first troubling settlement, West's deputy emailed the Office of Legal Counsel asking: ``Can you explain to Tony the best way to allocate some money toward an organization of our choosing?''  Explaining the final settlement to the press team, West's deputy wrote that the donation provisions require banks to ``make donations to categories of entities we have specified, as opposed to what the bank might normally choose to donate to.''  Sure enough, Congress received testimony, in 2016, that the donation beneficiaries were Obama administration allies. These include the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America, whose director calls himself a bank terrorist.  But aiding their political allies was only the half of it. The evidence of the Obama DOJ's abuse of power shows that Tony West's team went out of its way to exclude conservative groups.  On July 8, 2014, 6 days before DOJ finalized its settlement with Citi, Tony West's top deputy circulated a draft of the agreement's mandatory donation terms. A senior official from the Office of Access to Justice, who had been working closely with Tony West to direct settlement money to legal aid organizations, responded, requesting a word change.  She explained that the rewording would achieve the aim of ``not allowing Citi to pick a statewide intermediary like the Pacific Legal Foundation,'' which she explained, ``does conservative property-rights free legal services.'' The change was made.  It is not every day in congressional investigations that we find a smoking gun. Here we have it.  Unfortunately, the chief architect of this outrage was lauded, not punished. The recipients of the donations, from which PLF was excluded, circulated an email seeking ways to recognize ``Tony West who, by all accounts, was the one person most responsible for including the donation provisions.''  One organization replied: ``Frankly, I would be willing to have us build a Tony West statue and then we could bow down to this statue each day after we get our $200,000-plus.''  Mr.West's abuse of power stands in stark contrast to the reassertion of integrity by the current Attorney General Jeff Attorney General Sessions shut down the use of mandatory donations to benefit outside groups, barring the practice through a policy directive issued earlier this year.  This legislation, however, remains necessary because history shows that we cannot rely on the current DOJ policy remaining in place. In point of fact, in 2009, the incoming Obama administration reversed course from previous DOJ guidance that had started imposing limits on settlement payments to nonvictims. This reversal led to the abuses I highlighted.  H.732 is a bipartisan bill that would make the ban on settlement payments to nonvictim third parties binding on future administrations. The bill makes clear that payments to provide restitution for actual harm directly caused, including harm to the environment, are permitted.  It was obvious, from the outset, that mandatory donation provisions create opportunities for abuse; that such abuses actually occurred is now proven.

1164,topic-id,298,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  The Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act of 2017 prohibits settlements that provide for payments to nonvictim third parties. But what happens to leftover money if the settlement does not specifically provide for its disposition?  It turns out that this situation is ripe for abuse.  In 2013, a shocking New York Times expose revealed that the Obama administration bilked over a billion dollars from the taxpayer-funded Judgment Fund and handed it to special interests. The case, called Keepseagle, concerned claims against the Department of  The settlement, spearheaded by then Assistant Attorney General Anthony West, vastly overstated the number of claims against the government. One result was a $60 million windfall for the plaintiff's lawyer, who was on President Obama's transition team the year before.  The other result was $380 million in funds left over. This was taxpayer money. But instead of demanding it back, the Department of Justice agreed to direct it to nonvictim third parties to be selected by the same plaintiff's lawyer and member of President Obama's transition team. This, quite rightly, troubled the presiding judge.  My amendment would close this loophole by requiring that money left over after all victims have been compensated must be returned to wherever it came from.  This amendment also clarifies that permitted remedial payments must go to victims who suffered the injuries on which plaintiffs' claims are based. This prevents situations in which a payment is classified as remedial but is directed to an intermediary.  The abuses of power that I outlined today in the settlement context are truly disturbing. This is our opportunity to stop the abuse. We should be as comprehensive as possible.  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.

Big picture, we are requiring the bank to      change its behavior and at the very least, choose the actions      we prefer among various options that it might be economically      motivated to take. This in itself is valuable because we are      pushing them to focus their activities on the borrowers and      areas and relief of most concern to us and that we believe      will have the greatest impact in redressing the harm their      actions caused to consumers and communities.

By way of background, Cindy contacte      yesterday about an issue that we've been discussing with Tony      for months and one that we've been meaning to connect with      you on adding language that incorporates legal aid into the      Department's large bank settlement agreements (as part of      consumer/victim relief). We understand that Tony wants a      quick[[Page H8110]]     turnaround on this, so please feel free to reach out to us      with any questions.       Best,       an       Senior Counsel       Access to Justice Initiative       U.Department of Justice                               Exhibit G                DELIBERATIVE AND PRE-DECISIONAL DOCUMENT                       U.Department of Justice                               MEMORANDUM     To: Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong     From: an     Date: June 23, 2014     Subject: Including Legal Aid Organizations in Distribution of          Bank Settlement Funds       As requested by Associate Attorney General Tony West, ATJ      has researched options for incorporating legal aid into the      Department's large bank settlement agreements. Based on our      current understanding of the potential scale, we identified      three options that would best align with organizational      capacity and litigation goals, and achieve the ASG's goal of      a distribution mechanism that reaches a broad coalition of      legal aid organizations.       The options listed below could be pursued either separately      or in some combination. As set out below, we recommend a      combination of options l and 2:       1) distribute the majority of funds set aside for legal aid      to IOLTA foundations; and       2) reserve sufficient funds for a national organization to      establish Consumer Protection Fellowships in specific states      pursuant to the settlement, to focus on foreclosure      prevention solutions that help people keep their homes and      prevent future mortgage abuses.       IOLTA foundations are especially appropriate intermediaries      in cases involving banks because a) they have capacity to      effectively distribute large sums of money; and b) the      historically low bank Interest rates from the beginning of      2008 to the present, have meant the loss of hundreds of      millions of dollars to legal aid programs nationally, while      the need for free legal services has grown.       Legal aid offices respond to the wide range of legal      problems faced by low-income communities in distress, with      lawyers working on cases involving housing and consumer      protection as well as family law matters and access to public      benefits. Often clients have multiple, interrelated legal      problems, such as a loss of housing that may exacerbate or      lead to other debt problems or an acute need to access other      public benefits. Some larger organizations also have      expertise in broader community development work, like working      on behalf of citizen groups to negotiate community benefits      agreements (such as requiring development to include      affordable housing or prioritize local labor). Typically, as      non-profit organizations subject to oversight by boards of      directors, legal aid offices have a formal process for      setting local priorities with oversight and input from their      boards. It could be logistically difficult for large scale      funding through IOLTA to have subject matter restrictions on      it (such as only for housing cases). Like most IOLTA funding,      and like federal funds from the Legal Services Corporation,      it is best to have as few strings as possible--both to      respect established local priorities and avoid overly      burdensome accounting. However, for the smaller portion of      funding in option 2, it makes sense to be targeted both as to      geography and subject matter.       Finally, while we recommend as few restrictions as possible      on funding going to legal aid organizations, we note that      some organizations already live with funding restrictions--     such as not being allowed to pursue class actions. If, to      build support for these ideas generally, there is a need to      fashion reasonable restrictions, then ATJ can help with      further development of such options.

I am in the process of      sending him a thank you letter today on behalf of NAIP and      all of its members. I also wanted to see if there are any      other ideas to honor him and the DOJ in a more meaningful way      (resolution, other award, ceremony at the midyear?) and am      looking for any creative ideas to try and show him how      important this is to our community and more importantly what      a huge impact it will have on those in need.

I thought our      conversation was helpful, and I appreciate your willingness      to hear my suggestions regarding a ``pilot project on      community reinvestment'' in Prince William County, Virginia,      as an element of the anticipated JPMorgan Chase settlement.      For the record, it is important that I offer the following      disclaimer: this proposal is made on our own initiative, and      without the encouragement, approval, or suggestion by either      you or the Department of       By way of background, The Leadership Conference on Civil      and Human Rights is the nation's leading civil and human      coalition. We have been actively involved for many years in      housing and lending policies both before and in the wake of      nation's financial crisis. As I mentioned when we spoke, we      are working with several community-based organizations in      Prince William County that seek to promote the public      interest through leveraged investments in neighborhoods that      have been hard hit by home foreclosures.       For example, VOICE, a broad-based citizens organization      with 50 religious and community institution members in      Northern Virginia, has asked The Leadership Conference to      assist them in their fight to get JPMorgan to reinvest a      portion of the more than $300 million in equity it stripped      from Prince William County, VA communities and families      through predatory loans, toxic Mortgage-backed Securities      (MBSs), and foreclosures (see attached one-page summary of JP      Morgan's Prince William track record).       We are asking DOJ officials negotiating with JPMorgan Chase      to consider including in any settlement significant equity      capital or grant funds to promote and capitalize a Prince      William County Restoration Fund (see attached concept paper)      which will revitalize blighted neighborhoods, rebuild      homeownership, and address                           exhibit I Part II                               Metro IAF                           VOICE for justice                  National Community Restoration Fund          JP Morgan Chase & Federal Government MBS Settlement       Goal: Require JPMorgan Chase to reinvest some of the equity      its predatory mortgages stripped from communities as part of      the US Department of Justice's proposed $13 Billion      Settlement with JPMorgan over regulatory issues and mortgage-     backed securities (MBSs).       Metro Industrial Areas Foundation, a network of 22 broad-     based citizens organizations in the East, Midwest, and South,      proposes that this occur in one of two ways;       Ideal Proposal: The Federal Government should require      JPMorgan Chase to pay $2 billion in cash to capitalize a      National Community Restoration Fund that would help restore      communities and be available on a competitive basis. The      National Restoration Fund could capitalize 50 local community      restoration equity funds to rebuild communities across the      country that were destroyed by JPMorgan's predatory loans and      toxic       Alternative Proposal: The Federal Government should include      in its consent agreement, as part of the consumer relief      portion, a requirement that JPMorgan Chase capitalize local      community restoration equity funds through significant grants      (at least $10 million+ each) or Equity Equivalent (EQ2)      investments over 20+ years on a non-recourse basis at very      low interest rates (0%-1%) to rebuild communities devastated      by foreclosure. JPMorgan Chase could be given enhanced credit      towards its settlement requirements for this type of grant or      investment.       Background: JPMorgan Chase's predatory loans--packaged into      toxic MBSs--did not just hurt investors and individual      homeowners; they destroyed entire communities for which      JPMorgan should be held accountable to reinvest. MBSs allowed      predatory lenders to originate trillions of dollars of sub-     prime loans that were structured to fail, targeted at low-     wealth and minority borrowers, and concentrated In low-income      neighborhoods in cities and aging suburbs throughout the      The cumulative effect of these failed mortgages was to:       Leave large-numbers of blighted and vacant homes that      depress property values,[[Page H8111]]     preventing remaining homeowners from securing a loan      modification because they are underwater. These properties      also attract crime and other public safety issues;       Devastate homeownership rates, replacing owners with      renters vulnerable to negligent absentee investors and      destabilizing neighborhoods;       Create pressures on available affordable rental housing as      demand rises from families recently foreclosed, raising rents      and making rental housing unaffordable;       Deny large swaths of former homeowners, who are stuck in      high-priced rental housing,                               Exhibit J       Best,       Peter Kadzik       Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General       Office of Legislative Affairs     From: Martin Trimble     Sent: Saturday, February 15, 2014 6:13 PM     To: Kadzik, Peter J (OLA)     Cc: Luke Albee; Michelle Malwurm; Clyde Ellis; Keith Savage;          Wilson Michael; Frank McMillan     Subject: VOICE/Metro IAF Meeting with US Deputy Attorney          General Tony West       Mr.Kadzik: It was good to talk with you on      Thank you for agreeing to speak with US Deputy Attorney      General Tony West about meeting with VOICE--Virginians      Organized for Interfaith Community Engagement Leaders--to      discuss VOICE & Metro Industrial Areas Foundation's (Metro      IAF) proposal to create a $5 Billion National Community      Equity Restoration Fund to rebuild communities devastated by      predatory loans and toxic Mortgage Backed Securities issued      by financial institutions.       The VOICE-Metro IAF National Community Equity Restoration      Fund concept paper is attached. As you know, VOICE worked      with Senator Mark Warner, Federal officials, and other allies      to get ``grants to capitalize community equity restoration      funds'' included as one way JP Morgan Chase can fulfill its      consumer relief obligations under the Department of Justice-     JP Morgan Chase $13 billion toxic Mortgage Backed Securities      settlement. This precedent potentially creates a vital      resource to rebuild communities hard hit by predatory loans      and foreclosures. We will brief Deputy Attorney General West      on how community equity restoration funds established by      VOICE/Metro IAF sister groups are transforming blighted      communities on a large scale in Baltimore, New York,      Milwaukee as well as the VOICE restoration plan for Prince      William County, VOICE & Metro IAF will make the case that      the Department of Justice should make ``grants to capitalize      community equity restoration funds'' mandatory in all future      settlements.

It didn't come with a note or an explanation, just 12 rolls of I guess there is a little irony maybe because it is in  Maybe after watching the President entertain himself by tossing paper towels at hurricane victims in Puerto Rico, some well-intentioned person thought that giving paper towels to Puerto Ricans was an appropriate sign of respect--the gift you give to Puerto Ricans after a major disaster trying to cheer us up,  Having returned from my second trip to Puerto Rico since the hurricane, I can tell you one thing for sure: we need a lot more than paper towels from the President and this  This is I was visiting with the mayor. I want you to look at the pictures. This woman here, she has a disabled adult sleeping on a wet mattress. Yes, sleeping on a wet mattress. That is the home in which she takes care of her son. Four weeks after the hurricane, children hiding behind barricades, homes destroyed.  This is Comerio where food, 4 weeks after the hurricane, because there is no food, has to be handed neighborhood to neighborhood, hilltop to hilltop, hamlet and village to village within the town.  See this? People sleep there on that bed without tarps because somehow we forgot that in a hurricane-destroyed society it might have--be a good idea to have something over your head. Of course, the President said he gave himself a 10. Tell that to the people who have lived there 4 weeks.  I just came back from this trip on I am now not surprised that the congressmen, my colleagues, are taking day trips to Puerto Yes, that is what we do as Members of Congress, we get there at 9 o'clock during the Sun of the day, and we leave by 4 before the darkness comes because, of course, there is no electricity, and then they take us on a helicopter ride around the island. That is no way to visit.  You get off the plane and off the helicopter and you stay overnight when it is pitch black because that is the way 3.4 million American citizens live 1 month after the hurricane. That is how they live. So I don't know, maybe congressmen should stop taking day trips where they get there at 9 and leave by 4. Spend the night, get out of your comfort, and go talk to the American citizens that you are supposed to be representing.  America, see this? That is a horse stable, abandoned house where people live. I met a 13-year-old girl there with her mom and her 12-year-old brother. That is where they live. See this mom and the two children? No roof over their heads. Just a little tarp to keep one part of their house and no place to sleep.  See this man right here? He lives in this abandoned house in a little tent with a 2-month-old child and his wife, disabled in a wheelchair, and no electricity to run his air tank so that he can get the vital air that he needs to sustain his life.  This is what I saw, and this was without the help of the Federal Government because, if you ask for help, they will put you on a helicopter and take you on a nice tour and you will not talk or see anybody.  And I know there are some in America who say they should just do this for themselves. Well, guess what? They are citizens of the United States of They are a colony of the United States of And I would just ask America--there are over half a million people on that island who are homeless, whose homes have been destroyed, and our government--here is the one question people kept asking me no matter where I went, they said: Where is FEMA? Where is the help that we expect from the most powerful and richest Nation on the Earth in this moment of despair?

588,topic-id,545,"Mr.Speaker, there is something fishy about the Whitefish Energy deal that was reported in The Washington  Whitefish Energy, based in Whitefish, Montana, was awarded a $300 million contract to repair and replace the electrical grid in Puerto We learned that the company is 2 years old and, as of about 6 weeks ago, had just two employees. It does not have a track record of working on massive projects, certainly not one as massive as rebuilding the power grid in Puerto Rico after a once-in-a-century storm like Hurricane  The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority did not solicit bids for this contract. They did not do what most power utilities do under these circumstances, which is rely on mutual assistant relationships with other power companies.  In Florida and in Texas--and in Illinois, for that matter--after a big storm, power companies from around the country send linemen and other workers to assist the local company. But that is not happening here. The Florida Power and Light Company brought in 20,000 workers after Irma and, apparently, was willing to send workers to Puerto Rico and help, but the request for help never came.  So what is going on here?  A tiny company that does not have a track record gets one of the biggest contracts to help rebuild Puerto Rico in a no-bid, out-of-the-ordinary contracting procedure.  That is why I wrote yesterday to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and FBI Director Christopher Wray, because I want them to investigate this deal, how it was awarded, why this company got the contract, and whether there is any evidence of it being a sweetheart, corrupt deal to boost business allies and political allies of the President and members of his  I also plan to bring this issue up to the Oversight Committees in this body.  On the surface, the Whitefish Energy deal looks fishy, but when you look a little deeper, the Whitefish Energy deal looks corrupt.  Whitefish Energy is based in Whitefish, Guess what. That is the hometown of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who used to represent Montana in this body. His son even worked for the company. The chief executive of Whitefish Energy, Andy Techmanski, knows Secretary Zinke; but as a spokesperson for the Interior Department said yesterday, in Whitefish, ``everybody knows everybody.''  Guess what. That doesn't make me feel any better about the deal.

799,topic-id,1310,"Mr.President, I thank the minority leader, Senator Schumer, for his words of emphasis on the need to ensure that not only do our fellow Americans in Florida and Texas receive the relief they so dearly and sorely need but also that our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands, as well, receive the relief[[Page S6722]]they need and receive the priority they deserve.  California has been devastated, frankly, by the wildfires that we have just experienced. Ten days ago, I was in Santa Rosa, CA, and witnessed firsthand the devastation that took place throughout that region and, in particular, in Coffey  I met with evacuees. I met with firefighters. I met with community leaders, elected leaders, and others who traveled to that area out of concern and with a desire to help. I met county supervisors, and for two of them in particular, Supervisors Gore and Gorin, their entire districts were on fire. One of the supervisors even lost her own home. Yet they were leading the charge in the recovery efforts and doing so in such a selfless way and with such courage.  Entire communities were devastated, and people have lost everything and are still suffering to an incredible extent because of the loss they have experienced and the fact that they have not been resettled.  My heart breaks, as I know all of us feel for the 42 people and their families whose lives were ended in these fires. There were 42 people in this region who lost their lives. In addition, more than 8,400 homes and buildings were destroyed. For example, in Santa Rosa, 5 percent of the entire housing stock is gone. Many of the folks in these neighborhoods are middle-class families--working families. They are plumbers and teachers and first responders who were barely able to meet their mortgage. The fires have scorched more than 245,000 acres, and 100,000 Californians were forced to evacuate.  I must tell you, I am in awe of the work of the firefighters and first responders who fought tirelessly day and night. I heard stories of firefighters who worked 80 hours straight to do the work of evacuation, ensuring that no lives were lost and no lives were in peril. I am in awe of their work.  I met a firefighter. His first name is Paul, who, when I met him, was finally taking a moment of rest from the firefighting he had been doing. He was wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt and flip-flops he borrowed from another firefighter because he lost his home and everything he had. Yet there he was on the frontlines fighting to make sure no other Californians, no other people faced the kind of devastation he faced.  There were more than 11,000 total firefighters who went to the fire. Some were from other States and even other countries. They deserve our thanks. I stand here in the U.Senate to thank them for the work they did, coming to California and helping us deal with this crisis.  First responders and medical professionals did important work as well. Fifty-one doctors from Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital who lost their homes and possessions still stayed overtime to help crowded emergency rooms full of patients. I am uplifted by what I know, and the world now sees, which is the character of People rushed to help the elderly in nursing homes evacuate. I heard the story of a doctor who used his motorcycle to save newborn babies from a neonatal unit.  Now these folks need our help. Senator Feinstein and I will continue to demand FEMA resources, which include the need for housing, individual assistance, transportation, and water infrastructure. We need to make sure all Californians, regardless of status, can get help at the shelters.  I spoke with DHS Acting Secretary Elaine Duke and confirmed that ICE will suspend immigration enforcement in the area until further notice. It is our belief, and it is our understanding as Californians, that notice will be clear as to when this effort will end, in terms of not enforcing immigration. We want to be clear when it is going to start so we can tell Californians because right now they are trusting DHS's word that this immigration enforcement has been suspended. We are told that FEMA, through Elaine Duke, will also support emergency packages that provide disaster relief for the hurricanes in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.Virgin  California is resilient and will rebuild, but we need help. More than 12,000 constituents have contacted our office, and we will continue to work with FEMA, HUD, the Small Business Administration, and the USDA to ensure that those affected in my State will get all the relief that is necessary.  Congress needs to fund programs like community development block grants and section 8 housing to help provide affordable housing for low- and middle-class residents. They need the help to find affordable housing. California is facing an affordable housing crisis like many other States in our country, and this is something that has been highlighted by the devastation these various States and territories have experienced recently, but it is an ongoing issue we must deal with.  We cannot stop there. We need larger supplemental emergency packages that include helping This has to be a long-term commitment. California is experiencing the worst fires in history, and they are becoming more frequent. In the 1980s, fires burned and wildfires burned under 25 acres, on average. Now typical wildfires will burn over 100 acres. California's 2017 fire season has not yet ended, and it has already burned more acres than the average for the past 5 years. In Southern California, from Kern County to San Diego, red flag warnings are occurring as we speak. There are currently up to 55 mile-an-hour winds and warm, dry weather, with no humidity or very little humidity. These are the conditions that were at play during the most recent wildfire crisis.  We must also look at the future and how we can prevent wildfires from reaching this magnitude as we go forward. We must pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding  Today, over half of the U.Forest Service budget is dedicated to combating wildfires, compared to just 13 percent of the budget in 1993. The wildfires are treated differently than floods or hurricanes. The Forest Service is not allowed to use general disaster relief funds at FEMA, and that makes no sense.  Prevention is cheaper than reaction. The U.Forest Service estimated that there are 6.3 billion dead trees in the Western Removing them would improve safety by mitigating wildfires. Also, it would have an economic benefit and create jobs. There are certain bills, and the bill I mentioned, that will help achieve this because it will allow the Forest Service to dedicate part of the budget to forest management and not just reacting.  We must listen to the experts. For example, CAL FIRE agrees. Too often, States are picking up the bill for prevention in forest management, and we should make it very clear that fires are not partisan. This bill I mentioned, the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, is a bipartisan bill, and it should be inserted cleanly into the next supplemental emergency package.  Finally, let's recognize the connection between these disasters and climate change. California is leading the way and preparing for increasing wildfires, but the Federal Government needs to do its part. Natural disasters from fires to hurricanes, to floods do not discriminate by region or by party. We must help each other when these travesties hit, but also we must prepare for the future.  In closing, I would suggest and urge our colleagues to pass the supplemental bill and future emergency resources, ensure that Federal agencies deliver prompt help on the ground, and pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding  Thank you.

755,topic-id,1384,"Mr.President, I rise today to discuss an issue that is devastating families and communities in my home State of New Hampshire and across the United States: the fentanyl, heroin, and opioid crisis. This crisis is the most pressing public and safety challenge that New Hampshire faces. It does not discriminate. It affects people in every community and from every walk of life.  In 2016 alone, 485 people in New Hampshire lost their lives as a result of this epidemic. The rising use of synthetic drugs like fentanyl is making matters worse, killing people faster with smaller amounts. Last year, 72 percent of drug-related deaths in New Hampshire involved fentanyl. Behind those numbers are real people--moms and dads, sons and daughters who are dying. Their loss reverberates in pain and suffering for the family and friends whom they have left behind.  The people of my State have a longstanding tradition of sharing their stories and their priorities with their elected officials who represent them. Everywhere I go, I hear stories from those families and friends of people who have been affected by this crisis. Granite Staters are stepping forward and explaining what they have gone through, all in an attempt to break down the stigma of addiction, push for solutions, and hope that they can help others by making their voices heard.  Earlier this year, Greg and Linda of Derry, NH, reached out to my office to share the story of their son, who was also named They wrote to say:       If you were to put a name and face to this disease, it      would be that of the devil. Let's change that. Let's put a      face of hope and humanity to the disease of addiction. If by      doing so, even if just one life is saved, it is worth it.  I would like to share some of Greg's story today. Greg was born on November 16, 1985. He and his younger brother Neil were raised in a caring and loving home, where their parents did their best to teach them right from wrong, stressing the importance of being considerate, polite, and kind.  When Greg was 15, his parents moved to Derry, where he attended Pinkerton Academy and graduated with honors in 2004. During his senior year, like so many other students his age, he applied for college, eventually deciding on Keene State College, pursuing a major in biochemistry. He had a dream of becoming a physician.  He excelled academically, but his mom Linda said that during his transition between his freshman and sophomore year, something began to appear off. She wrote:       I saw firsthand that something was off about him. He was      very quiet and withdrawn. He was showing obvious signs of      depression which runs in both sides of the family.  Even as his depression progressed, Greg battled through. He graduated cum laude with a bachelor's degree in biochemistry. After graduating and moving back home, his parents urged him to seek help, but Greg held back. During this time, he had an outpatient surgery, after which he was prescribed an opioid-based painkiller. His mom said that after he was prescribed that opioid, he went from bad to worse.  Eventually Greg sought help. He saw a physician and was prescribed an anti-depressant. His mom said he seemed to be coming back around; he seemed happier. He took steps to advance his career, hoping to find a job with his biochemistry degree that would offer him a reimbursement on tuition so that he could continue to pursue a career in medicine. Though the job market was tough, his mom said:       Hands down, I have to say that one of the happiest days of      my life was when he finally got a decent job. . . . The dark      cloud was lifted--temporarily.  Unfortunately, Greg eventually lost that job, and then things spiraled out of control. His mom wrote:       The years following were a nightmare to remember. Just      imagine a loved one slowly losing all sense of themselves.      Legal trouble, bouncing from one job to the next, losing his      license more than once while we drove him back and forth from      jobs--some an hour away.       A restraining order here, a night in jail there. Debts that      weren't getting paid. Fits of rage, fights, a lack of      interest in family, friends, and basic hygiene.  She said:       By the time our worst fears were confirmed, he was using      heroin, we basically lost the soul of our son.  Greg's last few years were filled with back-and-forths. He had overdosed, his brother finding him in the bathroom of their home. Tired of being dependent on heroin, he sought help, signing up for a methadone clinic, entering rehab, and giving his parents hope that he would make progress.  Unfortunately, he started to use again but was getting ready to enter a drug court program. After joining his family on a vacation to visit an ailing relative, he decided to clean up his act, going to the gym and eating right.  Tragically, though, his mom wrote:       This was short lived however, as the demon snuck into his      room and stole him from us. All he left for us was a lifeless      body on the floor behind a locked door.  Greg's death and his heartbreaking story is the story of far too many people in New Hampshire and across the country, of people with dreams, hopes, and aspirations, whose lives are cut short as a result of this illness. Greg wanted to be a doctor. He wanted to be a husband and a father. He loved dogs and video games, and he loved to watch Patriots games on Sunday with his mom, his dad, and his brother. As his mom put it:       Brilliant and head strong, he was to be reckoned with, and      as his parents, we will never stop trying, on his behalf, to      see that there is an end to this epidemic.  His parents wanted to make clear that his substance use disorder really grew as a result of the opioid he was prescribed following surgery, a painkiller that was originally manufactured for terminally ill patients. They believe that pharmaceutical companies marketed this drug at the expense of their son, saying: ``Given to ease pain and suffering, ironically, it has caused irreparable pain, suffering, and death.''  We can never thank families who have lost loved ones enough for speaking out about this issue and for working tirelessly and courageously to try to prevent others from suffering as they have. Nor can we forget to thank law enforcement and first responders who are on the frontlines of this epidemic.  I want to make a special mention of Greg's father, Greg senior, who is a firefighter in Nashua, witnessing as a first responder every day the havoc that this crisis wreaks on other families and living with the reality of his own family's loss too.  Greg's mom said that at the moment of his death, she vowed that she would ensure that his life would not be in vain. His family reached out because they wanted to make a difference. I am grateful for their efforts to do this because they do, in fact, have the ability to make change.  Speaking up helps break down the stigma that prevents too many from seeking help and prevents too many others from offering it. It provides a[[Page S6805]]voice to the voiceless, making those who have died more than just a statistic. It gives us a perspective from which we can learn, and it pushes us to take action.  While thanking these families for their bravery is appropriate, it is simply not enough. Their bravery and their struggle must be marked by constant vigilance and urgent action. We must continue to focus on an ``all hands on deck'' approach at all levels of government and with those on the frontlines in order to make progress, save lives, and end this epidemic.  I am going to continue fighting and working with Members of both parties to combat this crisis, and I will continue sharing the stories of the people of my It is up to all of us to stop this from happening to more families.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

As the founder and owner of the North Country Climbing Center, Rusty and his wife have built a small business that has been described as an ``inclusive community,'' where he strives to create a welcoming environment for both experienced climbers and beginners. He has worked diligently to engage with various organizations throughout the community, like the Adaptive Sports Partners of the North Country, which empowers individuals who experience disabilities to experience rock climbing.  Rusty is also involved with local business and entrepreneurship groups, including the Franconia Notch Regional Chamber of Commerce, the North of the Notch Young Professionals Network, the Littleton Rotary Club, and the Bethlehem Colonial His commitment to supporting the local economy and other small businesses, in addition to his own successful climbing center, earned him Stay Work Play's Young Professional of the Year award. As New Hampshire continues to work to attract young people, his nominator noted that Rusty has ``reminded us why we chose to live and play in northern New Hampshire.''  In addition to running his business, Rusty also dedicates his time to the Sugar Hill Fire Department, where he is a volunteer firefighter, and the Pemigewasset Valley Search and Rescue Team, for which he is a lieutenant. Earlier this year, Rusty participated in the successful search and rescue effort for a hiker who had been missing in the White Mountain National Forest for days before he was found. In describing his motivation for volunteering for these critical public safety entities, Rusty says, ``In this community, people help each other. Not because it's required or because it's our job to do so, but because we are all in this together.'' That pervasive sense of selflessness and community solidarity is what makes the Granite State unique.  Throughout New Hampshire, citizens just like Rusty give back to their community, look out for their neighbors, and do what they can to help make our beautiful State a stronger place so we can all grow and thrive together. Rusty embodies the all-hands-on-deck spirit that we all strive to fulfill, and I am honored to recognize him as our Granite Stater of the Month for October.[[Page S6766]]                            ____________________",CREC-2017-10-24-pt1-PgS6765-2.txt,99999999999999,OTTO WARMBIER NORTH KOREA NUCLEAR SANCTIONS ACT,2017.0,24.0,October
73,topic-id,2026,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank my friend, the gentleman from Georgia, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate.  Mr.Speaker, I am here today to debate the rule for consideration of H.469, the Congressional Article I Powers Strengthening Act; and H.732, the Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act, two Judiciary bills that are deficient in both process and in substance.  First, let me address the Congressional Article I Powers and Strengthening Act, a bill that my Republican friends purport will provide commonsense solutions to curbing regulatory abuse, but will, in fact, undermine the ability of Federal regulators to protect the health and safety of Americans, threaten the privacy of victims of government misconduct, and intrude on the Department of Justice's enforcement discretion, raising serious separation of powers concerns.  Mr.Speaker, just as appalling as the substance of this bill is the process by which we are considering it and many other bills deriving from the Judiciary Committee lately.  This bill is actually three Judiciary Committee bills wrapped in one Rules Committee print. However, one of the bills, H.4070, was introduced last week without a hearing, without a markup, without notice to Democrats on the Judiciary Committee, and without consultation with constitutional[[Page H8089]]lawyers and experts and interested citizens.  This process is truly a slap in the face of regular order. A bill that has zero input from members on the Judiciary Committee or been the subject of any thoughtful discussion is suddenly on the House floor for a vote.  Interestingly, when I listened to my friend from Georgia, who I know is particularly serious about his approaches to legislation, I sat here and then I looked into the gallery, and there were 20 people who were seated there. I didn't see on the faces of those that I could see any understanding of one thing that he said, not because of the speed of his manner of speech, but because of the complexity of issues that give rise to us.  Among the things he said was transparency, accountability, and wanting to make sure that we, this body, exercise our prerogative with reference to for the people, by the people, and of the people.  I would imagine that people listening to this debate would want to believe that half of this body, half of the people who are represented in this country had input to this legislation. Let me tell you, People, they had none, zero. No Democrat had any input to this measure that I just discussed.  How can we expect Members of this body, let alone the American people, to have any idea as to what we are voting on with this measure and what its impact will be when it seems the path it took to getting a vote is based solely on the whim of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee?  Unfortunately, there is total disregard for even a semblance of regular order. That term is utilized a lot here, and, again, the American people, many of them, don't have a clue what we are talking about.  What we are talking about, basically, is matters that go to committees have hearings, have both sides have input, have witnesses who are experts or have responsibilities in that arena, and then the matter comes to the Rules Committee and is granted a bill of substance to come here to the floor, and that process is generally known by those of us with Congress-speak as regular order.  It is nothing new for the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee, which has been the worst offender of regular order, when it comes to pushing for a closed process.  During the 115th Congress, bills coming to the floor from the Judiciary Committee were granted the most closed rules of any of the committees in this august body, eight closed rules. There is no committee chair in this Congress who has requested the Republican-controlled Rules Committee grant more closed rules than the chairman of the Judiciary  Indeed, this departure from a process that we refer to as regular order, from a process that allows input from outside experts and other witnesses, a process that allows both parties, if there is a hearing, to ask questions of those witnesses, this departure is astounding, and that is within the context of this Congress, which, in just the first 10 months, will soon become the most closed Congress in history.  I remember when I ran for office in 1992, I appeared a lot on radio stations. In many of those appearances, the opposition, not just my opponent, but the major party, had begun a drumbeat of the Democrats are not following regular order, they are having closed rules.  Little did I know in 1992, nor did I aspire when I came here, to be on the Rules Committee to have a better understanding, but I kept listening to this closed rule argument, and many persons lost their elections because of that.  If there is ever a time for us to address it, it would be now. We have that prerogative to be able to open up this process so that all Members can be involved.  When this Congress began, the distinguished Speaker of this body promised an open and transparent He called for a return to regular order. After what we have seen over the last 10 months, I shudder to think what the distinguished Speaker considers a closed process.  I might add, the next tier under closed is structured rules, which we are here today on, which, yet again, limits the number of activities by others, amendments, and other processes that would be appropriate.  Yesterday, when my colleague and I were in the Rules Committee, we had before us matters that were germane to this issue that were denied, that could have, under an open process, been made in order so that we could discuss it here today.  This Republican process, shutting out the voice and input of representatives of nearly half the country, is not just an affront to normal House procedure, which it is, it is downright undemocratic and emblematic of the Republican majority's true inability to govern.  Mr.Speaker, I turn to the second bill encompassed in this rule, H.732, a bill as misguided and substantively unnecessary as the first bill was lacking in process. In fact, in the last Congress, a law professor testifying on an identical bill described it as a solution in search of a problem.  That was as true in the last Congress as it is in this one, which is too bad, because we do not lack in actual problems in desperate need of sensible solutions.  H.732 would prevent Federal agencies from requiring third-party payments, such as those to charities, in settlement agreements with entities accused of wrongdoing.  Now, there in the report pointed out by the chairman of the Rules Committee yesterday shows the number of banks and mortgage companies and others that have violated the law and entered into settlements with the government for billions of dollars. Such payments, in excess of what the victims have agreed to, and the settlements that have been entered into and approved by judges, each one of these settlements, my friend said these payments may have gone to politically motivated--may be politically motivated organizations, and he cites to La Raza, which did receive money, but so did other charitable organizations: the New Christian Joy Full Gospel Baptist Church, the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Chicago, the Catholic Charities Financial and Housing  We sought yesterday while we were in the committee--I sought and asked staff to provide for me some of the organizations that my friends say may be politically motivated, or activists, as he referred to them, and it is 49 pages of organizations that were available to receive these funds, and, yes, some of them are liberal and also some of them are conservative organizations as we know them.  Such payments to charities are a common enforcement tool in settlements and have long been used to help provide communities with relief from systemic harm caused by illegal behavior.  Now, for example, following the 2008 financial crisis, in some of the settlement agreements with Wall Street banks, President Obama's Department of Justice required banks to donate money to charities committed to neighborhood stabilization and foreclosure prevention efforts, and this made perfect sense.                              {time}  1245  In the wake of the crisis, as many as 10 million families lost their homes to foreclosure. Both the Government Accountability Office and the Federal courts have long upheld this practice in settlement agreements. Perhaps unsurprisingly, my Republican colleagues considered these provisions to be an attempt by President Obama's administration to use, as they say, ``a slush fund,'' to enrich, ``liberal friends,'' despite the fact that certified charities eligible to receive these payments encompass liberal and conservative groups alike.  They even launched an investigation which yielded no credible evidence to substantiate their claims. Yet, despite the GAO, the Federal courts, and a Republican-led investigation showing no wrongdoing, we are considering this bill today to ban this longstanding legal practice aimed at assisting communities in the wake of suffering systemic abuse--abuse that I will underline again, and even say slowly, hurt Democrats and  I suppose the only question left to ask my Republican friends is, 10 months into the new administration, nearly a year after the last election, why are they continuing to conduct[[Page H8090]]pointless and partisan oversight of the Obama administration?  Let me see if I can make this clear. President Obama is no longer the President of the United States, nor is Bill Clinton or George The President of the United States now is a new individual who we have to deal with, and it would be helpful if we were to address some of the matters ongoing that this particular administration is deserving of oversight.  I know that President Obama was a useful foil for many in the Republican Party when it came to messaging and campaigning, but he is not the President anymore. He won his two elections. That is the past. This bill represents nothing but the Republican majority grasping at straws and trying their best to turn their oversight attention away from doing their duty and providing oversight of the Trump administration.  Today, two new inquiries, I don't even have the time or wouldn't take the time to go into the inquiries that ain't going nowhere, have been announced, certainly as a distraction to many of the negatives that come out by virtue of this particular Congress not having done anything. It is the do-nothing Congress on steroids.  If there was ever an administration that needed rigorous oversight, it is the current one. In just 10 months, we have had reports of gratuitous use of private jets, the use of private email servers by senior staff, and I might add that one of those things identified today is they are going to go after Hillary or have oversight hearings on Hillary Clinton's emails. Enough already. Hillary Clinton lost her election, and lost with the emails as well, but we have current staff who are using private email servers. Given your history, should that not at least pique your oversight interest?  Spending tens of millions of taxpayers' dollars to use Mar-a-Lago for official meetings, waste, cronyism, the list goes on and on and on. How about oversight of a little, old company in Montana that doesn't have any successful history getting a $200 million no-bid contract in Puerto Rico to reestablish those facilities there? Out of Montana, little, old company, $200 million, no-bid. You got it. You go forward. You talk about waste and cronyism. And what do we get from the Republicans? Deafening silence.  Mr.Speaker, I find it ironic that we are considering the rule for a bill today entitled Article I Powers Strengthening Act when this Republican Congress has shown they can't even undertake the basic Article I duty of providing oversight of the executive. They don't need to strengthen Article I, they need to just start doing their jobs in the first place.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

I don't think I have any speakers, but I do have words that I wish to put forward right now.  It is shameful that we would be in a position where the DACA program is being threatened without a single thought to the consequences this decision would have on the 800,000 young lives this program protects.  While this may appear to be off message with regard to the measures that are before us, the minority is given an opportunity to present what is called a previous question, and it can be on matters germane to the thoughts of the minority and can be on any subject that they choose. In this instance, we choose to, with the previous question, address  Do the American people even want DACA to end? The answer is clearly no. According to a Politico/Morning Consult poll, support for allowing these immigrants to remain in the United States spans across party lines: 84 percent of Democrats, 74 percent of Independents, and 69 percent of Republicans think they should stay. Congress must act to protect our  Mr.Speaker, here is a chance to rectify the President's decision and restore the American people's faith in this institution.  If we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer an amendment to the rule to bring up H.3440, the Dream This bipartisan bicameral legislation would help thousands of young people who are Americans in every way except on paper.  Mr.Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of this amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.

Mr.Speaker, earlier I mentioned that there were 49 pages--I didn't realize how extensive it really was--of organizations that were eligible to receive funds under the Justice Department's prerogative.

79,topic-id,685,"Mr.Speaker, I do want to acknowledge that my friend from Georgia does have a companion bill in the other body. I believe it is 333. I would--like I will when the Georgia-Florida game comes up--make a wager with my friend that that bill ain't going nowhere. But, anyway, we are here talking about it, so my wager with the gentleman will be under appropriate measures. I wish he and I could go to Jacksonville together at what they say is the greatest cocktail party in the world.  Mr.Speaker, I just mentioned that at least one of the bills wrapped up in today's, in my view, nonsense, ought to continue to be described as a solution in search of a problem. I am not fully convinced that the observation is not an apt one for the whole lot of bills before us today. As I just mentioned, this is particularly disturbing as this country has real problems which need real solutions.  The Children's Health Insurance Program has expired, and there seems to be little to no will on the other side of the aisle to right this wrong at this time. Sure, we hear possibilities of a solution. When I came back this week, I thought that we would certainly address it. September 30 was when it expired. Yet we and, more importantly, millions of children and organizations wait for an answer.  We know that we are fast approaching a government shutdown, but instead we come to the floor week after week forced to debate ridiculous bills that, in substance, are well-thought-out by the persons presenting them, but, in reality, are not going to become law and are nothing more than talking points of the day, when these things that we should be addressing are going unmet.  We need to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration, yet the answer to this issue evades my friends across the aisle. We need to reauthorize the National Flood Insurance Program, yet we wait.  We need to address the crippling epidemic that is gun violence in this country. We need to remember that not even a month ago, this man out in Las Vegas took aim from the 32nd floor of a hotel and rained terror down upon thousands of innocent people enjoying a music festival. The weapons of war he used that night are just as readily available today as the day he bought them.  Finally, I understand people may want to forget the following, but we cannot, and I will not let you forget that there are millions of people across the United States Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, and there are thousands in Florida and in Texas who are still awaiting visits from  On the plane up yesterday, I was reading a 3-page-long article addressing, right in my community, the fact that people are sitting waiting for FEMA's response. I continue to raise at the same time that these hurricanes in Texas, southwest Louisiana, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico have occurred, forest fires in California and Montana and Oregon have occurred, and we haven't addressed drought in other areas that occurred. Just last week, tornadoes occurred in We have these disasters occurring.  I heard my colleague earlier today during morning hour make a presentation regarding a main burst in Detroit, Michigan, and that they don't have in her area sufficient drinking water. We know that the Flint, Michigan, matter isn't resolved.  This past weekend, I busted a tire on a bumpy-hole road, and we need to fix our roads in this country. This Capital ought to be called the ``Pothole of the World.''  Yet we stand here day after day discussing things that are going nowhere when people in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands are craving electricity, opening schools with no electricity, moving people from hospitals. We need safe drinking water all over this country. They need for us to show compassion and at least some decency with reference to humanity with those concerns.  Mr.Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule and the underlying legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.

During World War II, more than 260,000 Filipino soldiers from the U.commonwealth of the Philippines answered President Roosevelt's call to fight under the American flag. These individuals fought bravely, some making the ultimate sacrifice in defense of democracy and freedom. More than half a century later, our Nation made a commitment to honoring them for their service.  As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I believe it is our solemn responsibility to recognize those who put their lives on the line. That is why I was proud to work with my colleague Senator Hirono to pass into law the Filipino Veterans of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act, Public Law 114-265, to recognize the dedication and heroism of these individuals.  Now the time has come to award this Congressional Gold Medal to Filipino World War II veterans on October 25, 2017, and I could not be more proud and humbled that Nevada is home to Filipino veterans who served and are most deserving of this medal. Today I would like to again recognize and honor Filipino veterans who are living in Nevada: Sergeant Regalado Baldonado, Private Aurelio Dela Cruz, Corporal Benito Anton, and Private First Class Leonardo To these heroes, your place in history will not be forgotten. There are also many other Filipino veterans from Nevada who have passed on, but our gratitude extends to their family members who will ensure their legacy lives on.  While the awarding of this Congressional Gold Medal is a proud moment for the Filipino community and America, many Filipino veterans have yet to receive recognition for their service. There is no doubt to me that Filipino soldiers served honorably in the Commonwealth Army of the Philippines, Recognized Guerilla Forces, and New Philippine Scouts alongside U.troops during World War However, some have still not been verified by the U.for their service because they don't have the documentation the U.requires. This is an injustice that I will continue fighting so that every Filipino veteran is afforded respect for and acknowledgement of their contributions to our country.  I am honored to acknowledge all Filipino and Filipino American veterans for their dedication to our country and am proud this Congressional Gold Medal will serve as a constant reminder of the importance of the Filipino and Filipino American community in our Nation's history.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-23-pt1-PgS6712-3.txt,1863,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 469, SUNSHINE FOR REGULATIONS AND",2017.0,23.0,October
708,topic-id,711,"Madam President, I rise to discuss an issue that is extremely important to me and to many of my colleagues on this side of the aisle--the issue of judicial vacancies. I came here to work and am honored to serve on behalf of the people of the State of Nevada who sent me to One of the most pressing issues I have found since being here is, all too often Members of Congress go home before their work is finished.  Many of you here know the first piece of legislation I have introduced for the past two Congresses is my No Budget, No Pay The concept is simple. If Congress can't pass a budget and all of its spending bills on time, then Congress itself shouldn't get paid.  The Senate should apply the same concepts, in my opinion, to confirming judges. I commend our majority leader for bringing two more judges to the floor this week, but there is a lot more work to do. We need to work day and night to confirm those judges who are already on our calendar and have moved out of the Senate Judiciary The Senate has an incredible opportunity right now to confirm Federal judges who will uphold the We should be here every day, for as long as we need, to ensure all judicial vacancies are filled.  Our conference must be willing to work together in order to get the business of the Senate done. Right now, there are 149 judicial vacancies. Let me repeat that. There are 149 judicial vacancies, and the Senate has only confirmed 8 judges this session--149 vacancies, 8 judges confirmed. That means, in 9 months, with well over 100 vacancies and over 60 judicial emergencies, we have only managed to confirm 8 judges.  The minority party has undercut the confirmation process of the administration's nominees and judicial appointments. When new Presidents are elected, they have always been given an opportunity to put their team in place in short order. Historically, this is not just common courtesy, it is an expectation of the American people to have a seamless transition of power, resulting in a functional Federal  One of the eight judges confirmed was Neil Gorsuch, who I am thankful now serves on the Supreme Justice Gorsuch is an example of the type of judge we have the chance to put in place. As with Justice Gorsuch's confirmation, we need to do all that is necessary to fill these vacancies with great judges like him.  President Trump has nominated many judges and has more to nominate. For those he has already nominated, it is our duty to carefully review these nominations and ensure that these judges are confirmed in a timely manner. We must be willing to put in as much time as needed, whether that means working weekends, canceling State work periods, or working all through the night to get these Constitution-loving judges confirmed.  I know this is important to all of us, but we need to do better. Last week, I was a proud partner with Senator Perdue and several of my other colleagues in calling on the Senate to work 24/7 until we get our work done. We have a substantial list of important work to complete, including confirming the judicial nominees the President has sent us, passing tax reform, fixing our broken healthcare system, and funding the government. The American people elected us to complete these critical tasks. They elected us to deliver a simpler, fairer tax code and to make sure our Federal judiciary is fully occupied with judges whose sole purpose is to uphold the Constitution as it was written.  To my fellow Senators, I am calling on all of us to do what the people have sent us to do and not let a light schedule stop us from fulfilling our duties. The American people don't go to work 4 days a week, and neither should we. This isn't We need to work a full workweek. We must make it clear to our constituents that we are fighting for the hard-working Americans every single day. Americans do what it takes to get the job done, and we should do the same.

605,topic-id,749,"Mr.President, the resolution we are debating today demonstrates the lengths Donald Trump and the Republican Party will go to protect the special interests that contribute billions of dollars to their political campaigns.  Earlier this year, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, CFPB, issued a rule to prevent certain financial service companies from forcing consumers to sign predispute arbitration clauses that block class action lawsuits. This might sound like a boring, technical change, but it is not. At stake is nothing less than the right of millions of Americans to be heard in a court of law.  Contracts mandating forced arbitration can be found in virtually every contract someone signs these days. Every time you agree to an update to the iTunes terms of service, purchase a Fitbit, or open a credit card, you are signing away your right to join together with others to sue in a court of law if something goes wrong.  In 2010, President Obama and Democrats in Congress created the CFPB to protect the American people from predatory business practices by consumer finance companies. And while the[[Page S6744]]CFPB can't do anything about the iTunes terms or service, it can protect you, through the rule we are debating today, from companies that sell products and services related to consumer credit, automobile leasing, debt management, credit scores, payment processing, check cashing, and debt collection--industries that serve some of our most vulnerable communities.  The resolution we are debating today would eliminate these protections and expose millions to the tyranny of forced arbitration. This is particularly relevant in light of two major news stories this year in which the negligence, fraud, and malfeasance of major financial institutions harmed consumers across the country. This rule, for example, would protect the 805 Hawaii residents who had fake bank accounts opened in their names by Wells These people suffered real and material harm, but the fine print in their agreements explicitly prevents them from banding together in a class action lawsuit. This rule would prevent banks like Wells Fargo from doing this now and in the future.  In the wake of the massive Equifax data breach, the company initially forced consumers who registered for credit monitoring to forgo their right to join a class action and instead force them into private arbitration. These are high-profile examples of the problem but aren't the only ones. Hundreds of Hawaii residents have filed complaints with the CFPB about problems with credit reporting agencies and credit report errors that can increase the cost of a loan or result in the denial of credit.  Under a recent class action settlement, Hawaii customers falsely matched with someone on the terrorist watch list can receive over $7,000 from Is it really any wonder why TransUnion and other credit bureaus have fought so hard to block class action lawsuits with forced arbitration?  This rule would also protect consumers from predatory payday lenders that are extorting over $3 million in fees a year from Hawaii consumers alone. Over 98 percent of storefront payday lenders use forced arbitration clauses in their contracts.  Hawaii is home to more than tens of thousands of Active-Duty servicemembers, reservists, and veterans. This rule protects them too. In 2016, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency fined Wells Fargo millions of dollars after they illegally foreclosed on homes or repossessed cars in violation of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Without the CFPB rules, similarly affected servicemembers would be restricted from banding together to sue. It is why the American Legion, in announcing their support for the CFPB's rule and opposition to this resolution, said it would be ``extremely unfair to bar servicemembers, veterans, and other consumers from joining together to enforce statutory and constitutional protections in court.'' It isn't difficult to understand why. Big banks and megacorporations want to force their customers to adjudicate disputes through arbitration.  According to the CFPB, companies win claims in arbitration 91 percent of the time. The deck is stacked against the consumer in these forced arbitration situations, and after these judgments, consumers were forced to pay an average of over $7,000 to companies to even engage in the proceedings. Talk about a major imbalance of power.  Director Cordray and the entire CFPB spent years developing this essential consumer protection regulation, but I am not at all surprised that the President and his allies in Congress desperately want to eliminate this consumer protection rule.

763,topic-id,595,"Mr.President, Donald Trump and the Republican Congress have spent most of the past year pushing their misplaced priorities, no matter the direct and collateral damage it causes for millions of Americans across the country.  There are many examples to choose from to illustrate this point. Just last night, the Vice President had to come in and break a tie to protect huge corporations from the victims of the frauds they perpetuated. Now they are putting together a huge tax cut for the wealthiest people in our country, and they are trying to sell it as a raise for the middle class. In Hawaii, we call this shibai--or B. But there is perhaps no issue in which Donald Trump's dangerous agenda has caused more harm than his quest to deprive millions of Americans the healthcare and the health insurance they need. His first attempt at repealing the Affordable Care Act would have thrown as many as 30 million people off of their health insurance. Thanks to the combined efforts of so many people--active people, engaged people across the country--we defeated this proposal.  A few months later, continuing the assault on healthcare, Donald Trump renewed his attack on our healthcare system under the so-called Graham-Cassidy bill. But once again, the combined outrage of millions kept the bill from coming to the floor.  In the time they spent on their single-minded, unrelenting quest to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have allowed authorization for the Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, to lapse. Nearly 30,000 children in Hawaii and more than 9 million across the country depend on CHIP for their healthcare. You heard just now my colleague from Ohio tell you stories about the children in Ohio--children with asthma. In Hawaii, we have children with asthma, children with diabetes.[[Page S6808]]  Nearly 30,000 children in Hawaii who rely on CHIP for their healthcare are being affected by our inaction. Primarily covering children from low-income families who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, CHIP provides critical and much needed care for children with complex medical conditions.  Although existing funding has allowed States to stretch budgets to keep the program in place, money is quickly running out. If we don't take action soon, as many as 4 million children could lose their health insurance entirely--4 million children.  Congress cannot and should not be complicit in what I would call gross negligence. It is not negligence; it is gross negligence.  CHIP has traditionally enjoyed bipartisan support. In fact, it emerged from the committee with bipartisan support. I am glad Senators Wyden and Hatch have come together to create the KIDS Act, which I have cosponsored. This bill would extend CHIP's authorization and funding through 2022 and provide much needed certainty to millions of families across the country.  If we brought this bill to the floor right now, it would pass. It would clearly have the votes to pass. The only question is, Why don't we do it? Why don't we provide healthcare to millions of children in our country, for Heaven's sake?  I cannot believe that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are afraid to risk incurring the wrath of a vengeful I cannot believe that is what is keeping them from doing the right thing.

790,topic-id,1659,"Mr.President, I rise once again today to talk about how we are working to reform our outdated Tax Code and to provide much needed tax relief to our Nation's small businesses and to hard-working families and ranchers. We are working to not only provide hard-working taxpayers with tax relief but also to strengthen our economy and to stimulate job creation.  Along with the regulatory relief we have already provided and are working to continue to provide, this tax relief is all about a growing economy, more jobs, and higher wages for hard-working Americans and then making sure that they not only keep more of their earnings after tax but that they see growing wages due to a stronger economy that is so important after the last decade of stagnant wages and income. It is important to understand that this tax relief is both. It is absolutely about lowering the tax burden, but it is also about moving wages and incomes higher. That is the rising tide that lifts all boats in our country.  Today, the House of Representatives passed a budget resolution that the Senate sent them last week, so now we have completed the first step in terms of enacting pro-growth tax reform that, as I said, will provide tax relief to millions of middle-class families who have been struggling to get ahead over the past decade.  Today, I want to focus on how our tax proposal will reduce the tax burden on small businesses. Small businesses make up 96 percent of all employers in my State and over 90 percent of the businesses in the country. Over 90 percent of the businesses in this country are small businesses.  Earlier this week, we had a very productive meeting with the President to talk about our priorities for tax relief, and I specifically highlighted to him the importance of ensuring that tax reform works for our small businesses. When you talk about small businesses, you are talking about farmers and ranchers. As I said, 90 percent of all the businesses in this country are small businesses. So we are working with the administration and with the House to enact tax reforms that will enable American families to keep more of their hard-earned money and, as I said, empower our small businesses to invest and grow.  Our effort is about growing our economy and regaining our economic competitiveness in a global economy. Our Tax Code needs to ensure that our small business owners and entrepreneurs can compete in that global economy.  Small businesses, as I said, are the engine that drives our economy. They are the backbone of our economy. Small businesses create more jobs and employ more people than major corporations. They are the heart and soul of Main Streets across These businesses earn the majority of all business income in the United States and employ over half the private sector workforce in 49 out of 50 They employ over half of the private sector workforce in 49 of our 50  Over the past month, I have hosted tax reform roundtables across North Dakota to hear directly from our job creators--from our State's small businesses, from our ag leaders, from our farmers, and from our ranchers. What are their priorities when we talk about tax relief and tax reform?  Our tax blueprint supports those small businesses throughout the country by promoting job creation, economic growth, and, as I said earlier, global competitiveness. We propose to do this in a number of ways, but the biggest and most impactful thing is that we are lowering the tax burden. It needs to be tax relief.  Right now, for our small businesses, the marginal tax rate can reach as high as 44.6 percent. Think about that. Almost half of their income is going to Federal income tax. That is nearly twice the average rate of the rest of the industrialized world. So here we are trying to compete with that high tax rate--almost double compared to the average rate of the rest of the industrialized world.  By reducing the maximum tax rate for sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S corporations to 25 percent, we are creating greater economic growth and opportunity as small businesses reinvest in their businesses, in their employees, in their communities, and generate job growth.  Additionally, many small businesses, including farmers and ranchers, do not have access to the equity they need to operate, instead relying heavily on debt financing to fund their businesses. They go to the bank and borrow. This is particularly true for new and beginning enterprises, including new startups in technology--not just farming and ranching and traditional businesses but businesses across the board.  Our Tax Code needs to incentivize our Nation's entrepreneurs to start their business, and we need to make sure they can get access to capital. They need to be able to get access to that capital, but when they do, by and large, they are going to the bank and borrowing. That means they have to pay interest on that debt. So it is very important for small businesses that the interest on that debt be deductible. That is a huge cost, particularly for our farmers and ranchers. They don't have opportunities to float equity. They don't raise equity for their farming operation when they need to buy a tractor or a combine or you name it. They have to go to the bank and borrow.  So the deductibility of that interest expense to them is absolutely vital in their interests. That is true with small businesses across the board. When you look at small businesses in your community, they go to the bank and they borrow, and that interest cost is a big part of their business expense. They need to be able to continue to deduct it.  In the framework that we have proposed, another very important issue is being able to expense investments. If you really want to trigger growth, you encourage that investment. So the tax reform framework or proposal that we have put forward allows, in the first 5 years, full expensing of new investments. That is very stimulative to our economy. It is very pro-growth.  The other piece that I think is very important here is that we keep the section 179 expensing longer term. I think,[[Page S6842]]as we proposed it now, we would have expensing in the first 5 years--full expensing. That is great. That is, as I say, stimulative to the economy. But beyond that, then we need to make sure that section 179 expensing is there so that small businesses, farmers, ranchers, and others will know that they are going to continue to be able to expense their investment in new plants and new equipment. That is what keeps those small businesses growing. That is what keeps them hiring more people. That is what creates more jobs, and that is what pushes wages and income higher.  Also, we need to simplify and streamline the Tax Right now, the Tax Code is nearly 70,000 pages long--talk about being difficult and complex. Americans, right now, currently spend 6 billion hours a year complying with that Tax That is ridiculous. Can you imagine 6 billion hours a year just to figure out how to pay your taxes? So here is somebody who wants to pay their taxes. They spend all that time and all that effort just to figure out how much they have to pay. Obviously, we can do a lot better than that.  Our goal through tax reform is to allow the vast majority of Americans to file their tax return on a single simple page. I will mention that again. I think it is important. Our goal is for the vast majority of Americans, in essence, to file their tax return on one page and to make it easier to pay your taxes, to figure out what you owe, and to take away all that stress and all that difficulty in just trying to pay your taxes.  Many economists agree that high business taxes reduce wages to workers, raise costs for consumers, and reduces returns on retirement savings. Maintaining these high tax rates do nothing to improve the fairness of our system. They only punish everyday, hard-working, tax-paying citizens and reduce economic opportunity in  I will conclude on the same point that I started with, and that is by saying that there are two objectives here. It is not just to simplify and reduce the tax burden, so that people have more of their earnings in their pocket after paying taxes, but the other is to make sure they earn more and that we move wages and income higher. If you look at the growth rate in our economy over the last decade, it has struggled, in essence, to get to 2 percent. But compare that to the period from World War II to the present. Over that longer period, we averaged 3.3 percent. We want to get that growth rate back up.  We started to get that growth rate back up by reducing the regulatory burden. Over the course of this year, the administration and this Congress have done a lot to reduce the regulatory burden. Our growth rate has ticked up in the most recent month to 3.1 percent, the highest it has been in a long time. So what we want to do is to combine that regulatory relief and tax relief and get that higher growth rate. We also want to add an infrastructure package. When you put those things together, what do you get? You get more jobs, higher wages, higher income, and a higher standard of living for hard-working American citizens across this great That is the objective. That is what we are trying to do.  We all need to work together, and our goal is to get that done before the end of the year.  With that, I yield the floor.

But the reason why we are doing it next week is because Minnesota is about to run out of money. And my dear friend knows because I sat with him, even this week, trying to work something out.  Now, we know of these health centers, and in this bill we doubled the money for them. Of course, this bill is offset. We do it in a fiscally responsible manner. But this is not something to play political games with because some leadership Member wants to hold it up and go into We believe committees should be able to do their work.  Now, we started out, and Committee Chair Greg Walden, three times, was asked to delay by the ranking Democrat of the committee, even though we know the timeline is about to hit a number of States that cannot wait for a lack of action here.  So, yes, I am upset by this, but I am more upset about the number of times we sat down to try to work something out. And it was only yesterday I was told, Democrats said, no, they don't want to do anything, so we should just go forward. That is not the way this place should work.  If you look at this bill, I believe, if the committee had the freedom on the other side without the leadership telling them they had to vote ``no,'' it would have come out of the committee with a much different vote.

The committee decided on its own that it thought that the cuts that were being proposed by the Republicans are very harmful to some very important programs in healthcare for seniors that the gentleman, in his previous remarks telling us what the schedule was, said were very important.

The gentleman knows that I reached out to him, I don't know how many months ago, before a break, numerous times, right over on the floor on his side of the aisle, and I said: I am very concerned with what I am hearing on the Democratic side in the committee; I would like to get CHIP done early. And I asked for your assistance, and you helped.  There is one higher position on your side of the aisle who called the Speaker numerous times and pretty much shut down your committee. So three times we were asked to delay, and we did.  That is why, this week, I went back to all of you and said: Let's work out if you have a difference of opinion in pay-fors.  It was not us who walked away from the table. It was the message I was delivered from the other side of the aisle.  So I don't know why we are having this discussion. I don't know why you are asking these questions. It is you and your side of the aisle that have said no. It is us who said: Let's sit down and work this out.  But let me walk through a few of the pay-fors so you understand them and so the American public can understand them, because I don't think they are controversial.  We require health insurance companies to pay claims when they cover Medicaid enrollees while keeping Medicaid as the payor of last resort. Now, that saves $4 billion.  We say that individuals can't skip on their premium for 90 days and get free coverage. That saves $5 billion.  We say if somebody wins a high-dollar lottery, those winners should not be eligible for  Now, your side of the aisle voted against that in committee. So the argument that you are making that it is not bipartisan is true. Your side of the aisle believes that if someone wins millions of dollars in the lottery, they should still be eligible for  That will save $600 million that will actually go to the disabled, those who need this.  And what is more important, these States should not have to wait. These States should not be put in this position. Colorado has just announced that it will freeze enrollment. It will freeze enrollment because you guys walked away from the table. It will freeze enrollment because you say high-dollar millionaire lottery winners should still stay on  I don't think that is where the American public believes this debate should go.

CHIP is in effect; IPAB is not. It hasn't even created a board yet. So what you are saying to me is let's offset something that hasn't even been created.  What I am saying is the last time we had this bill on the floor, it was bipartisan votes. Democrats voted for it as well; 43 cosponsors on your side of the aisle.  So I don't think this question is just to me; it is probably for the whole body. But I think the reason the majority of the body wants to get rid of it is it hasn't even been created, and the majority of the people think it is a bad idea. So let's get rid of it now.

This bill was not marked up in committee prior to its expiring, prior to the authorization ending. So when the gentleman talks to me about time, with all due respect, had it been an item of importance--which it is a bipartisan bill. We both want to see this get done. The gentleman is correct, this program exists. The gentleman is also correct that, until we fix this, there will be States that will be running out of money. That is a great concern to us.

He quickly advanced and became the deputy military legislative assistant in a short period of time. Jeremy was full of life, always had a big smile on his face, and brought a lot of joy into my office. I would like to share a bit about Jeremy's life and family and then about his time in my office.  At the age of only 35, Jeremy fell into the arms of Jesus, doing what he loved: climbing Capitol Peak in Aspen, CO, on August 6. He was the loving husband of 7 years to Jamie and the proud father of 2-month-old, Jeremy was born in Cincinnati, OH, on March 9, 1982, to his parents, Bob and Linda Shull, and was raised alongside his two brothers, Ben and From an early age, Jeremy's love of the outdoors and his leadership skills were apparent to all. He went on to graduate from Perrysburg High School, in Ohio, and Grove City College, in Pennsylvania, where he discovered his love of rugby and international travel.  After college, he made his way to Washington, DC, where he was involved in the Falls Church Fellows Program and worked on Capitol Hill in my office. During this time he met the love of his life, Jamie, at Summer's Best Two Weeks, a Christian sports camp in Boswell, PA, and the two were married in 2010. As a couple, Jeremy and Jamie lived and worked in Washington, DC, Uganda, and went to graduate school at Geneva College in In 2014, Jeremy earned his master's degree in counseling and eventually went on to earn his LAC and LPC licenses with concentrations in trauma and addictions.  Shortly after earning their degrees, Jeremy and Jamie moved out west to Parker, CO, to pursue their adventurous dreams. Jeremy worked at a crisis stabilization unit and in other settings where he counseled clients in their worst moments, helping them to create vision and hope for their futures. To quote Jeremy, he served others, ``to sustain the weary and help clients overcome internal walls between them and a thriving life.'' This past May, they welcomed their beautiful son, Jack Ellis, into their family.  Jeremy is remembered by his wife, Jamie, and their 2-month-old son, He is survived by Bob and Linda Shull of Fairlawn, OH, brother Ben and his wife Emily Shull, and nieces Piper and Scout Shull of Cincinnati, OH, brother Josh Shull of Washington, DC, grandparents Norma Hissong of Bath, OH, Ken and Meg Shull of Seneca, South Carolina, numerous aunts, uncles, and cousins in Ohio and South Carolina, mother and father-in-law Mike and Teri Maurer and brother-in-law Justin Maurer of Washington,  In 2007, Jeremy traveled with me on a CODEL to Ireland, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, France, and The CODEL was en route to Africa when we had a required crew stop. The stop happened to be only about 45 miles away from where my daughter Molly was teaching and staying with her family. We only had about 24 hours on the ground, and it was meant for a time for us to adjust from jet lag, but Jeremy and I, along with my son-in-law and grandson, drove to the base of Grappa, which is close to sea level. Four hours later, we reached the top, which was 5,800 feet in elevation. We walked to the World War I monuments at the top of Grappa and hiked back down.  Later in the trip, when we had a break from our meetings, the delegation divided up and some of my staff decided to do a little sightseeing in Venice but Jeremy chose to stay back and play soccer with my daughter's kids. In doing so, he gave the rest of the delegation a real gift. Jeremy had been to Venice a few years before and had hidden a =100 note behind a brick in a wall hanging over one of the many canals. He gave us a list of clues as we went to Instead of sightseeing, we spent the time following the clues Jeremy gave to us and finally discovered the location. When our military escort pulled the brick out of the canal wall, he found the =100 note laying behind it. We took a photo of the note and then placed it back in the wall. We were careful to make sure that nobody saw us replace it. It was a very clever set of clues, and it became the most memorable times to visit Afterwards, we asked Jeremy why he hid this money in Venice and also in a couple other European cities. He said that one day he wanted to bring his future wife to Europe and take her on a treasure hunt. That was He was overflowing with adventure and very intentional in how he lived out his life of adventure.  Jeremy had a strong faith in Jesus Christ and lived his life to the full. Jeremy was best known for his adventurous spirit, curious nature, intentional relationships, and servant-heart. He was a volunteer firefighter and was devoted to his growing family. He put others first, and in a culture and generation that is more me focused, Jeremy was the opposite, always putting others before himself.

456,topic-id,486,"Mr.President, we have a very significant couple of votes coming up. One is the nomination of Scott Palk to be a district judge for the Western District of We have been working on this for about 2 years now. He is one of the highest qualified individuals.  I thank the leader for moving forward on his nomination this week. I know judicial nominations are a priority of the leader's, and I share his belief in the importance of filling the many vacancies we have with judges who will uphold the rule of law, not predetermine outcomes and not legislate from the bench. Scott Palk fulfills and embodies this philosophy, and I have full confidence that he will be a judge whom Oklahoma and the Nation will be proud of.  This nomination is of great need to the Western District, located in Oklahoma City, which has a very heavy caseload. In fact, we have three vacancies on the bench there. One vacancy goes back over 4 years and another over 3 years, so this nomination is desperately needed.  Mr.Palk was nominated in the last Congress--so it was not this Congress--during the previous administration. He made it through the Judiciary Committee by voice vote before we ran out of time at the end of the 114th We would have had this done, but we just flat ran out of time. He had bipartisan support in the last Congress and has in this Congress, with there having been a 17-to-3 vote in the Judiciary It is not very often that happens.  He also has bipartisan support back home in He comes highly recommended by David Everyone here knows who David Boren is. The Presiding Officer remembers David He was my predecessor in this seat. He was the president of the University of Oklahoma but is retired now. He is a Actually, he and I were elected to the House of Representatives in Oklahoma on the same day, so we go back a long way. David Boren knows Mr.Palk very well because Scott Palk has worked at the University of Oklahoma College of Law for about 15 years now after his having left a successful career in both the U.attorney's office and as a county district attorney.  David Boren said of Palk--now, this is a Democrat talking about Scott Palk--``He would make an excellent judge,'' would be ``balanced and fair in his approach,'' and has ``an excellent reputation for complete honesty and integrity.'' I don't know what more you could want in a judge.  That is David Boren talking, my predecessor in the  Again, I thank the leader for his commitment to fulfilling our judicial vacancies, and I ask that my colleagues support the nomination, as I am sure they will, with a ``yes'' vote for Mr. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

769,topic-id,4534,"Mr.President, I came back just a week ago from visiting our troops stationed all around the world, in all the commands--AFRICOM, EUCOM, CENTCOM--and talked to them about the threats in all these regions.  At a time when I hear colleagues across the aisle and political pundits ask the question, Why do we have troops in various places like Africa, it is important to remember the strategic importance of  I remember 10 years ago we didn't have a command for It was part of three commands: Pacific Command, Central Command, and European Now we have It is its own command. It seemed a little unreasonable that we were treating Africa as somewhat of a stepchild when that is the breeding ground out there for a lot of the things happening in terms of terrorism.  Despite our military's reach and influence, our Nation's shrinking defense budget has put AFRICOM at risk during a time when commanders are saying we face the most dangerous world we have ever faced, and we have.  I have often said that I look wistfully back at the days of the Cold War, when we had two superpowers and they were predictable. We knew what they had. They knew what we had. You have people from all over the world who are putting together equipment that we never dreamed they would have.  We have just gone through 8 years of another administration. I don't say this critically of him, but one thing about President Obama was that he was a committed, sincere liberal. Liberals generally don't pay a lot of attention to the military. Now we find ourselves in a situation where we are hurting. A lot of people assume that we don't have any problems militarily.  Sometimes I remind people that up until about 1962, we spent more than half--52 percent in 1962--of all of our revenues on defending What is it today? It is 15 percent. When I tell people that, they are in shock that we are in the situation we are in. We have terrorist groups in Africa--such as ISIS, al-Shabaab, and Boko Haram--and they are all growing in capability and have expanded their areas throughout This year we have seen horrific events occurring at the hands of these extremists. On October 14, a truck bombing killed 300 people in Somalia's capital. In Niger--it just happened--we had four of our U.soldiers who were killed in action on October 4 by an ISIS group.  We know that we have serious problems. I think it is a great disservice for people to say that we must have known that we had the threat that was out there in Niger, when in fact we didn't know it. They even compare it sometimes with I remember I was there at the time. I remember Chris Chris Stevens was the Ambassador who went there. He was in my office right before he left, talking about the threats that were there, talking about the Taliban, his training there, and talking about organized terrorist activity.  I have to remind people that the persons who are responsible for advising the Secretary of State, who at that time was Hillary Clinton, and the President, who was President Obama at that time, are the DNI--that was James Clapper at that time--the Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of When the Benghazi event happened, the annex was blown up. They all said at that time--they advised us, the President, and the Secretary of State--that they were forewarned by more than a month that on the anniversary of 9/11 things would blow up, and it was going to be an organized attack.  Right now there is an investigation going on to determine whether or not there is any way that we could have anticipated that in Niger this would be happening, and so far, that hasn't come up.  Despite the best of intentions, many of our partners in the region lack the capacity and the effectiveness to adequately defend themselves. People say: What do we have to gain there? This is exactly the same situation that we saw in Afghanistan prior to the war there. The terrorists have to have a safe harbor to train in, and that is what has happened.  During my travel, I had the opportunity to meet Prime Minister Benjamin I have to say this about him. I have never seen him so ecstatic. A lot of us were looking back at what they were trying to do during the Obama administration. It was disheartening to think that they put together this Iran deal, and our Secretary of State at that time, John Kerry, talked about how great it was and all of these concessions that were made when, in fact, that wasn't the case. Nonetheless, when our President came out and said that he was not going to recertify the Iran deal, that was kind of neat because people don't realize that it takes a recertification every 30 days by the President in order to keep the Iran deal together. He has not done that.  Shortly after that, I happened to be talking to Prime Minister It was an incredible relief to him that we were going to be looking at this. Still today, I think we all understand that Iran is the one that is financing terrorism all around the world. We discussed the shortcomings and looked forward to working with my colleagues in the future so that Iran does not become a nuclear nation, not now or ever.  What is perhaps the most encouraging is the message that this approach sends to the rest of the world, specifically to North President Trump's approach shows me--and, more importantly, shows Kim Jong Un--that an America-first foreign policy means that we refuse to take a single-minded approach to global threats.  I recall the changes taking place 8 years ago when our new President, President Obama, started his appeasing tour by going over and talking about[[Page S6810]]how America hadn't been doing the right thing. Now, all of a sudden, we have changed that around. That is what is taking place now. At that time we didn't have the threats that are out there today.  We look at North North Korea is run by a questionable person, totally unpredictable, according to our own military leaders. He is rapidly getting the capability not just of an ICBM--he has already proven he has an ICBM--but with a range not just of Alaska and some of those areas but of the entire continental United  On July 4 he launched his first successful If that were fired on a standard trajectory, that missile could have reached Some experts think it could have reached even further, into the continental United In light of that test, the Defense Intelligence Agency updated their assessment of the timeline by which North Korea would have the capability of hitting an American city. Instead of being 2 years out and 3 years out, it is now down to 1 year out. Some people say they have it right now. We have that threat that is out there. It is the greatest threat, in my opinion, that we are facing now or that we have ever faced.  Following this, on September 3, North Korea tested what is believed to be a hydrogen bomb. That would be seven times the power of what was dropped on Even if delivered by a relatively inaccurate ICBM, there would be horrible damage imposed on our continent.  It is important to remember that all of this power is being wielded by an erratic despot, Kim Jong North Korean officials have stated that they are not interested in diplomacy until they have an ICBM capable of reaching the east coast of the United  What does that tell you? It tells you that they are on their way. This stresses the need for the United States to enhance and accelerate our ballistic missile defense systems and to continue to put pressure on North Korea through every other means we can, diplomatic and otherwise.  My recent travels enforced again what I have been saying for some time; that is, that this is the most dangerous situation we have had, certainly in my lifetime. We have an opportunity to counter that threat right now. We are in the midst of our One thing about the National Defense Authorization Act is that this act is going to pass. It has passed for 55 consecutive years so we know it is going to pass now. But we need to go ahead and get it done. It is important because the primary constitutional responsibility that we have is to provide for the common defense of our great  We have serious readiness issues that are going to have to be addressed, and they are being addressed in this bill. I am the chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee, and we have fought hard to ensure that this year's NDAA takes care of these shortfalls we have had. Our forces are smaller now. We actually had a Readiness Subcommittee hearing, and we had the Vice Chiefs of all of the services there. They came in and said that right now we are in the same situation we were in when we had the hollow force following the Carter administration in the 1970s.  In January of this year, the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, General Daniel Allyn, said: What it comes down to is that we are going to be too late. Our soldiers arrived too late. Our soldiers required too much time to close the manning, the training, and the equipment we have, and the end result is extensive casualties to civilians and to our forces.  We are talking about death. That is what is at stake right here. Just last week, I met with the Secretary of the Air Force, Heather Wilson, to discuss aviation readiness. Right now we are 1,500 pilots short, and 1,300 of those are fighter pilots. Only 50 percent of the Air Force's squadrons are actually trained and ready to conduct all of their assigned missions. One-third of our ground brigades don't work. They are not ready for combat. As to the aviation brigades, it is the same thing.  Right now, as we know, the Marines use our fleet of F-18s. Sixty-two percent of them don't work. They don't have the parts for combat. We have this situation. That is going to have to be direct. This year's bill will increase the troop levels. We will do what is necessary to correct these problems. We need to get moving on that and make people aware that help is on the way.  By the way, here is one of my concerns in this bill. A lot of people are interested in the BRAC process. We do prohibit base realignment closings to take place for another year. The reason for that is not that there may be excess capacity right now or excess resources out there, but when we are in a rebuilding mode, we would rather be able to use those resources that aren't being used now rather than build new ones. One thing is true about a BRAC; it always loses money the first 3 years. Right now we can't afford to lose any of the money that goes to defending  Anyway, of the additional funding, there is going to be $8.5 billion for the missile defense that has been suffering, and we are going to be doing some good things. As we continue the conference process, which started today--we had our first conference meeting today--we need to focus on where we are.  Again, I repeat, the threat is there. We understand that. We know what is happening in By the way, the number of troops we have over there--you have to quit using this number of about 6,000--is really 1,300 troops for the entire continent who are not committed or working in some of the We need to get busy on that.                    Environmental Protection Agency  Mr.President, I have another issue I wish to visit. A lot of people are critical of what is happening right now in the Environmental Protection I feel I have to talk about this because, first of all, I was chairman of the committee that had jurisdiction over the Environmental Protection Agency for about 8 years. I see the things that are happening now, improvements that are being made.  One is by a guy named Scott Scott Pruitt happens to be from He is doing things now, and I don't know of anyone who has ever been abused during a confirmation process like he was. Poor Scott sat there. As a general rule, after a committee gets through with that process, they have questions for the record. Normally, they are somewhere between 15 and 20 questions for the record. Do you know how many questions Scott Pruitt got? He got 675 questions for the record. Anyway, he sustained that. He is now doing great things.  Over the last 8 years, I have had little, if any, chance to praise the work of the EPA, but I can do it now. After 8 years of being relentlessly targeted by the Obama administration to shut out our farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and energy industries, we have an administration that will listen to them and work with them. This is what jobs are all about.  There is a lot of talk about the visit that was made to our conference by President Trump yesterday. What he talked about most of the time was jobs. We are in the position to correct it.  What have we done to do that? A lot of the overregulations have been eliminated. There is the caricature of businesses referred to as greedy, loony boogeymen. But in reality, businesses are run by people who want what is best for America, for their families, and for the stockholders.  Now, like any sector of society, you are going to find a few bad actors, but we have laws and remedies in place to make sure we go after those individuals. The last administration treated those they regulated as the enemy, not as partners in ensuring that the environment was taken care of, which led to very harmful, unworkable regulations.  All of that is changing right now with President Trump and his administration. The administration realizes that working with those they regulate will produce better outcomes than only listening to those who wish to drive the industry into the ground. Administrator Pruitt has been meeting with farmers, ranchers, energy producers, and other industries to listen to and learn about how regulations affect them and how a worthwhile regulation might be implemented in a way that is producing an unintended harm.  I really cannot see why this is a bad thing, as the goal of the EPA is not to put companies or farmers out of business; it is to put forward policies that protect the environment and do not have a heavy cost, but just meeting with those who have been shut out of[[Page S6811]]the process in the past has extremists on the left seeing red. I guess they are just upset that they have lost their monopoly and their ability to write rules for the  Pruitt and the EPA are also moving forward to repeal the unlawful waters of the United This is one of the things, if you talk to the farmers throughout not just Oklahoma but throughout America, they will say, of all of the rules and regulations, this is the most harmful. This is 1. That is what they say. In fact, Tom Buchanan is the head of the Farm Bureau in the State of Oklahoma, and he says that is the problem.  People are not aware. In my State of Oklahoma, when you get out into Western Oklahoma, it is dry out there. I mean, it is about as arid as any part of the United Yet we know, if they were to move that jurisdiction of water away from the States and to the Federal Government, as was proposed in a rule that was promulgated by the previous administration, that area in Western Oklahoma would be considered a wetland before it is over. Anyway, that is probably, singularly, the best of the rules that he changed.  By the way, if anyone wants to see the rules--a lot of people say the President has not been doing anything. Most of these rules and regulations--there are up to 48 now--that have been costing jobs and putting people out of business have now been addressed by this administration, by the Trump administration, and very successfully. Right now, we are in the process of getting some of these things done.  The waters rule is going to take a while to get done because that is going to take some hearings and so forth. Another of the rules the EPA is working on repealing is the Clean Power Now, this is the thing that came from the Paris show. In fact, I have done this before. I have talked about the history of these things that have been put forth for 21 consecutive years now by the U.N., which is that they have these meetings. They get 196 countries together, and they try to see what they can do to get them to reduce CO2 emissions, when, in fact, they have not been able to do this.  Besides that, 87 percent of the power that is developed to run our country is either from fossil fuels or it is nuclear. If you extract those, as they tried to do, how do you run the machine called America? The answer is, you can't.  Anyway, as far as the Clean Power Plan, that was put together by President Obama, and it was something you could talk about as long as you wanted to, but the fact is, it was not good for the country. The rule was so unpopular that 27 States, 37 rural electric co-ops, and 3 labor unions challenged it in court. The cost of the rule was estimated to be $292 billion, but I have seen estimates that are well in excess of $400 billion.  The plan would raise electricity prices in 47 States; 40 of those States would see double-digit increases, and these increases would be shouldered by American families, many of whom already have to choose between making rent payments and paying their power bills or choosing between putting food on their tables or paying their power bills. The plan would also see the closure of 66 powerplants and eliminate over 125,000 jobs in the coal industry--an industry that has already been struggling in recent years.  The goal of this rule was to effectively end the use of coal-fired powerplants, which is a cheap and bountiful energy. What benefit would we get out of this? It would be more expensive energy.  By the way, the whole idea of the Paris thing was not just the Clean Power Plan put forth by our President; it was also what other countries were forced to do. For example, in signing on to this deal in Paris, which everyone was so upset about, China committed, for the next 10 years, to continue to increase, every 10 days, an additional coal-fired powerplant. Then they would try to reduce them after that.  What kind of a deal is that? They look back at the United States and think they know what is going to happen to our manufacturing base. They would go to China if we had to do this thing.  The most ridiculous thing about this is, the President's commitment under the Clean Power Plan was to reduce our CO2 emissions by somewhere between 26 and 28 percent by 2025. The problem with that is, it cannot be done. We even called in the EPA so they may tell us how this could be done, and they agreed it could not be done.  Anyway, that is something that is behind us now. I commend Scott Pruitt for realizing the legal footing of this rule and seeing that the costs the American people will bear under this rule is not going to happen.  Just last week, the EPA announced that it will end its controversial policy known as sue and settle. This is a good one. It is a policy that has cost the taxpayers an estimated $67 billion in new regulations that stemmed from this practice. How this works is that some extremist group will come in and sue the EPA for not doing something, and so they go into a settlement agreement with the EPA, and the EPA is in concert with them to come up with the very thing they were not able to get through legislatively. It is called sue and settle. You have heard the President talk about ending that practice. It is one that needs to be ended, and it is going to be. This practice circumvented the Administrative Procedure Act and usually ended up in settlements that were extremely beneficial to extremist groups and got them exactly what they wanted all the time.  My State of Oklahoma was a victim of this practice. In 2011, the EPA used consent agreements that stemmed from court cases in other States, not in Oklahoma, as Oklahoma was not even part of it or aware of it. They do that to overrule the State's Regional Haze Plan to impose EPA's own costly plan on Oklahoma electricity ratepayers. Now, the plan the EPA has pushed on this State costs an estimated $282 million each year. That is just in our State of Oklahoma, and it is something we would have to pay for.  The regional haze problem has nothing to do with health. It is all visibility. So this was ruining the theme of the Obama Never mind that regional haze is entirely a visibility issue and not a health issue, never mind that Congress specifically gave States the authority to regulate regional haze under the Clean Air Act in the amendments I strongly supported when they went through because it is a visibility issue and not a health issue. Yet because an environmentalist group did not like how Oklahoma was handling its own business, it sued the EPA in court outside of Oklahoma and did not include Oklahoma as a party in the case. The EPA capitulated and entered into an agreement with some of the extremists that conveniently required the EPA to impose its own expensive plan on my State of  So I am glad Administrator Pruitt has announced an end to this policy, and I urge my colleagues to take up 119. It is the Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act, of which I am an original cosponsor, to ensure that this practice is ended across the government and cannot be implemented by future administrations.  Finally, I would like to encourage the EPA to move ahead with a hinted-at, pending directive that would restrict scientists who receive EPA grants from serving on the Agency's scientific advisory committees. I have previously expressed concerns over the composition of the Agency's advisory committees for many reasons, including highlighting the fact that many science advisers under the Obama EPA, including a majority of those on the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee--that is called CASAC--have received considerable financial support from the They are calling into question their independence and the overall integrity of panels on which the advisers sit.  The National Academy of Sciences and the EPA's own ``Peer Review Handbook'' state that grants can constitute a conflict or a lack of impartiality. We are not talking about small grants either; we are talking about millions of dollars in grants. During the last year of the Obama administration, CASAC had six of seven members receiving these. Keep in mind, six of the seven members received a total of $119 million in grants--in EPA research grants--and three of the members received in excess of $25 million each. These are the scientists who are making the decisions. There were 22 of the 26 members of the CASAC Subcommittee on Particulate Matter who[[Page S6812]]received more than $330 million in EPA grants.  The scientists who receive vast sums of money from the very agencies they are advising certainly constitute a conflict of interest and, at a minimum, give an appearance of a lack of impartiality. As such, I welcome the news that Administrator Pruitt will be seeking to limit this worrisome practice.  I have laid out only a few of the many great things the EPA is doing right now and what Administrator Pruitt is doing. I got to know him a long time ago. In fact, I flew him around the State in my airplane back when he ran for the first statewide office. He is a guy who is a tiger and who is doing the right thing. I am very proud of what they are doing.  After this morning, the EPA is now advancing five EPA nominees for the EPA general counsel and for the Offices of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, Air and Radiation, Water, and Chemical Safety and Pollution Each of these nominees is needed for the issues I have talked about and for the many others that are on the Agency's plate.  Scott Pruitt has been working on so much of the President's conservative agenda alone, and he needs help to run these policies. I call on my colleagues and the leadership to prioritize these nominations. You cannot get this stuff done unless you have help. We have never seen a time when we have gotten this far into an administration and have had this large of a number of people who have not been confirmed.  Mr.President, I do want to mention one other thing because, for some reason, the Democrats have decided they are going to run out the whole 30 hours on the confirmation of a guy named Scott I have to say, Scott Palk has been doing a great job. In fact, on the vote that just took place on him, he received 79 votes in the U.Yet, just to be obstructionists, they are still demanding 30 hours.  Scott Palk is an experienced prosecutor with a decade of service. He was the assistant district attorney for Cleveland County in my State of Oklahoma and spent 9 years as an assistant U.attorney in the criminal division of the Western District of He has a reputation for honesty, integrity, and a commitment to fairly applying the law. Mr.Palk will serve Oklahoma with distinction as a principled jurist who will uphold the  He is going to be confirmed. We know he is going to be confirmed because he already received 79 votes. There is no reason to delay it, other than to hold people here and be obstructionists. I would urge my friends on the other side of the aisle to go ahead and confirm the guy.

923,topic-id,379,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, this bill comes to you, having been unanimously voted on a recorded vote out of committee, but it has been a long time in coming and it has a long history of its need. Both under Chairman Conyers, during the last years of the Bush administration, and under my chairmanship on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, we discovered a flaw in Congress' subpoena power.  Congress has, and has always had, and has been supported all the way by the Supreme Court, the need to do oversight. With that, we issued subpoenas. The enforcement of those subpoenas has come into conflict over the last several years, both during Mr.Conyers' chairmanship when he subpoenaed Harriet Miers to appear, and during my time when I subpoenaed records by the Department of In both cases, the administrations decided that it was appropriate to question the standing and to delay.  Those delays were unfair to the body and unfair to the American people because it denied them in any reasonable period of time the effect of factfinding. This is not a partisan issue. It is, in fact, an issue that has already been decided for the American people. Under the Freedom of Information Act, if you do not receive documents within a reasonable period of time, you have the right to go to court. You have standing as a private citizen or an interest group, and the court will decide what documents are appropriate for you to receive.  Yet this very question that was not once, but twice, defended by two different administrations of two different parties calls into question the ability in a timely fashion for Congress, the House or the Senate, to receive the information or the appearance of a witness it needs. We do not seek any new power under this legislation. We only seek an expeditious review by a Federal judge of a claim, either for the appearance of an individual or for documents appropriate to our oversight.  For that reason, I am pleased that both Republicans and Democrats within the committee saw fit to unanimously support this legislation. We believe that it is measured and it is also time.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-10-23-pt1-PgH8059.txt,1640,BANKRUPTCY JUDGESHIP ACT OF 2017,2017.0,23.0,October
925,topic-id,351,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I want to further echo the gentleman from New York's comments. Mr.Nadler is right. We will often, almost unanimously, find a way to disagree on what to look into at various times as a body. But whether it is a Democratic chairman or Republican chairman looking into something, whether it is a Republican administration or a Democratic administration, it is clear that we must, in fact, if a subpoena is issued, be able to enforce it in a timely fashion.  Under this legislation, it has a number of safeguards, but the most important one is the three-judge panel that will review these, followed by an expedited process at the U.Supreme  I might note, the interesting history of the two cases Mr.Nadler and I are talking about is one in which a Democratic chairman enforced a subpoena, but had to go to a recently appointed Republican judge, who, in a fairly reasonable period of time, reached the conclusion that: one, the committee had standing, and the House had standing and; two, that it was really without merit for the administration--then the Bush administration--to claim this immunity, this newfound immunity.  Similarly, in a slightly longer period of time, but coincidentally, a Republican chairman went before a freshly minted appointee of the very President who was refusing to comply, and she reached the decision that the documents were unfairly withheld and ordered them released.  So I think the interesting thing to all of us is the independence of the judiciary has worked not once but twice. We only want to codify it in a way that would cause the judiciary to have that opportunity in a timely fashion, and for the people's right to know to be recognized in that same expeditious fashion.  As Mr.Nadler said, the Senate has, for a long time, had a portion of what we are doing here today. It is an oddity that two coequals have not had the same ability during those many years since the late 1970s.

Mr.Speaker, I, too, urge the House to pass this bill, move it to the Senate in a timely fashion, and create an equal standing between the House and the Senate as to enforcement of its subpoenas.  I join with my colleague, the gentleman from California (Mr.Swalwell), in the frustration that individuals often feel that they have privileges in a vague sense that are not to be asserted, but simply not to occur.  In the last administration, we have even had individuals claim that they basically lied as little as they needed to, to protect some question of a classified nature. These kinds of claims, in addition to the law enforcement sensitive, confidential, and other security clearance claims, which are not codified in statute, yet often are the reason for delay or outright refusal to deliver documents, flies in the face of the ability--sometimes behind closed doors, sometimes in public--for Congress' ability to conduct oversight. I look forward to this legislation becoming law, and I think I will close with just one more item.  Mr.Nadler and I have served together as chairman and ranking member for a number of years. We share something which is the many years that we have been here in Congress, we have seen the frustration of both parties trying to do their job against another branch that often takes advantage of the natural rivalry between two different parties.  This legislation is designed to reduce that, to reduce the ability for the executive branch or other outside groups to, if you will, take advantage of the natural division between the two of us.

If the minority has not gone through the discovery that we have, that we placed in the Record, I will be glad to give Mr.Cicilline or anyone else a copy.

I think the important things here, though, Mr.Chairman, are if they want to have money in a settlement, such as the Deepwater Horizon tragedy, they certainly could, as long as it directly provides aid to the victims; which, of course, cleanup did. But when we look at these others, one of the great things is if they want to put it into a victim's fund as part of it, a government-controlled fund, they can if they want.  If the Department of Justice wants specific authority the way they do, for example, in water settlements, particularly related to Native American Tribes, they offer a deal, they put one together, and, Mr.Chairman, they come to This Congress, in the last Congress, settled multiple longstanding disputes with What is interesting is they made sure the money went to those who had been harmed when they came to Congress and said: Please codify this agreement.  But in the many agreements that seems to go on in the Obama administration--and we now have the smoking gun of that--they made political decisions. Making political decisions is why you have to put this back in the light of day and with real congressional oversight.  What is amazing is, during the markup of this bill, there were a number of Members of the other party who specifically talked about not trusting the current occupant of the White House and the current Attorney It baffles me that they would not want to take back this authority knowing that the Department of Justice could bring to us a request for a bill that would authorize a specific settlement that could have outside groups or grant authority on a case-by-case basis.                              {time}  1530  The reality is the slush fund system has to stop.

We are not talking about leftwing, rightwing, or other groups who get it. What we are talking about is a basic question of fungibility of money.

In a perfect world, the victims are made 100 percent whole. In a perfect world, 100 percent of the money passes from the perpetrator to the victim.  The Department of Justice making a decision not to a left- or rightwing group, but a political decision to give $1 million to the Coast Guard, to their charitable foundation, was a decision that clearly was not part of the mitigation but, rather, a general charitable decision. That was $1 million that did not go to the victim, did not go to the general Treasury, but it went to the whims of a bureaucrat.

So when we are trying to reduce potential misconduct by the executive branch, we are not doing it to take any money away.

One of them is that she touched on environmental cleanup. Very clearly, nothing in this legislation would limit the cleanup related to the wrongdoing or the damage. Not so. A third party could be hired to do the cleanup.  Additionally, nothing stops a settlement from requiring a company to have counseling or other mitigation. It simply stops the Department of Justice from picking a charity of its choosing to go do it.  Now what I would really like the gentlewoman--who may not be on the floor any longer--to understand is that the Department of Justice has grant authority and does multiple grants every single month of the year to some of the very same groups under its authority that these settlements are going toward. Congress has allowed it a certain amount of money to provide grants for general harm.  Additionally, every year, Congress allocates hundreds of millions of dollars to some of the very same groups and efforts the gentlewoman knows that we are talking about.

1009,topic-id,274,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Mr.Yarmuth for yielding me time.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this fiscal year 2018 budget resolution for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that the underlying assumptions are grossly misleading. It assumes fictions like hundreds of billions of dollars from the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, and it assumes an economic growth rate of 3 percent, which most economists on both sides do not believe is possible.  This budget is merely a vehicle for Republicans to fast-track tax cuts for millionaires, billionaires, and large corporations. Any assertion of cuts for working families is debunked by experts like Leonard Burman, cofounder of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, who has called this ``utterly implausible.''  Mr.Speaker, the facts are these: 80 percent of the Republican tax cuts go to the top 1 percent by 2027; the average tax cut for the top 1 percent in 2027 will be $207,000; and 42 million middle class households will face a tax increase, including those earning between $50,000 and $150,000, who will see a tax increase of one-third. That is what this budget lays the path for.  If we want to see where this will lead, let's just look at Kansas, a place where the Republican legislature has rolled back the tax cuts that they passed from several years ago because they simply didn't work and put Kansas' economy into a downward spiral.  We know who wins under this budget resolution. It simply paves the way for a huge tax cut for the wealthiest millionaires, billionaires, and corporations. That is wrong, and I urge a ``no'' vote on this budget.  ",CREC-2017-10-26-pt1-PgH8230-3.txt,99999999999999,SUNSHINE FOR REGULATIONS AND REGULATORY DECREES AND SETTLEMENTS ACT OF,2017.0,26.0,October

1083,topic-id,1756,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of legislation that will address the critical need to enhance security at airports in Cuba and across the globe.  Last week, I had the privilege to lead a congressional delegation overseas to see firsthand investments our foreign partners in Europe and the Middle East have made to enhance aviation security. We face an unprecedented threat landscape, and they are clearly responding to it.  In order to keep Americans safe, we must advance collaborative counterterrorism efforts with our allies and take a more stringent and risk-based approach with countries that are more hostile to the United  In leading this delegation to examine aviation security at international airports, I had the opportunity to meet with many members of our Foreign Service and military, who all work tirelessly on behalf of all of us to advance America's interests abroad.  Unfortunately, it has recently come to light that more than 20 of our American diplomats who were working at the United States Embassy in Havana were the victims of a sonic attack. As a result, many of these members of our Foreign Service have been diagnosed with serious injuries and dangerous symptoms, and, in some cases, even permanent brain damage.  Reports indicate that these attacks started as early as May of 2016, exactly one year after the previous administration removed Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. Our government told our diplomats Cuba was safe. The reality was quite the opposite, and, because of that mistake, some of our diplomats will pay a permanent price.  These horrific attacks on members of our dedicated Foreign Service raise numerous questions about how much trust and, indeed, how much confidence we can have in the Cuban  We have to ask ourselves: If Cuba is unable to ensure the safety and security of foreign diplomats working in the embassies there, how can it possibly prevent terrorists and other nefarious actors from accessing its airports and infiltrating flights bound for the United States?  I recall last year when the Obama administration entered into opening up flights to Cuba, they ceded so much of the authority to the Cuban Government, the communist Cuban Government, over who they are going to hire, who is going to work with the American agencies, and who is going to be in charge of security; and we have very little control and, indeed, very little oversight over anything to do with those airports, yet American citizens are going to be going there and possibly facing danger. That is a real concern.  The legislation we are considering today requires that Cuba's airports be subjected to additional security to ensure that inbound flights to the United States are secure.  I am not here today to relitigate the wider policy towards Cuba or the Cuban Government, but I am here to ensure that Cuba and the rest of the global aviation community are held to security standards that are sufficient in these modern times to respond to the evolving and sometimes grave threats that the aviation sector faces on a regular basis.  The International Civil Aviation Organization standards, which currently serve as the benchmark minimum requirements for all airports with flights to the United States, are simply too weak; and I would submit that they are becoming outdated, given the fact that terrorism aspects nationwide and, indeed, worldwide routinely are adapting, and these standards are not.  This legislation we are considering today requires the Trump administration to take steps to raise minimum standards which will elevate American aviation security around the globe.  No matter how strong our domestic airport and aircraft security is, we must continue to raise the standard of global aviation security for foreign countries and last-point-of-departure airports. It is imperative that aviation security standards are robust and that these standards are commonplace in foreign countries, especially those with flights to the United  It is also imperative that these countries meet these standards; not just say they are going to meet these standards, but that they are, in fact, meeting the standards, something we found out recently is not always the case.  Confidence in aviation security at home begins with the assurance that our global partners are enforcing security standards abroad. By passing this bill today, we can demonstrate to the global community that the United States sees international aviation security as critical, because raising the aviation security standard abroad will obviously and ultimately keep us safe at home.  Mr.Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman McCaul and Chairman Sires for joining me in championing this important piece of legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I would also like to thank all the members of the Homeland Security Committee and their staffs for putting politics aside, as we often do on this great committee, and supporting this bill unanimously.

Mr.Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the Cuban Airport Security Last-point-of-departure airports are critically important to our homeland security. One only need look at the latest laptop ban that was instituted at 10 last-point-of-departure airports, given the fact that the terrorists have now learned how to turn them into explosive devices.

What is more concerning is that over the course of the last year, the United States Government personnel in Cuba have been targeted and subjected to harmful sonic attacks, which in some cases have caused permanent brain damage. This must not be tolerated.  Too many questions remain when it comes to Cuba's airports.

1087,topic-id,394,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill for the reasons that I have already spoken about, but I do want to note that there are two things in this bill that are very important. One is to give us the ability to examine whether or not the airports in Cuba are indeed safe.  As you heard from the statements earlier during this colloquy from myself, from Mr.Vela, and from Mr.McCaul, there are gaps in our knowledge of Cuba that are simply unique to most of the other aviation communities. It is incumbent upon us to try and find out what is going on down there.  As my colleague, Mr.McCaul, stated, we were denied visas because they knew we were coming to look at their airports. They allow very little oversight from the TSA at their airports.  They or someone in their country have attacked our embassy employees. The communist Cuban party controls the vast majority of what happens with aviation with very little knowledge of what the internal workings of that are. They are not collaborative partners at all, and that is a major concern.  The other part of the bill is reviewing international aviation standards.  Are they keeping up to date with evolving threats, such as the laptop threat and others that we know of around the world? Are they adhering to the standards that are set by the ICAO? And are those standards sufficient going forward?  Those are all things we need to take a look at. I urge my colleagues to pass this bill because it is a Homeland Security bill. I hope that my colleagues in the Senate, including Senator Rubio, my good friend who is championing the companion bill, I hope that he pushes it over there quickly; and I hope we get this to the President's desk for signature because we can't mess with things that involve homeland security.

719,topic-id,633,"Mr.President, as the Senate irons out the details of our comprehensive tax reform plan to get the American economy back on track, I want to draw attention today to what I believe is one of the greatest obstacles in our path as we pursue 3-percent annual growth. That obstacle I am referring to is our aging national infrastructure: our roads, our bridges, our airports, our water systems, our sewage systems, and our waterways that desperately need dredging, especially in my  If our tax plan is going to be pro-growth, then we need to take advantage of this once-in-a-generation chance to use Federal revenues to invest meaningfully in our economy. Allow me to explain what I mean by that. Federal investment in our roads, our bridges, our railways, and our waterways would be a shot in the arm for the American economy. It would pay dividends for decades. Companies need good roads and bridges and shipping channels to transport their products and to ensure that they aren't sitting in traffic for hours--sometimes it seems like days--which eats away at profits and raises costs for our people. But for too long, Washington's spending priorities have been to grow the Federal bureaucracy instead of growing our capacity for economic expansion and development through infrastructure upgrades. We know the result. Our Department of Transportation now estimates that we have a backlog of construction and repairs that would cost $926 billion to clear. It would cost nearly a trillion dollars, and that is just the backlog.  I have a simple solution that I would respectfully suggest to get us back on track. According to the Congressional Research Service, $2.6 trillion in corporate profits made by American companies are parked overseas, and some outside estimates say $4 or $5 trillion. This money is overseas, and it will not be brought back to America as long as our antiquated corporate tax system is going to charge those American companies 35 percent in tax just to bring them back.  Congress is already discussing repatriation as a part of the move to a territorial tax system, which would use a competitive tax rate to encourage companies to bring their dollars back to the United States and keep them here and invest them here in American products and American businesses and American employees.  When tax reform passes--and it will--and we get a one-time surge in tax revenue as a result of this $3 to $5 trillion being brought back to the United States, we are going to get only one chance to spend that money wisely. Instead of blowing those repatriated dollars on an already bloated Federal bureaucracy, we ought to invest that money solely and exclusively in desperately needed infrastructure upgrades. Even a one-time target investment in clearing the industrial backlog will create jobs and stimulate the economy for decades.  Let's face it, too many of American roads today are axle-breaking insults to the 21st century. They are holding our economy back.  Let me be clear. We are talking about hundreds of billions of dollars flowing into infrastructure if we just make good use of those repatriated dollars. For example, just in my State of Louisiana, this could mean building a new bridge through Lake It could mean widening the interstate in Baton It could mean closing the gaps in I-49 between Lafayette and Shreveport and New We have neglected our highways and bridges for far too long, and this is our chance to use tax reform to catch up, to boost our international competitiveness, to lower costs for consumers, and to put our economy back on track to 3 percent-plus growth, which the American people expect and deserve.

Unfortunately, what we know about the Republican tax plan, as the details begin to leak out, go in a different direction.  This is a tax break, a big tax cut for billionaires at the expense of working families. According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a family making $50,000 could see their tax bill increase by as much as 380 percent--less money to set aside for retirement, less money to set aside for a child's education, less money to pay the bills that families who struggle work hard every month to pay, in order to fund a tax break for the wealthiest  5,400 families would get a $270 billion tax cut funded by increased taxes on people who work hard every day just to make ends meet.

259,topic-id,540,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend from Massachusetts for yielding me the time.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule because I rise in opposition to the underlying budget--a budget which is really a budget buster that could be before the full House for consideration tomorrow.  It calls for an additional $1.5 trillion worth of debt accumulated over the next 10 years. They call for that, I fear, in order to clear the path for unpaid-for tax cuts. There is a bipartisan path to move forward on tax reform. It has been 31 years since we have taken a serious run at the Federal code. It is long overdue. It is one that would simplify the code, that would broaden the base and lower the rates and make us more competitive at home, but especially abroad, in light of what the rest of the world has done.  That can also help promote economic growth, but I fear that that is not the direction that the opposing party is taking with their tax reform proposal. I say fear because we haven't seen the details yet. So we can't say with certainty just what exactly will be offered over the next couple of weeks. But if history is any guide, there is a proclivity to pass large tax cuts that are not paid for.  If history is a guide, we have been down this road before, in the 1981 tax cuts, the 2001, the 2003, that promised to bring a boon of economic growth that would offset and pay for the lost revenue. It didn't materialize. Instead, we had huge budget deficits. Unfortunately, today, we don't have the luxury of time to help us recover from a huge fiscal mistake. Because today, 70 million baby boomers are beginning their massive retirement and joining Social Security and Medicare--10,000 a day.  If we go down this route of going with massive tax breaks that aren't paid for, we are going to jeopardize the long-term solvency of Social Security and Medicare at exactly the wrong moment in our Nation's history. The folks back home tell me they would like to see tax reform along the lines that I just described, but they are not telling me that they are more interested in trickle-down economics where the predominant relief goes to the most wealthy, hoping that it somehow benefits everyone else.  Now, they would like to see it a little fairer for working families, for small businesses, for family farmers so that they can share in the economic growth and the prosperity that could be offered if we do this the correct way in a bipartisan fashion.  But instead, I fear that we are going to be witnessing history repeat itself. But unlike the time of the past, we don't have the luxury of time going forward without jeopardizing Social Security and Medicare, and without leaving a legacy of debt once again for our children and grandchildren to inherit.  So let's regroup. Let's do a budget that makes sense for the long-term fiscal solvency of important programs, but especially our children's future. This budget doesn't get us there.

It is impossible to forget the wait to get the final news that there were no survivors. That is how much Paul and Sheila meant to the people of our  I get my own special reminders every day.

Whether it was the tram operator, the elevator operator, or the police at the front door, he treated them as though they were I also have the flags in my office from his Senate office. Every day, they are a reminder for me of Paul and all that he did for the people of our  Paul and Sheila were always on the move. They were full of joy. They were persistent in their fight against injustices, small and large. During his lifetime as an educator, as an activist, and as a U.Senator, Paul Wellstone touched the lives of people throughout Minnesota and across the country. That is because his philosophy was simple. A lot of people, he said, would have people paid to represent them in Washington, but he was going to represent the other people. As he said in one of his famous campaign ads, he wasn't there to represent the Rockefellers; he was there to represent the ``little fellers.''  If you go to any local mental health group, they remember If you go to any Somali event in our State, they remember If you go to any community on the Iron Range in Minnesota, they remember Paul--both the man and then what he did.  Paul was my friend and mentor. He told me that I should run for office, and, as he did with so many others, he taught me that politics should have a purpose.  He also taught me how to campaign on city buses. This is how he would do it. At Nicollet Mall--being from a nearby State, the Presiding Officer is aware of Nicollet Mall in the city of We would get on a city bus at one end of the mall, and we would work it as though we had just got on the bus: Meet everyone on the bus, go to the end, get off, and then get on another bus going the other way and meet a whole group of people. I have no idea what the busdrivers thought after an hour of this, but that is what we did.  Paul Wellstone worked it bus by bus, block by block, precinct by precinct, and he made a lasting impression on people in a way that made them believe and know that getting involved in politics could make a real difference in their lives. He had an unending sense of optimism--optimism that maybe people he didn't agree with in this Chamber would eventually change their views.  He made a lot of friends here, on both the Democratic and Republican sides of the aisle. That was the message Paul took to new citizens, new voters, and everyone looking to get involved. He told them that working in public service can make a difference, and he showed them through his actions.  He had many passions. He fought for everything from campaign finance reform to improving our rural economies. He fought against veteran homelessness, to protect the environment, and, of course, he fought for the rights of workers.  He truly believed, as he famously said, that ``we all do better when we all do better'' and that politics is simply about improving people's lives.[[Page S6800]]  Anyone who ever met or talked with Paul found out that he had a special passion for helping those struggling with mental illness. That was shaped by his own family. As a young child, Paul watched his brother Steven's traumatic descent into mental illness. In college, his brother suffered a severe mental breakdown and spent the next 2 years in hospitals. Eventually, he recovered and graduated from college with honors, but it took his immigrant parents years to pay off the hospital bills.  Paul would always talk about how, when he grew up, his house was dark because no one wanted to talk about mental illness back then because it had so much stigma. He wanted to get it out in the sunlight. He knew that there were far too many families going through the same experience, too many devastated by the physical and financial consequences of mental illness. He knew that we could and we should do better. For years as a Senator, he fought for funding for better care, better services, and better representation for the mentally ill, and he fought for mental health parity in health insurance coverage.  Even years after his death, Paul's voice was heard loud and clear. Congressman Ramstad from Minnesota, a Republican Congressman at the time, took up the cause in the I helped. Ted Kennedy led the way and, of course, Pete Domenici, who had paired up with Paul on this important bill.  Finally, in 2008, we passed the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity The bill requires insurance companies to treat mental health on an equal basis with physical illness. For Paul, this fight was always a matter of civil rights, of justice, and of basic human decency, and that landmark legislation is one fitting way we honor him.  Sheila, of course, also dedicated herself to helping others, especially survivors of violence. I had the opportunity to work closely with Sheila when I served for 8 years as Hennepin County She focused on domestic violence and was instrumental in creating and getting the funding for the Hennepin County Domestic Abuse That center is an international model for serving victims of domestic violence by bringing together a full range of services and resources in one central location. Victims of domestic violence don't have to go through the redtape that would be difficult even for a lawyer to figure out.  Of course, one of Paul's greatest legislative achievements was the work he did, along with Vice President Biden and others, to pass the original Violence Against Women It was a team effort, and Sheila was right there on the frontlines with  Together, they accomplished so much. Their commitment to others never wavered, and neither did they.  It was just a few weeks before that tragic crash that I last saw Sheila and Sheila and I had been asked to speak to a group of new citizens, immigrants from It was a very small group, and we were there to talk about our own immigrant experiences, our own relatives. I remember she talked about her relatives in Appalachia, and I talked about my relatives on the Iron Range coming over from The event was winding down. It was a small, small event in a synagogue with these new immigrants, and, all of a sudden, a big surprise--in walked He wasn't supposed to be there. It was just a few weeks, a month away, from one of the biggest elections he had ever faced in the U.But he had gotten on an early flight and had come home from There he was--he and a group of immigrants and us--with no press, no TVs, not even a big crowd, all just a few weeks before his election.  He came for two reasons. He loved Sheila, and he wanted to be there to support her. But he was also there because he loved the immigrant experience. He embraced it. His family, like so many Minnesota families, was an example of how you can come to America, succeed in America, and then, in turn, help America succeed.  That is my last memory of Paul as he stood before those immigrants, telling about his own story, embracing them. I will remember him in that way, but I will also remember the joy he felt for politics, how he would run around that green bus of his, with people running alongside him on the parade routes.

1226,topic-id,385,"Mr.President, today I wish to discuss the vote in the Senate last night to overturn the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rule regarding forced arbitration that would protect consumers and make sure they get their day in court when financial institutions violate the law. The floor schedule did not allow me to give these remarks before the vote, so I am giving them today. This rule would have restored the ability of servicemembers, veterans, and other consumers to join together and seek relief through class action lawsuits. I opposed this rule repeal.  In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act included a provision instructing the CFPB to study mandatory arbitration and write a rule based on what they found. After several years of careful study, the CFPB released a 728-page report in 2015. This year, the CFPB finalized its arbitration rule mandating that consumer financial product contracts no longer include language barring class actions.  This rule was an important step forward in protecting consumers from the fine print arbitration clauses included in all sorts of contracts, including contracts for credit cards, debit cards, prepaid bank cards, payday loans, and even cell phones. The 2015 CFPB report found that 93 percent of consumers whose credit cards included forced arbitration clauses did not know that they could not sue their credit card companies.  The CFPB rule enhanced protections for consumers in the military. That is why the American Legion, the Nation's largest wartime veterans service organization, which represents 2 million veterans, and the Military Coalition, which represents 5.5 million current and former servicemembers and their families, supported the protections provided under this rule.  I have cosponsored the Military Consumer Protection Act led by Senator Reed, which would put the enforcement of the Servicemember Civil Relief Act under the CFPB so that the agency responsible for protecting servicemembers and their families is also able to enforce those protections.  Our servicemembers and veterans face challenges that are different from civilian consumers, especially during deployment. We need to make sure that they have all the protections they earn through their service. That is why I voted against H.111, the resolution of disapproval with respect to the CFPB arbitration rule, and I will continue to fight for our servicemembers, veterans, and consumers to get the protections they deserve.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-25-pt1-PgS6812-3.txt,1826,STOP SETTLEMENT SLUSH FUNDS ACT OF 2017,2017.0,25.0,October

I urge all my colleagues in the strongest possible terms to reject this proposal. This cap on 401(k) contributions would present a crippling and unnecessary burden on working families across the country by making it harder for everyday Americans to save for retirement.  There is already growing bipartisan opposition to this proposal as President Trump tweeted against it this morning, and in September, the majority leader said that this plan would punish people when they are actually saving for their own retirement.

I would state that Americans will be very pleased when they get a chance to see Scott Palk on the bench. He will be a fair judge. He comes from a great family and has a great passion to serve people, both as he served in the U.attorney's office in the past and at the University of Oklahoma, working at the law school there. He will make the Nation proud. I am glad we have finally gone through this extremely long process to finally get him on and to get him seated on that bench.

722,topic-id,1431,"Mr.President, I rise to speak to the Senate about the nominee that is currently in front of this body and on whom we should vote in the next few hours. We just finished a cloture vote to actually start 30 hours of debate. In the past, we wouldn't have had 30 hours of debate for a district court nominee, especially a district court nominee like this. This would have been something that would have been done by consent. We would have had a vote on this individual, rather than burning up 30 hours of time in debate on a single individual who just passed a cloture vote 79 to 18. This is not a controversial nominee.  Let me introduce you to Scott Scott Palk was actually reported out of the Judiciary Committee on June 15 of this year. He was nominated by President Trump on May 8. He has been pending since June 15 to get a vote on this floor because of the ongoing delays for each nominee as we go through the process.  Why do I say Scott Palk is not a controversial nominee? It is not just the fact that he passed the cloture vote 79 to 18. Scott Palk, if you remember his name in this body, was also a nominee of President Obama for the U.District Court for the Western District of He is now a nominee of President Trump for the U.District Court for the Western District of  There may be five things total that President Obama and President Trump agree on. Scott Palk is one of those five. This is not a controversial nominee, and he will be a great judge for us. He will also be a great judge in Western  He currently serves as the assistant dean for students and the assistant general counsel at the University of Oklahoma College of Law in Norman, OK, a position he has held since 2011. He has the strong support of the president of the University of Oklahoma, who happens to be former Senator David Boren, a Democratic Senator from this body, who is now leading the University of Oklahoma and has done that with great excellence for the past two decades. He is also strongly behind this nominee as well.  Scott Palk joined the University of Oklahoma College of Law after 19 years of public service as a State and Federal prosecutor. He graduated in 1992 from the University of Oklahoma College of Law, where he began his legal career as a legal intern for the district attorney's office of district 21, serving in Cleveland, Garvin, and McClain  After graduating and passing the bar, he became an assistant district attorney for Cleveland County, where he prosecuted a variety of crimes and death penalty cases. In 1994, he became the multicounty drug task force coordinator, initiating and directing the district's first wire-interception drug investigation and coordinating Federal and local resources, culminating in the successful prosecution of a significant multicounty methamphetamine distribution organization.  The Association of Oklahoma Narcotics Enforcers awarded him the Prosecutor of the Year award in 1993. In 1992, he became the first assistant district attorney for district 21 and served in a dual prosecutorial and administrative role.  In 2002, he joined the U.attorney's office in the Western District of Oklahoma, where we are pushing him to be a judge now, as an assistant U.attorney, prosecuting violent crimes, gangs, and domestic terrorism.  In 2004, he became the deputy criminal chief of the U.attorney's office and served in the additional roles of violent crime, national security coordinator, anti-terrorism, advisory council coordinator, and crisis management coordinator.  That same year, in 2004, the Oklahoma Gang Investigators Association awarded him the Prosecutor of the Year award. The Executive Office for U.Attorneys awarded him the Director's Award for Superior  In 2005, the Drug Enforcement Administration awarded him the Certificate of Appreciation for Outstanding Contribution in the Field of Drug Law  In his most recent role at the U.attorney's office, he supervised administrative staff and assistant U.attorneys, handling a criminal caseload primarily consisting of national security and organized crimes and coordinating efforts with the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force, the FBI foreign counterintelligence squad, and the National Security Division of the Department of  His work in national security matters included both traditional criminal investigations, as well as investigations utilizing provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance  In 2011, the FBI awarded him the Director's Certificate of Appreciation for Assistance to the Joint Terrorism Task  Scott Palk is eminently qualified for this task. He shouldn't be a controversial nominee, and he should already be a judge. We are missing three judges in the Western District of President Trump nominated him on May 8, and it is now the end of October when we can finally get him to the floor to be able to move him.  This delay tactic, this stalling tactic that is out there, this resist movement to try to prevent the President of the United States from getting his staff in every agency and to prevent judges from being able to actually go on the bench is delaying good people who are not controversial to be able do the job that is needed in each district. He is an individual who passed 79 to 18 on a cloture vote, and I am confident we will not consume the next 30 hours of debate about him. The hours will now expire as we sit in silence on the Senate floor, waiting for us to be able to have a final vote--just delays.  I have made a proposal to my colleagues. It is not a radical proposal. Quite frankly, it was a proposal in 2013, first proposed by a Senator named Harry Reid: to be able to move the nominations time period from 30 hours of just wasted time on the Senate floor to 2 hours--2 hours for district court, 2 hours for the Deputy Assistant Secretary of whatever agency it may be, having 2 hours of debate. These are for individuals who have already gone through committee, already gone through extensive vetting, already moved to the floor, and who most certainly will pass because it is a simple majority to be able to move these individuals based on the change of rules that at that time Senator Reid led.  Let's also do the same rule on time. Instead of 30 hours of wasted time on the floor when we could do other things for the American people, let's go back to the 2-hour agreement that we had in the past. It was a simple rule of 2 hours for individuals like for district courts and other individuals and agencies, 8 hours for higher tier individuals, who may be for a circuit court and such, and 30 hours for Cabinet officials.  I don't think that is an unreasonable request to make. It is a rule that we have done in the past, and it is a rule that we need to go back to. The American people are frustrated with the block in timing on moving people, especially people with wide bipartisan support. No one understands why someone who President Obama nominated and President Trump nominated has to take up 30 hours of time on the floor on debate when no one will really debate him and it is certain what the outcome of these people will be.  The American people are expecting us to debate and to engage on issues. I recommend again to this body: Let's go back to the Harry Reid rule--2 hours of debate for individuals like this in district courts, 8 hours of debate for higher tiered courts, and 30 hours of debate for Cabinet officials and the Supreme We can do that again. We have done that in the past, and I recommend that we move back to that, not just for a single congressional body but as a change in the rules of the Senate, so that, permanently, we are able to be more functional again. A body that is[[Page S6783]]dysfunctional can be fixed by its own Members, moving us to a functional set of rules. That is what I hope we would achieve in the days ahead.  I look forward to voting for Scott Palk, whenever we finish with a 30-hour clock of time--of wasted time--to be able to move on a nominee and to see wide bipartisan support again for a good nominee. Scott is going to do a great job on the bench. We need him there to be able to get started.  I yield back.

389,topic-id,1406,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank Congressman Veasey for his leadership and for his dedication.  Today, I am at this mike for a number of reasons. One is that we have witnessed, over the weekend, another time in history that will be written for many to read, for generations to try to understand what exactly happened.  Most of us are raised that, in a time of grieving and mourning, you are sympathetic, you are patient, and, most of all, you try to be understanding.  I am at a loss in trying to understand how the dialogue was reduced to name-calling and then just unfactual information. But what I had hoped and what I feel that, as an American, as a Member of Congress, as a citizen, if someone gets it wrong, that at least I deserve, ``I'm sorry, I didn't get the information right,'' or maybe ``I spoke out of turn.'' And when you are grieving the loss of someone you love dearly, someone who was serving this country, someone who, as the family of a military service person, gave the sacrifice as well for them to represent our country.  I would hope--I was hopeful that that would happen, but it did not. There comes a point in time, Mr.Speaker, as American citizens, that we begin to stand up and say, as our country, there is an expectation. There is an expectation for those we elect, there is an expectation for those in leadership, and truly, there is an expectation of civility and, at minimum, truth.  As we know, the FBI has had a long, troubling history of using its broad investigatory powers to target Black citizens. It is not a myth. It is a fact. It has been written. During the 1960s, Director Hoover used the counterintelligence program to surveil and discredit civil rights activists, members of the Black Panther  For an example, the FBI falsified a letter in an attempt to blackmail the Reverend Martin Luther King into silence.  So the Congressional Black Caucus is concerned by the assertion that coins a new term, ``Black identity extremists,'' and claims, with high confidence, that they are likely to target law enforcement based on perceptions of police brutality against African Americans.[[Page H8071]]  In August, the FBI Counterterrorism Division issued a chilling and outlandish warning to its agents, all hidden behind the veil of an internal report never meant to be seen by the American people. It worries me because, in 2017, such a misguided and hateful and dangerous report exists at all.  Released just 9 days before the hateful violence in Charlottesville, this report targets so-called Black identity extremists by falsely linking peaceful and necessary calls for justice from Americans, from the African-American community, to entirely unrelated acts of violence against law enforcement.  Mr.Speaker, I served as a mayor of a diverse city for 14 years and had the responsibility of an entire police force for a city. I have such respect and honor for those who serve us.  I understand how, when there is trouble, the police run to that trouble to protect us, but I also know that the power that is held on the shield of a police force can be used for other than protection of their people. And that in this great country that we live in, time and time again in history, some people will use the comment: Don't be so sensitive about everything that happened. But history has shown us, every change that we have made in this country of freedoms and rights have come from people who had the courage, the political courage, to stand up and fight for that. Is that extremism?  Will you say the right to vote were Black extremists? Would you say that the women who protest and march so that women could have the right to vote, were they extremists? Or were they Americans who believed in this country and had the courage to stand up not just for them but for generations to come?  Our Social Security, when we looked at--and we looked at hunger in this country, and people repeatedly have shown, of all ethnic groups, that nothing in America happens without protests and the courage to stand up. Are they extremists, or they part of this amazing democracy that we have?  And the threat of being labeled by our FBI so you have permission to now treat these individuals, who have the courage to stand up, as unlawful villains and terrorists, and you have the permission now by the FBI to attack and to imprison them.  We must, as a Congress and a country, learn to understand the power of our words, and I am going to close with this.  Your words mean something. If this administration has taught us anything, the words of those who are elected to leadership do matter, whether it is the truth or whether it is a lie. It matters.  It fuels anger and hatred in people. It tells people that it is okay to disrespect others. Words mean something. And for me to be a Black woman in America and be labeled, if I stand up and fight for my rights, if I stand with others, if Black Lives Matter has not just been Black people standing up--it has been all members of the United States, citizens saying that all lives matter and that we will not tolerate criminal injustice against Black people and the murder rate that we see of those who are of color.                              {time}  2015  This has been a movement in our country, and now we see this internal labeling by our law enforcement in our country. Does that cause me to feel afraid in my own country? Does that give me the fear that history is going to repeat itself because words have given permission for this to happen when you legitimize people whose only purpose to stand and be in a position in your community is to say that you have no value less than me and we hate you?  But do you know what? There are some very fine people there. Being a Black person in America, I can tell you, we have had some fine days. I would not be standing here, this little Black girl from Detroit, if this country did not give me the opportunities. But it came from the protests; it came in the death and the riots of the people in my generation before me who would not sit down and be quiet.  So now are we being told that we are not to use our constitutional rights of free speech and protests and to gather to say that now you are being an extremist? I am not going to allow that to happen in this country, and if you want to label me, label me. But I would not be here today if it were not for those who had the political courage to stand up for what is right, not just for Black people, but for Americans in this country. And that is something that this report strikes a chord with me.  I stand in opposition. I understand when someone takes their freedom to stand up and oppose something that is happening in America, and I want to protect that First Amendment right. But if we can avoid the consequences of halfway speech fueled by fear and false perceptions, we will be stronger as a country.  Mr.Speaker, I call on Congress to join me and my colleagues in condemning this report and standing with us for a more peaceful, a more accepting, and a more equal country where we can really mean, when we stand up and we say the Pledge of Allegiance and we say, ``one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all,'' and for all of us we have a name.  We have a name that we were given at birth, and we expect our leadership, our President, our Congress, our Chief of Staff, our military to address us by our names.

513,topic-id,678,"Madam President, in correspondence with officials of the Government of Bangladesh over a period of several years and in conversations with officials of our own State Department, I, like many others, have raised concerns about enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrests, unfair trials, extrajudicial executions, and other flagrant violations of the rule of law by the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed and particularly by the Rapid Action Battalion,  Like the inquiries and appeals of others, my concerns have been responded to by Bangladeshi officials with blanket denials, obfuscation, and even falsehoods.  Despite such attempts to deflect responsibility, it is beyond a doubt that the rule of law is often violated by Bangladeshi law enforcement agencies. This conduct has become so ingrained that it is not an overstatement to describe Prime Minister Wajed's government as one that condones state-sponsored criminality.  Of course, the government would vociferously reject such a characterization, insisting that individuals who have disappeared were kidnapped by militants or joined extremist groups or simply claiming that their whereabouts are unknown to the government. The problem is that there is often credible eyewitness testimony to the contrary or those responsible for the abductions have identified themselves as members of one of the security forces, the RAB being the most notorious.  The State Department's latest Country Reports on Human Rights describes the situation in Bangladesh as follows: ``Human rights groups and media reported that multiple disappearances and kidnappings continued, some committed by security services. The government made limited efforts to prevent or investigate such acts. The United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances contacted the government on March 9 concerning the ``reportedly alarming rise of the number of cases of enforced disappearances in the country'' and had 34 outstanding cases under review as of May 18, but the working group did not receive a response. Following alleged disappearances, security forces released some individuals without charge, arrested some, some were found dead, and others were never found.''  The State Department also cited the practice of torture of detainees in Bangladesh: ``Although the constitution and law prohibit torture and other cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment or punishment, local and international human rights organizations and the media reported security forces, including RAB, intelligence services, and police, employed torture and physical and psychological abuse during arrests and interrogations. Security forces reportedly used torture to gather information from alleged militants although members of political opposition parties claimed that security forces also targeted activists within their parties. Security forces reportedly used threats, beatings, kneecappings, and electric shock, and law enforcement officers sometimes committed rapes and other sexual abuses. Two prominent human rights organizations stated that security forces tortured eight persons to death in the first nine months of the year.''  The situation has not improved since the State Department published that report earlier this year. Just last week, seven senior representatives of an opposition political party were arrested in Their whereabouts, conditions of confinement, and the evidence against them remain a mystery.  This egregious situation has been cited by the European Parliament, the United Nations, Human Rights Watch, and other reputable human rights monitors; yet the government of Prime Minister Wajed rejects such admonishments out of hand as fabrications or an infringement of sovereignty. Not only do these practices violate the rule of law, they threaten democracy itself. Bangladesh does face a serious problem of violent extremism, which must be effectively addressed, but if peaceful expression and association that challenges government policies or that condemns corruption and police misconduct are equated with terrorism and responded to with threats, arbitrary arrests, and disappearances, extremism will increase, and democracy will suffer.  Other international organizations and governmental bodies have urged the Government of Bangladesh to respond to calls regarding dozens of cases of disappearances and to permanently dismantle the RAB and suspend other law enforcement agencies that have engaged in such crimes until credible investigations of such cases are conducted and those responsible are appropriately punished. I echo those calls and do not support further U.assistance for such agencies until the necessary steps are taken.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-23-pt1-PgS6711-2.txt,1383,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY BUREAU,2017.0,23.0,October

Since then, dramatic progress has been made in controlling the disease, although more remains to be done.[[Page S6712]]  The United States has also joined in the fight against the Lord's Resistance Army, which ravaged northern Uganda for many years. I remember a time, not so long ago, when thousands of young children, called ``night commuters'' would walk each evening from their remote villages into towns where they were protected from being kidnapped by the LRA and forced into servitude as child soldiers.  Throughout that period and to this day, President Museveni has remained in power, for five consecutive terms, solidifying his control increasingly through repression, including the arrest, imprisonment, and even alleged assassination attempts of political opponents and social activists. In 2016, at his most recent inauguration after an election marred by fraud and intimidation, Sudan's President Bashir, indicted by the International Criminal Court, was an invited guest.  In 2012, President Museveni announced that he would ``certainly not'' seek to remain in office after age 75, consistent with article 102(b) of Uganda's Constitution; yet today, with the next Presidential election scheduled for 2021, an effort is underway in Uganda's Parliament, presumably with President Museveni's blessing, to amend the constitution to eliminate the age limit. If successful, Museveni could remain President for life, in the tradition of other African strongmen like Robert  There is no law against amending the constitution. Our own Constitution poses no such age limit on Presidents or Members of Congress, but doing so for the obvious purpose of perpetuating the increasingly autocratic rule of a serving President, who has used the security forces to silence his opposition and who has systematically undermined the possibility of a free election, is wrong.  Such an outcome would be a tragedy for democracy and the rule of law in Uganda, at a time when corruption, economic stagnation, and internal strife are propelling Uganda backwards. The United States and the international community have provided Uganda with billions of dollars in aid since 1986 when President Museveni first came to power. I supported that investment in Uganda's social, economic, and political stability, and President Museveni deserves credit for many positive developments in Uganda since the horrific years of his brutal predecessors, Idi Amin and Milton Obote; yet today much of that investment is at risk of being squandered.  Ultimately this is a decision for the representatives of the Ugandan people, but I hope the Ugandan Parliament recognizes what is at stake, not only for the people of Uganda and for the future of democracy and stability in that country, but for future support from the United States and the international community.

607,topic-id,541,"Mr.President, something truly outrageous is happening today on the floor of the The resolution we will consider today signals to the American people, in no uncertain terms, that they do not deserve the right to seek justice when big banks or other financial service providers rip them off, leave their personal information exposed to hackers, or engage in discrimination. The resolution of disapproval before us today will strip Americans of their rights in court and will ensure that corporate wrongdoing can remain shrouded in secrecy--all to protect powerful companies like Wells Fargo and  Access to our court system is a fundamental principle in American society. It ensures that all those who wrong others, no matter how powerful, are equal in the eyes of the law and can be held accountable. That may no longer be the case. Access to our courts is under assault by companies that slip forced arbitration clauses into the fine print of agreements for basic services like checking accounts and credit cards. For some of these companies, like Equifax, consumers are not even their customers. They sell consumers' financial information to other companies. They have little incentive to protect consumers or even treat them fairly. That is how Equifax can actually make significant profits after it carelessly allowed the personal information of half of the adult population in the United States to be compromised. This is wrong.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, CFPB, rightly put some commonsense limitations on the abuse of forced arbitration clauses. The rule provides that financial services companies cannot force consumers to sign away their right to join a class action lawsuit. The rule also requires more transparency when arbitration is used to ensure that wrongdoing cannot be hidden by powerful companies to keep consumers in the dark. Protecting consumers in this way should not be controversial.  With the blunt instrument of a resolution of disapproval, the majority is seeking to strike the CFPB's rule and prevent it from ever implementing a similar rule in the future. This action, through a simple majority vote, would slam the courthouse door shut on every American who is ever ripped off by a company like Wells Fargo or has their sensitive personal information carelessly left unprotected by a company like If we go down the path of striking this rule, consumers will only be left with the same empty, meaningless apologies we always hear from these companies when they are finally caught red-handed.  I hope the American people are following this vote today. If they want to know whether their Senator stands with them or stands with corporate abusers, they will certainly find out. Whose side will the Senate be on when the rollcall is taken on this key vote? The American people, and their rights as citizens and as consumers? Or the powerful corporate interests who are pushing to repeal this protective rule? We shall soon see.  This should not be a partisan issue. We all represent the American people. It is time we act like it. The Vermonters I represent are watching. They know what is at stake by repealing this rule. I urge every Senator who shared my outrage at Wells Fargo and Equifax to take a stand and reject this shameful resolution.

882,topic-id,2213,"Mr.President, let me just speak for a few minutes on the emergency supplemental appropriations for disasters.  No one in this Chamber is immune from disaster. Six years ago, I remember, in Vermont, Marcelle and I watched as communities around Vermont felt the devastating impact of Tropical Storm That storm washed away entire communities in our State, tearing down homes, local landmarks, and bridges alike. I watched the devastation from a helicopter with the Governor and the head of our National Guard the day after the storm hit. I saw bridges washed away. The only way we could get into the towns was by helicopter because all of the roads were gone that led into them. I saw homes that had been on the north side of a river that were now upside down and destroyed on the south side of the river.  Do you know the one thing that occurred to me as I traveled around the State of Vermont? It is that I had heard from my fellow Senators, both Republicans and Democrats, saying that they would help us rebuild. I had heard the same thing from the President of the United They stood by Vermont's side to help us rebuild--again, Republicans and Democrats alike--because that is who we are as We lift each other up in times of disaster. We are one country.  Today, in California and across the West, families are returning to the charred ruins of their homes--those who were able to get out alive. In Florida and Texas, communities are trying to put their lives back together after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma--again, those who were able to get out alive. In Puerto Rico, hundreds of thousands are still without potable water, electricity, cell service, or adequate medical supplies following Hurricane The Virgin Islands are also facing devastation that I can never remember. Millions of Americans all over the country, as well as the Americans in Puerto Rico and the Americans in the Virgin Islands, need us to work together to help lift them up, just as we have seen in past disasters. This is not a Republican or a Democratic issue; this is an American issue. This is who we are as a country. We hold together.  I have been privileged to serve here since the time of President In times of disaster, I have seen every single President, Republican and Democrat, work to help Americans and do it out of concern for Americans, not for themselves. That is why it is so disappointing that President Trump[[Page S6704]]seems more concerned with claiming credit for a job well done than the actual situation on the ground deserves, particularly in Puerto President Trump has given himself a 10 out of 10 as though this were a game show for the administration's response to the devastating hurricane, but let's look at some numbers that really matter for the people who have lost everything.  It has been 48 days since Hurricane Irma made landfall in Puerto Rico and 34 days since Hurricane Maria tore through the island. These storms wreaked havoc on those who live there. They destroyed houses and killed at least 49 people. Yet, 48 days later, nearly 80 percent of the island is still without power, and 30 percent of the population is without clean drinking water--some having to resort to drinking contaminated water. Roads are impassable. Bridges are down. The few hospitals that are operating are operating on generators.  Frankly, the administration was slow to respond to the disaster. So to claim that it gets a 10 out of 10 for its response is to ignore the facts, especially the facts that the people who have been hit know so well. As I said before, this is not a reality TV show. It is not where the participant with the highest score advances to the next round. This is not fiction. These are people's lives--real people. They are people's homes. This is the hard part of governing. This is where we roll up our sleeves and dig in for the long haul. We stop patting ourselves on the back. Instead, we use that hand to give a hand to the people who are hurting.  Today we are going to advance a disaster package that contains $36.5 billion in additional emergency relief. It includes $18.7 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, Disaster Relief Fund, $16 billion for the National Flood Insurance Program debt forgiveness, $1.2 billion for nutrition assistance, and $576.5 million to address these devastating wildfires in the western part of the United  As vice chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I support this bill, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same. If we do not act, the Disaster Relief Fund and the Flood Insurance Program will run out of resources in a matter of days. This money, if we pass it, will help FEMA, the Department of Defense, the Army Corps of Engineers, and other agencies to continue their work in all of the devastated communities and to start catching up with the work that needs to be done and to help families begin to rebuild their homes and their lives--those who did not die in the disaster. This is just the next step. This is a multistep process. This is the next step on the road to recovery.  Last week, I met with Governor Ricardo Rossello, of Puerto Rico, and his staff. I have been to Puerto Rico many times, in happier times, but here he detailed the unique challenges that face Puerto He was telling us what is happening to our fellow The electric grid was almost completely destroyed. Its infrastructure, itself, was demolished. Houses were flattened. At the same time, Puerto Rico faces a fiscal situation that will make it nearly impossible for it to provide the Federal match that is required for most disaster assistance programs. It faces a Medicaid funding crisis that may leave nearly 1 million people without healthcare in just a matter of months, assuming that we restore their healthcare.  This tells us that our response cannot be business as usual. We need to tailor disaster assistance to meet Puerto Rico's unique challenges. We may need to consider legislation to address its unique needs. Most importantly, we need to think long term. To simply replace and repair what was destroyed would be shortsighted. We have to help our fellow Americans who are in Puerto Rico to recover, to rebuild, and to be more resilient and better prepared. We should invest in the 3.4 million U.citizens in Puerto Rico and invest in their infrastructure so that the next disaster is not a humanitarian issue and crisis.  Some like to say that the situation is unique in Puerto It is not. We have to acknowledge that historic-sized storms are now annual occurrences, and we have to respond accordingly. Even with the help from our own citizens and from the U.Government, we are just now fully rebuilding in Vermont, and we were not hit as badly as these other places were. Across the country--from wildfires in California to the flood damage in Florida, Texas, the U.Virgin Islands, as well as what I said about Puerto Rico--we can invest in technology, and we can invest in conservation and infrastructure. That would mitigate further damage.  Do you know what? It would also make these communities more resilient because we cannot speak about ``once in 100 years'' storms. Sometimes, as we have seen this year, they have been ``once in 2 months'' or ``once in 3 weeks'' storms. This requires a commitment from the U.It is not measured by days or weeks or months but in years--a commitment that does not waver, a commitment that does not depend on whether you live in Texas or Florida or Puerto Rico or the Virgin  Today, I urge all Senators to support this emergency supplemental bill that will provide much needed assistance for disaster relief across the country, but it is still just the next step on the path to recovery. The Trump administration is committed to putting forward a third, more comprehensive disaster package in the coming weeks. As vice chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I intend to hold the administration to that commitment.  In conclusion, even in the years since Irene, this Vermonter still takes comfort in the number of Republican and Democratic Senators who called me during that storm and pledged support and, along with the pledge, came through with the support.                   Recognition of the Majority Leader  The PRESIDING The majority leader is recognized.                       The Budget and Tax Reform  Mr.Mr.President, last week, the Senate took an important step for the fiscal and economic future of our country with passage of the budget for fiscal year 2018.  The comprehensive, responsible budget we passed marks out a clear vision for the future. It will put the Federal Government on a path to balance, and it sets out a new course after the long years of the Obama economy, when paychecks stagnated, steady work became harder to find, and retirement for many slipped further away. The budget we passed isn't just about getting our fiscal house in order--though it is certainly about that--it is also about getting our economy going again and growing again.  Perhaps the most important way it does so is by authorizing legislative tools to advance tax reform, and passing tax reform is the most important thing we can do today to get our economy reaching for its true potential.  Tax reform is all about helping the middle class succeed. It is about making it easier to create jobs in America and keep them right here. To summarize the effort in one phrase, it is this: Tax reform is about taking more money out of Washington's pocket and putting more in yours--more for workers, more for small businesses, and more for the middle class. After all, as the President wrote over the weekend, ``we are not talking about the government's money--we are talking about your money, your hard work.''  If you look back a few months, many doubted our ability to get a budget done or to advance tax reform. They didn't see the path forward. Those skeptics underestimated our resolve. The Senate has delivered on the budget, and we will soon have the tools to deliver on tax reform.  We now look forward to our House colleagues' continued consideration and passage of the budget. Once they do so, we can move forward with tax reform for American families.  For Americans who have suffered through years of uncertainty--everything from a recession to outsourcing to unemployment--we are ready to deliver for you. For those who watched opportunity recede while the personal wealth of coastal elites grew beyond comprehension, help is on the way. We want to put more money in your pocket, we want to make retirement a reality for you, we want to get this economy moving the way it should, and tax reform is the key to helping us get there.  I would like once again to thank Chairman Enzi and the members of the Budget Committee for their important work to get this budget resolution passed.[[Page S6705]]  I also would like to thank the cloakroom staff, the Parliamentarians, the clerks, the pages, and the officers of the U.Capitol Police who worked into the evening to make sure, as they always do, that the Senate runs smoothly.  Thanks also to Chairman Hatch and the members of the Finance We now look forward to their continued good work on development of the kind of tax relief that will get our economy truly moving again.  Mr.President, on another matter, the Senate remains committed to doing its part to support the ongoing hurricane relief efforts, and, to that end, today we will take a vote to advance the administration's most recent supplemental funding request. These resources will ensure that FEMA and the rest of the administration have the ability to continue their crucial support to help those impacted by devastating storms.  Like many colleagues, I have been engaged on this issue from the very start. Through several meetings with leaders from Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands, I have had the opportunity to hear firsthand how the government can support their relief efforts. I met with Puerto Rico's Governor last week to get another update on the funding request and to hear about the continuing recovery.  In addition, I have continued working with the administration as it responds to these storms. For instance, after the devastation of Hurricane Harvey, I met with the Department of Homeland Security's Acting Secretary to learn more about what would be needed. I also met with President Trump's eminently qualified nominee to lead that  The House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a supplemental funding request with strong bipartisan support, and now it is our turn to act. As we all know, the administration will continue to actively review hurricane relief and recovery needs. As it does, we can expect the transmittal of additional supplemental requests for our consideration in the near future.  The victims of these hurricanes continue to count on our support, and I look forward to the Senate continuing to do its part to help.

883,topic-id,470,"Mr.President, I just want to address very briefly one other issue that surfaced last week.  Press reports indicate there are multiple nominees of President Trump awaiting Senate confirmation, but even though they haven't been confirmed--there has not been a vote maybe even in committee, I understand; certainly they have not been confirmed by the Yet they are engaged in the very duties of the positions for which they have been nominated. That includes nominees showing up to work, even though they are not yet confirmed. It means they attend White House meetings, even though they are not yet confirmed. They show up for photo ops, even though they are not confirmed. This includes officials with at least three different agencies.  If accurate, this is nothing but an end run around our constitutional system.

We have always insisted that these kinds of nominees await a vote first.

Although I may have hated to wait sometimes, we insisted on it. So I raise that point.  It raises a real question. I am told that it may be a violation of the law. It certainly raises a question if they make decisions based on their responsibilities in a position that requires confirmation and they haven't been confirmed. We may be facing lawsuits--taxpayers paying to defend lawsuits--when all they have to do is wait a few days.  Republicans are in charge of the They can bring up these nominees.

Police brutality is a reality African Americans grapple with every day.  African Americans are three times more likely to be killed by police than White people. That is a reality. That is not a perception. The facts speak for themselves.  Despite being only 13 percent of our population, nearly 25 percent of those killed by police in the United States each year are African That is a reality. That is not a perception.  Nearly 99 percent of police-involved shootings have not resulted in any officers involved being convicted of a crime. Now, that is a reality, not a perception.  I also want to be very clear that Black identity extremism does not exist. It is simply not real. No academics or journalists have uncovered such a movement. No one has identified as a leader of such a movement. No act of hate or violence has been committed in the name of Black identity extremism.  So what is it, then?

That is why members of the Congressional Black Caucus are here this evening. To sound the alarm.  This is not just another revelation or press report that should be dismissed.  This kind of hateful stigmatization presents a serious threat to the African American community. This is not mere speculation, Mr. If we're honest about the history of our nation, we must admit that the FBI has a disturbing history of surveillance and intimidation of African Americans for political expediency.  I remember all too clearly the lives that were cut short during the civil rights movement through the highly coordinated counterintelligence program known as  For 15 years under the direction of FBI Director Edgar Hoover, the federal government spied on civil rights leaders and sowed division among African Americans with one express goal.  To ``expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize'' any individual or group deemed to be subversive or a threat to the established power structure.  Members of the Black Panther Party were the greatest victims of this vitriolic pursuit.  Under the guise of COINTELPRO FBI agents harassed, intimidated and committed acts of violence against Black Panthers and their supporters.  Men and women were killed as a result of this program. We simply cannot allow government sanctioned violence to develop against innocent African Americans fighting for the perfection of our union.  As the conscience of Congress, members of the Congressional Black Caucus are determined to stop COINTELPRO 2.0 dead in its tracks.  That is why we are demanding that the FBI give a full account to Congress on the development of this report and the sources used to inform it.  It has been said that those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat.  Well Mr.Speaker, we are here to give the American people and the Trump Administration a history lesson.

986,topic-id,1479,"Madam President, as we speak, our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico, Texas, and Florida are recovering from a series of devastating hurricanes. Over 100 people have lost their lives because of these terrible storms, and many more are struggling to get by day to day.  The crisis is perhaps most acute in Puerto Rico, where 35 percent of the population still does not have access to safe drinking water and four out of five Puerto Ricans do not have power.  The people of Florida, Puerto Rico, and Texas have responded with great tenacity and admirable creativity to this disaster. I wish the same could be said of the politicians here in Washington,  Once again, this body is poised to fail the American people. Instead of helping the victims of these disasters through responsible aid paired with lasting reform, Congress has rushed to its favorite so-called solution--billions of dollars in new spending with little accountability or meaningful oversight.  If this $36.5 billion aid package passes, it will mean even more money and more power for government programs that in some cases left us vulnerable to these disasters in the first place. If it passes, the politicians and lobbyists will pat themselves on the back for doing a good deed and then move on to the next multibillion dollar spending opportunity. Meanwhile, the people of Florida, Puerto Rico, and Texas will be left to pick up the pieces and to deal with the disastrous consequences of this approach.  Puerto Rico, in particular, has to contend with the effects of a devastating storm and decades of malfeasance that has left Puerto Rico with $74 billion of debt.  This crisis calls for emergency aid, yes. More than that, it calls for true lasting reform, the type of reform that is noticeably absent from this measure. That is why I am voting no on this shortsighted bill, because it is easy to caricature a vote against emergency aid as calloused or cruel, but it is hard to do the real work that is necessarily required by real, lasting, meaningful reform.  It is harder still to defend these packages when their contents are exposed fully to the light of day. If you were evaluating an emergency aid package, you might reasonably expect it to direct all of its spending to programs that actually help the people of Florida, of Puerto Rico, of Texas, but this proposal does not even come close to directing all of its money to broad-based recovery efforts.  Just under half of the $36.5 billion in new spending would bail out the National Flood Insurance Program, or In the Houston area, just 17 percent of homeowners were enrolled in the In Puerto Rico, the numbers are even more sparse. Just 5,600 Puerto Ricans are enrolled in NFIP, less than 1 percent of homeowners. That means 99 percent of Puerto Ricans will not get anything at all from the $16 billion to But then again, it is not clear that NFIP recipients get much from NFIP to begin with.  The National Flood Insurance Program represents the triumph of good intentions over sound public policy. Its generous subsidies were supposed to reduce the need for Federal aid after massive storms. Instead, NFIP encourages thousands of Americans to live in some of the most dangerous real estate in the country.  NFIP sells flood insurance at rates well below that of any reasonable private insurer. As a result, its policies do not accurately reflect the risk of living in manifestly flood-threatened, flood-endangered areas. These government policies encourage Americans to live in precisely those areas where their livelihoods--and, in fact, even their lives--can be swept away in an instant.  Economists refer to this perverse incentive as moral hazard, and, in more senses than one, that is just what the National Flood Insurance Program is--a hazard to It is distinctly immoral for the government to subsidize housing in the Nation's flood plains--deep within the flood plains--or on the edges of its coast. Instead of building your house on a rock, the government wants you to build it on the sand.  NFIP pays out claims for properties that have been swept away not once, not twice, but many, many times before. Homes that have been flooded multiple times make up just 1 percent of NFIP policyholders, but they account for more than one-third of its claims. This has cost taxpayers more than $12.1 billion in payouts according to the Congressional Research  When Hurricane Harvey swept through Houston last month, it submerged a house that had been flooded 22 times since 1979. The house is valued at about $600,000. The government has spent $1.8 million to rehabilitate it.  No private insurance company would ever offer insurance on the terms that NFIP offers. Such a company would endanger its policyholders, and it would run out of money.  That is precisely what has happened under The program is $25 billion in debt and routinely blows through its statutory debt limits.  The emergency aid package Congress is considering today would cancel $16 billion of NFIP's debt--no questions asked. Congress isn't making NFIP bring its actuarial practices in line with reality or into conformity with free-market forces. No, it isn't even appropriating new funds for another failed program. That, at least, would be business as usual in Instead, Congress is effectively giving a debt amnesty to the National Flood Insurance It is absolving NFIP of its sins and making American taxpayers do the penance.  So that is an example of what is in the bill. Let's consider a little bit of what is not in the bill.  If we want to be responsible leaders in a moment of crisis like this one, we need to provide long-term reforms in addition to any short-term assistance. We need to provide a full meal to those affected by these storms and not just a temporary, passing sugar rush.  But this bill does not include any reforms that would help Puerto Rico attain long-term stability or climb out from underneath its $74 billion debt. It doesn't even attempt to reform the dysfunctional electrical utility program which, through a combination of neglect and profiteering, has left millions of Puerto Ricans in darkness. Without electricity, Puerto Rico can't power hospitals, clinics, food banks, or even sewage systems. And it doesn't repeal the Jones Act, the protectionist regulation that kept foreign-flagged relief ships out of Puerto Rican harbors for precious days after Hurricane Maria and for a long time has forced Puerto Rican consumers to pay significantly higher prices on just about everything they buy.  Simple reform measures such as reforming PREPA, the electric utility company I mentioned a moment ago, or repealing the Jones Act would provide very meaningful, lasting benefits to Puerto Ricans long after the public's attention has drifted and the relief money has dried up. But Congress, true to form, would rather double down on broken laws and broken programs rather than fix them, and Congress would rather take on more debt than spend according to what we have and prioritize in order to get there.  None of this $36.5 billion in emergency spending is offset by spending reductions on other programs--none of it--not a single dollar. That is the sad irony of this bill. If the trend of deficit-fueled spending continues, one day soon we will wake up to the cries of our fellow Americans and we will have nothing to give them in support.  Again, this bill doesn't take care of those programs, and it is not as if there aren't solutions out there. One of my colleagues, Senator Paul, has effectively been blocked from introducing an amendment that would call for offsets to this spending. Another one of my colleagues, Senator Flake, has tried to introduce an amendment, of which I am a cosponsor, that would bring about some of these other reforms I have described--reforms to the State-owned utility company, to the Jones Act, and reforms to the way that we spend money through the Federal Government in Puerto Rico.[[Page S6711]]  I hope my colleagues will work with me on a more responsible, sustainable, meaningful way to help our brothers and sisters in areas affected by the recent hurricanes. Congress has the authority to lead, especially over Puerto Rico, where we have plenary power that exceeds the authority we have in other parts of the country within In this hour of crisis, especially with regard to Puerto Rico, we are the only ones who indisputably have this power, and we are the ones who must act if we are going to achieve meaningful reform.  If we can only offer money and a pat on the head, it will be our fault when the American people continue to suffer as a result of failed programs that haven't worked and call out to us through their failures for reform.

I know that our budget shapes our national priorities and values, but the Republicans have put forward a budget that I think is downright sinister. This budget is morally bankrupt. It is a Trojan horse that steals healthcare from children and rips food from the hungry just to fast-track $1.5 trillion in tax breaks to billionaires and corporations.  Budgets are moral documents. They should not be rigged in favor of special interests and the wealthy few, but the cruel and crooked Republican budget does just that.

10,topic-id,447,"Mr.President, today I wish to honor Joseph Guio, Jr., a hero who made the ultimate sacrifice saving the lives of his fellow crewmembers aboard the USS Monaghan during World War  Gunners Mate Third Class Guio was one of the hundreds of men who were lost at sea during Typhoon Cobra, which struck Task Force-38 in December of 1944. Task Force-38 consisted of 7 fleet carriers, 6 escort carriers, 8 battleships, 15 cruisers, and 50 destroyers that had been operating in the Philippine Sea conducting air raids against Japanese airfields.  Survivors of the event reported that Joe freed a raft from the sinking ship and was injured in the process. Regardless, he continued to pull his fellow men to the safety of the raft and saved many lives. Aboard the raft, his grateful comrades tried to comfort Joe in his last moments, and he thanked them for doing so before he passed on.  When the Monaghan sank, 256 crewmembers were lost. Twenty held on to the raft for some time, but after days at sea, exhausted, injured, and struggling against 50-foot waves, that number dwindled to six. The USS Brown rescued the six survivors 3 days later.  Joe's body was never recovered, but his name is inscribed on the Tablets of the Missing at the American Cemetery and Memorial in Manila, He was 25 years old.

765,topic-id,661,"Mr.President, this summer the Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, turned 20 years old.  I served on the House committee that created this bill and was proud to support providing the affordable comprehensive health insurance to low-income children and pregnant women. It is a bipartisan program, and it is an effective program. Last year alone, CHIP covered nearly 9 million children throughout the country. In Massachusetts, CHIP has been instrumental in achieving near-universal coverage for our children in the Bay  Yet, instead of celebrating CHIP's successes over the last two decades, congressional Republicans have placed CHIP in programmatic purgatory. That is because they allowed CHIP to expire at the end of Instead of focusing on reauthorizing this critical healthcare lifeline, Republican leadership chose to waste months of time trying to repeal the Affordable Care They let just one of these successful programs lapse while they tried unsuccessfully to end another. They were more interested in ripping healthcare coverage away from millions of Americans and taking a machete to Medicaid rather than protecting our Nation's children.  We should not forget that CHIP stands on Medicaid's shoulders. Any fundamental changes to how Medicaid operates--whether it is block-granting or capping the program--will hamstring CHIP's ability to serve children as effectively and efficiently as it was intended to do, but instead of immediately returning attention to ensuring that this lapsed deadline is not effective, House Republicans have further delayed action by inserting partisan policies to pay for the program. This has not only caused an unnecessary delay in passing a bill to reauthorize CHIP, but it has dragged CHIP onto the political game board, turning it and our children into pawns in their ruthless game of partisan chess.  CHIP has historically been and should be above such games because CHIP is not just an insurance program, it is a reassurance program. It reassures States that they can provide comprehensive healthcare coverage to some of their most vulnerable, it reassures doctors that their patients will be able to access care and treatment, it reassures teachers that their students can be healthy enough to learn, and it reassures Mom and Dad that their children can still get well in the face of financial hardship.  Continued inaction on CHIP is dangerous and damaging. Every day we delay reauthorizing CHIP is another day parents across the United States live in fear that their children may soon lose their health insurance. They panic at the thought of leaving their child's asthma untreated, skipping a trip to the dentist, or delaying a doctor's visit because they can't afford to pay for the treatment or medication that may be prescribed. If we don't act soon, this fear may become a terrible reality for families. In Massachusetts, CHIP funding will expire early next year. This could impact coverage for 160,000 children in the Commonwealth, potentially delaying access to treatment and services that could have ramifications into adulthood.  In Congress, we are celebrating the 20th birthday of a successful children's insurance program by effectively threatening to end it. That is what Congress is now doing to the State of That is what they are saying to the State of Massachusetts; that they are going to effectively try to shut down a program that for 20 years has served the children in our That makes no sense.  I urge my Republican colleagues to put their partisan games aside to provide certainty and stability to States, to providers, and to reassure families by reauthorizing When President Trump says he wants to make the healthcare system in America better, when President Trump says he wants to make sure families are able to take care of their children, we have a program that does that already. It is successful, and families and the States love it. All we need is Republicans in the Senate to work together in order to make sure that program continues for the health of all children in our country.  I yield the floor.

449,topic-id,1554,"Mr.President, I think it is going to be a very robust conversation about taxes. When we look into the eyes of working Americans, I hope my Republican colleagues are ready to answer this question, and that is, Why do they, the Republican Party, want to send $3.5 trillion of tax benefits to the top 1 percent? Why not spend the tax benefits on the middle class?  Well, my colleagues keep coming to the floor and saying this is all about the middle class, but they don't mention that, in fact, every single major change is all about benefits for the richest 1 percent.  Changing the dynasty tax to create a dynasty loophole, wow, that really doesn't benefit anybody in the working class. Lowering the top bracket while raising the bottom bracket, well, that doesn't help anybody in the working class. Providing a special passthrough for those who can put their business activities into limited liability corporations and have a special low rate, well, that certainly doesn't help anybody in the middle class.  One provision after another, after another is targeted at the richest Americans, while coming and preaching help for the middle class. Oh, the American people will see right through this scheme. They are going to ask: Why is it you do so little for those at the bottom? In fact, you do nothing for those in the bottom third. Why is it you do so little for those in the middle class? In fact, many of them will see a tax increase. Why do you send the vast bulk of the benefits to the richest Americans when the richest Americans are already so much richer than anyone else?  The debate we are going to have is important. For my colleagues who think they can fool the American people by talking about the middle class and instead are targeting the richest to be richer, I have news: It is not going to work.                           Climate Disruption  Now, Mr.President, I will turn to a different topic. Climate disruption is a seminal challenge of our generation. It affects everything from our forests to fisheries and farming. Rural America is the core target of the impacts of the changing climate, and we see the impacts worldwide. We see it in disappearing ice sheets and melting permafrost and the reduced number of glaciers around the world and dying coral reefs. We see it in migrating animals and insects. We certainly see it in the more powerful hurricanes hitting the United States in Texas and Puerto Rico and  In response, communities around the world are transforming their energy economies. They are increasing the efficiencies of their buildings, their vehicles, and their appliances. They are working to replace carbon-polluting fossil fuel energy with clean and renewable energy.  Well, how much do you know about the changes underway? Let's find out. Welcome to episode 6 of the ``Senate Climate Disruption Quiz.'' Here we go.  First question: In December of 2016, vehicle emissions and coal production in the United States of America were each at record lows since what year? Were they at record lows since 1970, 1974, 1980, or 1986? Lock in your answers.  The answer is not 1970 or 1974 or 1980; the answer is 1986. We are now working on over three decades, despite a vast increase in the vehicle miles traveled. We have reduced the emissions, and we certainly reduced the emissions in coal production. We are experiencing quite[[Page S6829]]a change. We see the transition through clean and renewable energy irrevocably underway.  Let's go to the second question. How many Republican Representatives--Members of the House--asserted that climate change has the potential to adversely impact all Americans? How many Republican Members of the House? Was it 13 or 17 or 20 or 22? Admittedly, it is a modest number.  The number was 17. The answer is These 17 Republican lawmakers introduced a resolution warning that ``if left unaddressed, the consequences of a changing climate have the potential to adversely impact all Americans.'' So this is a very big deal, that 17 Republicans in the party financed by the coal and oil billionaires, who have really taken complete control of the U.Senate, stood up to them and said: We are going to speak on behalf of our responsibility, as citizens of the United States of America, to protect our citizens from the assault on our farming and our forestry and our fishing from climate disruption. I praise those 17 for having done so. It is a powerful, bipartisan step in the right direction of championing the cause of all Americans--and for that matter, the entire planet.  Question 3: In July of this year, California extended its cap-and-trade program to which year? Did it extend it for just a couple of years to 2020 or to the year 2025, 2030, or 2035? How long did California lay this vision into the future? Lock in your answers.  The answer is 2030. The program would have otherwise expired in 2020, so they extended it another decade. It was basically a statement of confidence that the program that they laid out, that they have in place now, is working and deserves extension. It is the only program of its kind in the country, and it is the second largest in the world.  Under this vision, this new and expanded program, California will cut its emissions of carbon dioxide 40 percent from its 1990 levels, despite having a vastly expanded economy. That is a powerful vision and a vision we need to extend through completely eliminating the burning of fossil fuels in the next three decades.  Question 4: How many acres of our citizen-owned--that is, our Federal--fossil fuels were leased to industry as of October 2016? Had we leased out 30 million acres of Federal land for the extraction of fossil fuels or 45 million or 53 million or 67 million? Any of these is really a vast amount of what we own as citizens. Lock in your answers.  The answer is at the top end of the spectrum--67 million acres. What this means is that for years and even decades into the future, we have already contracted for a vast amount of fossil fuels to be extracted from our citizen-owned lands. These extractions add to the problem facing rural America and the impact on our farmers and our fishermen and our forests. That area which has been leased out for the extraction of fossil fuels, which, as citizens, you and I own, is the size of Colorado--a vast sea of fossil fuel extraction leases on public lands. It shows the dire need to pass the Keep It in the Ground  The only responsible thing for us to do is to not do any more leases of our citizen-owned oil or coal or gas. The responsible thing to do, the right thing to do, especially as we work in partnership with the world, is to say no new leases that expand this 67 million acre number.  Now let's turn to Question 5. Which U.community was the first to make a decision to divest all of its oil and gas stocks because of the impact of oil and gas on destroying our Nation? Was it Cooperstown, NY; Salem, OR; Lawrence, KS; or Walla Walla, WA? Lock in your answers.  The answer is Cooperstown, There is quite an interesting story behind this, a remarkable story. At the center of the story is a man named Louis Mr.Allstadt is a retired ExxonMobil executive. At one point, he managed all of Mobil Oil's exploration in the United States, Canada, and Latin America, so he knew the oil industry, the fossil fuel industry, inside-out from the very top level.  After retiring, he ran for town trustee in As a town trustee, he then spearheaded an effort for Cooperstown to become the first town in the United States to divest its oil and gas stocks. Mr.Allstadt summed it up this way: ``You don't just keep driving your car when you see a cliff ahead.'' Well said. Yet so many in this Chamber are determined to drive the car over the cliff.  From the high reaches of the executive suites of Exxon Mobil, Mr.Allstadt could see the damage being done to the planet by the continued burning of fossil fuels. He saw the absolute need to stop, and he took a principled, moral stand on behalf of us all.  Thank you, Mr.Allstadt, for doing that and setting that example. It is one we should all pay attention to. Every city council and every mayor across the country should ask the question: Should we follow Mr.Allstadt's example, the example of Cooperstown, NY? Because if we continue in the direction we are going, we will do fabulous amounts of damage from which we will not easily recover--if we can recover at all.  So there you have it, folks--episode 6 of the ``Senate Climate Disruption Quiz.'' These questions were ripped from the headlines. Facts on the ground are changing fast as climate disruption increases and communities across the globe respond. We are racing the clock, and we have no time to spare. So stay engaged in the fight.  In the near future, I will bring you episode 7 of the ``Senate Climate Disruption Quiz.''  Thank you, Mr. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

603,topic-id,797,"Mr.President, I couldn't disagree more with my colleague from He gave a very studious presentation that missed all the key facts. He made a big point out of the fact that we would lose a dispute resolution tool, but, in fact, access to small claims and access to arbitration remain in place, so it is simply wrong.  He noted that small claims is a great option, but, of course, what we are talking about are provisions in which credit card companies and cell phone companies and broadband companies put charges on your bill that are unjustified, but they are small amounts. They are little amounts. It is $5 here, slammed there; it is $10 there, jammed on your bill there. You discover it, and you call them up, and they say: Well, you can come to arbitration. Of course, arbitration means they choose the decision maker; they pay the decision maker, and that decision maker comes to them for future business. So it is completely rigged.  If anyone wanted to see an example of the swamp at work here in DC, we have it on the floor tonight. This is Big Business taking justice and ripping it out of the hands of consumers across our  It costs fees to go to small claims; you can't go to small claims for $10 or $5 or $20. This is well understood.  My colleague made a big point about the fact that a lot of companies settle. These companies have the best lawyers that money can buy. They settle only when they have cheated the consumer and they know there is a chance they are going to get a worse verdict if it goes to trial. It is smart for them, and it saves money for them not to continue to adjudicate a case in which, clearly, they are wrong. So, of course, they will settle. This is not an argument against consumer rights; it is an argument for consumer rights.  My colleague made the argument that 25 percent of the fees go to the lawyers, but he didn't point out that means 75 percent goes to the consumers. Why is that a fair deal? Because consumers can't afford to go to court for $10 or $20 or $15, so they are awfully happy to be able to get 75 percent of what they are owed.  Again, he didn't begin to mention the fact that the whole point is deterrence. These companies are given a right to cheat because there is no way for a customer to get a fair adjudication. In arbitration, the company chooses the judge; the company pays the judge. And these judges come back time and again for case after case after case, finding for the companies time after time after time. So if you want a rigged system, if you want an example of a swamp flooding this room right here, this is it, right here, right now.  Deterring companies from cheating individuals makes a lot of sense. It adds a lot of value to our society. Credit card customers, nursing home residents, students with loans, veterans--veterans weigh in heavily against the abusive practice of a rigged system--certainly customers of cell phone companies and broadband.  I have had this experience myself. I looked at a bill, and I said: Wait, what is this charge on here that I have never seen before? I called up the company. Of course, you go through a phone tree, and you spend an hour trying to talk to some real person who is way overseas somewhere. They say: Well, we just added it to your bill 6 months ago, and you should have protested it the first month it was on your bill. Well, I don't look at the details every single month to see if the company tried to cheat me. And if they did it to me, they did it to thousands and thousands of others. They were willing to reimburse 1 month of this, but not the first 5 months. At $10 a month, that is $50. You can't go to small claims for $50. You can't go to court for $50. The only fair thing is to have the full range of options, and that is taken away by arbitration.  I would bet none of my colleagues here, not a one--and if any colleague would like to stand up and say they disagree, I would like to hear it--not a one would agree to have a serious dispute settled in which the opponent chooses the judge, pays the judge, and that judge gets business from them all the time. That is rigged and that is wrong, and that is why I encourage my colleagues to vote against this resolution tonight.

740,topic-id,1504,"Mr.President, I am coming to the floor to talk about the challenge we have with forest fires that have been raging in the West, in Montana and Idaho and Washington and Oregon and California, and periodically we have devastating fires in Colorado, New Mexico, and  We have to figure out how we do a better job in a multitude of ways. First, it is very important that we quit treating terrible fire years, enormous fires, as if they are some ordinary event because there is currently no FEMA-style reaction to terrible forest fires.  We respond with FEMA for tornadoes and for floods and for tidal waves and for hurricanes and for earthquakes but not forest fires. Well, the result is, the Forest Service runs out of funds to fight the fires in a bad year, and then they have to drain all the other programs they are working on, including the programs to prepare for future timber cuts, the programs to thin the forests, the programs to repair the infrastructure in the Federal forests, all these other efforts, and then they can't resume those efforts until we have restored their funding, which can come often far later.  This fire borrowing has to end. That is why we absolutely need to support the bill Senator Wyden, Senator Crapo, and others have been working on to say: Let's create a FEMA-like structure for these worst fires so we end this fire-borrowing devastation of the fire accounts. That absolutely needs to happen.  Right now, there are three funding issues we need to address. First, we need to help out the communities that have been impacted economically by these devastating fires. Some have been scorched directly, others have been profoundly affected by the smoke in the community, others have been affected by highways being shut down, and others have been impacted by tourism dropping dramatically. So it is very important that we send a message to the Department of Agriculture, the Small Business Administration, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development to say: Use your emergency programs to assist these communities. We really should make sure they are at the front of the line, along with those who have suffered the disasters in Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico, for emergency loans and assistance from the Small Business Administration and for an augmented share of community development block grants to assist them in a very flexible fashion.  I had the chance to meet this weekend with leaders in the Rogue Valley to talk about how smoke had affected them, and company after company after company had been dramatically impacted. Some you would say was obvious. If you have a zip line company and tourists aren't coming because the smoke is very thick, you are going to be impacted, but others are a little less obvious; for example, the production of wine and the potential impact of the smoke and the fires directly on the harvest but then also on perhaps tainting the flavor of the wine, which will have an impact down the road.  So we need to make sure we do all we can to assist these communities just as we are assisting the communities that have been devastated by Hurricanes Harvey, Maria, and  The second thing we need to do is, we need to include $200 million in the next package, the third tranche of assistance for the disasters this year. We need $200 million to fund the repair and replacement of infrastructure and trail infrastructure damaged--the buildings and the trails that were damaged by these forest fires. Now, that $200 million, that goes half to trails and infrastructure that were damaged by the hurricanes and half to those impacted by the fires. Essentially, the damage was roughly equally split. Without this type of funding, the Forest Service will be forced to postpone or cancel projects in fiscal year 2018 to accommodate the recovery. It will compromise the work to remove hazardous trees for public safety, road and trail maintenance, restoring vegetation in watersheds, and rehabilitating wildlife and fish habitat.  The third thing we have to do is seize the moment and invest in fire resilience. Every single time we have a fire season like this--and this season we spent almost twice as much, on average, to fight the fires--people ask: Why don't we do more on the front end to reduce the risk of these fires?  Well, that is such logical thinking to do more on the front end. What do they mean by that? We have millions of acres of second-growth forests. We clearcut them. Some of them regrew naturally. Others were replanted. We replant virtually everything now. After 10 or 20 years, the trees are very close together. The branches are very close to the ground. This is prime territory for fires. Fires love this. Disease loves this. So it becomes a real problem unless you go in and thin the trees enormously--take out a lot of those trees--and proceed to get rid of the hazardous fuels of branches that accumulate on the ground and so forth. But if you do those two things, those forests become much more resistant to fire.  When you are doing this on a stand that is a bit older--20 or 30 years older--you also get a significant supply of sawlogs for the mills. So this is a real win-win situation. You get a forest that is better in resisting fire, you get a forest that is better in resisting disease, you get a forest that is better for timber stands, and you get a forest that is better in terms of being an ecosystem. With all that winning, we need to do more to make it actually happen.  In my State of Oregon, there are 1.6 million acres that have already gone through the environmental process. They are ready to be thinned and have the hazardous fuels removed. In Washington State, it is at least 400,000 acres. There are probably hundreds of thousands of acres in every State from Montana and Idaho to California, Nevada, and New  This picture shows the difference. This road right here had a stand on the left that had not been thinned. If you can make out the colors, these trees are dead. They are all brown--dead trees because of the heat of the fire when it swept through. This side of the road had been treated. The trees had been thinned. The brush had been[[Page S6796]]taken out from below. They often call that mowing. It has had prescriptive fire in it, which means after you have thinned it, you may go 10 or 15 years, and then let fire burn up the shrubs at the base. Therefore, on this side of the road, the forest is undamaged.  In fact, I went out to this area outside of Sisters, OR, this last weekend. It is just remarkable how the area that had been thinned and treated with mowing and prescription fire became very resistant to the fire that was sweeping toward It really helped the Forest Service fight the fire because they could easily maneuver through the area that had been thinned, much more than the area that hadn't been thinned. So that Milli fire was stopped before it got to Sisters, thankfully. In other places where the forest hadn't been thinned, the outcome might have been very different.  Let's invest now in this win-win. Let's not succumb to the traditional timber wars of the past. After fires like this, there are those folks who come along and say: We just need to clearcut everything. Let's do a 10,000-square-foot timber sale with no environmental review and allow everything to be cut. That was the 1950s. In fact, we have a bill in this Chamber that says: Do exactly that, and you can take out the old growth and the big trees. The irony of that is those are the trees that are actually fire resistant. Those are the trees you want to leave.  This is a solution that brings the environmental world and the timber world together and provides a supply of sawlogs for our mills. Let's make that type of vision happen. But to do that, we have to fund the effort. We have to have the funds to be able to go in and do that thinning and mowing and fire prescription. That is why we are asking for about $600 million to help thin the forests of Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, New Mexico, and wherever else there is a forest that has gone through that environmental review. It is ready for action. Let's put Americans to work in those forests in this win-win strategy.  Three things we need to do: Help our communities that are scorched, proceed to invest in emergency repair of the damaged infrastructure on our forest lands, and invest a significant $500 to $600 million in thinning the forests that have already gone through environmental review.

Just last week, together we sent a letter to U.Ambassador Nikki It was signed by 21 of our colleagues. It called for ``tangible actions against the Burmese government to end the violence, to help the Burmese people and make clear that there will be consequences for those who commit such atrocities against civilians.''  I am pleased to partner with my colleague on this. I think he will share some remarks, and then I will follow up with some remarks of my own.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-10-25-pt1-PgS6781.txt,1900,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2017.0,25.0,October
745,topic-id,1756,"Mr.President, I appreciate the comments of my colleague and the opportunity for us to work together to help shine a light on this moment of great atrocities in the world. A great deal of what we are calling for is for America to do more to shine a light on it and for the world to work together, not just to shine a light on it but to end it and to proceed to have as much healing as can possibly take place.  I thank my colleague from Indiana for being deeply in this conversation. It is a real pleasure to work on the Foreign Relations Committee together.  We must address this situation. According to a report from the U.High Commissioner for Human Rights, ``government forces and Buddhist extremists in Burma have carried out `a well-organized, coordinated and systematic' campaign of human rights violations against the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar's Rakhine State,'' with a strategy to ``instill deep and widespread fear and trauma--physical, emotional and psychological--among the Rohingya population.'' This comes after the commissioner's statement that this ``security operation,'' as they refer to it, in Burma was ``a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.''  As we ponder international relations, we see from time to time that one group, somewhere in the world, will respond to deep tribal impulses and prejudices and seek to wipe out another group. These are horrific moments in history, and we have seen this movie--this situation--occur time and again. After such atrocities, the world has said ``never again''--``never again,'' meaning that we will respond when we see this happening. We will apply great pressure. We will coordinate with the world to make sure it stops, because such effort to wipe out another ethnic group is so unacceptable and it is such a crime against humanity.  But here we are, and it is happening right now in It is happening with a Buddhist nation.  We normally associate the Buddhist religion with a main emphasis on peaceful conduct. Yet this tribal impulse--these deep prejudices are so powerful that they overcome whatever peaceful impulse there is, and they have resulted in a massive effort to wipe out the Rohingya people. In the course, there have been a massive number of rapes. There have been children killed right in front of their mothers. There have been villages surrounded by soldiers and then the village huts set on fire, and then they have been shot as they flee. This is about as inhumane as it can get.  Something close to 300 villages have burned to the ground. By some estimates, 3,000 civilians have been killed. A few weeks ago, we were talking about 400,000 refugees pouring into Now, the number is 600,000 Rohingya refugees.  Roughly half the Rohingyas live in Burma, and those refugees include 300,000 children. Think about the type of trauma those children have just experienced and the challenges they will have regaining a foundation to thrive. Then there are those who are internally displaced inside of Burma, who have been driven out of their villages but haven't been able to make their way to This is the challenge we face.  There is an area of Bangladesh called Cox's That is where these two main refugee camps are. International aid groups are working to quickly get as many resources as they can into this area so that people do not starve and so that medical wounds can be addressed. But there is still a significant lack of food, a lack of clean water, and a lack of sanitary bath and toilet facilities. That condition is ripe for spreading disease--diseases like cholera.  When I was home in Oregon, I met with a group of Rohingya refugees who came and settled in As we can imagine, they have a very personal connection to what is happening. Some of them have distant relatives still there. Some have immediate family members. They don't know exactly what has happened to everyone in the middle of this chaos.  We also heard about villages that didn't get burned down but where the military was blockading people from leaving the village to go to the fields to secure food and blocking them from leaving the fields and going back into the village, probably responding to international outrage over villages being burned and essentially resorting to a strategy of starving out the villages to drive people away. Imagine being trapped in one of those villages, knowing what is happening to village after village after village, knowing children have been slaughtered, women have been raped and often killed, and men have been shot. The desperation is enormous.  I heard firsthand accounts of conditions of refugees from Reza Uddin, who had just returned from a 2-week trip to visit them. He told powerful and moving stories about children who had been brutalized, children who had been separated from their parents, children who might possibly now be orphans because it is not clear if their parents are still alive or, if alive, where they are.  The world collectively has not done enough. The community of nations has not done enough to address this unspeakable brutality. Bangladesh should be complimented for accepting these refugees fleeing for their lives. They have been cooperative. It is a challenge for them, and we should acknowledge that. We should continue to ask them to do everything possible and to give the U.High Commissioner for Refugees and various aid organizations full opportunity, full access, and full authority to be in and assist those in these refugee camps.  The United States, the United Kingdom, and the United Nations have condemned the actions of the Burmese, and that is certainly appropriate, but we haven't done enough. We have not taken the steps to which my colleague referred to strengthen sanctions or coordinate international countries to all weigh in. The only thing that will make a real difference here is pressure on the Burmese military. They are in charge. We can criticize the civilian government in Burma, and many have, and they have been unable to stop what[[Page S6799]]is going on and sometimes often reflect the prejudices that contributed to this, but it is the military that makes the decisions.  We had testimony from the State Department yesterday, and one of the officials used the term ``vigilantes'' for what the vigilantes are doing in this oppression. That is not the right term to use. This is not uncoordinated action. This is action coordinated through the military decision-making process. You don't surround camps, you don't have significant planning that goes into it, and have it just be vigilantes. Vigilantes may be involved, but they are not the driving force. They might be assisting the soldiers in some cases, but this is a coordinated act of the military of Burma, and it is important that the community of nations convey to the military how unacceptable this is and that there will be significant consequences.  My colleague has referred to the fact that in this situation no military sales should be made to such a military. That is important, but that takes a conversation among nations, and the United States needs to be deeply engaged in this.  There is a lot of international fundraising going on. There was a donors conference held on Monday to assist the refugees. It raised about $200 million or a little more in new funds. That is about $400 per refugee. That is not nearly enough to provide for shelter or care in a situation with complete lack of access to fields or farming or support. It is going to take more than that. We should be involved in working with the United Nations, UNICEF, World Health, UNHCR, or the U.High Commissioner for Refugees, and the World Food Program to step up and assist. I certainly believe it would be very helpful to have President Trump take this issue on and speak from the heart of our Nation to this dark and evil deed that is happening--that we reject it and we will partner with the rest of the world to end it.  I do feel that there is a history in which we have helped lead nations in these situations. We haven't always been there. I know that President Clinton said that the biggest regret of his administration is that he didn't respond quickly in Central Africa when the Tutsis and Hutus went to battle against each other, slaughtering each other with machetes. This is a chance for us to really respond--to respond aggressively, to have that moral clarity, and to exercise that leadership in the world. I join my colleague in calling for such action for more assistance, with the aid to both Burma and Bangladesh, for the moral clarity to take action that pressures the Burmese military in a significant and compelling way and to provide assistance in the right of return--the ability of these individuals to be able to return to their villages.  Traditionally, this group has been denied citizenship. Early on, we heard from the civilian government in Burma: We will let them come back if they show they are citizens. 1, they have never been granted citizenship. 2, after a horrific situation like this, if they did have papers, they wouldn't have papers now. They would have been burned along with the villages. There needs to be a change in attitude, a change of heart among the Burmese civilian leadership, and certainly among the military, to lead an effort in the peaceful tradition, the Buddhist tradition, of embracing this diversity and returning these people to their land.  Former U.Secretary General Kofi Annan now serves as chairman of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine He and his team have laid out a report with very specific actions--actions that will help end the cycle of radicalization and the cycle of violence. We need to work to try to make sure those things are implemented, to show oppressive governments and the rest of the world that the world will not stand--that the world will respond, and respond aggressively, in a coordinated, forceful way when ethnic cleansing occurs. That is the best deterrent we could have for future atrocities.  Again, I thank my colleague for being in this dialogue and for his support to shine this light and to take a compelling more forceful action. Like him, I look forward to meeting with the Ambassador from Burma later today.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

Subject: Tongass National Forest Land and Resource Management          Plan     Lisa Murkowski,     U.      This is in response to your letter requesting our opinion      on whether the 2016 Amendment to the Tongass Land and      Resource Management Plan (2016 Tongass Amendment or      Amendment), approved by the Tongass Forest Supervisor on      December 9, 2016, is a rule under the Congressional Review      Act (CRA). For the reasons discussed in more detail below, we      conclude that the 2016 Tongass Amendment is a rule under                               BACKGROUND                        Tongass National Forest       The Tongass National Forest is the largest of the 154      national forests It comprises 78 percent of the land base in      southeast Of its approximate 16.7 million acres,      about 10 million acres are forested Of the forested acres,      the Forest Service classifies approximately 5.5 million acres      as being ``productive forest.'' As a national forest, the      Tongass is managed by the Forest Service within the      Department of Agriculture (USDA).       Since inception, the Tongass timber program has been based      on harvesting old-growth trees--in the context of the      Tongass, generally meaning trees more than 150 years old--     that can be a source of high-quality lumber. The Forest      Service began offering timber sales on the Tongass in the      early 1900s. Although timber harvest increased substantially      in the 1950s through 1970s, harvest has since declined      significantly.       A number of laws and regulations have reduced the number of      acres where timber harvest is allowed on national forests,      both nationwide and on the Specifically, according      to statistics provided by Forest Service officials, of the      approximately 5.5 million acres of productive forest in the      Tongass, approximately 2 4 million acres are not available      for harvest because of statutory provisions, such as      wilderness designations, and another 1.8 million acres are      not available for harvest because of other factors, such as      USDA adopting the roadless rule.                    National Forest Planning Process       The National Forest Management Act of 1976 (NFMA), as      amended, requires the Forest Service to ``develop, maintain,      and, as appropriate, revise land and resource management      plans for units of the National Forest systems.'' Plans are      to provide for ``the multiple use and sustained yield of the      products and services obtained from [the national forests] .      . . and, in particular, include coordination of outdoor      recreation, range, timber, watershed, wildlife and fish, and      wilderness.'' Thus, the Forest Service must ``balance      competing demands on national forests, including timber      harvesting, recreational use, and environmental      preservation.''       Forest plans identify the uses that may occur in each area      of the forest. The Forest Service is required to update      forest plans at least every 15 years and may amend a plan      more frequently to adapt to new information or changing      conditions. Resource plans and permits, contracts, and other      instruments for the use of national forests must be      consistent with the applicable plans. When a plan is revised,      these instruments are to be revised as soon as practicable to      be made consistent with the revised plan, but only subject to      valid existing legal rights. The Forest Service is required      to promulgate and follow certain procedures set forth in      regulation for the development, amendment, and revision of      forest plans. The decision to adopt a forest plan and the      rationale for making that decision are made public in a      Record of Decision (ROD) issued pursuant to the National      Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). For timber harvest      activities, forest plans typically identify areas where      timber harvest is permitted to occur and set a limit on the      amount of timber that may be harvested from the forest.       The Tongass forest plan allocates defined areas of the      forest to various Land Use Designations (LUDs). In general,      the plan allocates all areas of the forest to LUDs as part of      the forest planning process. Some LUDs implement statutory      land designations, such as wilderness, and areas allocated to      those LUDs must be managed in accordance with the statutory      requirements applicable to those land designations. Other LUD      allocations are for development of resources, such as timber      production, and the Forest Service manages these areas in      accordance with LUD direction, such as by allowing roads to      be built and commercial timber to be harvested.       The descriptions of the uses allowed by the plan within a      LUD and the corresponding permissible activities are      management prescriptions. Each management prescription gives      general direction on what may occur within areas allocated to      the corresponding LUD, the standards for accomplishing each      activity, and the guidelines on how to go about accomplishing      the standards. While a forest plan may allocate certain areas      to a timber LUD, that allocation does not itself authorize      third parties to harvest timber. If the applicable management      prescription allows timber harvesting within a given LUD,      additional steps are required before the contractual right to      harvest timber is created. The Forest Service will identify a      sale area, conduct the required environmental analyses,      appraise the timber, and solicit bids from buyers interested      in purchasing the timber. The Forest Service then prepares      the timber sale contract and marks the sale boundary and the      trees to be cut or left. The purchaser is responsible for      cutting and removing the timber, with the Forest Service      monitoring the harvest operations. These sales or projects      are to be conducted consistent with the applicable forest      plan, but plans generally do not require any specific sale or      project to be undertaken.                    Tongass National Forest Planning       In 1979, the Tongass National Forest was the first to      complete a forest plan under The plan was amended in      1986 and 1991. In 1997 USDA approved a Revised Forest Plan,      which was then amended in 2008.       In 2010, USDA announced its intent to transition the      Tongass timber program to one based predominantly on the      harvest of young growth--generally consisting of trees that      have regrown after the harvest of old growth--in part to help      conserve the remaining old-growth forest. A 2013 memorandum      from the Secretary of Agriculture stated that within 10 to 15      years, the ``vast majority'' of timber harvested in the      Tongass would be young growth. The memorandum also stated      that the transition must be done in a manner that ``preserves      a viable timber industry'' in southeast The Forest      Service announced in May 2014 that it would amend the forest      plan for the Tongass to accomplish the transition. As part      of the decision-making process for the amendment, in      November 2015 the Forest Service released for public      comment its proposed forest plan amendment and      accompanying environmental analyses.       The substantive changes in the 2016 Tongass Amendment are      set out in Chapter 5 of the As compared to the      2008 plan, the 2016 Tongass Amendment generally reduced the      areas potentially open to old-growth harvest while allowing      young growth harvest in some areas previously unavailable for      any type of harvest. Specifically, the 2016 Tongass Amendment      makes the following changes to the 2008 Tongass Land Resource      Management Plan (LRMP):       Allows old-growth harvest only within the portion of the      Tongass National Forest included in the first phase of a      timber sale program adaptive management strategy set forth in      a 2008 Tongass LRMP Amendment Record of Decision;       Allows young-growth harvest in all phases of the 2008      timber sale program adaptive management strategy, but only      outside of roadless areas identified in the 2001 Roadless      Rule;       Allows young-growth management in development LUDs and in      the Old-Growth Habitat LUD, beach and estuary fringe, and      riparian management areas outside of stream buffers, subject      to certain conditions and for a specified period of time;       Establishes direction to protect priority watersheds;       Modifies the network of old-growth reserves to maintain      their effectiveness; and       Includes new management direction to facilitate renewable      energy production.       USDA describes the other changes resulting from the 2016      Tongass Amendment as simply clarifications, corrections of      typographical errors, and updates of references to law,      regulation, and other mandatory policy direction to reflect      the current version of the provisions that have changed since      2008.                        Congressional Review Act       CRA, enacted in 1996 to strengthen congressional oversight      of agency rulemaking, requires all federal agencies,      including independent regulatory agencies, to submit a report      on each new rule to both Houses of Congress and to the      Comptroller General before it can take effect. The report      must contain a copy of the rule, ``a concise general      statement relating to the rule,'' and the rule's proposed      effective date. In addition, the agency must submit to the      Comptroller General a complete copy of the cost-benefit      analysis of the rule, if any, and information concerning the      agency's actions relevant to specific procedural rulemaking      requirements set forth in various statutes and executive      orders governing the regulatory process. CRA also established      special expedited procedures under which Congress may pass a      joint resolution of disapproval that, if enacted into law,      overturns the rule.       USDA has not sent a report on the 2016 Tongass      In its response to us, USDA stated that ``it is the position      of the Department of Agriculture that the 2016 Tongass      Amendment is not subject to Accordingly, the amendment      will not be submitted pursuant to CRA.''                                ANALYSIS       In 1997, we decided whether the Tongass National Forest      Land and Resource Management Plan issued May 23, 1997, was a      rule under In that decision, we reviewed CRA's      definition of a rule, found that the Plan fit within that      definition, and concluded that it was a rule for CRA      purposes. As explained below, we reach the same conclusion      with regard to the 2016 Tongass       CRA incorporates by reference the definition of ``rule''      found in section 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act      (APA) which provides, in relevant part:[[Page S6762]]       ```rule' means the whole or a part of an agency statement      of general or particular applicability and future effect      designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy      or describing the organization, procedure, or practice      requirements of an agency''       However, under CRA, the term ``rule'' does not include:       ``(A) any rule of particular applicability, including a      rule that approves or prescribes for the future rates, wages,      prices, services, or allowances therefor, corporate or      financial structures, reorganizations, mergers, or      acquisitions thereof, or accounting practices or disclosures      bearing on any of the foregoing;       ``(B) any rule relating to agency management or personnel;      or       ``(C) any rule of agency organization, procedure, or      practice that does not substantially affect the rights or      obligations of non-agency parties.''       Consequently, the first step in analyzing whether the 2016      Tongass Amendment is a rule under CRA is to determine whether      it meets the definition in section 551 of       The definition has three key components. A rule must (1) be      an agency statement, (2) have future effect, and (3) be      designed to either implement, interpret, or prescribe law or      policy or describe the agency's organization, procedure, or      practice requirements. First, in order to be a rule, the      statement must be made by an agency. USDA, the issuer of the      2016 Tongass Amendment, is an agency. The 2016 Tongass      Amendment therefore meets the first component of the      definition.       Second, the agency statement must have future effect. The      2016 Tongass Amendment is a guide for future forest      management activities and establishes a prospective      management direction The text of the Amendment specifically      notes that all future plans and activities will be based on      this Forest We therefore conclude that the 2016 Tongass      Amendment also meets the second component of the definition.       Third, the statement must be designed to implement,      interpret, or prescribe law or policy or describe the      agency's organization, procedure, or practice requirements.      The purpose of the 2016 Tongass Amendment, like all forest      plans, is to implement the provisions of NFMA and other      applicable statutory and regulatory provisions. The Amendment      also implements USDA's policy to transition the Tongass      timber program to one based predominantly on the harvest of      young growth. It thus meets the third component of the      definition and falls within the definition of the term      ``rule'' in section 551 of       USDA argues that the Amendment is not a rule because it      does not provide final authorization for any activity and      does not substantially affect the rights or obligations of      non-agency parties. It points out that implementing the      Amendment necessarily requires additional actions by the      Forest Service, and that the Amendment itself neither creates      nor takes away any party's rights or obligations. However,      APA does not require that an agency statement provide final      authorization for any activity, or that it substantially      affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties, to      qualify as a rule. Indeed, ``the impact of an agency      statement upon private parties is relevant only to whether it      is the sort of rule that is a rule of procedure . . . not to      whether it is a rule at all.'' The APA sets forth only the      three requirements described above, each of which is met in      this instance.       Our analysis now turns to whether the Amendment falls under      any of the CRA exceptions. In its response to us, USDA      presents alternative arguments that the 2016 Tongass      Amendment is a rule of particular applicability or,      alternatively, a rule of agency organization, procedure, or      practice that does not substantially affect the rights or      obligations of non-agency parties.                   Rules of Particular Applicability       USDA argues that the 2016 Tongass Amendment is a rule of      particular applicability because it applies to a single      national forest and, thus, is not a rule for purposes of CRA      pursuant to the exception in section 804(3)(a). According to      the legislative history of CRA:       ``Most rules or other agency actions that grant an      approval, license, registration, or similar authority to a      particular person or particular entities, or grant or      recognize an exemption or relieve a restriction for a      particular person or particular entities, or permit new or      improved applications of technology for a particular person      or particular entities, or allow the manufacture,      distribution, sale, or use of a substance or product are      exempted under subsection 804(3)(A) from the definition of a      rule.''       The legislative history also provides examples of rules of      particular applicability such as import and export licenses,      individual rate and tariff approvals, wetlands permits,      grazing permits, plant licenses or permits, drug and medical      device approvals, new source review permits, hunting and      fishing take limits, incidental take permits, broadcast      licenses, and product approvals. The legislative history of      CRA also offers IRS private letter rulings as an example of a      rule of particular applicability. In addition to being      addressed to a specific person or entity, private letter      rulings differ from other IRS guidance and Treasury rules      in that the agency is not bound to follow them in its      dealings with others even on facts that are analogous.      Other IRS guidance and Treasury regulations have legal      force in all instances and are binding on the agency in      all cases; private letter rules have legal force only with      regard to a particular person or entity.       The 2016 Tongass Amendment is not an approval, license, or      registration to a particular person or entity. Nor does it      grant or recognize an exemption or relieve a restriction for      a particular person or entity. While the plan does only apply      to the Tongass National Forest and not to other national      forests, it applies to ``all natural resource management      activities;'' to all projects approved to take place in the      forest; and to all persons or entities that engage in uses      permitted by those projects. For instance, every person or      entity bidding on or engaged in permitted timber harvesting      will be doing so in accordance with the plan. The Amendment      applies to all persons or entities using the forest--not just      a particular person or entity. It is binding on agency action      in all cases, not with respect to one person or entity.       While there is no case law on the question of general      versus particular applicability for purposes of CRA, there is      analogous case law interpreting these terms under APA in      which courts have held rate setting ``addressed to and served      upon named persons in accordance with law'' to be a type of      rule of particular applicability. However, the 2016 Tongass      Amendment does not solely set rates and it does not apply to      a single entity. It states: ``All future plans and activities      will be based on this Forest Plan.'' Additionally, in our      prior decision on the Tongass National Forest Land and      Resource Management Plan issued in 1997, we concluded that      the Plan was of general applicability since it affected many      parties. We therefore conclude that this rule does not fall      within the exception for rules of particular applicability.Rules of Organization, Practice, or Procedure That Do Not Substantially          Affect the Rights or Obligations of Non-Agency Parties       USDA maintains that the 2016 Tongass Amendment is exempt      from the requirements of CRA as a rule of agency      organization, procedure, or practice that does not      substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency      parties. The Amendment governs where old-growth and young-     growth timber harvests are allowed in USDA states      that the Amendment is narrowly focused on accelerating the      transition from a primarily old-growth timber program to a      primarily young-growth program and, in doing so, ``provides      limited modifications to the Tongass LRMP to guide the      Tongass National Forest's procedures and practices going      forward.'' These changes, it asserts, involve agency      procedure and practice relating to the Forest Service's      management of the Tongass National       The CRA legislative history discussion of this exception is      limited, but states that it was modeled on APA, which      excludes ``rules of agency organization, procedure, or      practice'' from the requirement that a notice of proposed      rulemaking be published in the Federal Courts have      applied the APA exception by distinguishing between      procedural and substantive rules. A rule is substantive when      it ``encodes a substantive value judgment or puts a stamp of      approval or disapproval on a given type of behavior.'' In      these cases, courts have focused on whether the agency action      has substantive impacts on the regulated community.       For example, the Fifth Circuit in Phillips Petroleum v.      Johnson, held that the proper test of whether a rule is      procedural or substantive is whether a ``regulation of      general applicability has a substantial impact on the      regulated industry, or an important class of the members or      the products of that industry.'' Phillips Petroleum concerned      oil and gas royalties owed under leases for federal lands      administered by the Minerals Management Service (MMS). The      court held that an agency Procedure Paper changing the      criteria for valuing natural gas liquid products, used to      calculate royalties, was a substantive rule subject to APA      notice-and-comment rulemaking requirements. The agency argued      that the Procedure Paper was a rule of agency organization,      procedure, or practice. However, the court rejected this      argument, stating: ``Although the Procedure Paper would      appear to fall squarely within this exemption, for the change      effected by the Procedure Paper plainly relates to the      internal practices of MMA procedure, the mere fact that it      may guide MMS procedures does not mean that the Procedure      Paper is a 'procedural' rule for purpose of APA.''       The 2016 Tongass Amendment implements an agency policy to      transition from old-growth to new-growth timber harvesting.      In doing so, it encodes the agency's substantive value      judgement in favor of this transition and has a substantial      impact on the local timber industry. Even accepting USDA's      characterization of the Amendment as involving agency      procedure and practice relating to the Forest Service, under      the reasoning of Phillips Petroleum, the Amendment is not a      procedural rule since it has a substantial effect on the      regulated industry. Therefore, we conclude that it is not a      rule of agency procedure. This is consistent with our prior      decision on the Tongass National Forest Land and Resource      Management Plan issued in 1997, in which we concluded that      the Plan was not a rule of agency procedure due to its      substantial effects on non-agency parties.       Relying primarily on the Supreme Court's decision in Ohio      Forestry Ass'n v. Sierra Club,[[Page S6763]]     USDA specifically argues that the procedural rule exception      applies because the 2016 Tongass Amendment does not      substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency      parties. At issue in Ohio Forestry Ass'n was a Sierra Club      challenge to a Land Resource Management Plan for Ohio's Wayne      National Forest on the ground that the plan permitted too      much logging and clearcutting. The question decided was      whether the rights asserted by the Sierra Club in challenging      the plan were ripe for judicial review. The Court explained      that the purpose of the ripeness doctrine is:     ``to prevent the courts, through avoidance of premature      adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract      disagreements over administrative policies, and also to      protect the agencies from judicial interference until an      administrative decision has been formalized and its effects      felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties.''       The court held that the rights asserted by the Sierra Club      were not yet ripe for review, and that there would be later      stages in the forest management process when plaintiffs could      assert those rights to challenge the Forest Service's      decisions.       The issue we decide here, however, is not whether rights      asserted by a party to challenge the Amendment are ripe for      judicial review. The question here is whether the 2016      Tongass Amendment has a substantial impact on the regulated      community such that it is a substantive rather than a      procedural rule for purposes of We have concluded that      it has such an impact and thus is a substantive rule. The      Supreme Court's decision is inapposite for CRA purposes,      since it is Congress' exercise of the review procedures in      CRA that is in issue, not the ripeness of a party's right to      bring suit challenging administrative action.                               CONCLUSION       The 2016 Tongass Amendment is a rule for CRA purposes as it      meets the definition of the term ``rule'' under APA, and none      of the CRA exceptions apply.

735,topic-id,1814,"Madam President, I rise today to talk about the dire humanitarian situation in Puerto Rico and to challenge this country to end a century of discrimination against the Puerto Rican people.  While the fleeting media attention may have waned, the desperation of the people of Puerto Rico has not. The lackluster response from the Trump administration is an outrage. It has been more than a month since the hurricane, and 80 percent of the island's electricity is still out. Roads and bridges have collapsed. Homes have been destroyed. Of the 67 hospitals that are open, less than half of them are operating with electricity. Families are searching far and wide for clean drinking water, and some have been drinking water from wells at a Superfund site.  This kind of inhumane response would never ever be permitted in a U.But one doesn't even have to look at other States to evaluate this response; we can look abroad. Within 2 weeks of the earthquake in Haiti, there were 17,000 U.military personnel on the ground in that country. Two weeks after Hurricane Maria made landfall in the United States, the United States had deployed only 10,000 troops to respond to the disaster in both Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin  News broke yesterday that the state-owned electric company on the island, PREPA, refused to operationalize mutual aid agreements with electric companies on the U.mainland. That is a standard step in normal disaster response. Fault lies with PREPA, but how on Earth did FEMA and the Trump administration allow that to happen, leaving millions of Puerto Ricans in the dark and in danger for almost a month? It is beyond comprehension, and it speaks to the failure of the U.Government's response.  The truth is that Hurricane Maria exposed far more than just immediate physical damage; the hurricane also laid bare a very simple truth that is plain to every resident of the island and every Puerto Rican living in my The truth is this: The United States has been screwing Puerto Rico for over 100 years, and this is just the latest, most disgusting chapter.  There is an undercurrent in the discourse about Puerto Rico that is as pernicious as it is ahistorical. You will hear people, like President Trump, say that Puerto Ricans are wholly responsible for the financial mess they find themselves in and that Puerto Rico should just pull itself up by its bootstraps. The rewriting of history ignores the fact that the Federal Government and Congress have had our hands tightly wrapped around those very bootstraps since 1898.  The United States acquired Puerto Rico from Spain through the Treaty of Paris in 1898, when the United States defeated Spain in the Spanish American Puerto Ricans didn't ask to be part of the United States; we acquired the island. A century ago, Congress extended U.citizenship to Puerto In 1950, Congress recognized the island's limited authority over internal governance, and Puerto Rico became formally known as the Commonwealth of Puerto  Being a commonwealth or a territory is permanent second-class status. Without access to the same healthcare reimbursement, the same infrastructure funding, the same education dollars as other States, Puerto Rico starts every single race 50 feet behind the rest of These built-in disadvantages are designed to hold Puerto Rico back. They have been in place for 100 years to keep Puerto Rico from being a true economic competitor with the mainland.  Believe me, the Puerto Rican people have done everything they can to overcome this discriminatory treatment. There is an entrepreneurial, never-say-die spirit in Puerto I know this because no State has a greater percentage of residents with Puerto Rican roots than But despite the strength of the Puerto Rican people, they are stuck because Washington has tied their hands behind their backs by taking away the right to vote in Federal elections, virtually guaranteeing that Puerto Rico's economic disadvantage will never ever be remedied. It is a black hole from which Puerto Rico and the other four U.territories can never escape.  Puerto Ricans are U.citizens--despite the fact that recent polling suggests that half of Americans don't know this--but they can't vote for They have no voting representation in Think about it this way: Americans with a mainland address can vote if they move to Mongolia or Sierra Leone, but if they temporarily take up residence in a U.territory like Puerto Rico, they miraculously lose their right to vote.  There are real, practical consequences to this lack of representation. We are watching the most egregious example right now. Do you really think that if Puerto Rico had two U.Senators, 80 percent of the island would still be without power a month after the hurricane? By the way, Puerto Rico has more citizens than 21 States that have a total of 42 Senators in this body. Do you think a President would denigrate and insult Puerto Rico the way President Trump has if it had electoral votes?  The botched response to Maria is just the latest attack on the island, perpetuated by a Congress that can afford to ignore a big part of the United States that has no voice in Congress to object.  For over six decades, the U.Navy pummeled the island of Vieques, just off Puerto Rico's coast, with ordnance, using it as a bombing range for military exercises. Those weapons allegedly contained uranium, napalm, and Agent Today, people who live on Vieques are eight times more likely to have cardiovascular disease and seven times more likely to die of diabetes than others in Puerto Cancer rates on Vieques are much higher.  If you want to know why Puerto Rico has been in a decade-long recession, look no further than More than 50 years ago, the U.Government launched several initiatives to help spur economic growth on the island. It was a good thing. Ironically enough, the initiatives were collectively called Operation One of the tools that were used to spur economic growth was a tax break to allow U.manufacturing companies to avoid corporate income taxes on profits that were made in Puerto Manufacturers descended on the island in droves, and the entire economy in Puerto Rico became oriented around those companies. But what Congress gives, Congress can take away, especially if the entity you are taking from has no meaningful representation in In 1996, Congress phased out the tax breaks. Guess what. It sucked the island's tax base away, cratering Puerto Rico's economy for the next two decades.  It is worth noting that Puerto Rico is not blameless for the financial situation that it is in. There definitely has been a fair share of mismanagement on the island. Bad decisions have been made. Saying that Puerto Rico is only a victim of schemes of the mainland is not true. But the same can be said of fiscal mismanagement and bad decisions in other U.But a century of underinvestment in Puerto Rico has been a big part of the story as to how they arrived at this situation. And unlike all those other U.States, Puerto Rico has no way of rectifying the past misdeeds because its toolbox to reckon with its past is limited to what Congress sticks in the toolbox, and that toolbox doesn't provide access to the Bankruptcy  As a result, Congress passed PROMESA, which created this financial oversight board on the island. Puerto Rican bondholders on Wall Street, who bought the bonds for pennies on the dollar, are now challenging the current oversight board's legitimacy, with the hope of being paid before the island gets relief. These practices of the bondholders, who have been circling the island for years, are made more menacing because they are spending boatloads of money lobbying Just watch TV at night in Washington, DC, to see their ads. They know that the people of Puerto Rico have no voice here, have no votes here.[[Page S6793]]  Now it looks as though other predators are circling. News came out this week that a small, two-person company in Whitefish, MT, somehow, some way, got a no-bid $300 million contract to restore power in Puerto Rico from the island's power authority--the same power authority that refused the help of experienced electric companies that actually know how to turn the power back on. How does something like this happen? It turns out that the little town in Montana is the home of the new Secretary of the  Get ready, because this is just the start. President Trump and his billionaire cronies are going to use this disaster to enrich themselves. The Whitefish power contract given to a friend of the Secretary of Interior--with two people employed at that company--is just a scratch on the surface of what is to come.  Puerto Rico has been getting screwed for decades. None of this is new. None of this is unpredictable. If you think this is just one century-long string of rough luck, you are ignoring the last critical aspect of Puerto Rican history.  Back in 1901, when the U.Supreme Court decided that even though residents of the territories lived in the United States, they shouldn't be able to enjoy full constitutional protections, the Supreme Court was pretty explicit about why these citizens in places like Puerto Rico deserved this second-class treatment. Justice Henry Brown, who authored the separate but equal doctrine, held that Puerto Rico and the other territories didn't need to be afforded full rights under the Constitution because the islands were ``inhabited by alien races, differing from us in religion, customs, laws, methods of taxation, and modes of thought.'' That, my friends, is racism defined. And it is both past and present when it comes to the rationale for the historical and continued mistreatment of the people of Puerto  It is time for that mistreatment to change--not just by doing right by Puerto Rico at this moment, at their hour of need. Yes, it is time for President Trump to command that FEMA and the U.military and the powers that be in Puerto Rico turn the lights back on right now. Congress should give Puerto Rico every cent they need.  I am glad that we came together this week to approve the latest round of emergency aid, but it is long past time that we addressed the second-class treatment we have given the people of Puerto Rico for decades. Even that racist 1901 Supreme Court decision contemplated that the territories' unequal status could only be justified temporarily. It is time to untie the hands of the Puerto Rican people and ensure that they have full economic and political rights.  I hope my colleagues will join me in this conversation in the coming months. It is just as important as the one we are having on emergency response because if anything good can come from the disaster of Hurricane Maria, maybe it is that.  I yield the floor.

724,topic-id,1244,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to talk about what my bipartisan healthcare bill with Chairman Alexander means for the people we are all here to serve, what it means for patients and families in my home State of Washington and across the country who are worried about being able to afford the healthcare they need, and what it means for States and communities and hospitals that are administering and providing care.  Negotiations of this magnitude are always tough. There are some things you agree on, and sometimes there is common ground that emerges early, but there is no question that you also find areas of strong disagreement. You have to work your way to each answer step by step.  One issue that Chairman Alexander and I agreed on from the very start of our negotiations, where we worked our hardest, and what we had the most discussions on was the goal of putting patients and families first and that it would be families who would benefit as much as possible from our efforts to restore stability to our markets. That was the crux of our debate. It was our guiding star.  I am very proud to say that our bipartisan bill does just that. Here is what is at stake. Here is what we know. Patients and families across the country are looking ahead to next year. They are rightly worried about their healthcare--premiums, benefits, and coverage--and they are realizing that they are about to pay the price for the uncertainty and partisanship we have seen on healthcare over the last 9 months.  Like all of my colleagues, I have listened and I have talked with many of these families in my home State, at hospitals, schools, roundtables, and in meetings with patients, doctors, providers, and veterans. They have all made it very clear that enough is enough with playing politics with people's healthcare.  Here is how our bipartisan bill would protect those families and restore certainty to the markets. I will not go into all of the details, of course, but I do want to focus on some really important points.  First of all, this bill would restore the out-of-pocket cost reduction payments that President Trump has announced he will be ending for this year as well as for 2018 and 2019. This means that some serious sabotage--something that experts say would raise premiums by double digits for millions of families--would be off the table.  Second, this bill would make significant investments when it comes to healthcare outreach and enrollment to make sure that families know about their insurance options.  Third, this bill makes some changes to give our States more flexibility when it comes to developing plans and offering options while maintaining essential health benefits, like maternity care and protecting people with preexisting conditions or protecting the elderly--and all of this while making sure that costs go down for families and preventing insurers from doubledipping and padding their profits with both cost reduction payments and higher premiums.  Put simply, this bill is an important step in the right direction of preventing premium increases, stabilizing healthcare, and pushing back against President Trump's recent actions.  This bill reflects the input of patients, Governors, State commissioners, experts, and advocates, and it has strong support from a majority here in the So far, 24 Senators--12 Democrats and 12 Republicans--have cosponsored this bill. I know there are a lot of others who agree that we need to act and that we must do so in our working together under regular order, as with our bill, rather than doubling down on partisanship and dysfunction.  I am focused on moving our bill forward as quickly as possible, and I certainly hope that the majority leader will listen to the Members on both sides of the aisle who also want this bill to be brought up for a vote without delay.  Let me be clear. As this bill moves forward, I am certainly open to changes that expand access to quality care, put families ahead of insurers, and maintain those core patient protections that I have been clear all along have to be protected. I am certainly not interested in changing our bipartisan agreement to move healthcare in the wrong direction.  Chairman Alexander and I have a record of seeing tough legislation through to the end together, whether that is K-12 education, FDA user fees, mental health reform, or opioid use disorders, which is why I am confident that we can do the same with this stabilization bill.  We have negotiated a strong agreement that has the support of 60 Senators, and the support is growing. The President has also expressed his support for our effort, so I see no reason why we should not move this bill through the Senate, get it signed into law, and then continue the bipartisan discussion on healthcare in the country.  I will also take some time to talk about another pressing healthcare challenge, and that is the immediate need to extend Federal funding for the historically bipartisan, expired primary care cliff programs, like the Community Health Center Fund, the National Health Service Corps, and, of course, the Children's Health Insurance Program, or  It has now been almost 25 days since the Federal funding of these primary care cliff programs and CHIP were allowed to expire by the Republican majority, and in that time, I have heard from thousands of people in my State and nationwide who are urging Congress to act. Each day that passes is a day that we are failing to meet our commitment to these families and putting the health and well-being of nearly 9 million children, including more than 60,000 children in my home State of Washington and the 25 million patients who, at great harm and great risk, get care from the community health centers.  In Washington State, as in so many other States, notices to families about gaps in their children's healthcare are about to go out as soon as December 1, and in my State, we will run out of Federal funds for CHIP in  Let me be clear. Parents in my home State and across the country should not be up at night, worrying about their children's healthcare because Congress cannot get the job done. That is so unacceptable.  There is a bipartisan deal in the Senate right now that was negotiated between the chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee that would provide certainty for this vital program. I understand that extreme House Republicans have chosen, instead, to take an irresponsible path in their trying to ram through a partisan bill that will jeopardize the efforts in the Senate and in the House to come to an agreement as soon as possible.  To be clear, this delay has not been without serious consequences, but we can still act. It is up to Republican leaders now to reverse course, come to the table, and join with Democrats to get this done. It should not have to be said, but there should not be any place for partisanship or politics when it comes to protecting the children and families we represent. I hope that we get this done and get it done quickly, and I hope that all of our Members will move forward on this.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

279,topic-id,661,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.469, the newly renamed Congressional Article I Power Strengthening  This bill stitches together three unrelated bills, each one problematic in its own way.  Title III of the bill, the Article I Amicus and Intervention Act, would permit as a right the House to intervene as a party where an amicus in a lawsuit with the Department of Justice declines to defend the constitutionality of a law or regulation.  While this proposal may have some merit, it was introduced only last week. It was the subject of no hearing. It has had no markup. We simply do not know the full implications of the measure. If it is a worthy proposal, we should take the time to consider it in committee before moving forward.  Title II of the legislation, the Judgment Fund Transparency Act, would require additional reporting about the funds paid out of the Treasury Department's Judgment Fund by the United States Government to resolve legal claims against it. This legislation raises significant privacy concerns. It would require publishing sensitive, personally identifying information about individual claimants who are the victims of government misconduct, such as medical malpractice, racial discrimination, or sexual harassment.  Our laws should carefully balance the need for public disclosure of government spending with the need to protect the personal privacy of individual citizens. This bill upsets that balance.  By far, the most concerning aspect of this legislation is Title I, the Sunshine for Regulations and Regulatory Decrees and Settlements  This provision also poses as a transparency measure, but its real aim is to disrupt and delay the process for issuing rules that protect public health and safety.  Congress frequently sets a statutory deadline for an agency to complete a rulemaking, but the agency sometimes misses that deadline. Under current law, private parties can sue the agency to meet its statutory obligations. Since there is little dispute that the agency has failed to do its duty, these lawsuits often end up settling, with the agency agreeing to a new schedule in which to complete the required rulemaking. That is perfectly reasonable.  However, the Republican majority and the businesses that are the subject of such regulation believe these lawsuits have some nefarious purpose. They have concocted an imagined vast conspiracy by which private parties collude with the government to file a lawsuit, and the government happily either settles or enters into a consent decree, supposedly allowing it to impose obligations or rules beyond what it could otherwise do.  Unfortunately for supporters of this bill, there is no evidence of such a conspiracy and no evidence, in fact, of any problem. To solve this nonexistent problem, this bill adds numerous procedural requirements before a settlement or consent degree can be entered into.  The effect of these requirements would be to make any settlements or consent decrees more difficult and more time-consuming to enter into, with the predictable result that agencies will not even bother to enter into them at all.  Most troubling, the bill would create a special and more permissive rule for virtually any party to involve itself in the case as an intervener. These interveners would do their best to ruin, block, or delay any settlement, including during what should be private negotiations.  That, of course, is the true purpose of this bill. They seek to tie government agencies up in years of litigation so that they are unable to issue rules protecting public health and safety. The real conspiracy here is the Republican plot to destroy the regulatory state. With one hand, we defund the agencies; and with the other hand, we build all sorts of hurdles in the regulatory process so that the agencies have no ability to complete their work.  It is a shameful effort that may save big businesses some money and regulatory compliance, but it will cost our citizens their health, their safety, and possibly their lives.  Mr.Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this terrible legislation.  ",CREC-2017-10-25-pt1-PgH8194.txt,850,BANKRUPTCY JUDGESHIP ACT OF 2017--Continued,2017.0,25.0,October
924,topic-id,409,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.4010, the Congressional Subpoena Compliance and Enforcement Act of 2017. My support of this legislation is tied to my view of our committee's responsibility to conduct oversight of the executive branch.  Nearly a century ago in McGrain v. Daugherty, the United States Supreme Court framed that responsibility this way: ``A legislative body cannot legislate wisely or effectively in the absence of information respecting the conditions which the legislation is intended to affect or change; and where the legislative body does not itself possess the requisite information--which not infrequently is true--recourse must be had to others who possess it.''  In other words, it is our responsibility to ask for the information we require to do our jobs effectively, and the Constitution empowers us to enforce those requests if we are at first denied. We should be very clear on this point. Congress does not require a statute in order to enforce its subpoenas in Federal court.  We know this, of course, because in 2008, the House Judiciary Committee went to court to defend that authority. Ruling in favor of the committee, the court held that the Bush administration's claim of absolute immunity from our process ``is entirely unsupported by existing case law.''  In effect, both government officials and private individuals have a legal obligation to comply with the duly issued congressional subpoena whether or not the bill before us today is enacted into law, still this legislation is useful as a means to codify certain practices and to expedite enforcement of subpoenas in Federal court.  It also puts the House on equal footing with the Senate, which has had a statute in place since 1978, allowing that body to enforce at least some of its subpoenas in Federal court.  Mr.Speaker, I thank Chairman Goodlatte for working with us to make sure that we strike the right balance. This bill both protects our existing authority and mitigates many concerns about abusive subpoena power by a runaway committee. I also want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr.Issa) for his leadership on this issue.  We often disagree about the issues we should prioritize for oversight, but I suspect that we stand together on the importance of oversight, both to our committee and to the Congress as a whole.

926,topic-id,229,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to share one last thought before closing. In our markup of this bill, the gentleman from California (Mr.Swalwell) had this to say about a recent experience in the Intelligence Committee:  ``We had interviewed a witness just 2 weeks ago with respect to our Russia interference investigation. . . .  ``After the interview, he gave a public statement . . . and said that he had withheld information from the committee because he was not under subpoena.  ``And he also stated that he felt like he had certain privileges to assert that allowed him to withhold this information.  ``And so I saw right there . . . that even under a subpoena, individuals believe''--some individuals believe--``that without necessarily having a judicial or legal basis for privilege that they could just assert it.  ``And I believe that is because the public is starting to perceive that our subpoena power does not have the weight that it should.''  Wherever the Intelligence Committee's investigation lands, Mr.Speaker, we have a great deal of work to do. Given some of our current challenges, it is more important than ever for the House to conduct substantive oversight of the executive branch. This bill contributes to that effort, and I urge my colleagues to support it.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

1142,topic-id,465,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.732. This misguided legislation would restrict the government's flexibility to resolve lawsuits against corporate wrongdoers and would make it harder to provide a remedy to all those who are harmed by the company's malfeasance.  Under well-established law, when settling claims with some corporate defendants, the Department of Justice may seek to include among the terms a contribution by the defendant to a third-party organization. Because it is often difficult to identify each individual who was harmed by the company's actions, particularly those who suffered the secondary effects of such wrongdoing, these third-party payments are intended to address the generalized harms caused by corporate bad actors. But this bill would prohibit any payment to a party that is not for restitution or to remedy a harm that is ``directly and proximately'' caused by the defendant. Such restrictions will needlessly hamper the Department of Justice's ability to efficiently resolve claims and to provide relief to all those injured by a defendant's actions.  For example, in the wake of the financial crisis, the Department of Justice, under Attorney General Holder, sued several large banks whose egregious misconduct destabilized the housing market and threw millions of people out of their homes, with millions more placed on the brink of foreclosure, all while the banks reaped massive profits. The banks agreed to resolve these claims by paying record-setting fines to the government in recognition of the tremendous damage they had caused.  Some of these voluntary agreements also included payments to housing counseling agencies and legal aid organizations responsible for assisting homeowners devastated by the foreclosure crisis that those banks helped create. The Republican majority sneers at these nationally recognized community organizations, however, and dismisses them as nothing more than activist groups. Republicans are so concerned that funds were going to organizations that help level the playing field between corporations and individuals that they drafted this legislation to prohibit the government from entering into a settlement that provides for any third-party payments.  Homeowners and communities across the country are still struggling with the aftermath of the foreclosure crisis, and the third-party payments negotiated by the Obama administration have been vital in helping both the direct victims and all those who suffered the collateral consequences of the banks' misconduct.  Attorney General Sessions recently announced that his Justice Department will not include such terms in the settlements it negotiates. But supporters of this bill insist that we must tie the hands of future administrations as well, weakening their ability to efficiently resolve claims and preventing them from using this tool to seek relief for the victims of corporate misdeeds.  This unnecessary and irresponsible legislation is yet another attempt by the Republican majority to favor wealthy corporations over individuals, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it.

So what we are hearing today is, from the last two Republican speakers: This is a bad budget. Let's vote ``yes.''[[Page H8250]]  The gentleman from Ohio said a while ago, this is all about the middle class. The middle class does not pay an estate tax. The middle class, because of our efforts--and, I think, mine in particular--no longer pay the alternative minimum tax.

I am happy to sit down with the other side and acknowledge some parts of the Code that clearly don't work any longer for the American people.  This is being done by one party, exclusively. They have not negotiated with us. They have not given us the opening. They have not said to us: ``Where do you want to proceed on this?''  Instead, if you pass this budget today, they suggest you are going to see their plan on November 1, and you are going to vote for it sometime around November 6. That is not negotiation.  The Congress I signed up for actually negotiated these agreements, and if you couldn't love the final passage, at least you could like it because you had sufficient input.

800,topic-id,1562,"Mr.President, just as the Senator from California has outlined the needs of her State, having been hit by a natural disaster, so, too, natural disasters, not wildfires--although we have had plenty in Florida--but hurricanes have hit other  Yesterday, this Senator spoke at length about the effects on a particular industry, the citrus industry. I showed pictures of 75 percent to 90 percent of the fruit on the ground. This Senator made a unanimous consent request to include a bipartisan amendment to get money for agriculture, not just in Florida but Texas, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the wildfires in California into the package--specifically, about $3 billion for agriculture. The losses in Florida's agriculture are $2.5 billion, of which three-fourths of a billion is just losses to citrus growers.  That is all the bad news because the unanimous consent request was rejected. The good news is, although the[[Page S6723]]White House rejected it, they made a promise to put it in a continuing supplemental emergency appropriations in November for all these natural disasters and get that funding in there for agriculture. Some of us on both sides of this aisle, in order to make sure that promise is kept, have put a hold on the nominee for Deputy Budget I will take the White House at its word, and this ought to all be worked out in That was the subject of my address to the Senate yesterday, along with my colleague Senator Rubio from Florida, as we talked about the losses particularly to agriculture.  Today I want to talk about how a month after the hurricane in Puerto Rico and 2 months after the hurricane in Florida, the aftermath is not going so swimmingly because people are not getting the assistance they need. Mind you, this is 2 months after the hurricanes. People lost all the food in their freezer because they didn't have any power. They are supposed to get assistance in order to be able to buy food. If you are living paycheck to paycheck and you don't have a paycheck, you don't have any money to buy food. Therefore, you should get financial assistance from FEMA and the Yet you ought to see the lines in Miami, in Orlando, in Tampa, and in Belle Glade, and then they are cutting off the lines. The people who are getting cut out are going without food. So we have a long way to go.  The USDA's Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, called D-SNAP, is supposed to help all of our people recover from losses incurred by Irma by making short-term assistance available. It is especially important for families who are low income, who don't have income, or they are not getting a paycheck. Now they are saddled with unexpected repairs like a storm-damaged roof. They spent money evacuating or they lost wages during the storm, or they lost power and lost all the food in their freezer. Some people buy food in bulk because they can get it cheaper and store it in the freezer. Then, bam. It is all gone because there is no power.  There were 50,000 people waiting at a center in South Florida, and many were turned away after waiting in the heat for hours and hours. The next day it was the same story in another city I didn't mention, Delray The people are getting desperate.  I thank FEMA for everything it has done. I thank the Congress for doing the first supplemental in September that was intended originally for Harvey in Texas but along came Irma in I thank the Congress for the additional supplemental we just passed last night, but the administration of all these programs for assistance to people is not going so well.  Let's take another example. You get on the phone and you call You are supposed to get a FEMA representative, and you have to wait. If that is because FEMA needs more people on a short-term basis to handle the amount of calls, well, FEMA, let's get it going.  What happens if you are calling because you need to have a FEMA representative come to your house to inspect your house so you can then get the necessary individual assistance to help you? You are waiting for assistance as to when a housing inspector can come and visit the home. Once you get through on the telephone, the last time we checked, the expected wait time to get a housing inspector is 45 days. That is too long for families to wait for an inspector to come because these Floridians are stuck living in damaged homes. Their homes have gotten wet, and, therefore, the mold and the mildew has built up, and they don't have any place else to go. They don't have any income to go down to one of the air-conditioned hotels, and they are still waiting for the FEMA inspector to come and inspect their home so they can get qualified to get the assistance that, in fact, they are due under the law. Our people can't access certain forms of FEMA assistance until the inspection is complete. I am told that FEMA has indeed increased the number of housing inspectors on the ground, but this process has to be expedited.  This isn't the only delay that is causing a very serious threat to health and to safety in FEMA has been very slow to bring in manufactured homes, mobile homes. Why? Because a lot of people's homes and/or mobile homes were so damaged, they can't go back and live there, so they get temporary assistance. They go into, hopefully, some air-conditioned place, such as an existing apartment complex or, per chance, a hotel. But what if you are in the Florida Keys? What if you are in the Keys, where there are not enough hotels and motels? In fact, there are not a lot of apartments.  By the way, the service industry is necessary to revive the tourism industry in the Keys, as an example, because that is the lifeblood of the economy, and the service industry has no place in which to live because their trailers are history.  I wish I had a picture here to show you of a mobile home park just north of Big Pine Key that I went to. There was not one mobile home that was upright. They were either all on their side, or they were upside down. It is not unusual because these are the The hurricane came right off the water, a category 4. But FEMA isn't getting those mobile homes, those manufactured homes, in as temporary assistance.  Understand, the example I gave is of the Florida There is one way in and one way out. But you have to compensate for that. In the meantime, people are suffering, and people are hurting.  The redtape should not stop anyone in this country from having a safe place to live. I urge FEMA to expedite the transporting of these units all over Florida, to Florida communities, and filling them up so that Floridians have a place to live that is safe and clean.  I say to my friend from New Jersey, if what is going on in Florida isn't bad enough, what about Puerto Rico? Right now, more than a month after the hurricane, 80 percent of the island still doesn't have power. I didn't go into the urbanized parts of San Juan, although I was there and did look around; I flew into the mountains, into the little town of For 2\1/2\ weeks, they were cut off. They didn't have a road to get up there for 2\1/2\ weeks.  I say to my friend from Washington, in Puerto Rico, would you believe that over a month after the hurricane, 30 percent still do not have potable water? In Utuado, in the mountains, I saw them going up to a pipe to get water that was flowing down through the mountains. This wasn't necessarily potable water, but it was the only thing they had. They were lining up with their plastic jars and plastic buckets.  Hospitals in Puerto Rico are rationing services. They are forgoing optional operations. They are making difficult decisions on prioritizing patients because of limited medication, and limited facilities, fuel, communications, and power. Dialysis centers are desperate to get clean enough water so that they can process the dialysis for kidney patients.  Clearly, more needs to be done to help the people of Puerto Rico in addition to the people in Florida and all the other  I urge my colleagues to remember the plight of Americans trying to put their lives together after a major disaster.

982,topic-id,1027,"Madam President, in my explanation, I will go into it in detail.  It is my hope that the White House promise that this will be taken up in November, which is the next tranche of the hurricane money, the disaster assistance. It has been well past a month since Hurricane Irma hit Puerto Rico and 2 months since it hit Florida, and Floridians all across our State are working as hard as ever to recover.  One group of individuals who were hit especially hard by this storm is Florida's citrus growers. I will refer again to this photograph. You can see the citrus grove. You can see the branches on the citrus trees. Some of the trees have blown over, but in the meantime, you can see all of the fruit that is on the ground.  Toward southwest Florida, at least 75 percent of the crops are on the ground. In more central Florida, it is upward of 50 and 60 percent. Of all the times, this was going to be a bumper crop. Lord knows, with the greening disease--its nickname is ``greening,'' but it is a bacteria--it will kill the tree in 5 years, and it has been declining the citrus production over the course of the last 10 years. We had suffered enough through all of that, and then here had come this hurricane. When it looked as if there was going to be a good crop to turn around the lessened production that had occurred over each of the last 10 years, this is what happened.  If that were not enough--all of the fruit on the ground--take a look at this. This is what has happened to citrus groves. Whole trees have been blown over. Whether you are talking about a grove that is totally demolished or a grove that has lost almost all of its crop, that is why the Florida citrus growers are in such a very difficult economic situation. Some of Florida's farmers lost nearly everything when Irma tore through the In fact, the statewide agricultural industry has lost more than $2.5 billion. Included in that is $760 million that Florida's citrus industry alone, just by itself, has lost, as you see in these photographs.  Earlier this month, the U.Department of Agriculture released its first crop estimates for the 2017-2018 citrus season. They estimated that Florida's citrus growers would harvest 54 million boxes of oranges this year, but that number doesn't yet fully account for all the damage caused by Hurricane  According to the folks on the ground, they believe the actual estimate is going to be only 31 million boxes this season. Now compare 31 million boxes to a decade ago when Florida harvested over 203 million boxes. Ten years before that, Florida growers harvested 244 million boxes. Now they are estimating, after the storm, a yield of only 31 million boxes.  So the Florida citrus growers are really taking a hit. They have to have disaster assistance. The citrus industry is a vital part of Florida's economy, and that is why Senator Rubio is here with us. We have been pushing so hard to get our citrus growers some help.  Just a couple of days after the storm, Senator Rubio and I met with a group of growers in a citrus grove in Polk County in Central Florida, where the loss is about 50 or 60 percent, unlike South Florida, where the loss is 75 to 90 percent.  Unfortunately, the White House has been saying: No, we can't do it in this disaster assistance bill. As we have been working on a bipartisan amendment that would provide the growers with the help they need, the same amendment that the majority leader had to object to, President Trump has reportedly been making calls urging others in the Chamber to move forward with the overall package as is and to nix the money we need to help Florida's farmers.  Florida's citrus industry may have been one of the industry's hardest hit by the storm, but it certainly wasn't the only industry that was affected in Florida's fruit and vegetable farms lost more than $180 million when their fields were flooded and their bushes were ripped straight out of the ground. Row crops, such as peanuts, cotton, sweet corn, potatoes, and sugarcane together experienced nearly $450 million in losses from the hurricane-force winds and heavy rains.  Senator Rubio went to Hastings to see the potato farms. He saw how they had been ripped to shreds. Florida's nurseries lost nearly $625 million when their greenhouses were damaged by the winds. Florida's timber industry lost $261 million. Florida's cattlemen, whose ranches, barns, fences, and equipment were severely damaged, lost a total of $237 million in losses. Dairy farmers had to dump more than $2 million worth of milk because they couldn't store it properly after they lost power.  Farmers are the lifeblood of this country and an important part of Florida's economy. Right now, they desperately need our help. In urging the Senate to move forward with this disaster package as it is, not amended, President Trump has told some of our colleagues that he would support adding this additional agriculture money in a later supplemental next month. To my colleagues who have farmers and ranchers in their own States, you know as well as we do that these families and businesses can't wait any longer. They need our help, and they need it now. I ask you to consider how you would react if those farmers and ranchers suffered $2.5 billion in losses from a single natural disaster, as our agriculture industry in Florida has.  So, to accommodate the majority leader, I already made the unanimous consent request, which the majority leader objected to. I want to further state that to fulfill the White House promise of including the disaster aid farmers desperately need, I have placed a hold on the President's nominee for Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Getting the additional money next month could be the difference between whether Florida's farmers can replant their crops next year or not.

353,topic-id,6915,"Mr.President, we currently have a $20 trillion debt.  Now, we might ask ourselves, whose fault is it, Republicans or Democrats? The easy answer is both. Both parties are equally responsible, equally culpable, and equally guilty of ignoring the debt, ignoring the spending problem, and really I think allowing our country to rot from the inside out.  This year, the deficit will be $700 billion, for just 1 year for our country, $700 billion. We borrow about $1 million a minute. Under George Bush, the debt went from $5 trillion to $10 trillion. Under President Obama, it went from $10 trillion to $20 trillion. It is doubling under Republicans and  Right now, we are in the midst of another spending frenzy. People will say: Well, we are spending the money for something good. We are going to help those in Puerto Rico, in Texas, and in My point is, if we are going to spend money to help someone in need, maybe we should take it from another area of spending that is less in need. I think that just simply borrowing it--even for something you can argue is compassionate--is really foolhardy and may make us weaker as a nation.  Admiral Mullen put it this way. He said: The 1 threat to our national security is our debt. In fact, most people who follow world politics--while we do have problems around the world--don't really see us being invaded anytime soon by an army or an armada, but people do see the burden of debt.  So what we have before us is a bill, $36 billion, much of it going to Puerto Rico, Texas, and My request is very simple: We should pay for it.  About 1 month ago, we had $15 billion for the same purposes. We are set, in all likelihood, to have over $100 billion spent on these hurricanes. I simply ask that we take it from some spending item that seems to be less pressing. We could go through a list of hundreds and hundreds of items.  One thing I think we could start with is why don't we quit sending money to countries that burn our flag? If you are a country saying: ``Death to America,'' burning the American flag, maybe we shouldn't give you any money. We give money to Pakistan, we trade and sell arms with most of the Middle East, which does not like us, and we do this with borrowed money. We don't even have the money we are sending, but we can make the burden a little less if we say: Let's not give any money to countries that hate us, to any country burning our flag.  In Pakistan, there is a Christian woman by the name of Asia She has been on death row for 5 years for being a She went to the well to draw water, and the women of the village began chanting, ``Death to the Christian.'' As she was being beaten and pummeled on the ground and thought she was going to die, the police finally showed up. She thought they were there to rescue her. They were there to imprison her. They took her off to prison. That was 5 years ago. It is not easy being Christian in the Middle  In Pakistan, there was a doctor who helped us get bin His name is He also has been in jail now for about 5, 6 years. He helped get us information that helped us to target bin Laden and finally get this great enemy of our country. The Pakistanis put him in jail for helping us.[[Page S6731]]  The Pakistanis help us one day and stab us in the back the next day. When the Taliban was defeated under President Obama, when he put 100,000 troops in there, they scurried off into Pakistan, they had a sanctuary, and then they came back. I think we ought to think twice about sending money to countries that burn our flag, sending money to countries that persecute Christians, sending money to countries that, frankly, don't even like us.  We spend about $30 billion helping other countries. If you were going to help your neighbor, if your neighbor was without food, would you first feed your children, and if you have a little money left over, help the children next door? That is what most people would do. If you are going to give money to your church or synagogue, would you go to the bank and borrow the money to give to somebody? Would that be compassionate or foolhardy? Is it compassionate to borrow money to give it to someone else?  People here will say they have great compassion, and they want to help the people of Puerto Rico and the people of Texas and the people of Florida, but notice they have great compassion with someone else's money. Ask them if they are giving any money to Puerto Ask them if they are giving money to Ask them what they are doing to help their fellow man. You will find often it is easy to be compassionate with somebody else's money, but it is not only that. It is not only compassion with someone else's money, it is compassion with money that doesn't even exist, money that is borrowed. Of the $20 trillion we owe, China holds $1 trillion of that.  All this might be said, and you might say: We just have to help people. You are worrying too much. Do you have to talk about details? Really, all the money is being well spent. If you look back at money that has been spent before on disasters, guess what--people replace everything, including things that weren't broken.  I remember, in Katrina, a family who was holed up in a beachside resort for weeks with taxpayer money. They could have put them up across the street for about $60 or $50 a night. They were staying in a $400-a-night beachside resort with government money, with FEMA money.  I think we have to look at how well government spends money. Do you want an example of how well government spends money? Last year, we had some great science. There was a lot of great taxpayer-funded science going on. They wanted to study whether Neil Armstrong, when he set foot on the Moon, said: ``One small step for mankind'' or whether he said: ``One small step for a man.'' So it was either ``One small step for man'' or ``One small step for a man.'' They wanted to know if the article ``a'' was in there. So they took money that was actually intended for a good purpose--to study autism--and they studied Neil Armstrong's statement when he landed on the Moon, $700,000.  In the NIH last year, they spent $2 million studying whether, if someone in front of you in the buffet line sneezes on the food, are you more or less likely to eat the food that has been sneezed on? I think we could have polled the audience on that one.  They spent $300,000 studying whether Japanese quail are more sexually promiscuous on cocaine. I think we could probably just assume yes.  This kind of stuff goes on year after year. You think: Oh, those are aberrations. That is new.  William Proxmire was a Senator--a conservative Democrat back in the day--and he used to do something called the Golden Fleece He would put out these awards. They sound exactly the same as the stuff we are finding now.  We spent money studying the gambling habits of We have studied how to prepare the Philippines for climate change. You name it, we are studying it around the world, with money we don't have.  If you want to make the argument: We are running a surplus, we are a great country, we are going to help all the other countries of the world--I would actually listen to you if we were running a surplus, but we are not. We are running a $700 billion deficit. We borrow $1 million a minute.  We have a lot of rich people here. We ought to ask these rich Senators: What have you given to Puerto Rico? What are you giving to Texas? Instead, they are giving your money. They are really not even giving your money. They are giving money they borrowed.  So what am I asking? Not that we not do this. What I am asking is: Why don't we take it from something we shouldn't be doing or why don't we try to conserve? So if you decided you want to help the people next door, you might say: I am not going to the movie theater. I am not going to go to the Broadway play. I am not going to the NFL game. I am going to save money by cutting back on my expenses so I can help the people next door who are struggling, the father and mother out of work, and they need my help--but you wouldn't go to the bank and ask for a loan to help people. That is not the way it works, unless you are a government. Then common sense goes out the window, and you just spend money right and left because you are compassionate, you have a big heart, because you have the ability of the Federal Reserve just to print out more money.  There are ultimately ramifications to profligate spending. We are approaching that day. Some say you get there when your debt is at 100 percent of your We have now surpassed that. We have about a $17 trillion, $18 trillion economy, and we have a $20 trillion debt. Is it getting any better? Have we planned on fixing it at all? No, there is no fixing. Is one party better than the other? No, they are equally bad. They are terrible. One side is at least honest. They don't care about the debt. The other side is just hypocrites because they say: We are going to win the election by saying we are conservative, we care about the debt, but they don't. The debt gets worse under both parties. Voters need to scratch their head and say: Maybe they are both equally bad with regard to the debt.  Most of the debt is driven by this. It is driven by mandatory spending. What is mandatory spending? These are the entitlements, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, Social This is driving the debt. It is on autopilot. So when we talk about a budget, nobody is talking about doing anything about the spending on autopilot. Why? It is risky to talk about reforming entitlements because everybody is getting one. If we don't, though, we are consigned to more and more debt, and ultimately I think we are consigned to resign to a time in which the currency may well be destroyed and the country could be eaten from the inside out through this massive debt.  Last week, we voted on a budget. From appearances, you would say: Well, the Republicans put forth a conservative budget. It had $6 trillion worth of entitlement savings. In the first year, it had $96 billion worth of entitlement savings.  But ask one Republican, ask any Republican in Congress ``Where is your $96 billion worth of entitlement spending coming from?'' and most of them wouldn't even know it was in the budget. It is in the budget to make it look good and look as if it balances over 10 years. Yet there is no plan to do anything to entitlement spending. There is no plan to do any entitlement savings. There is no bill in committee and no bill to come forward.  I introduced an amendment to the budget. I said: Well, if you are going to cut or save or somehow transform the entitlements into responsible spending, where we spend what comes in and we don't borrow, why don't we put rules or reconciliation instructions into the budget to tell people that, yes, we are honest, we are sincere, and we are actually going to cut spending? Do you know how many people voted for it? There are 52 Republicans; we had 5. They say they are for spending cuts, but they are not really because nobody will vote to give the instructions to actually do the spending cuts.  The budget we typically vote on is called discretionary spending. This is the military and nonmilitary. If you were to eliminate all of that, you still wouldn't balance the budget. That is one-third of the budget. You can't even balance the budget by eliminating one-third of it. You have to tackle the entitlements. Yet nobody has the wherewithal, the guts, or the intestinal fortitude to actually do it.  We did have a big fix once upon a time on Social In 1983, President Reagan and Tip O'Neill--Republican and Democrat--came together to[[Page S6732]]say that we were out of money, and we gradually raised the age of Social Security to 67. Is anybody happy to do that? Is anybody jumping up and down, saying: Oh, I want to wait longer to get Social No, nobody is, but if we don't do it, there will be no Social Security because we are destroying the system.  Social Security pays out more than it brings in. Once upon a time, it was the other way around. We used to have about 16 workers for every retiree. Now we have a little bit less than three workers for every retiree. Families got smaller.  People ask me: Why are Social Security and Medicare running a deficit? Whose fault is it--Republicans or Democrats? Really, it is a little bit of both, but it is also the fault of your grandparents for having too many kids. A whole bunch of baby boomers were born, and they are all retiring, but the baby boomers had fewer kids, and the baby boomers' kids had even fewer kids, so it is a demographic shift.  If we put our heads in the sand and do nothing, the debt will continue to accumulate. We are accumulating debt by the billions of dollars every year. This year, it is $700 billion, and it is estimated that it will be close to or may exceed $1 trillion next year. During President Obama's tenure, we had deficits of over $1 trillion in several years. Over an 8-year period, we actually increased the debt over $1 trillion a year. There was about a $10 trillion increase in the debt in the 8 years of President  If we look at whose fault it is, Republicans or Democrats, it is both. But I will tell you the way it works around here. People say that it is noble, that you are enlightened if you compromise. So here is the compromise you get. You heard that four of our brave young men died in Niger the other day. Most of the people here didn't even know we were there, to the tune of 1,000 soldiers. Once they heard about it--the hawks--they said: Oh, we need more. They didn't know 1,000 were there, but they said that we need more there, that we need more people in  No one has bothered to have a debate over what the war in Niger is about, whether we should be there, and whether we should send our brave, young men and women there. Our Founding Fathers said that was the first principle--the first principle of going to war. The initiation of war, the declaration of war, is to be done by They specifically took that power away from the It is not just about funding, although that is another way we control war, but the primary way we control whether we enter into war is the declaration of war. It is under article I, section 8. This is where the congressional powers are laid out. People say: Oh, that is an anachronism; we don't obey that anymore. They certainly don't. But it was never removed from the Constitution; they just quit and began ignoring this.  How important was this to our Founding Fathers? Madison wrote this. Madison said that the executive is the branch of government most prone to war; therefore, the Constitution, with studied care, granted the power of war to the legislature. It wasn't just Madison who said this; it was Jefferson, Washington, The whole panoply of Founding Fathers said that war was to be initiated by  We have had no vote, no debate, and most of the Members didn't know we were in this part of Yet here we are. But the knee-jerk reaction by those on the right typically, but some on the left, is that we need more, that we wouldn't have lost those 4 lives had we had 10,000 troops in a country in which none of us knew we were going to be at war. None of us fully debated who the parties are to the war. Yet we are going to be at war there now. So the knee-jerk reaction is that we are to expand our role in this war in  I had my staff ask a question: How many troops do we have in Africa? Nobody here knows. We looked it up, and we found out it is 6,000. We have 6,000 troops in We knew we were at war in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, and Libya, but we didn't really know we had 6,000 troops in That would include Six thousand troops are in  The point is, when you get back to the debate we are talking about--the budget--there are a great deal of expenditures to have troops in a hundred-some-odd countries. So we literally have troops in over 100 countries. We currently have 6,000 troops in It is expensive. How do you convince the other side of the aisle to pay for it?  Typically, the Republican side of the aisle says: ``Katy, bar the door.'' We will spend whatever it takes, and then some, on the military.  The Democrats say: Well, what about welfare? We need more welfare.  Then they tell you that to compromise is noble, to be enlightened, to be pragmatic, that to compromise is what we should shoot for, that we should work with the other side. So that is what happens.  There has been a bipartisan consensus for maybe 50, 60, 70 years now, and that is to fund everything. If the right wants warfare, the left says we must get more welfare. If the left wants welfare, the right says we have to have more money for warfare. So it is guns and butter. It began in an aggressive way during the Vietnam war, but it has proceeded apace. We continue to spend money as if there is no tomorrow, but both parties are guilty. It is the right and the left. It is compromise that is killing this country. It is the compromise to spend money on everything, for everyone, whether you are from the right or the left.  But there could be another form of compromise. We could say that we wish to compromise in the reverse direction. We wish to say that, look, maybe for the Republicans, national defense is more important than welfare, and maybe for the Democrats, welfare is more important than warfare, but maybe the compromise could be, you know what, we don't have enough money for either one. Maybe the compromise could be that we will spend a little bit less on each.  You know what. We did that recently. When I first came up here, I was elected in this tea party tidal wave that was concerned about debt. Something called a sequester was passed. Guess who hated it. All the big-spending Republicans and all the big-spending They couldn't pass out their goodies and favors enough because there was some restraint.  You say: Well, I heard the sequester was terrible. I saw people at school and I saw people in my town saying that the sequester wasn't giving them enough money.  The sequester was actually a slowdown in the rate of growth of spending. This is why you have to understand newspeak. We talk about newspeak and how people change the meaning of words to make them meaningless or even to make them mean the opposite. You hear all the time--when we were having the debate on repealing ObamaCare, we were talking about capping the rate of growth of You heard all the squawking on the left saying we were going to cut We were going to cut the rate of growth of  So we had a sequester, and it was evenly divided between military and nonmilitary, between Republican interests and Democratic interests. It did not cut; it slowed down the rate of growth of spending over 10 years. It was actually working to a certain degree. We got it because people who were concerned about the debt fought and fought and said: We need to be concerned about the debt. We are hollowing out the country from the inside out.  Who destroyed the sequester? Really, the voices were louder on the Republican side than the Democratic side, but both parties were complicit. The sequester has essentially been gutted and destroyed, and the spending caps have become somewhat meaningless.  We have before us today $36 billion. It will exceed the spending caps. We have a sequester in place, but there are all these exemptions, so it is exempt. Anytime you say it is an emergency, it is an exemption. Within the $36 billion, though, there is $16 billion because we run a terrible government-run flood program that is $16 billion in the hole. So we are going to bail it out by letting it wipe out all of its debt. That sounds like long-term mismanagement in a badly run program rather than an emergency. Yet it is going to be stuck in an emergency bill so it can exceed the caps.  What am I asking for today? I am asking that we obey our own rules. We set these rules. We set these spending caps. We set the sequester. Let's obey[[Page S6733]]them. The other side will say: Oh, we are obeying the rules; we are just not counting this money. That is the problem. We have this dishonest accounting where people say: Oh yeah, we are obeying the rules. But we are not.  There are a couple of ways you could pay for this. The first way, I tried a couple of weeks ago. We had a $15 billion bill, and I said: Why don't we pay for it with the foreign aid, the welfare we give to other countries? Why don't we say: You know what, it is time we looked at America first. It is time that we took care of our own. It is time that we spend money taking care of those in Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico, but let's spend money that we were going to send in the form of welfare to other countries. Maybe we should take care of our own.  Instead, though, the Senate voted otherwise. I forced the issue. They weren't too happy with the amendment. I only got the vote because I was persistent and I threatened to delay things, and I was able to get a vote. Do you know how many Senators voted for this? No No Democrats wanted to offset any spending, and 10 Republicans did. I think the vote was 87 to 10. Eighty-seven Senators voted to keep spending money without any offsets, to basically just borrow the money.  Now we are having the same debate again. I have an amendment to offset the $36 billion. In all likelihood, I am not going to get an amendment vote because they don't have time. It would take 15 minutes, and God forbid we spend 15 minutes talking about how we are being eaten alive by a $20 trillion debt. God forbid we talk about how a $20 trillion debt is an anchor around the neck of the country. God forbid. God forbid we offer an amendment and at least take 15 minutes to have an offset, to say we should pay for this money we are going to send to Puerto Rico, Texas, and Florida, pay for it by taking it from some other element in the budget.  Last time, I offered foreign welfare. This time, what I put on the table is something that is very similar to a bill that has been put forward and offered for several years called the Penny The Penny Plan is this. There is a great illustration of this--if you want to look at this on YouTube--of a guy with a bunch of pennies stacked and showing sort of in a visual way what it would be like to cut one penny out of every dollar. That is what we are talking about. A 1-percent cut across the board would pay for this $36 billion bill. It is actually a little bit less than 1 percent. One percent of a $4 trillion budget would be $40 billion. We need $36 billion, so it is less than 1 percent. Just cut the budget less than 1 percent.  Do you think there might be 1 percent waste in every department, including even departments of government you might like? Do you think any American families ever had to deal with a 1-percent cut? Government is so wasteful at every level that we could probably cut several percentage points of every division and department of government, and you wouldn't know it was gone. I mean, the waste is astounding. When we looked at where money is spent, we looked at some of the money that was being shipped overseas not too long ago, and one of the programs that we found was a televised cricket league for All right, self-esteem is really important, and you are going to pay for it. So we are going to pay for television so that the Afghans can feel better about themselves by watching cricket on  The first problem is that we don't have the money. We have to borrow it. The second problem is that they don't have televisions in Well, some do, but the 1 in 1,000 people who have a television, I guess, are going to feel better about the Americans paying so that they can watch cricket on It is one thing after another. We paid $1 million for a variety program to put little songs and skits on their televisions. Once again, most of them do not have a TV to watch.  In the war effort in Afghanistan, we spent trillions and trillions of dollars on the war effort. We have defeated the Taliban many times, and I am sure that we could defeat them again, but that just means that they will go across the border, hide in caves, and go back when we are tired.  We spent $45 million on a gas station in This is an interesting gas station. It serves up natural gas. You might say that is great because we are lessening the carbon footprint in Afghanistan, except that it is completely absurd. They do not have any cars that run on natural gas in  So they built a $45 million plant. The original estimate was that it was going to cost about $500,000. It was like 46 times the cost of overruns, and it ended up costing $45 million. It serves up natural gas, but nobody has a car that runs on natural gas.  We said whoops, and we immediately bought them 24 cars that run on natural gas so they could go to the $45 million gas station to get their natural gas. But that was not enough. We had natural gas cars for them, but they had no money with which to buy the natural gas. So we bought them all credit cards. We bought them natural-gas-burning cars, we gave them a natural-gas gas station, and we bought them credit cards to reduce the carbon footprint of those who are living in This is absurd.  When we look at the budget and when we look at accounting, a lot of the money that has been spent overseas in the Iraq war, the Afghanistan war, the Syria war, the Niger war, the Libya war, the Somalia war, and the Chad war is not really budgeted. A lot of this money is actually done as an off-budget thing. It is called the overseas contingency operations. It is really a way of cheating, a way of being dishonest in your accounting. It is a way of evading spending caps, but it has also gone a long way toward making it easier to keep spending money without restraint. We tried to put restraints on military and nonmilitary, and they were exceeded by this slush fund. They call it OCO funding, or overseas contingency operations. When we had the budget vote recently, I put forward an amendment and simply said that we should not spend above our caps. If we put these caps in place, this is what we should spend. I think that we got maybe 15 or 20 votes on that, but this is the problem.  Ultimately, we have to decide as a country this: Are we going to obey the Constitution? Are we going to go to war only when we declare war, when Congress does its job and declares war, or are we going to go to war anytime, anywhere? That is sort of what we do now. We go to war anytime, anywhere on the face of the planet, and it is not for free.  Not only is it expensive in dollars, but it is expensive in the lives of the young men and women who are sent to these wars. Yet no one has ever voted on them. We lost a soldier in Yemen 3 or 4 months ago. For his family, it was devastating, but America pays little attention because America is, basically, not fighting the war. A very small percentage of America--brave young men and women who are often from rural parts of our country--is fighting our wars, but the mass of America is not fighting. You could say that they are volunteers--that is great, and I think that is the best kind of army to have--but I hate it that we do not show the responsibility and care of actually doing our job and of taking the time to debate it.  Should we be at war in Yemen or not? Should we be at war in Niger? Should we be at war in Libya? Should we be at war in Chad? Should we be at war in Somalia, in Djibouti, in Pakistan, in Afghanistan? We have troops in probably 20 or 30 nations in which there is conflict going on, and we are actively involved in the midst of conflict in at least 6 or 7. It is very expensive in human lives and dollars.  We need to ask ourselves this: Will we do this forever?  The Sunnis have been fighting the Shia for about 1,000 years.  People say: Well, we are going after ISIS in  ISIS is basically a name for radical jihadist Islam, and it is all over the planet. Are we going to go everywhere and kill every one of them? Is there a possibility that, when we kill 1 that 10 more will pop up? Is the Whac-A-Mole strategy for killing every terrorist on the planet or every radical on the planet the way that we are going to win?  We went into Yemen on a manned raid in January or February of this year, and we lost one brave Navy They say that we got information, but they will not exactly tell me what information they got. They claim[[Page S6734]]that it was this great information that is going to make the war on terror so much easier. I have my doubts. In the raid, though, which was a manned raid in the middle of Yemen, women and children died. I do not blame our soldiers. I have members of my family who are Active They do what they are told. They take orders. It is tough being put in a situation like that. You are dropped in the middle of nowhere in a village. Maybe the women and children are shooting at you as well. You have to defend yourself and complete your mission.  Yet I wonder whether or not the policymakers should be more involved with making the decision as to whether we should be in Yemen and whether or not the people who live in the surrounding area to that village will, for 100 years or more, recite through oral tradition the day that the Americans came, and whether or not we will have actually killed more terrorists than will have been created by the oral tradition of when the Americans came.  We are also aiding and abetting Saudi Arabia in this horrific war in There are 17 million people who live on the edge of starvation in Yemen, and the war is exacerbating that. Yemen is a very poor country to begin with. They import about 80 percent of their food. Currently, the Saudis have a blockade. So no food is getting in. They say that it is to prevent arms, and I am sure it is, but one of the consequences is no food. There are a half million people with cholera right now. It is sort of a bad form of dysentery, and in poor countries, you die from cholera. There are a half million people with cholera. It goes along with no food and no clean water.  The Saudis are blockading Yemen, and the Saudis are bombing We are selling the Saudis the weapons. We are refueling the planes and helping the Saudis pick the targets. One of the Saudi targets about 1 year ago was a funeral procession. This was a funeral procession of a Houthi leader or rebel. There were 500 people--civilians--who were wounded in that procession, and there were 150 who were killed by a Saudi bomb on civilians.  Do you think they are going to soon forget that? Do you think that by killing 150 people in a funeral procession and wounding 500, you killed more terrorists that day than you created?  I would say that that day will live on in oral history for 1,000 years. The day the Saudis came with American bombs and bombed an unarmed funeral procession will live on for 1,000 years, and hundreds--if not thousands--of people will be motivated to become suicide bombers because of the day that the Saudis bombed a funeral procession.  It is incredibly expensive in lives--their lives, our lives. When you look at the cause of famine around the globe and when you look at it extensively and study the causes of famine, it is war probably 6 or 7 times out of 10. War is a terrible thing, and we must acknowledge that and try to think of ways that we can make war the last resort instead of the first resort.  I mean, for goodness sake, the people on television this Sunday did not know how many troops were in Yet their immediate response was that we should have had more--that we need more troops over there in Africa--in a place that most Americans have not heard of and have no idea who is fighting whom or whether or not it is an achievable goal. They say that 1,000 was not enough, that if we had had 10,000 in air support and all of this, we would have prevented these deaths. That is one lesson you could learn. The other lesson you could learn is that maybe we should not have been there at all.  You see, people have to stand up for themselves. There is this idea of sort of self-rule and independence, but if people are coddled and not sort of forced into the position of defending themselves, they will not.  We have been in Afghanistan for 16 years. In the 16 years we have been there, what have we found? We have found that about 60,000 to 80,000 Afghans have come over here. We have to help these translators. Well, they speak English, and they are pro-So they need to stay in Afghanistan and create a country. The best people left.  It is the same in We won the war in Iraq, and all of the good people came over here. I have nothing personally against those who came other than that I am disappointed that there were not enough people who were heroic enough to stay in their country to help build a new country.  Who fights over there? Some of the Afghans fight. Some people join their army to shoot us. We have this green on green, where their soldiers are shooting our soldiers because they come in and intentionally are there to kill our soldiers. Yet the question is, How come, after 15, 16 years, the Afghans cannot fight to preserve their nation?  Now everybody says: Oh, if America comes home, the Taliban will take over. The Taliban is not quite It is also not quite the same international sort of jihadist. They did harbor bin Laden once upon a time. Most of those people are dead if not all of them.  If you look at how terrorism ended when the IRA ended in England and in Ireland, it ended up being a negotiation. So many say that they will never negotiate with the enemy. If you never negotiate with the Taliban--they are, unfortunately, pretty popular in Afghanistan, and they are going to be there forever--can we kill them all? It is just like the radicals throughout these Islamic countries. I think there are too many to kill. The question is, Do you create more than you kill?  If you put this in context and say that we have to be able to defend ourselves and that our country needs to be strong to defend itself, I could not agree more, but do you know what? We become weaker every day as we run up this debt. We are $20 trillion in debt--$700 billion this year. We borrow $1 million a minute. Realize that predicament, and then realize that the powers that be do not want to allow amendments to offset spending.  I am proposing, if we spend money on Puerto Rico and Texas and Florida, that we offset it by taking it from something that is less of a priority, from something else in the budget. If we were to cut 1 percent of the rest of the budget, we would have more than enough to pay for this. Would anybody notice 1 percent? One would have to push things around a little bit, but they would all survive.  We have looked at spending, and to show you how bad spending in the Federal Government is, it gets faster each month as you get toward the end of the year. When there is only 1 month left, these bureaucrats say: Oh, my goodness, we might not be able to spend the money fast enough. So spending in the last month of the year is, actually, five times faster than in any other month of the year. In fact, in the last month of the fiscal year, not only is it five times faster, but each progressive day it gets faster. The last month of the fiscal year is On September 1, they spend the money like this. On September 2, it is like this. On September 3, it like this. On September 4, it is like this. It goes up every day because they are trying to shovel the money out as fast as they can. If they do not spend it all, they are afraid they will not get it next year. The common parlance is ``use it or lose it.''  When you get all the way to the last day of the fiscal year, spending actually increases and goes with the rising and setting So it is 8 o'clock, earlier here than it is in As the Sun rises, we begin spending money in the We are shoveling it out as fast as we can. As the Sun progresses towards sunset, the spending shifts to the west coast. They are shoveling it out at 5 o'clock Pacific time in their trying to get rid of the money.  If you look at when most conferences are, when most government employees go to a conference in Las Vegas, it is in the last months of the year. They found that they have some money. What is a million bucks? You don't mind spending a million bucks, right? You want these government employees to have a good time. So there was a group--I think it was the General Services Administration--a couple of years ago, and you saw those pictures of the head of the GSA and his wife in a big Las Vegas hot tub, drinking champagne. I think that was a million-dollar event--it was either at that conference or at another one--in which they decided that it would be good and instructive for their employees if they actually had a Star Trek reenactment. So they hired Star Trek reenactors.[[Page S6735]]  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.

355,topic-id,602,"Mr.President, there have been many who have said, including Admiral Mullen, among others, that the greatest threat to our national security is our debt. We have a $20 trillion debt. This year, the debt for 1 year will be about $700 billion. We borrow $1 million a minute. What we have before us is a bill that will exceed our spending caps.  We will be told that this is an emergency and we must do it. Yet I think the true compassion comes from helping those but also making sure we don't add to our debt. I think the truly compassionate person helps their neighbor by giving part of their surplus to their neighbor but not going to the bank and borrowing money to give it to their neighbor.  We are $700 billion short in the budget, and we are simply going to print more money and send it to Puerto Rico, Texas, and What I ask is, if you are going to help people, why don't we set our priorities? Why don't we take money from other areas of the budget where it is not needed?  What I propose is that we cut 1 percent or a little bit less than that across the board. I think there is not a department of government that couldn't deal with 1 percent less, and we would take that money and we could spend it on the emergencies in Puerto Rico and  I think if we think somehow that it is compassionate to go ahead and just borrow more money and continue doing this, I think we are fooling ourselves. I think our country becomes weaker each day we add to the debt, and I think it is time we become honest with ourselves.  If you look at whose fault this is, there is enough blame to go around, frankly. The debt doubled under George Bush from $5 trillion to $10 trillion. The debt then doubled again from $10 trillion to $20 trillion under President  We are on course to add, some estimate, another $10 to $15 trillion over the next 8 years. This is a real problem for our country. So I think, as we look toward helping those who suffer from the hurricanes, we should look toward taking it away from less pressing priorities.  There is also $16 billion in here for the flood program that continues to pay people to build in flood zones. We do it year after year after year. We continue to rebuild in flood zones, and then the taxpayers are left on the hook. So we are wiping out $16 billion in debt for the flood program, and we are also then spending money we don't have.  At this point, what I would like to do is raise a point of order that has to do with us exceeding the spending caps. I think, if we are going to be honest with ourselves--we are in the midst of talking about a large tax cut, which I favor, but how can we be the party or the people who cut taxes at the same time we continue to borrow more? So what I am asking, through this budget point of order, is that we actually adhere to our rule to not exceed our spending caps and try to slow down the accumulation of debt.  With that, I raise the section 314(e) point of order, pursuant to the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, against sections 304, 306, 308, and 309 of the Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act of 2017.

Mr.Speaker, it is unfortunate that we find ourselves in this position where the lines are being so blurred that Gold Star families have come into this political discussion and are being dragged into this, unwillingly, over the past several days.

Mr.Speaker, as much as we would like to live in a colorblind society, in an America where people should be judged by the content of their character and not the color of their skin,[[Page H8070]]we aren't there yet. Race, unfortunately, still matters.  Juries devalue Black lives by punishing offenders more harshly when their victims are White than when their victims are Police are more likely to use force when interacting with Black people than when interacting with White people. Emergency room doctors are less likely to prescribe pain medication to Black patients than to  Results from psychological studies of racial bias have shown that nearly 90 percent of the White people in the United States who have taken the implicit-association test have an inherent racial preference for White people over Black people. Oh, yes, race matters in America, and we have got to talk about it.  It should not take a crisis for the United States to discuss race and the effects of stereotypes that are baked into our national cultural. We should not have to wait for a police officer to shoot an unarmed Black man before we discuss how negative stereotypes about Black people affect snap judgments.                              {time}  2000  It should not take mass murder in a Bible study to get us talking about how negative stereotypes of Black people in social media help White supremacists rationalize their racism.  Back in 1997, Professor Jody David Armour warned us that bad actors would try to make racism seem reasonable. Professor Armour wrote a book called ``Negrophobia.'' In it, he predicted that ``perhaps the gravest threat today to progress toward racial justice comes from the right-wing ideologues bent on convincing White people of good faith that negative stereotypes about Blacks are justified.''  Professor Armour told us to look out for people trying ``to prove that Blacks are inherently less intelligent and more violent than Whites.'' And he explained that these people would try to make racism seem rational by using discredited studies, unscientific experiments, and cooked statistics.  What have we seen on our social media over the past few years? We have seen that negrophobia is alive and well in the United States, and social media is its enabler.

387,topic-id,442,"Mr.Speaker, countries like Russia have used social media to fuel racial tensions in America's communities, and White supremacists have used social media to organize their hate.  We must not be afraid to ask: What role has Facebook played in fueling negrophobia in America?  Facebook was born in an age of diversity, but it was not born with a commitment to diversity. Only 3 in every 100 Facebook employees are African  The company has no Black executives, and it has no Black board members. The company's global director of diversity has said that hiring women and people of color is complicated. Its chief executive officer, Sheryl Sandberg, has promised that Facebook would hire a Black board member sometime soon.  Why has it taken so long? Why have minority voices been left out of the essential media development? Has Facebook's failure to value minority voices inside the company made Facebook an online megaphone for racist voices outside the company?  Facebook's algorithms have the power to affect the way Americans think about Black people, for better or worse. When Facebook accepts money from foreign actors who want to exploit racial tensions in the United States, Facebook perpetuates negrophobia.  By the same token, Facebook's algorithms could weaken negrophobia by enhancing positive messages that challenge people to reexamine and resist discriminatory responses, but that will require Facebook to fully commit to diversity right now, not sometime in the future.  Mr.Speaker, the Congressional Black Caucus met with Facebook a week ago in terms of these negative ads that were found out to be bought by Russian actors and spending $100,000 in doing so, and buying fake ``Black Lives Matter'' responses and ads and ``anti-Black Lives Matter'' ads to continue to fuel this division in our country.  If countries are able to see a weakness in our fabric in this Nation, then they will exploit it. We have to come together as Americans and understand that our issues are something that we have to deal with and look each other in the face and have an honest discussion about.  No one is perfect. No one is saying that one side is worse than the other, but we need to come together as a unit, as this great experiment called the United States was meant to be, that all men are created equal and endowed with certain inalienable rights--all Americans, not just some--and we continue to strive towards that goal, towards that utopia in this country.  This is the greatest country in the world, and we all know it here because we benefit from it, but we have a long way to go in terms of reaching the ultimate goal.

959,topic-id,540,"Mr.Speaker, I would first like to start by thanking my colleague, Congressman Garamendi from the great State of California, for hosting this afternoon's Special Order hour on the Republicans' massive tax giveaway to the rich.  Mr.Speaker, the American people want a tax plan that creates jobs, builds infrastructure, helps out the poorest among us, strengthens the middle class, and requires billionaires to pay their fair share.  Unfortunately, the Trump-Ryan-McConnell tax plan puts billionaires first and working class people last. The Republicans' tax plan will cut taxes for the wealthiest 1 percent, and it will raise taxes for more than a quarter of New Jersey's households. That is 1.2 million families in the State that I represent.  Across the country, the average tax increase for families under the Trump-Ryan-McConnell tax plan is $794 a year, another $794 a year on families struggling now to make ends meet. In New Jersey, that is money a family could use to pay for a month of childcare or 7 months of an electric bill.  The President spends a lot of time golfing at his resort in Bedminster, New He knows many working class people in New He employs some of them. His proposal to eliminate the Federal deduction for State and local taxes will hurt them dramatically.  Eliminating the Federal deduction for State and local taxes will take money out of people's pockets and out of New Jersey to fund tax cuts for the wealthy. That is just not going to work for the American people. Eliminating the Federal deduction for State and local taxes doesn't work for New Jersey, and it doesn't work for the American people.  Nearly 2 million people in New Jersey take the deduction. That is more than a third of the State's taxpayers. Most of them are from New Jersey's lower and middle-income families. Getting rid of that deduction means higher taxes for regular people.  So let's be clear. The Republican tax plan claims to be cutting taxes, but in reality, it raises taxes on millions of New Jersey's families and millions of other families nationwide.  The Federal deduction for State and local taxes is good for families. It keeps them from paying twice on the same income. If you pay State and local taxes on your hard-earned money, the Federal Government should respect that. After all, State and local taxes pay for our roads, our schools, our police, and all essential services we rely on each and every day.  New Jersey already pays more to the Federal Government in taxes than it receives in return. In fact, according to the Tax Policy Center, for every dollar New Jersey pays to the Federal Government in taxes, we get back only 77 cents. That is 77 cents on every dollar. The Trump-Ryan-McConnell tax plan is asking people from my State to send more to Washington so the wealthiest 1 percent can get a tax cut. That is just wrong.  When he unveiled his tax plan, President Trump claimed taxes are something he is very good at. Yeah, protecting billionaires is all this tax plan is good at.  Elected officials from both parties must continue to stand against the Trump-Ryan-McConnell proposal and prevent billionaires' first tax overhaul from crushing hardworking families.

If you are in the middle class, you will most likely be having your taxes increased. If you have a family member on Medicare or Medicaid, you will be, most likely, devastated by the impact of this.  This is a bill that the Republicans are putting forth that will add trillions of dollars to the national debt while they sing the praises of fiscal responsibility.

Build the human infrastructure of America by investing in education and healthcare and the rest.  Build our democracy by making sure that our democratic process has the resources necessary to be conducted in a way where every person's vote is counted as cast.  So all of this is connected to governance, and all of this is harmed by the assault on our budget that this tax proposal will present.  Middle class taxes will increase. Middle-income families will pay more. Tens of millions of middle class families will pay higher taxes.  One of the ways they will is because of the great idea the Republicans have to stop the deduction for State and local taxes. This is a big hit on middle class families in our country.  It steals trillions of dollars, borrows from the future and from our children's future to give tax cuts to the wealthiest. Eighty percent of the GOP tax cuts go to the wealthiest 1 percent at the expense of our children and working families and our country's future.  It would devastate Medicare and After adding trillions to the deficit, the GOP will use the deficits to justify destroying Medicare and And they are on it. They are already, in the bill, saying that they are going to means test It is in keeping with their theory that Medicare should wither on the vine.  Democrats are for A Better Deal, for real bipartisan tax reform. Any business will tell you that what they want[[Page H8083]]in tax reform is some level of certainty that this is going to last for a while. The only way to do that is to have bipartisanship at the table.  Go to the table. What will create growth? What will create good paying jobs? What will reduce the debt? This bill does exactly the worst.  Don't let them tell you that, even though they are adding trillions of dollars to the debt, that is going to be paid for by economic growth. It has never happened. Trickle-down economics, President Bush tried that. It was tried before. It has never done that. It has never paid for itself. In fact, it has only increased the national debt.  In that regard, Bruce Bartlett, who was an economist in the Reagan years as well as worked very closely with Jack Kemp in supply side economics as an advocate for supply side economics, said: We never said it would pay for itself. Anybody who tells you that these additions to the deficit will pay for themselves by growth, it is not true, it is nonsense, and, he said,  Forgive me, Mr.I am just quoting. I am just saying what he said.  So this is a moment of truth for our country. What are our values? How are they reflected in our budget? How do we grow the economy in a way that increases the paychecks of America's working families so that they have consumer confidence? they spend? they inject demand into the economy? they create jobs? they bring revenue to the Treasury?  How is it a good idea to cut education in order to give tax cuts to the wealthiest people in our country? Nothing brings more money to the Treasury than investments in education, early childhood, K-12, higher ed, postgrad, lifetime learning for our workers.  So, with stiff competition, mind you, having tax cuts which will steal from our budget investments in education is, with stiff competition, one of the worst ideas that the Republicans have to offer. But this is something that people should be alerted to, forgetting the policy and all the rest of it, what it means in your life.  Most likely, middle class family, you will pay more taxes. If you have a family member who is dependent on long-term healthcare, long-term care, whether in a nursing home or at home, most likely you will pay a price. If you have a family member who is on Medicare or if you are, Social Security disability, you will be affected by it.  The President said in his campaign the system is rigged. This is the rigging of the rig. This is taking the rig to a step that is almost impossible for us to return from. They take us down this road to ruin. They take us down this path to severe increase in the national debt to the tune of trillions of dollars, not even counting the debt service on it, at the cost of investments in our future, in our children, in our families, in fairness in our economy, in opportunity for  This is something that must be stopped, and we can start by stopping the assault on the State and local taxes deduction. Let's hold Members of Congress accountable for what they do that affects your pocketbook and your future.  We will be continuing this conversation for awhile, and we will have charts and the rest to visually demonstrate what this is.  Governance is about how you raise the money and how you invest it, and this is the dialogue that our country needs to hear very clearly for not only the policy aspects of it, but the personal consequences in their lives. This is a very bad deal for the American people, for middle class families.  Democrats want A Better Deal, better jobs, better pay, better future, and, by the way, to do this in a very bipartisan way.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-24-pt1-PgH8082-2.txt,905,HONORING SERGEANT BRYAN BLACK,2017.0,24.0,October
1057,topic-id,1454,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I particularly want to recognize Mr.Yarmuth's extraordinary leadership as the ranking member on the Budget As we all know, budget should be a statement of our national values. What is important to us as a nation should be reflected in how we allocate our resources.  Again, it is a statement of values, and who better to manage all of that in this Congress of the United States than Mr.Yarmuth, who brings his values and his heartland priorities to the budget process, and I thank him for the leadership he has provided.  Sadly though, I rise in opposition to what the Republicans have proposed which is a devastating Republican budget. The first step in the GOP's dangerous plan to fast track their immoral tax framework is to hand trillions of dollars to the wealthy while raising taxes on working American families.  The Republican budget and tax plan cruelly rig an unfair system even further against hardworking It cuts a raw deal for families in every corner of our country. Democrats have a better deal, better jobs, better pay, better future.[[Page H8252]]  But right here, before our eyes in this House, Republicans are replacing the great American ladders of opportunity with the silver spoons of plutocracy and aristocracy. Their agenda raises taxes on the middle class. That is a fact. Tens of millions of middle class families will pay higher taxes, including a heavier burden for State and local taxes.  It might be interesting to our distinguished colleague, Mr.Scalise--and isn't it a joy to see him in debate on the floor--in his State of Louisiana, 458,000 people will pay an average of nearly $7,000 more by losing their deduction.  And Congresswoman Black, from the great State of Tennessee, in her State, 573,960 people will lose their deduction, around $5,600 a filer.  Not only that, if that isn't bad enough for assaulting the dream of homeownership in our country by attacking the deduction, this plan that the Republicans propose has been estimated to reduce the value of people's homes by 10 percent. You not only are paying more money in order to give a tax break to the wealthy and to big corporations, you are reducing the value of your home, and, by the way, your neighbors' homes as well.  So with all of the unfairness in it, the one that is most understandable to people directly is how it affects them. And in that case, 44 million Americans will pay more because of what the Republicans have in their plan.  So it raises taxes on middle class, particularly with the State and local tax deduction removed. And by the way--another by the way--if you are a corporation, your deduction is not removed, just if you are an individual filer, so again, an advantage to corporate America at the expense of America's working families.  Next, it borrows trillions from the future to give tax cuts to the wealthiest. Eighty percent of the tax cuts in this Republican proposal goes to the wealthiest 1 percent; 80 percent goes to the wealthiest 1 percent at the expense of America's working families and children. The budget on the floor today reveals the true cruelty behind the Republican's tax plan. What words would be best to use it? It is looting the middle class, massive looting of the middle class; rip-off of the middle class, because there are many middle class people.  So you take some money from all of those middle class people and those who aspire to it so that you can give a lot of money to the few. That is a big sucking up of assets from the middle class to the wealthy. That is what they are here for. It is in their DNA: trickle-down economics. It is in their That is what the Republicans come here to do, and that causes a deep addition to the national debt.  They are supposed to be deficit hawks, but I think they have become an endangered species because they don't seem to care that, with the cuts that they are taking, the tax breaks they are giving to corporate and wealthy America will cost over $2 trillion--not counting service on the national debt which would take it closer to $3 trillion additional.  That is a very hard road to come back from. And as our distinguished ranking member has pointed out, the opportunity cost in the budget, whether it is a trillion dollars from Medicaid, half a trillion dollars from Medicare, funds taken from education, the seed corn of America's preeminence in the world. Why? To give a tax cut to the high end.  And they will say: Oh, well, the growth will come from this. We will pay for that.  It never has; never has. Don't take it from me. Bruce Bartlett, who was one of the orchestrators of the supply-side economics said: We never said it paid for itself. Anyone who says it does, it is not true. It is nonsense.  He went even further to call it  As I said, it ransacks Medicare and Medicaid, adding trillions to the debt in tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy, looting the middle class, shaking down the middle class, ripping off the middle class, increasing the taxes of the middle class.  It devastates vital investments, as our distinguished ranking member said, in good-paying jobs with higher wages for working families, the education of our children, the health of our working families. It really is a good example of what they say that Medicare should wither on the vine. In keeping with their trickle-down economics, Medicare should wither on the vine because they will take half a trillion dollars from Medicare in their budget that will follow.  So Republicans will harm veterans, rural America, seniors, and children, again, all in the name of fast-tracking trillion-dollar tax breaks for the wealthiest 1 percent. What more do you need to know? Eighty percent goes to the wealthiest 1 percent.  Again and again on the floor, the Republicans have tried to tilt the playing field against hardworking families. This is really quite remarkable though. This is a great transformative moment for America where we can reject this assault on the middle class, this addition to the national debt, and instead, say: Let's go to the table and work in a bipartisan way to truly reform our Tax Code so that we can be competitive in the world; so that families can thrive, and that they can have the deductions that are fair for them and needed, and not taken away from them, but not taken away from corporate So we stand ready to go in a bipartisan way to work to do this.  Any tax cuts, because this isn't just tax cuts to the rich--that is not tax reform--any tax cuts, any agenda like that has to be bipartisan in order for it to be sustainable. So let's come to our senses here. Common sense says--well, mathematics says, if you take a lot of money from many people to give it to a few, you are exacerbating the disparity of opportunity equity income in our country.  This is the wrong thing to do. It is not what our values are about. It is really a shame that they would even bring such a document to the floor. Anybody who lives in a district where their deductions, the tax deductions for State and local taxes, are taken away from individual filers, but not for corporations, as the bill determines, to the tune--and I can read you all of the statistics across the country about how devastating this is--as our own Governor said: How could they do that to our State or any State without the department of finance of our States saying: Wait a minute. Understand what this does to the economy of our Understand what this does to our individual filers in our  Who said that this document that came over from the Senate should have such a devastating impact on States and Members coming to the floor and endorsing it. Some say: Oh, I am just voting for the budget, but it really isn't what it--no. You are putting your name next to taking the deduction of homeownership and of State and local taxes away from your constituents. They are going to know that. I would rather you reject this. We don't want a political argument. We want to protect the American people.  That is why I hope everyone here would come down in favor of the middle class and reject this assault, this rip-off, this shakedown of the middle class that the Republicans have on the floor.                              {time}  1030  ",CREC-2017-10-26-pt1-PgH8230-3.txt,905,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017.0,26.0,October

The genesis of the University of Michigan predates the founding of my home State of  On August 26, 1817, Lewis Cass, Governor of the Michigan territory, enacted a charter to create the University of Michigania, aligned with territory judge Augustus Woodward's envisioned System of Universal  In 1852, the university's first president, Henry Philip Tappan, pioneered a model of higher education in which scholars do not settle for existing knowledge but actively pursue new knowledge through rigorous science. This approach solidified the university's enduring legacy as a center for scientific research and discovery.  The university has paved the way for future innovation with many firsts throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. It was the first university with a chemical laboratory, the first to own and operate a hospital, the first to teach aeronautical engineering, the first public university with dental and pharmacy schools, and the first with a program in human genetics. Perhaps the most game-changing first--it was the first large State university to open its doors to both men and women.  Today, faculty and students continue to reach new firsts by answering important research questions that will affect future generations. Take, for instance, how the university has laid the groundwork for breakthroughs in American mobility.  In 2015, Mcity, a public-private partnership led by the University of Michigan, became the world's first controlled environment designed to test connected and automated vehicle technologies. The 32-acre simulated urban and suburban landscape is designed to support rigorous, repeatable testing of self-driving car technologies before they are tested on public roads and highways. This hub of innovation reflects our State's legacy as the heart of the American auto industry and will help lead our country into the next era of transportation.  A similar nexus between our past and future is true across nearly every discipline that U of M's research touches--engineering, medicine, social sciences, humanities, and more. Students and faculty are developing new cancer treatments, creating energy-efficient batteries, engaging in cutting-edge environmental science to protect the Great Lakes, and building prototypes of engines to take us to That is just to name a few.  Tied with the University of Michigan's drive to pursue knowledge is its drive to put that knowledge into action for the greater good. At its core, the university's mission is to serve society. This has been demonstrated by its history of activism and civic engagement.  The university commemorates one such event that occurred on October 14, 1960. Senator John Kennedy, whose former desk is just a few feet in front of me here today, delivered an unplanned speech on the steps of the Michigan Union at 2 a.m. He challenged University of Michigan students to work abroad in developing nations in an effort to promote peace. These remarks laid the blueprint for the U.Peace Corps, which was established in 1961.  The University of Michigan continues to have a truly global reach. It provides a world-class education to a diverse student body of 63,000 students on its Ann Arbor, Dearborn, and Flint campuses, educating instate, out-of-state, and international students alike. They are drawn to the university's unfaltering endeavor to expand our[[Page S6804]]base of knowledge and empower individuals to leave a lasting and positive impact on the world around them.  With more than 572,000 living alumni--including my daughter Madeline, who just graduated this past May--the University of Michigan has one of the largest alumni networks, full of artists, astronauts, business and government leaders, entrepreneurs, and humanitarians, as well as Nobel laureates in economics, medicine, and science.  The University of Michigan's many illustrious alumni include U.President Gerald Ford, Swedish diplomat and humanitarian Raoul Wallenberg, Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Arthur Miller, actor James Earl Jones, civil rights leader Mary Frances Berry, Google cofounder Larry Page, and author and scholar Robin Many more alumni will follow in these footsteps.

That is not what I came here to talk about, Mr.I just thought it was a little bit beyond my humanity to endure that lecture, especially about impeachment, when the Representative comes from a party that impeached President Clinton over one lie--one lie about sex--and we get a profusion of dozens of lies every single day from the White House, from this President, about matters of public policy, crucial matters of national security, and so on.  That is not even to get into the question of admitted obstruction of justice, bragging about the fact that he had fired the FBI Director because he was involved in the Russia investigation; not even talking about the rampant abuse of power that we see as recent as this week with apparently corrupt dealings in terms of the Puerto Rican rescue, when 80 percent of the island is still without power, and it looks like there are all sorts of sweetheart contracts that are afoot there.  It is not even to go to the question of the domestic Emoluments Clause and the foreign Emoluments Clause, which are defied every single day with the money that is pouring forth from foreign governments directly to the Trump Hotel and Trump Tower and the Trump golf courses all over the world.  I am not going to get into any of that stuff because I want to talk about something hopeful and uplifting tonight. I want to talk about America's responsibilities in the world, something that we used to take really seriously.  I want to talk about what America is and who we are and what debt of responsibility we owe to the rest of the world and how well we are doing today, given what is taking place around the world.  Now, in America, unlike most countries in the world--or at least a lot of countries in the world--we are not defined by virtue of being one race or one ethnicity or one religion or one political party or one system of belief. We are unified just by virtue of the fact that we have one Constitution and one Bill of We all agree to adhere to it and live under it and struggle for a more perfect union under that umbrella.  Mr.Speaker, every day we get to come to work, and we see the busts and the statues and the portraits of great We see Frederick Douglass, we see Thomas Jefferson, we see John Adams, we see George  Mr.Speaker, America was the first Nation on Earth conceived in revolutionary insurgency against a monarchy, an arbitrary political leadership, and the fusion of church and  Our forebearers rebelled against centuries of religious warfare between the Catholics and the Protestants every bit as vicious and bloody as what we see in the Muslim world today between the Sunni and the They rebelled against the idea that, as Tom Payne put it, the king is law. He said that in the democracies, law would be king.  That was the idea behind We would govern ourselves. As Jefferson put in the Declaration of Independence, all men are created equal, all of us are endowed with inalienable rights--life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness--and government is legitimately erected only on the basis of the consent of the governed.  Now I hasten to say that all of those beautiful ideals were not realized at the start of our Let's not make-believe. Let's not pretend.  We didn't start, in the words of that great Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, as a nation of the people, by the people, and for the people. We started as a slave Republic of White male property owners over the age of 21, where the vast majority of people could not vote and could not participate: indentured servants, slaves, women, and so on.  But still, the idea was there, and those beautiful, tantalizing ideals were inserted by Thomas Jefferson, whose memory was defended recently by a group of hardy and defiant University of Virginia students who surrounded the statue of Thomas Jefferson to defend it against the rampaging mob of racist skinheads and Klansmen who had come to desecrate the memory of Jefferson and everything that he believed in with his ideals and the words that he put in the Declaration of  Those were the founding ideals of the country, and through successive waves of political and social struggle and constitutional change, we have opened America up. Through the Civil War and the Reconstruction amendments, we opened America up:  The 14th Amendment gave us equal protection and due process. The 13th Amendment abolished slavery. The 15th Amendment said no discrimination on the basis of race in voting. The 17th Amendment shifted the mode of election from the State legislatures to the people. The 19th Amendment gave us woman suffrage. The 23rd Amendment said people here in the District of Columbia could participate in Presidential elections. The 24th Amendment abolished poll taxes. The 26th Amendment lowered the age of voting to 18 all across the whole country.  The whole trajectory of our constitutional development has been towards greater equality and freedom for the American people. That is who we are. We are a nation that united with other nations around the world to defeat fascism, Nazism, Stalinism, communism, and totalitarianism in the last century. We did that.  We stood with Eleanor Roosevelt and the United Nations in proclaiming the U.Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which enshrined the rights of freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, freedom of assembly, and freedom of the press, taking all those rights and freedoms that we fought for in America that are in our Constitution and trying to make them a global ideal so that all of the people of the world could enjoy the fruits and the experience of liberal democracy.  When we stood at our best as a country, we have been on the side of freedom movements. We have been on the side of human rights. We have been on the side of victims of government authoritarianism and persecution. That is who we are as a country.  It is all being forgotten and frittered away with the chaos that has descended not just upon the White House--that is too easy, I would say to my dear friend Mr.Zeldin--on this institution, on lots of institutions in Washington, D.We are forgetting who we are.

In Burma, in[[Page H8219]]Myanmar, the government is waging brutal ethnic and religious violence against Rohingya Muslims, thousands of whom have been killed and more than 100,000 of whom have fled the country, in terror.  Now, this savage campaign of ethnic cleansing in Burma by the Buddhist-led government is being turned on all Muslims in that country. And what is our government doing?  In Turkey, which I will have a little bit more to say about in a moment, there is a vicious crackdown on free speech and free press, and the jailing of journalists and citizens without due process. In Russia, there continues to be outrageous human rights abuses against the personal political enemies of Vladimir Putin; against the LGBT community, which continues to be reviled and demonized by the government. In Chechnya, there are campaigns against journalists, and so on. In the Philippines, President Duterte has overseen the killing of thousands of people in a brutal war on drugs, with no due process at all, where the police can simply declare that you look like a drug user, you look like a drug dealer, and then they can have you killed.  It is also in Venezuela, where Maduro has consolidated his power and is denying the rule of law at every turn; in Saudi Arabia; in Iran, which was mentioned before, with brutal campaigns against ethnic minorities--one of the leading administrators of capital punishment on Earth, fomenting terror abroad.                              {time}  2000  Saudi Arabia, which Freedom House calls among the worst of the worst, where torture is present, where women are victims of almost pervasive sex discrimination--I think just a couple of months ago they won a limited right to drive in 2017--and on and on.  And across the world, governments have passed laws against blasphemy, against heresy, against apostasy, against witchcraft, against sorcery, against all kinds of imaginary religious offenses which were wiped off of the books of our State laws centuries ago under the First Amendment, and yet there are people rotting in jail today because they belong to the wrong religious group and they are accused of blasphemy or apostasy in Iran or in Saudi Arabia or Bangladesh, or any other number of countries which use the tools of the state to oppress people because of their religious faith and their religious worship.  What does President Trump do? Well, he personally praised Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines and invited him to come to His first state visit was to Saudi Arabia, where he publicly said that he was not going to take issue with anything that they were doing in terms of human rights, didn't speak about any of the people rotting in jail in Saudi Arabia in a way that completely violates the human rights understandings and norms of the world.  He has praised Erdogan in And, of course, we know of his infamous and somewhat inscrutable relationship with Vladimir Putin, certainly has nothing to say about human rights violations taking place against Russians, tens of thousands of whom have summoned up the courage since the President took office to march in the streets against political corruption and for human rights. And our government does nothing to support the people in civil society in Russia who are trying to stand up for the idea of human rights in their country.  Trump says, when he goes to Saudi Arabia: We are not here to lecture. We must seek partners, not perfection.  And he has found those partners all over the world: Duterte in the Philippines, Putin in Russia, Orban in On and on down the list, you find a despot, you find a tyrant, you find a kleptocrat and a bully, you have found a newfound buddy of the United States of  Now, over the summer, media outlets reported that the State Department wanted to drop the promotion of democracy and human rights from the Department's mission. The State Department has since eliminated the www.humanrights.gov website and moved its content to an alternative and more obscure web address.  In May of 2017, Secretary of State Tillerson reversed decades of bipartisan consensus that human rights and democracy are not only essential components of U.foreign policy and national security, but universal values that the U.has adopted as a guiding principle of international legitimacy. And, of course, everyone knows of President Trump's attempts to withdraw from treaties and agreements all over the world, including, of course, the Paris accord on climate change.  Now, all of these actions, all of these statements are a betrayal of who we are as a country. We are not defined by race. We are not defined by ideology, unlike other countries around the world. We are not defined by religion. We are defined by an idea of liberal democracy committed to equality and freedom for all. If we give that up and we surrender that, we surrender what is most precious and defining about the United States of America, Mr. And guess what. We have got human rights problems right here at home that we need to be dealing with.  Do you know we have millions of Americans who can't vote and are not represented in Congress? This anomaly was brought home to us in a very sharp way over the last several weeks with the crisis in Puerto Rico, where people still lack access to medicines that they need, where people--a majority of the population still lacks access to clean water, and power is out for four-fifths of the population. Those are our people. Those are our citizens. Those are Americans in Puerto  But why were they treated differently? Why was there this notorious negligence and lethargy in responding to the plight of people in Puerto Rico? Well, they have no voting representatives in this Chamber or in the United States Senate, so we have got millions of people unrepresented.  Right here in the Nation's Capital, in the District of Columbia, we see the exact same democratic deficit, the exact same discrepancy and discord between our values and our ideals and what the reality of daily practice is. We are the only democratic nation left on Earth where the people of the capital city are disenfranchised in their national legislature. We are the only one.  I have only been in this body for 10 months, Mr.Speaker, but I have noted how frequently and how joyfully this body will rise to trample the local legislation adopted by people in the District of Columbia who can't fight back because they don't have voting representation in Congress, and so we are very happy to kick them around if they have got a different point of view on death with dignity. Of course, death with dignity in the District of Columbia should be of no concern to us. What should be of concern is life with democracy in the District of Columbia if we are going to be faithful to our ideals.  They get to decide, not us. But as long as they are excluded from representation in the national legislature, they are going to continue to be kicked around on questions of gay rights and whether or not poor women can be given full access to reproductive healthcare in the District of Columbia, another issue where the majority in this body decided to squash the political self-determination of more than 650,000 American citizens who live right here in the Nation's  We have got millions of people who are disenfranchised. That is a human rights problem. So we have got to deal with that. Maybe if America begins to stand up again for human rights around the world, we will begin to stand up again for human rights in our own country.  So this is not a partisan issue. Of course, one of our great leaders in the advancement of human rights in America was President Abraham Lincoln, a great Republican, and his friend Frederick Douglass, a great I take pride in that. I take pride in the Republicans who fought for freedom and democracy in They are as much a part of my legacy as great Democrats like Franklin Roosevelt or President Barack Obama, the people who fought for civil rights and civil liberties in my party. So we should cherish everybody in our history who moved forward the engines of freedom and democratic change in the country.  Mr.Speaker, I just want to say these are tough times in There is a lot of chaos that has descended upon our country, and, Mr.Speaker, we need all Americans to know, but especially young Americans to know, what we really stand for.[[Page H8220]]  We have a claim, a very strong claim to being the greatest nation on Earth, and it has got nothing to do with the military, and it has got nothing to do with our It has got to do with the way we were created, what our founding ideals were, and then the commitment of the people always to try to realize those ideals and engender a more perfect Union as we go along.

787,topic-id,816,"Mr.President, we all recognize that a postsecondary education is required for most family-sustaining, middle-class jobs, and that an educated workforce is essential to a modern, productive economy. A report by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce found that college-level intensive business services have replaced manufacturing as the largest sector in the U.economy, and that while college-educated workers make up only 32 percent of the workforce, they now produce more than 50 percent of the Nation's economic output, up from 13 percent in 1967. A college degree also pays off, as median annual earnings for bachelor's degree holders were $23,000 higher compared to high school graduates in 2014.  Yet just as there is growing recognition that postsecondary education is indispensable in the modern economy, families are being required to shoulder growing debt burdens that threaten access to college.  According to an analysis of student loan debt by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, between 2004 and 2014, there was an 89 percent increase in the number of student loan borrowers and a 77 percent increase in the average balance size. Today, over 40 million Americans have student loan debt.  This is a growing drag on our economy. As student loan debt has grown, young adults have put off buying homes or cars, starting a family, saving for retirement, or launching new businesses. They have literally mortgaged their economic future.  We know that student loan borrowers are struggling. A recent Department of Education analysis of outcomes for student loan borrowers who began their studies in 1995-96 and 2003-04 found that only 38 percent of the 1995-96 cohort had paid off their loans without default after 20 years, and only 24 percent after 12 years. For the 2003-04 cohort, only 20 percent had repaid their loans without defaulting after 12 years. Worse, 52 percent of students who attended for-profit institutions had defaulted on a student loan within 12 years. Roughly, 8.5 million borrowers currently have a loan in default.  We have seen the costs to students and taxpayers when institutions are not held accountable. Corthinian Colleges and ITT are two examples of institutions that failed their students while benefitting from Federal student aid. Their fraudulent business practices eventually led to their demise, but not before leaving their students and taxpayers on the hook for millions of dollars in student loan debt.  We cannot wait until an institution is catastrophically failing its students before taking action. Institutions need greater financial incentives to act before default rates rise. Simply put, we cannot tackle the student loan debt crisis without States and institutions stepping up and taking greater responsibility for college costs and student borrowing.  That is why I am pleased to introduce the Protect Student Borrowers Act with Senators Durbin, Warren, and Our legislation seeks to ensure there is more skin in the game when it comes to student loan debt by setting stronger market incentives for colleges and universities to provide better and more affordable education to students, which should in turn help put the brakes on rising student loan defaults.  The Protect Student Borrowers Act would hold colleges and universities accountable for student loan defaults by requiring them to repay a percentage of defaulted loans. Only institutions that have one-third or more of their students borrow would be included in the bill's risk-sharing requirements based on their cohort default rate. Risk-sharing requirements would kick in when the default rate exceeds 15 percent. As the institution's default rate rises, so too will the institution's risk-share payment.  The Protect Student Borrowers Act also provides incentives for institutions to take proactive steps to ease student loan debt burdens and reduce default rates. Colleges and universities can reduce or eliminate their payments if they implement a comprehensive student loan management plan. The Secretary may waive or reduce the payments for institutions whose mission is to serve low-income and minority students, such as community colleges, Historically Black Institutions, or Hispanic-Serving Institutions--provided that they are making progress in their student loan management plans.  The risk-sharing payments would be invested in helping struggling borrowers, preventing future default and delinquency, and increasing Pell Grants at institutions that enroll a high percentage of Pell Grant recipients and have low default rates.  With the stakes so high for students and taxpayers, it is only fair that institutions bear some of the risk in the student loan program.  We need to tackle student loan debt and college affordability from multiple angles. And we need all stakeholders in the system to do their part. With the Protect Student Borrowers Act, we are providing the incentives and resources for institutions to take more responsibility to address college affordability and student loan debt and improve student outcomes. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill and look forward to working with them to include it and other key reforms in the upcoming reauthorization of the Higher Education                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-10-26-pt1-PgS6855.txt,1982,LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM,2017.0,26.0,October
788,topic-id,546,"Mr.President, as Americans, we take inspiration from those who have answered the call to serve, whether in defense of our Nation abroad or to strengthen our communities at home. This willingness to make common cause with our fellow citizens and serve a purpose greater than ourselves is a hallmark of our We should ensure that every American who wants to serve has the opportunity to do so. To that end, I am introducing the America's Call to Improving Opportunities Now (ACTION) for National Service Act with Senators Coons and Our legislation calls for elevating the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) to a cabinet-level agency and supporting up to one million national service positions annually.  Since 1994, over one million individuals have served through the AmeriCorps program. Additionally, roughly 245,000 seniors over the age of 55 volunteer annually through the Senior Corps programs. These individuals have addressed critical community needs in education, economic development, health, and many other areas. They have come to their fellow citizens' aid in times of national disaster, including thousands who have been deployed in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Unfortunately, we have not created the capacity to support all those who want to serve.  Rhode Island has embraced service. Providence is one of the top AmeriCorps cities in the nation. Across our State, nearly 4,200 AmeriCorps and Senior Corps volunteers are helping students succeed in school, ensuring veterans get access to the services they need, supporting seniors in their communities, protecting the environment, and addressing other critical needs. With additional resources and support, Rhode Island volunteers could accomplish so much more.  We strive to honor those who serve. Even more importantly, we invest in the education and professional development of those who have sacrificed and given so much to our Developing the talents of our most committed citizens pays life-long dividends. Our investment in the GI Bill not only honors our service members, but also enriches our Similarly, the education awards for those who have served through CNCS programs have economic impacts beyond the individuals who earn them. Just as we came together on a bipartisan basis to expand and enhance the GI Bill benefits, now is the time to increase the education award for those who serve at[[Page S6856]]home. The ACTION for National Service Act will ensure that national service volunteers who complete two full terms of service earn an education award equivalent to four years of in-State tuition at a public university. Those who are willing to serve should not have to carry a heavy burden of student loan debt to achieve their educational goals.  Today, as our communities face challenges in a host of areas, we need more people to participate in national service, and we need more partners to support them. As such, the ACTION for National Service Act will establish a National Service Foundation to encourage private sector and philanthropic investment in expanding national service opportunities.  All AmeriCorps members take a pledge to get things done for Americans, to make communities safer, smarter and healthier, and to bring us together.

812,topic-id,743,"Mr.President, I rise today to oppose the Congressional Review Act resolution repealing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's forced arbitration rule. At a time when millions of Americans are suffering the consequences of abusive practices by major financial institutions--including the massive consumer fraud by Wells[[Page S6730]]Fargo and the exposure of up to half of the national population's personal information due to inadequate cyber security by Equifax--it is simply wrong to give immunity to bad corporate actors against lawsuits by the very customers they harmed.  I urge my colleagues to think about the millions of Americans who still don't know all the facts about whether they are victims of one of these or other major banking scandals. They deserve the chance to gather the facts and hold the responsible parties accountable. This anticonsumer resolution strips away those victims' constitutional first line of defense against lending fraud and permits corporations more opportunities to take advantage of consumers.  We have known for years that forced arbitration clauses harm the financial security of those who are most vulnerable to lending scams. Companies slip these clauses into the fine print of contracts for everything from loan applications to purchases on a smartphone. Let's be clear. Even if every American had the time to read and understand the fine print of every contract they sign, most of these contracts by major financial institutions are one-sided, and the consumer has no power to bargain the terms in the fine print.  With these in place, consumers who learn their bank or lender has overcharged or defrauded them also learn quickly that they have signed away their right to take the corporation to court. Instead, they must choose between dropping their claim or going it alone in an arbitration process that is clearly and notoriously stacked in favor of the corporation.  Forced arbitration makes it easier for predatory lenders to avoid the consequences for taking advantage of consumers. This reality is even more outrageous when we consider the fact that predatory lenders view servicemembers, military families, and veterans as prime targets for financial scams. The CFPB has noted that servicemembers are attractive targets because, among other things, they are required to maintain good finances, their pay is consistent, they often relocate, and many are just starting to make significant financial decisions. The Department of Defense is also well aware that military bases draw predatory lenders selling bad or illegal loans, which is one reason why the Department of Defense recently issued new rules banning forced arbitration for many loans covered by the Military Lending But these rules still don't cover the full range of financial products that may be used to take advantage of military consumers and their families. That is why I have worked for years with Senator Lindsey Graham on legislation to ban forced arbitration clauses that waive or limit rights under the Servicemembers Civil Relief The CFPB rule bans many of these and other forced arbitration clauses that disproportionately harm servicemembers and their families.  While the CFPB has provided data to support the arbitration rule's positive effects for servicemembers, we should also listen to the servicemember community. Their strong support for this rule speaks volumes. The CFPB rule's supporters include the Military Coalition, which consists of 32 military advocacy groups, including the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and associations representing the interests of members of the Navy, Army, Air Force, and Marine Moreover, in August, the National Convention of the American Legion adopted a resolution opposing legislation to repeal the CFPB forced arbitration rule because, among other reasons, it ``is extremely unfair to bar servicemembers, veterans, and other consumers from joining together to enforce statutory and constitutional protections in court.'' Simply put, servicemembers and veterans don't want this CRA, and they are watching this vote closely.  Mr.President, forced arbitration is the prime example of a rigged system whereby powerful corporations and interests play by different sets of rules than average When a normal person defrauds another person, that person is entitled to seek a resolution in court. It is wrong for us to allow major corporations to create their own justice system that serves their own interests at the expense of American consumers, families, servicemembers, and veterans.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution and to permit the CFPB arbitration rule to go into effect.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

Over and over again, they have been on top of the situation and making sure that America's position and the moral position of the world is declared by this Today we have four bills that are in keeping with that tradition and the great job that they have already been doing.  First of all, let us just note that this human shield legislation, whatever way Hezbollah acts, it is worth us saying: Look how horrible it is. Look at the horrible tactics they are using. It is worth us having a resolution to draw people's attention to it, but let's just be fair.

This is how far down those people who would destroy Israel have gone. So it is just and right for us today.  Yes, they point out the human shields, but this is part of a bigger problem.

I think he has made an excellent record of not only the premise of the deal, but the effect of the deal so far.  Mr.Speaker, I agree with the gentleman from New York that Mr.Barr is going to be critical in leading the effort forward in sanctions, whether they are part of the JCPOA or not. I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for his words tonight as well.  Earlier this month, President Trump set a new direction for the United States, a direction of leadership. He made clear that we would no longer allow the Iranian Government to continue to pursue nuclear weapons, continue funding terrorism, or threaten the very existence of our great friend, Israel, the strongest ally we have in the region.  President Trump made clear that, unlike the previous administration, we will not reward Iran for chanting ``death to America,'' and we will not allow this terrorist regime to dictate our Nation's foreign policy.  Getting the Iran deal done was the only thing the previous administration cared about. Think about that, just getting the deal done. I think we all remember that sentiment around here: getting the deal done no matter how terrible was the only thing the previous administration cared about. We had to get the deal done.

I appreciate the President's leadership on this and other matters.  The United States never should have signed onto the deal in the first place, Mr.Speaker, because it was a bad deal. It gave Iran immediate access to $150 billion, it allowed the Iranians to continue their ballistic missile research, and it contains a sunset provision that will allow the Iranians to return immediately to enriching uranium without consequence.  Now, even then-Secretary of State John Kerry said: ``Some of the $150 billion will end up in the hands of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps or other entities, some of which are labeled terrorists.''  That was our Secretary of State's direct quote admitting that some of this $150 billion was going to get to terrorists.  There is no situation in which the United States should allow money to get to terrorists. Hoosiers that I represent see this quite clearly. Surely, the Americans that the rest of us represent see the same thing. But then-President Obama and Secretary Kerry allowed this to happen and were cheered on, in fact, by many in this very Chamber and many in the  This year alone, Iran has tested their ballistic missiles at least three times, and they tested a rocket space launch vehicle. Now, in their most recent test in September, they used a ballistic missile with the potential range to hit Israel, the only stable democracy in the region.  As Mr.Barr pointed out, Mr.Speaker, intercontinental ballistic missiles aren't even meant for They are meant to come here. They are meant to go to our other allies--a bad deal indeed.  The threats Iran poses are truly extreme: terrorists, a nuclear arms race, and continued threats to America and its neighbors. Unfortunately, we cannot go back in time and stop then-President Obama from signing this disastrous Iran nuclear deal--and, by the way, it is signing in the theoretical sense because Mr.Yoho is also right, Mr.Speaker, when he said that this was a set of papers that truly had no signatories. It was an executive action by then-President Obama for sure. But, all in all, no matter what the semantics, it was a bad deal.  But we can--we can--move forward by creating tough sanctions like, Mr.Speaker, Mr.Barr was pointing out and making sure Iran is held accountable.

His bottom teeth looked like they had been taken with a pair of pliers and rearranged. His mother, Cindy, described how his hands and legs were totally deformed.  Otto's story serves as a very real and very tangible reminder, and teaches a new generation of Americans of what happens under totalitarian governments and communist dictators.

At just 18 years of age, Iyotte enlisted in the U.Army and was assigned to Company E, 2nd Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division, during the Korean war.  Upon being deployed overseas to Korea, Sergeant Iyotte's battalion was one of the first sent into battle in 1950. During combat, Sergeant Iyotte was wounded, but returned to the battlefield in just 3 weeks.  Months later, Sergeant Iyotte was detailed to Operation Thunderbolt on February 9, 1951. During this assignment, Sergeant Iyotte was captured and ultimately held at a prisoner-of-war camp in Changsong, where he passed away in 1951. However, his remains never made it home.  Due to his many heroic efforts, Sergeant Iyotte was awarded the Purple Heart Medal, the Combat Infantryman's Badge, the Prisoner of War Medal, the United Nations Service Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, and the Korean War Service  Through the combined effort of Sergeant Iyotte's family, the U.Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency and the Department of Veterans Affairs, Sergeant Iyotte's remains were positively identified earlier this year. This week, they return to his family so he can finally be laid to rest near his home in South  With this, I welcome the opportunity to recognize the life of a fallen hero, SGT Philip James Iyotte, and commemorate his return to White River, He is finally home.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-26-pt1-PgS6845-4.txt,99999999999999,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,26.0,October

451,topic-id,5049,"Mr.President, over the next few weeks, the Senate, the House, Congress--everybody here in Washington is going to be engaged in what I think is one of the most important and potentially impactful debates we have had here in a long time. For a place that has been so criticized for not doing anything, we have a chance to actually do something that is going to matter and help real people and help the country. It is called tax reform.  I think the great thing about a tax reform debate is that it actually goes to the heart and soul of our identity as a nation and who we want to be and who we have been up to this point.  We are a nation that has embraced free enterprise. There are people who don't believe in free enterprise. There are people who believe in different variations of free enterprise. By and large, America has believed in free enterprise. That basically means the government doesn't try to control too much of the economy. People have private property and private businesses. You have rules to make sure people don't cheat and steal from one another or hurt people, but by and large, we believe in a private economy. Why do we believe that? I think the answer to that is not just a purely economic one; you look back at our founding.  One of the unique things about this country that we have taken for granted and do not do a good enough job of teaching young Americans is that America was not created as a nation to bring together a common race or a common ethnicity or a common religion. There are a lot of nations around the world--in fact, I would argue that most of the nations that have ever existed have been a homeland for the people who were born and have lived in that one place--not us. We were founded on the idea that you could bring different kinds of people from different backgrounds and unite them as one people, despite their differences in background and ethnicity and religion. You could unite them behind a very powerful idea--the idea that all of us are created equal because we were born with a God-given right to life and to liberty and to pursue happiness.  That is not just a revolutionary idea; it has changed the world. It has been the identity of our country. It is among everything else that makes us unique and special. In every generation, it has been challenged economically, socially, and culturally. We need to continue to fight for that.  One of the core principles behind equal opportunity is the ability to fulfill your economic potential--to grow up and be who you want to be, do what you want to do, open a company or work for a certain industry or career or[[Page S6830]]stay home and raise children. Whatever your choice is, they are all legitimate. We are a nation that believes we all have the God-given right to pursue that, and that is something which free enterprise makes possible.  The difference between free enterprise and people who want government to control everything is--the best analogy I can think of is, imagine a pie. Let's use a pie as an example. I can't bring one on the floor to graphically detail it, but imagine one in your mind. Imagine if I said to you: This pie will never grow. It will always be the same size. Every single one of us gets a slice.  Well, if the pie can't grow and everyone gets a slice, then the bigger your slice, the smaller my slice. That is what people who don't believe in free enterprise argue. They argue that the pie really can't grow, and so you need government to make sure that pie is sliced equally or equal enough among everybody. The Tax Code is one of the ways they do it.  There is another argument. It is the one I believe in. It is the one that I think has made this country the most prosperous in human history. It is the argument that that pie doesn't have to stay that size. We can make it a pie that is a lot bigger and make sure it keeps growing. Therefore, it doesn't matter how big the other person's slice is, as long as your slice is big too. More for them doesn't mean less for you. That is one of the unique attributes of free enterprise: Everyone can be better off without anyone being left worse off. That is the theory, but it doesn't always work in practice for a lot of different reasons. That doesn't mean anarchy. We do need government. I am not anti-regulation; I am anti-overregulation.  I fly on airplanes. Everybody here flies on a lot of airplanes. I am sure we are all glad that airplane is inspected and the person who is flying it is really a pilot and not just someone who stayed at Holiday Inn  I think all of us want to make sure that when you open a bottle of medicine prescribed to you, what is in that bottle is actually the medicine and not something fake or something different.  When we eat food, we want to make sure it is not poisonous or going to spread disease. These are all products of regulation.  The same is true in economics. That is why we have antitrust laws. That is why we take on anti-competitiveness, because it actually undermines free enterprise. I am not talking about corporatism, because there are a lot of countries around the world that claim to be free enterprise, but they really aren't. Four or five big companies control everything, and everybody else either works for them or is unemployed. That is not what I am talking about.  I am talking about free enterprise--a nation and a system in which someone can quit their job, open a business, compete with their former employer, and put them out of business--or at least take away some of their customers--because you are better than they are. That is free enterprise. That is what we believe in, and the Tax Code is a part of it.  What has challenged free enterprise in this country in the 21st century and you sense it in people's frustrations? There are two things.  The first is there is a lot of overcompetition. It wasn't true in the sixties and seventies. We forget Germany and These countries were wiped out completely during World War It took them decades to rebuild. America was the only show in town for much of the fifties, sixties, up into the seventies. But all of these other countries watched us grow, and they started doing the things we did. They started deregulating, and they most certainly started cutting taxes.  The result has been that over the last 20 or 25 years, most countries in the industrialized world, the big economies, charge companies a lot less in taxes than we do. What that does over time is make us uncompetitive. That is why not a day goes by that you don't read about some American company that was bought by a company in another country and moved over there. Do you know why? Because they pay less in taxes over there than they do here. Anyone who doesn't realize that is missing a big part of it.  We are not the only show in town anymore. We have to compete, and that is why our Tax Code is important. If it becomes uncompetitive, you are basically forcing and/or inviting companies to leave the United States for a more favorable tax treatment--and that has happened.  Do you know who has paid the price? Not the rich people. If you are a wealthy investor, you can invest your money anywhere in the world. Even if you make your money here, I promise you, you have the best lawyers and the best accountants to find every creative loophole to save money. And if that loophole doesn't exist, you will hire the best lobbyist to make one.  In the end, the truly wealthy--the billionaires, the owners with these extraordinary amounts of wealth--they will figure it out. Do you know who gets hurt? The people who get paid every 2 weeks. That is who gets hurt because when those companies leave the United States, they take their jobs with them. The fewer of those there are and the more people we have competing for fewer jobs, the less people get paid at a time when everything costs more.  There is another thing that is hurting us, and it is not part of the tax reform, but it is the way growth is now distributed. We can no longer just assume that if the economy grows, everyone will be better off automatically, because the truth is, in the 21st century, there are some careers, some industries, and some jobs that pay substantially more.  Do you want to talk about the haves and have-nots in the 21st century? The haves and the have-nots are the people who have advanced education and the right skills and the people who do not. We have to close that gap. Vocational training--that is a separate topic that has to be dealt with and is critically important in the way growth is distributed. But you have no growth to distribute if you don't have growth. So that is why this is so important.  When you hear all this talk about wealthy corporations getting huge tax breaks, it is not necessarily true. It is really, really important for people to pay attention to the details and not just the talking points on this.  For example, let's say company X is a publicly traded company, so they sell stock on Wall Street and the like. Next year, because we lower taxes, that company makes $1 million more than they did this year. What can they do with that million dollars for a publicly traded company? There are really only four things they can do with that money, and all four of them help working  The first thing they can do is grow the business. They can say: We like our business a lot. We now have a million dollars more than we thought we were going to have, but we believe so much in our future that we are going to take that million dollars and we are going to invest it to grow the company. We are going to open a new factory. We are going to open more stores and hire more people as a result. We are going to invest in more equipment, which means the people who make that equipment have more work. That is the first thing you can do with the money you might save on taxes.  The second thing you might have to do--maybe you don't grow your business, but with that million dollars extra that you have from the tax cuts, you are going to have to pay your employees more because, if not, they are going to quit and go to work for somebody else. So all of a sudden, you are now in a position to be able to hire good people and retain them by paying them more and by offering better benefits to keep them. That is the second thing you can do with the money.  The third thing you can do with the million dollars from the tax cut that you didn't plan on having is lower prices. You can say: I am in competition with these five other businesses to sell the same thing. We are going to use our million dollars to lower our prices just a little bit, just enough so that people buy it from us instead of them. Do you know what that other company is going to have to do? They are going to have to lower prices, too, to compete with you. Do you know who benefits from the lowering of prices? The middle class. The people who are going to shop are going to be paying less because of the competition. That is the third thing that can happen.  The fourth thing that can happen and the one that gets the most criticism is,[[Page S6831]]well, they will just pay it to the shareholders in dividends. Who are the shareholders? The shareholders are wealthy people who trade in Wall Street and spend all day in front of a computer and have these brokerage accounts and people who handle their accounts. They are a part of it.  You know who else are shareholders? Millions and millions of If you are a firefighter or a police officer with a union pension, you are a shareholder. You might not be aware of the companies you have shares in, but it is in your pension, and the future of your pension will depend on how those investments go. If you are a 401(k) holder, you are a shareholder. Just because you are not in front of the computer every day, checking your TD Ameritrade account to see how much money you have in X stock and Y stock does not mean you are not a shareholder. You are a shareholder.  Virtually every sort of investment mechanism for retirement in America is invested in what is called equities, is invested in the market, is invested in stocks and bonds. If, in fact, those things are doing better, it is helping you retire.  That is why the business side of this is so important. It will help grow the economy, but it actually will also help people because there is nowhere else for that money to go.  The other type of small business, which is actually the majority, has been called a passthrough, and that is what most businesses are organized as. That is where you pay on your personal rate. If you are a small business owner with three employees, you are an S corporation, and at the end of the year, you pay your taxes on your personal rate. Your rate is actually higher than the companies, the corporations, except you can't hire the lawyers and the accountants and all the other expertise. You are actually, in many cases, paying more than the big companies. These small businesses need to be helped, too, and they would be with tax reform that lowers their rate and makes them competitive.  Beyond ensuring that people are either going to have better retirement funds, lower prices, more pay, more jobs, and we are helping small businesses, the vast majority of which are owned by people who are not multimillionaires and billionaires, the other thing we can do to help working-class people in this country is an expansion of the child tax credit. It is an idea that Senator Lee and I have been pushing for the better part of 2 years. It wasn't always universally popular, but I am going to explain three reasons why it is important. In fact, not only is it important, but it has to happen. If we don't do this, then someone could argue that this is not a middle-class tax cut. If we do it, it will be, perhaps, the single largest middle-class tax cut in modern history.  The child tax credit is a credit you get per child. Obviously, it phases out at some point--the more money you make. Why do we have it? We have it for two reasons: 1, we truly believe that the family is the most important institution in society and parenting is the most important job you will ever have. I don't care who you are. If you are the President, if you are a Senator, if you are a Congressman--I don't care what you do--the most important job you will ever have, the most influence you will ever have, the most impactful thing you will ever do is to raise a family, so our Tax Code accounts for that. It should.  The second thing is that raising children is expensive. If you are raising children right now or have at any time in the near past, you know how expensive it is. I don't know where they get these numbers, but they sound right to me. The Department of Agriculture estimates that to raise children from the time they are born to the time they are 18 is about $235,000 per child. That is a staggering amount of money. That doesn't even account for college, by the way.  All you have to do is spend just 10 minutes; just go out one day this weekend and talk to the people you know who are working parents, and ask them. They are going to tell you one of the most expensive things they face, especially between the time their children are born and the time they turn 4 or 5, is childcare. In over two-thirds of the States in this country, this costs more than it does to go to college. Imagine that you make $800 a week that you take home, but you have to spend $400 a week on childcare for your two kids. That is half your paycheck.  I am not saying a child tax credit fixes all of that. I am saying that is a cost that keeps going up. It is a reason why the tax credit has lost about $300 in value from the time it was last expanded in 2003.  The other thing to add to it is, if you look at some of the changes being proposed on the personal deduction, that is another $500 off. In essence, at $800 per child, we are just breaking even. That is why we have to have a child tax credit that is at least $2,000 to really have an impact.  The other thing we have to do is make it refundable. What that means is it has to apply against payroll tax. Medicare, Social Security taxes--that comes from FICA; it comes immediately off your paycheck. Everybody pays that tax.  Not everybody pays income tax. If you don't make more than a certain amount of money, you don't have an income tax liability, but you are paying taxes. It is called the payroll tax. If we don't deal with that, if we don't make the child tax credit apply to that, then we are basically not cutting taxes or not helping the vast majority of people who need it. There has been some speculation that this would be too expensive and cost a lot of money. It is not true.  2, it is their money. You don't get it unless you owe it, and you don't owe it unless you are working. All we are saying is let people keep more of their money to pay for their cost of living.  By the way, they are going to have to spend that money. We know that a large number of families in this country are living beyond what they make. That is why credit card debt has risen over the last 20 years. They are going to take that money, and they are going to spend it. They are going to spend a lot of it on raising their children. They are going to spend a lot of it on the things that we talked about.  I am not saying this alone will change it, but, hopefully, the child tax credit, combined with a growing economy in which there are more jobs that pay more and prices are lower, is going to truly help people, and we have to help people in that regard. So this has to be a critical component of tax reform.  I wanted to set the stage for that, because, unfortunately, it is a complicated thing. Unfortunately, taxes are very complicated, more than they really should be.  There is going to be a lot of misinformation out there about who this actually helps and how the economy actually works. So it is really important for us to be clear and upfront about why it is that we are doing the things we are doing.  When I hear all this talk about helping millionaires and billionaires--they are probably the people who care the least about some of the tax reforms. They are going to be finding their way; they just want to know what the rules are. They just want to know what the rules are because they are going to figure it out one way or the other. If their taxes are too high, they will take their money to another country. If they are low enough, they might invest it here. Either way, they are going to be fine.  The people we really want to help are working people and small businesses, and the Tax Code is a part of that. It is not the only part of that, but it is a big part of it. That is why this has to happen. It has to happen. It has been far too long.  I want to take a step back and say that 50 years from now, when people read about this time in American history, they are going to ask themselves: What was wrong with those people? Did they not realize that all these other countries were taking their jobs, and one of the ways those jobs were leaving is that they were giving them away. They were literally inviting people to leave by acting so arrogant about themselves that they thought they could charge them anything they wanted in taxes, and they would stay. That is just not true anymore. I am not sure it ever was entirely true, but it is less true today than it ever was before.  In the end, the people who are really being hurt by this are the people whose jobs don't pay enough at a time when everything costs more.  The people who are really being hurt by this are the people who wish they[[Page S6832]]could start their own business, but they can't because they don't think they can make enough money to survive.  The people who are really being hurt by this are parents who are trying to raise their children at a time when everything costs more, but their paychecks aren't keeping pace.  The people who are really being hurt by this are the people who sit down every month, and they write down on a piece of paper: This is our budget for the month. And about 14 or 15 days into the month, something comes in the mail that they didn't expect was on its way, and all of a sudden, that whole budget gets blown out, and now they have to use a credit card to pay for it.  The people who are being hurt by this are the people whose kids are now 17 years old, and they say: I want them to go to college, but I have no idea whether they are going to be able to go. Even with financial aid, they are going to have to borrow money to go to school, and now they are in debt. Before they even vote in their first election, they already owe $10,000. We have to help them if we are going to rebuild the country's economy, and tax reform is a key part of it.  Here is my last point. There has been a lot of talk about debt--that this is going to grow the debt. That actually doesn't have to be true. If you lower the tax rate and businesses are hiring more people, creating more jobs, and growing, that is going to grow your economy. When you grow your economy, you have more taxpayers. When you have more taxpayers, you have more revenue. Even though you didn't raise the rate, you will still collect more money because even though you don't have more taxes, you have more taxpayers. That is a big chunk of this.  Just a normal, not unrealistic growth rate would more than pay for the money that people are saying we are not going to collect as a result of this. That is part one of it.  The other thing that is interesting to me is if we stood here today and said ``Let's take $1.7 trillion and spend it to build stuff that the government does,'' there would be no problem with that. That would be seen as stimulus. That is positive. That is good debt spending. But, somehow, if we say ``Let's take money and give it back to people so they can spend it themselves,'' that is bad debt. That is ridiculous.  The third thing I would say is that you are never going to tax your way out of debt anyway. Even if we tax everyone in America next year--if, for everyone in America who made $1 million next year, we confiscated every penny of it and said ``Your tax rate this year is 100 percent,'' it would not even make a dent on the debt. That is how big the debt is and how fast it is growing. So you can't tax your way out of this, and you can't just cut your way out of it, either, by the way. So the only solution to our debt long term is that you have to do two separate things, and you have to do them both.  1, you have to grow your economy. You have to. That pie has to grow. 2, the debt has to be held back so it doesn't grow as big as the economy. If you grow the economy by 4 percent and you grow the debt by 4.5 percent, then you are not going to get there. You have to do both. This is part one--grow the economy.  Part two is going to have to be to bring our spending on a sustainable path so that the growth and the benefits of the growth and the revenue from the growth aren't being taken and used to pay for even more government.  To use a best analogy, if you owe a lot of money and you only make $2,000, and next month you get paid $3,000 a month but you add $1,500 a month of expenditures, then you are still owing more money. So you have to do both. You have to generate more revenue through growth--not through more taxes--and you have to hold the long-term line on spending. This is step one of that two-step process. We have a chance to do it here before the year is out. We have to do it, and I believe we will. It will be hard. It should be hard.  I always laugh when I read these articles that say: Oh, tax reform is divisive, and people are arguing about it. They should argue about it. They don't have a lot of arguments about economic policy in China, by the way, because there is not much of an opposition, but in America, we are a republic. There are different ideas. There should be different ideas. Tax reform should be controversial. It is important. There should be debate, and there will be so we arrive at good public policy. There is nothing wrong with that. It is a good thing, not a bad thing, as long as that debate is geared toward reaching a result.  In the end, I will tell you this, if we don't do it, I actually think it will hurt our economy, not keep it the way it is. It will actually hurt it because a lot of businesses, a lot of employers, and a lot of Americans assumed that this would happen, given who won the elections in 2016. They have already made investment decisions on the assumption that some of this was going to happen. I am telling you, if it doesn't happen, the collapse of confidence will hurt the economy badly. Failing to act will actually reverse whatever gains we have already made this year on the expectation of growth and will actually shatter people's confidence in America's future.  If you are sitting there today thinking: Where am I going to open this big plant and hire 1,000 people, and you see tax reform collapse in the United States, and the people in the House, in the Senate, and in the White House are all supportive of tax reform, and you still couldn't get it done, you are going to say to yourself: Guess what; I am not going to invest in that place because even when the people who are in favor of it are in charge, they still can't get it done.  Not doing tax reform will not lead to the status quo. It will actually leave us worse off. That is why we must do it. That is why the child tax credit has to happen, by the way, because not only can we not pass it without it, but we can't justify it without it.  I am optimistic that we are going to get there. It will be a lot of work, but it will be good work. It will be the reason why so many of us are here to begin with. We come here to make a difference. We come here because we want to contribute toward making things better--not perfect, but better. This will make things better.  For all the people who complain that we spend years here and nothing ever happens, this is the chance to see something happen in our time here and be able to look back when our service here is done and say: We made a difference while we were there.  That is what we are endeavoring to do, and I am excited about the fact that I believe we are going to do it. It will be long, it will be hard, but it will be fun and it will be good for our country and for our people. If we do it right, it will be one of the most rewarding things any of us will ever do in our time here in public service.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Sullivan).

983,topic-id,1491,"Thank you, Madam  I thank the senior Senator from Florida on this issue. I want to elaborate on it a little further. Any time we ask the taxpayers of this country to step in and help a private industry, it is important and incumbent on us to justify why. The amendment he just made that we have been working to get included in what is before the Senate obviously deals with agriculture at large, and he described some of the different industries in Florida that have been hurt in agriculture and some of the crops in Florida that were impacted by the storm.  The reason I want to focus my attention on citrus is not because we don't care about the other industries that were damaged, but citrus is in a unique and precarious place. I want to describe it to people who may not be as familiar with this as those who live in Florida and see it all the time.  First, I would say that one of the signature issues in the campaign and in politics today is the desire to make more and produce more in the United States; the idea that somehow, because of these changes in the global economy, we have lost significant industries to other countries, and we talk about that primarily in manufacturing, but we also talk about it in technology and things of this nature. I don't think[[Page S6709]]we should leave agriculture out of that conversation. If we want there to be agriculture in the United States, then we have to deal with each of those crops and the unique challenges they face. We most certainly want to have agriculture in the United  A lot of people don't identify Florida as an agricultural It is better known for its tourism and being one of the largest places where people move to be in warm weather and not have State income tax, but Florida is a large agricultural I encourage people to look at the numbers. If you have spent any significant time in Florida, it is not just something we put on our license plates and not something we call ourselves in our heritage, it is real now. Tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of jobs across the supply chain and entire communities are sustained by the presence of agriculture. In the case of citrus, the overwhelming majority of growers are actually families who have had these operations for sometimes two or three generations and are trying to stay afloat.  You look at this and ask: What is this industry doing wrong to be under these circumstances? Yes, they had a storm, but why can't they rebuild like everybody else? Two things. First, citrus in Florida was already facing an extraordinary challenge. It wasn't a better orange or better grapefruit that some other countries are doing than we are. It is a disease called citrus greening that didn't just blemish the fruit the way the canker did, but it killed the trees. You have a significant number of growers who are on the borderline of being out of business because unlike--and I am not diminishing other people's losses here, on the contrary--but unlike a manufacturing plant that gets wiped out by a storm, where you put the new machine in and in 6 months you are up and running, that is not the way it works with citrus.  The time between when you plant the new tree and produce fruit is 4 to 5 years, and you have to stay afloat in between. They are already facing that. So that already has them on the brink of catastrophe, and they have been working very hard to get around and design scientific solutions. They have made some advances, thanks to the work at the University of Florida, but they are not there yet. In the process, they have been hurting already.  You heard about the production figures and how low they have gotten, and here comes the storm. The first thing it does is knock all the fruit off the trees. When we flew over these groves, all we saw on the ground was fruit all over the place. As those familiar with agriculture know, once that fruit gets in the floodwater, it can't be sold, and you can't do much with it. The fruit continued to fall over the days to come.  On top of everything else they were facing, they lost this year's crops. A lot of these fields were flooded, so they were sitting in feet of water. That kills the trees, and they will continue to lose trees in the weeks to come.  Put yourself in the position of the grower who has to say: I have already lost everything for this year. I lost a bunch of trees that I will not have next year or the year after that. I was facing citrus greening. Do I really want to replant or has the time come to sell my land for some other use, development, or has the time come for me to go into another crop or has the time come to declare bankruptcy? This is the life challenge of American agriculture families in the State of  Look, I hope very much that in November we are going to be here next month and we are going to pass a new bill and it will have this money in there and it will be fantastic, but we know how this place works, and I don't know why we wouldn't do it now. Do we truly want to keep American businesses in America? This is a great example of an opportunity to do it.  It is not an industry that benefits from anything extraordinary from the government. They are literally on the verge of going away unless we help them sooner rather than later. We have the entire Florida delegation in the House in favor of it, and they couldn't get it in the House bill. You have both Senators here for it. It can't be a part of this because if we change it, it goes back, and we lose time.  No one can tell you why it is not in there, no one can tell you why they are against it being in there, but it is not in there. Sometimes you start to wonder, and you guess why people look at this process and shake their heads.  Unfortunately, it looks like this has been foreclosed. Obviously, Senator Nelson moved forward and made that motion and it was objected to so it will not be a part of this package, but I hope we think about these men and women and families who own the groves. How do you explain it to them and what happens if it goes away? What happens if we lose this industry? It will not just hurt Florida, I think it hurts the country. I think it sets a precedent for other crops that might be threatened by floods in the future.  I hope this can be reversed, and I am hopeful we will deal with it in November, but if we don't, I just want everyone to understand what this means. This is not hyperbole. This industry is in a lot of trouble. I am not telling you that the amount of money we are asking for alone will save them, but without it, sooner rather than later, I feel we will lose not just Florida citrus, but I feel we will lose something as a key part of the State's heritage and a key crop for the country, and we will depend more than ever on foreign imports to feed our people with this problem.

She lived in my congressional district in Cathedral City, My heart breaks for her family and loved ones. She is, by far, one of the most courageous and inspiring people I have ever met. She put family, country, and community before self.  At 23, Jennifer answered the call to serve our Nation as a medic and a staff sergeant in the United States Air She served for 6 years, from 2001 to 2007, and helped save countless lives on the battlefield.  After being honorably discharged at the rank of staff sergeant, Jenn continued her life of service, helping patients in our local communities as a radiology technician at Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm  She led a healthy and full life in so many ways. Her many hobbies included CrossFit, hiking, camping with her family, quilting, and even painting.  All who met her remember her love of country, her determined spirit, her passion for serving others, and her devotion to family.  Despite her healthy lifestyle and no other risks, in 2016, Jennifer was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, a terrifying diagnosis for anyone, let alone a young mother.  After exhaustive work to investigate the potential causes of her cancer, her oncologist linked Jennifer's exposure to burn pits in Iraq as the only identifiable and plausible risk for her cancer.  Burn pits are commonly used by the military to eliminate waste in Iraq and The large burn pit at Balad Air Base in Iraq, where Jennifer was stationed for 6 months in 2006, covered 10 acres and burned over 240 tons of trash each day, including everything from computer parts, medical waste, plastics, and chemicals; some items we wouldn't allow to be burned in open air in our neighborhoods here in the United Yet, in a crowded camp of thousands, our men and women in uniform are exposed to giant plumes of black smoke.  After learning of the potential link between her exposure while she served our great Nation and her cancer, she went to the VA seeking answers and help. After being denied medical assistance and benefits from the VA initially, Jennifer reached out to the advocacy group Burn Pits 360 and my office.  Along with others, and as a team, we helped her navigate the complicated VA process, cut through the red tape, and get her the benefits that she had earned.  I visited Jennifer at her home. During our kitchen table talk, she told me about her daily struggle raising two small children while battling pancreatic cancer. She was brave and had an optimistic attitude.  She told me what it was like living every day in Iraq right next to the burn pits--the smoke, the smell, the irritated cough, and the sickness that followed.  Her main concern was to ensure her husband and children were going to be okay after she passed. Her second concern was for her fellow veterans who, like her, were exposed to burn pits. She wanted to bring awareness to what she called ``the Agent Orange of our generation.'' Imagine that. During the toughest battle of her life against an aggressive cancer, she elevated her family and fellow veterans above herself. Her advocacy was for us to prevent future exposure to burn pits and serve veterans who have already been exposed.  That is why we are here, to honor Jennifer and fight for her, her family, and fellow veterans. We must find a solution. Unfortunately, it is too late for Jennifer, but we can fight in her honor.  I was there with Jenn; her husband, Ben; children, Aida and Wyatt, at her bedside hours before she passed away, and I am honored to call Ben my friend.  On behalf of my wife, Monica, the 36th Congressional District, and our entire Nation, we join together as a community to grieve with you, Ben, little Aida and Wyatt, and to honor your wife, your mother, and the life of Jennifer We are awed and humbled by Jennifer's life of patriotism and service, and her life and her love of family.

20,topic-id,362,"Mr.President, yesterday afternoon the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office came out with a score for the bipartisan Alexander-Murray bill. The CBO report confirms that the Alexander-Murray bill is a great deal for the American people. It does precisely what it was intended to do. It stabilizes the marketplaces, helps to prevent premiums from skyrocketing, and reduces the deficit, by CBO's estimate, nearly $4 billion.  As Senators Alexander and Murray noted, the report shows that their bill ``will benefit taxpayers and low-income Americans, not insurance companies.''  Even the Wall Street Journal editorial board--no liberal cabal, that is for sure--said today: ``The bipartisan compromise proposal crafted by Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) now officially falls into the category of `so obvious it should pass immediately.' ''  That is not Chuck Schumer talking. That is not even Mitch McConnell talking--for those on the hard right who might doubt Mitch McConnell's fidelity. It is the beacon of the hard right, the Wall Street Journal editorial page.  They say, again: Alexander-Murray ``falls into the category of `so obvious it should pass immediately.'''  So, my fellow Republicans, what are you waiting for? Everyone on your side wants the bill. Jump on it. Support it. Let's get this done, and let's help stabilize our markets, whatever our views are on healthcare.  Above all, these reports should be all the evidence that President Trump needs to come off the sidelines and endorse the bill. It doesn't bail out the insurance companies; that is what he said he was worried about. It doesn't cost the government money, and, in fact, it reduces the deficit by $4 billion. So there is no good reason for President Trump to continue to obscure his position.  Leader McConnell has said he will put it on the floor if the President says he will sign it. By delaying, the President is harming healthcare markets, causing significant uncertainty, and doing nothing but hurting Americans who are trying to afford healthcare.  So, Mr.President--President Trump, not my dear friend, the Acting President pro tempore, the Senator from Alabama--President Trump, if you don't pursue this bill, the consequences will fall on your back.

48,topic-id,1536,"Mr.President, on taxes, later today, the House will likely vote on whether to pass the budget resolution that recently passed the My colleagues in the House should be aware that this budget will explode the deficit by $1.5 trillion. That is under the best of circumstances. That is under circumstances where they find $4 trillion of pay-fors. That is probably unlikely. It will slash Medicare and Medicaid by $1.5 trillion, and it will set up the same awful partisan process that caused the Republican effort on repeal and replace to fail, because when you try to do it with one party, it is fraught with peril. If you do it in a bipartisan way, a few people on either side will try to pull the bill off course but they will not succeed because they don't have the votes.  I remind my friends in the House who purport to be deficit hawks: You are voting for a budget that will increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion. Many of these House Members, particularly in the conservative wing of the caucus, particularly those in the Freedom Caucus, have spent their entire careers on the barricades, railing against the evils of deficits. What a stunning hypocrisy it would be to abandon those principles today and vote for this budget simply because it gives tax cuts to the wealthiest of Americans and the most powerful, largest of our corporations.  Now I would also remind my Republican friends in the House--particularly those in New York, New Jersey, California, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Illinois, Washington, and Minnesota--that voting for the budget today is tantamount to voting for the elimination of the State and local tax deduction, and that would sock it to the middle-class taxpayers in their States and districts. To most of our Republican friends from those States, they are blue States, but there are red districts that are suburban, well-off. They will get clobbered if they take away the State and local deduction. Those are the constituents hurt the most--not the rich and not the poor--the middle class and the upper middle class. Not only will it raise their taxes dramatically, but most people would lose deductions between $10,000 and $20,000. That ain't chickenfeed.  It would lower home prices. A recent study by the National Association of Realtors done by Pricewaterhouse Coopers, the esteemed accounting firm, showed that eliminating State and local would erode property values, the rock of the middle class, by 10 percent. To middle-class folks in New York and, I believe, around the country, their home is their piece of the rock. They struggle each month, paying the mortgage, paying the taxes, paying for the upkeep, but they are hoping that by the time they reach later middle age they will own that home, and that gives their kids a place or gives their kids a nest egg when they pass it on. But this bill, by eliminating State and local, reduces across America, on average, home values by 10 percent. So it is a double whammy to the middle class, raising their taxes and lowering their home values. Why would we do that?  You don't have to take it from me. I will tell this to my Republican colleagues. Peter King is a hard, rock-ribbed Republican who has a lot of courage and who this morning was on TV talking about investigating Hillary Clinton, but here is what he said about repealing the State and local deduction. He said that it ``will devastate my district forever.'' That is a solid middle-class and upper middle-class Republican district on Long  Here is what else Peter King said: ``How anybody from New York and New Jersey can vote for this budget without knowing what is in the tax bill is beyond me.'' He was referring to the State and local tax deductions.  I salute Peter King for telling it like it is. Having the courage to stand up and say to his own party's leadership: I will not forsake my constituents for a tax bill when I don't even know what the details will be. The remaining Members of the New York, New Jersey, California, and other delegations have[[Page S6827]]a decision to make. Will they protect the middle class and tens of thousands of homeowners in their districts or go along with the hard-right agenda that will cost their constituents hard-earned money for groceries, home repairs, and other needs, and do that all so that the very wealthy can get a huge tax break and all so that the biggest corporations which are flush with money can have even more money--wrong.  I hear on the other side that we are talking about a tax bill for the middle class. To eliminate State and local deductibility hurts the majority of middle-class people in this country. That is what will happen if they keep that in there.  Now, some will say, in the House--and I have heard one of my colleagues from New York, a Republican: Oh, that Schumer is a Democrat; he is beating up on But I went through this in 1986, the last time we had tax reform. It was the Democrats who were pushing the bill--Senator Bradley, a legend in this Chamber, and Leader Gephardt, one of the Democratic leaders in the Despite their entreaties, I told them not only would I not vote for any reform bill that had State and local deductibility in it, but I would lead the charge and round up others, and I did. I got a lot of flak from my fellow Democrats, but it was the right thing to do for my middle-class constituency in southern So when I ask our Republican colleagues to buck their leadership to help their middle-class constituents, it is something I did with the Democratic leadership the last time tax reform was on the floor.  Some are already rationalizing their vote to approve the budget by putting their hopes in the vague possibility of some kind of compromise on State and local deductibility. The harsh fact is, there is no good compromise to be had on State and local. If you want to make taxpayers choose between the mortgage deduction and the State and local, it is like asking taxpayers to decide whether they want to cut off their right arm or their left arm. Some are talking about a cap. Well, where are you going to cap it? More than 50 percent of the total value of the deduction goes to taxpayers with incomes below $200,000. Cap it too low, and almost all those middle-class taxpayers get whacked. Cap it too high, and it doesn't raise enough money to offset all the cuts my Republican friends want to give the corporations and the top 1 percent. Republicans in the House shouldn't stake the votes on the prospect of a good compromise on State and local because there is not one to be had.  The bottom line is, any Republican plan that limits SALT is the equivalent of robbing middle-class families of tax benefits and handing it over to the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations. There is no--no--compelling reason to do it. People aren't clamoring for it. We don't need to take a trillion dollars from working families and give it to millionaire CEOs, period.  If that weren't enough reason to vote no, the Republican leadership is still debating capping pretax contributions to 401(k) plans. Do you hear that, retirees and potential retirees? In their craving thirst to give the wealthiest people in America a tax break, they are going to say: You can't save money for retirement tax-free. What a gut punch to the middle class that would be. Despite the President's claims to the contrary, Representative Brady and Senator Portman have said that a 401(k) cap is still on the table.  So do you know what this bill has become? Again, in its desperation to help the wealthiest, it is like a quiz show. Which way do we hurt the middle class to pay for it? Door one is State and local deductibility. Door two is cap retirement. Who knows what they will pick in door three? It could be the mortgage deduction. Asking middle-class people to choose which poison to take so they can help the wealthiest makes no sense.  I would urge my colleagues in the House and here in the Senate: Stop doing this partisan bill that was dictated by the hard right, very wealthy individuals, very rich corporations, huge corporations. Work with us. We want to create a bipartisan bill that helps the middle class. We are for tax reform, and we can get something done.  Please stop this train in its tracks early on before it is too late and you will regret it. There are large numbers of Democrats, including this minority leader, who want to sit down with Republicans and come up with a deficit-neutral, middle-class, small business-oriented, bipartisan tax relief bill, not a plan to benefit the richest 1 percent or the largest and most powerful corporations that are already flush with cash. We want to work with our Republican colleagues on a real bipartisan deal. Defeat this budget, and we will.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-26-pt1-PgS6826-3.txt,1036,CUBAN AIRPORT SECURITY ACT OF 2017,2017.0,26.0,October

397,topic-id,1395,"Mr.President, good morning.                  Commending Senators Flake and Corker  Yesterday we all learned that our colleague Senator Flake will be retiring at the end of his term. After Senator Corker's announcement a few weeks ago, this was another blow to this body. Senators Flake and Corker are both men of principle, decency, and conscience.  In his address here on the floor shortly after his announcement, Senator Flake alluded to the great figures of history who toiled at these desks to remind us that our time here is only temporary. He is certainly right. It should comfort him, however, that history will judge Senator Flake and Senator Corker as two men of the greatest conscience to have graced this Chamber on either side of the aisle in a long time. This Senate will be much poorer for their departures.                   The Budget and Republican Tax Plan  Mr.President, last week the Senate passed one of the worst budgets in our Nation's history. It excuses one of the most massive expansions of the national debt ever--$1.5 trillion. It directs the committees to take a sledgehammer to Medicaid and Medicare, again to the tune of $1.5 trillion, and it sets up the same awful, partisan process that Republicans used to try to jam healthcare through for tax cuts.  The budget is now before the I hope every House Member is taking a close look at it, and Republican Members who come from States such as New York, New Jersey, Washington, California, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Illinois, and Minnesota should pay particular attention to the issue of State and local deductibility. There is no doubt the elimination of State and local affects States and congressional districts over the entire country.  For instance, one of the States that pays the highest rates and gets the highest tax break from State and local is Thirty-five percent of Utahns take it because it is such a large percentage tithe, and they don't use the standard deduction. It affects middle-class families in every In the State it has the lowest effect on, West Virginia, it will still affect 17 percent of families. I don't have the numbers in front of me, but my guess is that Kentucky, the home State of our Acting President pro tempore, is probably in the twenties. But in many States, the State and local deduction is claimed by over one-third of taxpayers and amounts to tens of thousands of dollars a year in deductions.  In California, 34 percent of taxpayers take the deduction for an average of $18,400. In New Jersey, 41 percent of taxpayers claim State and local with an average deduction of $17,850. Faced with this, some of our colleagues are looking for a compromise. They say: Well, let's just take away the deduction for the people who earn above $200,000, $300,000, or even $400,000. Or they say: You can choose between taking the State and local deduction or the mortgage deduction. That is like saying: Taxpayer, we will chop off your left hand or your right hand, but we will give you the choice.  Even without the mortgage trade, a compromise doesn't work. It doesn't work for a few reasons. 1, it is double taxation. You are being taxed on paying tax. 2, for States like New York, particularly my upstate colleagues, it chases away businesses. Companies don't want to locate in a place where their top executives are going to pay a lot more, because they can't deduct their taxes. 3, it lowers State income so that whether or not you use the State and local deduction, your school board, your road building, your police, and your fire departments will be hurt as they will be creating a huge deficit.  So a compromise doesn't work here. I have named some of my Republican colleagues in New One of them got very mad yesterday. All I say is this: In 1986 there was a Democratic tax reform bill led by Senator Bradley and Congressman I had the same conviction and with the same strength and velocity opposed their taking away State and local, even though they were of my own party. We worked hard and we succeeded. Tax reform passed in 1986 with Ronald Reagan's blessing. I supported it. It was real tax reform. We closed loopholes and lowered rates. We did not just give massive tax breaks and let the deficit go up. But State and local was removed, and the bill still passed.  So I would simply ask my Republican colleagues to oppose their party leadership when it hurts their States and constituencies, as I did back in 1986 when I was a fourth-term Member of  Now a few Members of the New York and New Jersey delegation--a whole bunch in New York--have come out against the elimination of State and local deductibility. I salute them. They have done what they should do. In the eyes of the Founding Fathers, they have represented their States and their constituents. They have not represented these hard-right, corporate, wealthy interests that just want their taxes reduced. Are the remaining Members of the Republican delegation from New York and New Jersey, as well as Members from Washington State, California, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Minnesota, Illinois, and all the other States going to stand up now because they know this hurts middle-class constituents? This is not a tax break for the rich. The rich have lots of other big tax breaks, and the property taxes that they pay are not that much in terms of their income. I hope they will stand up as some of my courageous colleagues have in New York State and in New  Here is another reason we don't want to eliminate the State and local deduction. A recent study by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that under the Republican tax plan, any homeowner with an income of between $50,000 and $200,000 would see an annual average increase of $815.  Here is the amazing part of their study. They say that home prices would fall 10.2 percent in the short term. That makes sense. If you are a new homeowner or buying another home, you calculate: How much is my mortgage? How much are my property taxes? What deductions will I get? If you don't get the deduction, you have less money to pay the mortgage because you are paying higher taxes. So the demand for homes goes down, the[[Page S6779]]price new home buyers are willing to pay is less, and home prices go down.  So my Republican colleagues, particularly those in the House who have to vote on this bill tomorrow, are going to hit their middle-class and upper middle class constituents with a double whammy if they vote for this bill. They will pay more taxes, their home values will go down, and home values are the rock of the middle class. That is what people work for their whole lives. The happiness someone 45 or 50 years old has when they pay off their mortgage and their home is theirs is great. Why delay that? Why impede that? Why impugn that?  Are our Republican colleagues willing to go home and explain to their middle-class constituents why their taxes are going up and their home values are going down? Because if they are not willing to confront that, they shouldn't vote for this bill.  The budget is a betrayal of the middle-class men and women who sent House Members to Congress, who sent all of us to the Senate and the For many in the middle class, as I said, it raises taxes and erodes property values. And why? To lavish tax breaks on big corporations and the superrich. Its main focus is to give a tax cut to corporations and the top 1 percent.  I would say to the average American: Is your 1 goal reducing taxes on big corporations and the richest people in America? Well, that is the Republican Party's 1 goal. They say they must have tax reform. It is their 1 priority. And this bill, the core of it, the raison d'etre for it, is to cut taxes on big corporations and the wealthiest people.  Again, to the American people: Is your 1 goal the same as the Republican Party's here in the Senate and in the House--to cut taxes on the richest corporations, to cut taxes on the wealthiest individuals? I don't think so. Do you, ",CREC-2017-10-25-pt1-PgS6777-7.txt,1036,CUBAN AIRPORT SECURITY ACT OF 2017,2017.0,25.0,October

627,topic-id,1570,"Mr.President, I want to first thank my colleagues, particularly Sherrod Brown, our ranking member of the committee, Senators Whitehouse, Blumenthal, Franken, and so many others who have spoken so eloquently on this issue. I don't think it is a coincidence that many Members on our side have spoken and very few on the other side. Once again, it is one of those instances where the powerful will get more powerful. Everyone knows it, and people are not out there beating their breasts about this if they are trying to support it, and maybe there is a little bit of being ashamed.  This is what has happened here. We finally have an agency to protect the consumers against large institutions, most of which are good institutions, but some of which typically take advantage of the average person. They do it in a whole variety of ways. We saw with Equifax the idea that they didn't have to protect people's information and were almost nonchalant about it. We saw it with Wells Fargo, where people came up with a scheme. We see it all the time. The average consumer doesn't have the lawyers, the time, and the ability to study what is happening. They don't understand the long contracts where they sign away their rights to go to court. They need a bank account. They need a car loan. They need something, and, yes, their only recourse in this case may be a class action suit, particularly if it is $20 or $30. You are not going to go to court individually, but if it is thousands of people, a trial lawyer will make some money, yes, to protect those people. How horrible that people might have the ability to come together and hire a lawyer.  What is happening in the last 9 months is that--we have a lot of people who are disaffected. Many of the campaigns, including President Trump's campaign, understood that. But when President Trump campaigned, he campaigned as a populist against the powerful institutions, against the Washington lobbyists, and said: Let's do something for average people. But once he got into office, he embraced the hard right, whose goal in most cases is to just protect the powerful. They got this sort of drumbeat going on: Poor innocent people have too much power, and big banks and big corporations don't have enough. Let's go after unions, even though incomes are down and only 6 percent of private America is unionized. Let's go after them. They are too powerful. They make these big corporations squirm or pay a little more money to people or pay a benefit or pay some healthcare--how horrible. Let's go after the trial lawyers. I don't always agree with their tactics. I voted against them on occasion. But let's go after them, even though they are one of the few recourses that average people have. That is hardly as reprehensible as an Equifax or a Wells Fargo in doing what they do. But people on the other side somehow have this mythology because of the hard right and its machine and their think tanks and their media messaging--FOX News--that somehow the powerful are getting a bad break in America and the average person has too much power.  What is wrong?  I will say this. It is going to lead to people being even more disillusioned, more angry, more sour, and we will move further away from what the American dream, ideal, and optimism are.  Our colleagues on the other side, my dear friends--I like them, I really do--wittingly or unwittingly are part of this movement, and it is a shame. It is a shame.  Community banks aren't beleaguered by these cases. They don't usually do this stuff. When I talked to community bankers who lobbied me on this, they basically said to me: No, we are with the whole banking association. The big banks want this.  This is not little banks. These are the Wells Fargos and the We shouldn't do it. We shouldn't do it.  I worry about this country. I love this country. It has been so good to me, my family, and my people. I still believe to this day that it is what the Founding Fathers called it when they left Constitution Hall--God's noble experiment.  We are one nation under God, noble. We are a noble country. No one has had the ideals we have had for hundreds of years. We are an experiment. We keep evolving, changing, and adapting, as we should. But when I see what has gone on in the last 9 months--a combination of the President's appeal to lower instincts of people, to divisive instincts, and the hard right machine, which has too much power on the other side of the aisle--I worry. I worry. I worry about the country. I worry about our standards of decency and honor.  Everyone heard Senator Flake speak today. It moved all of us. It is a shame he is leaving this body because he has been a voice and a beacon. I didn't agree with him on most issues, as is pretty obvious by our voting records, but he stood for the right thing. I say to my colleagues, somehow we are doing too many wrong things around here. We are trying to take away people's healthcare. We say we want better healthcare at lower costs. That is what the President says, but we put a bill on the floor that does the opposite. We know it. We are doing it on taxes. We say we want to help the middle class, and the tax bill dominantly helps the wealthy.  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are afraid to say they are helping the wealthiest because they think that is the way to create jobs because they know that Americans don't believe it--nor should they.  Most recently, the great Kansas experiment, the Koch brothers' own laboratory, totally flopped.  They say unions have too much power, and yet incomes in the middle class have declined. There are abuses. There are abuses everywhere, but middle-class incomes decline, fewer people have bargaining power, more people are paid lower, and there are 7 million fewer good-paying jobs in America today than 15 years ago. In part, that is because we don't have unions and because the hard right has learned through legal tactics to destroy them, and now with government legal tactics on the absurd argument that the First Amendment says you don't have to join a union or pay dues to a union.  This is just one of many issues where once again we are helping the powerful against the powerless. There is a political benefit, I understand. There is a fear if you go against these hard-right forces. I have heard it from my colleagues, but it is wrong for the country. I wish that maybe a bell would ring. There are lots of issues we don't agree on, but some of these issues don't have a basis in fact. That is why the floor is empty on the other side.  I respect my dear friend. He is a good, good man, in the Flake mold. He has to be here all night and defend it. He doesn't have too many others backing him up, and I think I know why, because deep down they know it is wrong. They can figure out that there is an abuse of trial lawyers, but they still know it is wrong. They still know it is wrong.  To sum it up, a ``yes'' vote is handing a ``get out of jail free'' card or the equivalent to Wells Fargo and It is that simple. A ``yes'' vote is saying you believe that Americans who get taken advantage of don't have the right to seek recourse. A ``yes'' vote tells rapacious financial institutions that they can continue to hose consumers without any serious consequences or accountability, because we all know that average folks don't have the ability to go to court on their own to sue. We know that. Everyone knows that.  If there are abuses, let's fix them, but don't totally denude people who don't have much power from the little power they might have through going to court. I hope that maybe there is somebody, because the vote is close. It took a long time to bring this resolution to the floor because there were some people who wanted to stand up, but they[[Page S6755]]got ground down by this hard right machine that always wants its way.  They are doing great. Corporate America is making more money than ever before. Financial institutions are healthier than ever before, but it is not good enough. More--we want more. The ``more'' is fine if it didn't come at the expense of average folks when somebody is abusive.  The CRA is a meat-cleaver approach. Those who have issues with this should try to address them with a scalpel, not a bludgeon. I urge my colleagues one final time, those on the other side of the aisle, to vote no on this disapproval resolution on behalf of our constituents, who deserve to have more rights when standing up to the powerful when they are right, not less.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

She has seen the damage and is working so hard to help the people of her  So we are going to talk about wildfires, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin First, we can't forget about the 3.5 million American citizens in Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands, who continue to suffer the terrible effects of Hurricane Maria, the strongest storm to hit the island in a century. It has been more than a month since Maria, and 75 percent of Puerto Rico is still without electricity, only a third of the island's cell sites are functional, and many who have diseases like diabetes and other diseases or who are in need of dialysis have been unable to receive their specialized treatments and medication.  One million Americans in Puerto Rico are suffering without access to clean water. We have seen the pictures of them drinking sewage and water from Superfund sites. I read this report that they have accidentally used wells located in one of the most contaminated Superfund sites, Dorado, to get water, because they are so desperate.  I have called on the White House to put a point person in charge of the recovery, and I repeat that request today. The administration should appoint a CEO for response and recovery for Puerto Rico, someone with the ability to bring all the necessary Federal agencies together, cut redtape on the public and private side, turn the lights back on, get clean water flowing, and help bring recovery. It is a national tragedy that deserves the most organized and efficient response. A CEO for response and recovery with a direct line to the President in the White House would help get the house in order.  Now, at the same time, we can't forget the devastation brought by wildfires out A group of Senators will be speaking on the floor today--my colleague from California is about to do just that--in support of swift passage of disaster aid for those regions, and I wholly support the effort.  As the number of forest fires and the cost of fighting these fires has risen dramatically, it has left the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior at a severe funding deficit. This has forced the Forest Service to take money from other accounts within the agency to cover the firefighting deficit, in a process called fire borrowing. Fire borrowing prevents the agency from carrying out its other missions, including investing in forest fire prevention.  As we have seen, the terrible forest fires rage across the West, hitting so hard the State of California, which my colleague is going to address. We must take action and provide the Forest Service with a long-term wildfire funding fix.  Some Members want to bog down this process with environmental and forest management riders, but I stand with Secretary of Agriculture Perdue and others who have called to simply fix the funding problem, without riders, to allow the agency to carry on its mission.

It now has 12 Republican cosponsors and 12 Democratic cosponsors. That is as bipartisan as it gets. I believe all 48 Members of my caucus will support the agreement, which means it has the necessary 60 votes. Even Leader McConnell has made it clear that he will put the Alexander-Murray bill on the floor as soon as President Trump supports it.  Let me make a direct appeal to the  Mr.President, come out and support the Alexander-Murray bill. You called it ``a very good solution'' already. Announce that you will support it, and it will pass through the Senate soon after.  The President's only stated concern was that the Alexander-Murray bill ``bails out insurance companies.'' I can assure the President that Senators Alexander and Murray took great pains to make sure the insurance companies would not get one extra penny from this deal. I have read the language. I have worked with them. It is good. It is strong. They have included provisions in the bill to prevent insurance companies from double dipping on the cost-sharing program and ensure that the money goes precisely where it is intended: to keep premiums and other out-of-pocket costs down for low-income  If the President wants even greater assurances, we can work to move back the start of enrollment 1 month. He may be able to do that administratively, but if not, that is something both Senator Alexander and Senator Murray wanted to do, which would ensure that there would be new applications, and the rates would be looked at as if cost sharing were happening, but the White House blocked it. If the White House and the President want to make it even stronger--I think it is strong enough already--then we can do that. From what I understand, the President might be able to do that administratively.  This idea that the President isn't supporting this because he doesn't want the insurance companies to make money on this--well, it is wrong. There is some other reason he doesn't want it done. Maybe he doesn't want a bipartisan bill. Maybe it is because he wasn't involved. Maybe it is because on issue after issue the hard-right Freedom Caucus people say don't do it, and he is afraid, because he is not showing much leadership when they stand up to him.  The only reason the President shouldn't support this bill is that he wants to continue intentionally hurting He has talked about that. He almost seems gleeful: ObamaCare will fail--even though he is trying to make it fail.[[Page S6706]]  The President should know that premiums have shot up 30 percent in Pennsylvania because of the President's decision to end cost sharing. Premiums for silver plans will rise 20 to 25 percent if cost sharing is not restored. It is time for the President to stop the sabotage. He created the problem by for the first time not renewing cost-sharing payments. Now we have a solution that will renew them, but Democrats will have to give. Copper plans have never been our favorite. He should go along with the good compromise.  The President has told me repeatedly that he wants to work in a bipartisan way. He told me that he wants to work in a bipartisan way on healthcare. Well, on this one, I am from Shows us. Show me.  It is time, Mr.President, to turn the page on healthcare and pass the Alexander-Murray bill. We have other pressing healthcare issues to grapple with. For the first time in history, again due to lack of leadership from that White House, the authorization for the Children's Health Insurance Program has expired. That must be reauthorized, too, and soon. Kids across America are depending on it.  President Trump, please stop the games. Stop the zigging and zagging. You are for it one day and against it the next. Stop coming up with fake excuses. Declare your support for this bill so we can move forward in a bipartisan way to improve our Nation's healthcare.                       The Budget and Tax Reform  Now, Mr.President, on taxes, last week the Republican majority jammed through one of the worst budgets in history. That is not hyperbole; this is one of the worst budgets in history. They should hang their heads in shame. It increases the deficit by $1.5 trillion, slashes Medicare and Medicaid by $1.5 trillion, and sets up the same partisan process the Republicans used for healthcare.  Now it goes to the House for their approval, where many conservative House Republicans will have to rationalize voting for a bill that dramatically increases deficits. For many in the conservative wing of the House Republican caucus, the debt and deficit have been their 1 focus in Congress, their raison d'etre. Many campaigned on the singular promise--made with almost religious fervor--to lower our Nation's debt and deficit. They rhapsodize fiscal responsibility. They hold themselves up as the guardian of preventing the debt from being passed on to our grandchildren. They evangelize constitutional amendments requiring a balanced budget. They were willing to risk default on our Nation's credit for a spurious talking point.  The budget resolution will be a true test of the principles the Freedom Caucus and the hard right in the House have espoused about the evils of deficits for the better part of the last decade, because those same Members of the Freedom Caucus must now vote to approve a budget that increases the deficit by $1.5 trillion. The House bill didn't do that. The Senate bill clearly does. Yet, so far, we haven't heard a peep from the Freedom The most scolding deficit hawks have morphed into deficit doves, eschewing principle for political expediency.  With respect to the deficit, any economist will tell you that a dollar less in revenue due to a tax cut is the same as a dollar less in spending. Yet the Freedom Caucus and deficit hawks only harp on the deficit when it is about spending cuts: Get rid of Get rid of Slash them--programs every bit as popular and as important as any.  As Representative Walker, a conservative of the House, lamented, ``[The deficit] is a great talking point when you have an administration that's Democratic-led. It's a little different now that Republicans have both houses and the administration.'' Really? So you are a deficit hawk only when it is politically expedient, Representative Walker?  Well, the Freedom Caucus still has a chance to change the course of their budget when we vote this week. When the Freedom Caucus came out against the Republican healthcare bill, the Republican majority was forced to make concessions to them. If they were real deficit hawks, honest deficit hawks, consistent deficit hawks, nonpolitical deficit hawks, they would do the same thing here.  Let's see how Representative Walker and his fellow Members of the House Freedom Caucus vote on a GOP budget to increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion.  Another point on the GOP tax plan. The Republicans are so wedded to their desire to give a massive tax break to big corporations and the superrich--which will blow up the deficit even in their fake math models--that they are searching for new ways to sock it to the middle class to make up the difference.  First, Republicans debated eliminating the mortgage deduction, then they included the provision to eliminate State and local deductibility, and recently there have been reports that some Republicans want to cap Americans' pretax contributions to their 401(k)s. That is one of the few provisions we have to encourage middle-class families to start saving for an early retirement. President Trump tweeted this morning that we are not going down that road. The fact that Republicans were even considering raiding American's retirement savings to pay for giant tax cuts for corporations shows just how backward their plan is.  The Tax Policy Center estimated that while the wealthiest 1 percent of America would reap 80 percent of the benefits under the GOP plan, it would also raise taxes on nearly a third of middle-class workers. That statistic reveals the rotten core at the center of this tax plan: The Republicans are so eager to give tax cuts to the rich, they are willing to explore many different ways of raising taxes on the middle class to pay for them. Each time, they bring up different methods--mortgage interest deductions, State and local deductibility, capping pretax 401(k)s--and then back off when they see the political and popular cost to each proposal. That shows you the dilemma they are in.  The fact is, there is no way the Republicans can avoid raising taxes on a good number of middle-class families if they are going to cling to such massive tax cuts for the rich and powerful and still make the numbers work, even with fake math.  Instead of capping middle-class deductions or pilfering retirement savings, how about Republicans drop their proposal to repeal the estate tax? Repealing the estate tax would cost the government hundreds of billions. Why are Republicans looking at middle-class deductions instead of merely scrapping the estate tax repeal, which goes only to estates of over $5 million--only to estates over $5 million. The number who benefit is tiny. It is in the thousands. Their estates get huge, huge benefits. Get rid of that instead of hurting the middle class. The logic is confounding, and our Republican colleagues will not even talk about it.  This plan is so rotten at its core that it has our Republican colleagues turning themselves into pretzels and jumping through hoops, and they can't really say what they believe--trickle down works. The only rationale for this entire plan is that if you give tax breaks to the wealthy and the big corporations, there will be a lot of job growth. It didn't happen when George Bush's tax cuts occurred. It didn't happen when Kansas dramatically cut its taxes. The Koch brothers' center, Kansas--they did just what the Koch brothers wanted. It was a disaster. Growth was much less than the national average even though the taxes were slashed. Although they don't state it, it is contrary to what our Republican colleagues believe.  I respect the Republican Member who comes up and says: Trickle down works; that is why we are doing it. Tax cuts for the very wealthy is what would fuel the economy.  No one else believes it anymore. History disproves it. It is fake. It is a fig leaf so that they don't have to admit what they want to do--give huge tax cuts to the wealthiest of their contributors, the people who have sort of set up the sinew of this Republican Party with their think tanks and op-eds and so many other things, the Koch brothers network.  The American people should know that the money to pay for that giant tax cut for the rich is coming from somewhere, and it is likely to be coming from their pocketbooks.[[Page S6707]]                 Steel and Aluminum Imports Investigations  Finally, one final topic: steel and aluminum. Recently and shockingly, Commerce Secretary Ross has said he is waiting for the Republican tax plan before completing critical investigations into how steel and aluminum imports are impacting the capacity of steel and aluminum U.producers to supply our defense needs. I am not sure why the Republican tax plan has anything to do with this national security investigation, which could finally lead to some relief from the predatory trade practices from China and other countries. The two are entirely unrelated.  Secretary Ross's comments smell like an excuse for further delays--and a bad one at that. I would like to see him explain his decision to the thousands of steelworkers whose jobs are on the line because their companies aren't competing on a level playing field because China repeatedly subsidizes, doesn't play by the rules, and cheats.  It is another classic example of the Trump administration promising one thing and doing another. President Trump has promised many times to crack down on China, and still, 10 months into his administration, his Commerce Secretary is once again needlessly delaying a preliminary step in that effort.  I have known him for 30 years. He is a New Yorker like I am. Every time I see Secretary Ross, I say to him: When are we going to do something on China?  Oh, we are going to do something tough.  Each time, there is a different excuse. This should have happened in the first 2 months of the administration. It hasn't.  Because of the Republican inaction, because of the President's unfulfilled and rapidly becoming broken promise on being tough with China, Senate Democrats will be sending a letter to President Trump and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross demanding that the administration keep its promise to crack down on China's unfair and predatory trade practices. We are asking that they continue these investigations and expeditiously complete them. These trade investigations have nothing to do with tax reform, and there is no need to delay them.  One more thing on Today I read that Tesla--our great car manufacturing company--will be relocating to  When you want to sell cars and many other advanced products in China, you have to do one of two things: set up a joint ownership company which lets them steal our intellectual property or face huge tariffs. That is based on the fact that the WTO was poorly negotiated and China was regarded as a developing country. That was the fault of President Bush and President Obama; neither did enough to stop  Based on his campaign rhetoric, one would think President Trump would be tougher as China steals our family jewels. It is no longer clothing and furniture; it is our best industries. They steal our intellectual property by these joint ventures. Sometimes they do it by cyber theft--a lot of times they do it by cyber theft--and it is hurting the good-paying jobs that might be available to our children and grandchildren. Based on campaign rhetoric, one would think President Trump would be tougher on China, but so far it has been a lot of talk and not very much action, and the delay in these investigations is another example.

1071,topic-id,1095,"Probably most of all, when we talk about the President, it is time to stop tweeting and start leading on taxes. Mr.President, it is time to start really engaging with the substance of the tax plan that your staff and congressional Republicans have put together because, Mr.President, your rhetoric does not match the reality on the tax bill.  The President has been selling his tax plan as a boon for the middle class. He told a group of truckers earlier this month that his tax plan is ``a middle-class bill.'' He said: ``The biggest winners will be everyday American workers.'' In his words, the Republican tax plan would bring about a ``middle-class miracle.''  President Trump, I urge you to look closely at the tax plan that your staff and congressional Republicans have put together. Ask the advisers around you what about this tax plan benefits the middle class and the everyday American worker more than the wealthy and the powerful, because trickle-down, if that is the only thing that benefits the middle class in your thinking, doesn't work. No one believes in trickle-down anymore except a small group of very wealthy business people who have undue influence on the Republican Party and, I hope, not on you, Mr. Let's look at this plan that supposedly is a middle-class plan. It repeals the estate tax. That applies to a small number of families with estates over $5 million. It lowers the rate on passthrough entities. That benefits wealthy law firms and hedge fund managers so they can pay less in taxes than the average citizen. It lowers the top rate while raising the bottom one. The cut in the corporate rate would hardly help the American worker. This is trickle-down. Our Republican colleagues don't talk about trickle-down because they know most of America doesn't believe in it.  Our corporations are flush with cash already. They are flush with cash. Giving them more cash is not going to change their behavior. What are they doing with this cash? Most of the large corporations are not creating jobs with the cash they now have. Stock dividends, stock buybacks, dividends, increases in CEO salaries--that is where it goes. So this bill is not a middle-class bill. I believe the President believes it is. You have to read it. No more tweeting, no more superficiality--read the bill. Don't let your advisers just walk in and say: Mr.President, it is a great, middle-class bill, and you just let them go by.  It has already been shown--not just by me but by many others--that Mnuchin and Cohen don't tell the truth about this bill, and they know better. The Tax Policy Center said that the top 1 percent of our country will reap 80 percent of the benefits from this plan. They also said, Mr.President, that it is a middle-class bill. According to the Tax Policy Center--no one has disputed it--a third of all middle-class taxpayers will see their taxes go up. Is that a middle-class tax bill, Mr.President, one in which taxes go up, not down, on nearly 30 percent of middle-class taxpayers?[[Page S6721]]  Now, if this is such a middle-class tax plan, then, why do Republicans here on the Hill keep floating new middle-class deductions to cut--the very deductions on which the middle class depends. First, it was the mortgage deduction and, then, the elimination of State and local deductibility, which made it into the plan. Now they are even talking about capping pretax contributions to 401(k) plans.  There are such huge tax breaks for the wealthy and such a huge deficit hole that the tax writers have no choice but to raise taxes on the middle class and cut deductions. Even the great doubling of the standard deduction, Mr.President, is undone by the elimination of the personal deduction. If you are a family of three, you break even. If you are a family of four, you lose money even before they cut the other deductions.  Now, on State and local, in many Republican districts in the House, in many of our Republican colleagues' States, over 30 percent--certainly, 20 percent, and the lowest number is 17--of taxpayers would use that deduction. Eliminating the State and local deduction is a dagger to the heart of the middle class, Mr.You should tell your tax writers in the House and Senate to take it out of the bill.  Here is what PricewaterhouseCoopers just found out. Home values would go down 10 percent if we eliminated the State and local deduction. Homes are the piece of the rock for the middle class. People wait and struggle and pay every month so they can own their own home free and clear, and then that value declines because we eliminated State and local deductibility. Every homeowner is affected, even those who take the standard deduction.  If this were such a middle-class plan, I would say this to the President: Why wouldn't Republicans on the Hill scrap the repeal of the estate tax, which only benefits the very rich--not one drop goes to the middle class--instead of looking for more middle-class deductions, like the 401(k), to reduce or eliminate?  President Trump says he wants to do a middle-class bill, but if the only benefit to the middle class is this trickle-down theory, it is not a middle-class bill at all.  We Democrats have said all along that we want to update our Tax Code to provide middle-class tax relief. My caucus wants to provide tax relief to small businesses, not to big corporations. They are the ones that need the money to create jobs, not the big corporations who are flush with money.  Incidentally, as for AT&T, which is leading the charge for this tax cut, their average tax rate over the last 10 years was 8 percent, and they eliminated 80,000 jobs. So much for the idea that when you pay a low tax rate you are creating jobs.  So we offer this to the President: Come work with Democrats on a real middle-class tax bill. The plan your advisers put together with Republicans on the Hill doesn't do what you say it does. We can put together a tax bill in a bipartisan way that actually gets the job done for the middle class and that tells the rich corporate leaders and financiers that they shouldn't be in control of the bill, which they are now, and you, Mr.President, are going along wittingly or unwittingly. Either way is no good for you, no good for your party, and no good, most of all, for                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-24-pt1-PgS6720-6.txt,1036,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,24.0,October

Why not say, as he has said in the past, that he supports Senator Alexander's work? I believe many more Republican Senators want to sign their name onto this bill, but they are waiting to hear definitively from the President before they announce their support.

This is a bipartisan agreement. I applaud the work of Senator Alexander and Senator Patty Murray to craft this bipartisan agreement to address the challenges we have in the short term with healthcare. Senators Alexander and Murray have given us a template for bipartisan negotiations not just on healthcare but on other critical matters that are going to come before this Senate--tax reform, reauthorizing community health centers and the Children's Health Insurance[[Page S6785]]Program, reaching an agreement on the 2018 budget. These are all major issues facing this country and issues we should be working on in a bipartisan way. The Senate is at its best when we observe regular order and we follow the committee process, when we work across the aisle and make principled compromises to get things done for the American people. I believe that is exactly what this health insurance bill does.  In a Senate that is nearly equally divided between Republicans and Democrats, this is the only productive way forward for us to address the challenges that face this country. Too often we have seen people use bipartisan negotiations as a last resort, but bipartisanship should be the Senate's first resort, not the last resort. It should be the foundation of our work in this body. This is how the great majority of Americans want us to conduct the Senate's business.  When I travel around New Hampshire, this is the consistent comment I hear everywhere I go: Why can't you all work together to get things done for this country? This is especially true on matters like healthcare and tax reform, which affect families throughout the country.  I am encouraged that the Alexander-Murray bill has earned strong bipartisan support and, as Senator Alexander said, has 24 original cosponsors. That number is equally divided between Republicans and This is a balanced agreement that has been negotiated by both parties over many months, and I think it is our best bet for stabilizing marketplaces in the short run so we can continue to work on long-term issues around healthcare.  I am especially pleased this agreement provides for the continuation of cost-sharing reduction payments for 2 years. These payments are necessary to keep premiums, deductibles, and copayments affordable for working people. Without these payments, the cost of coverage will skyrocket, insurers will leave the marketplaces, and millions of people will lose their healthcare coverage. I have been working on this issue of cost-saving reduction payments since earlier this year, when I introduced a bill that would permanently appropriate funds for the  As the CBO said, the language in the Alexander-Murray bill ensures that these CSRs are not a bailout to insurance companies, but they are a way to help people with the cost of insurance. They are orderly payments that are built into the law that will go directly to keeping premiums, copays, and deductibles affordable for lower income Both Democrats and Republicans recognize that these payments are an orderly, necessary subsidy that keeps down the cost of health coverage for everyday As Senator Alexander said, we saw that these payments were in the bill the House voted for around healthcare, and they were also in the Senate bill earlier this year.  In recent months, I have heard from hundreds of people across New Hampshire about the enormous difference healthcare reform has made in their lives. We are a small State; we have just about 1.3 million people. Nearly 94,000 Granite Staters have gotten individual healthcare coverage through the marketplaces. Nearly 50,000 have gotten coverage thanks to the Medicaid expansion program in New That has been a bipartisan effort, with a Republican legislature and a Democratic Governor, to get that program in place, and it continues to enjoy the support of the Republican legislature and the Republican  Because of the Affordable Care Act's increased access to care, we also have 11,000 Granite Staters who have substance use disorders and who have been able to get treatment for the first time. New Hampshire has the second highest rate of overdose deaths from the heroin and opioid epidemic. Having treatment available through the expanded Medicaid Program has made a difference for thousands of people in New Hampshire and their families. Hundreds of thousands of Granite Staters with preexisting conditions no longer face discrimination resulting in denial or sky-high premiums. These are important achievements, and this legislation will allow us to continue down that road to make sure people have healthcare coverage they can afford.  For people across New Hampshire and across this country, healthcare coverage is often a matter of life or death. It is about being able to take a sick family member to a doctor. It is about knowing that a serious illness will not leave a mountain of debt.  I am very pleased to be able to join in the bipartisan efforts led by Senators Alexander and Murray to strengthen the parts of the healthcare law that are working and to fix what is not working. The other provisions in this legislation will allow States more flexibility through the 1332 waiver process. The Alexander-Murray agreement expedites waiver approval so States can implement smart fixes to stabilize their marketplaces, for instance, by establishing a State-based reinsurance program. The agreement also includes a restoration of funding for open enrollment outreach in educational activities, and it protects four protections related to insurance affordability, coverage, and plan comprehensiveness. All of these changes are positive steps forward, steps that I hope will set us on a bipartisan path, strengthening elements of the Affordable Care Act that are working well and fixing elements that need to be changed.  I am hopeful the Alexander-Murray agreement can gain the bipartisan support it needs to pass in Congress, that it can gain the President's signature, and I am encouraged by Senator Alexander's comments about the President's comments yesterday because we need to restore certainty and stability to the marketplaces. Instead of partisan efforts to undermine the law and take health insurance away from people, we should embrace the spirit of the Alexander-Murray agreement. Let's work together in a good-faith, bipartisan effort to build a healthcare system that leaves no American behind.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.

Over 2 days of battle, Private First Class McCloughan put himself in danger time and again in order to rescue his fallen brothers.  His head and arm were bloodied by shrapnel and small-arms fire; yet he refused to stop. When the battle was over, he had saved the lives of 10 members of his company.  Private First Class McCloughan received the Combat Medical Badge, two Purple Hearts, two Bronze Stars with ``V'' device for valor, and the U.Army Valorous Unit Citation, among other awards. He was a hero in every sense of the word. However, he remained focused on only one thing: how he could best serve others. That is just what he did.  Jim McCloughan returned home and taught and coached at South Haven High School until retiring in 2008. That might have been where his story ended had it not been for his one-time platoon leader, LT Randall  Lieutenant Clark never forgot about Private First Class McCloughan's heroism and worked tirelessly to get him the recognition he had earned.

With yearly salaries of over $1.4 billion, these facilities represent one of our State's most significant manufacturing sectors.  Paper and forest products play a vital role in our domestic economy and benefit every American as they go about their daily lives. Additionally, wood construction is an innovative form of climate protection because wood oftentimes replaces competing building materials that require sizeable amounts of fossil fuels to produce. Moreover, wood lowers a building's carbon footprint because it continues to hold carbon absorbed during the growth of the tree, keeping that pollution out of the atmosphere for the life expectancy of the building. As we look to reduce carbon emissions and green our building stock, we ought to look at greater use of innovative wood products in commercial structures.  Similarly, paper and packaging products help all Americans to communicate with each other, teach our kids, and learn new things ourselves. These products preserve and deliver our food, medicine, and other manufactured goods. Whether it is a marriage certificate or a young child's finger painting, these paper products capture some of the most important moments in a person's life.

74,topic-id,612,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman for bringing up H.469, which includes, as indicated, the text of my bill, the Judgment Fund Transparency  The purpose of this act is really very simple. Actually, contrary to previous arguments, the rule of this and the intent of this is so simple. It is simply for government transparency. This bill will go a long way in providing our constituents and taxpayers a better idea of how their tax dollars are spent.  Now, heaven knows, and for heaven's sake, those of us here, we certainly know, the Federal Government isn't perfect. It is prone to errors that can cause harm to individuals or organizations from time to time, and when these errors are particularly egregious, the government is sued and damages are awarded to those who are harmed.  Early on, in fact, this Congress spent a large part of its time doing nothing but sorting through claims and making appropriations to pay those claims. In fact, not even 100 years ago, much of this body's work consumed only that topic, and it wasn't until 1956 that Congress established the Judgment Fund and gave authority to the Treasury Department to resolve these claims in ``a permanent and definite appropriation.'' That simply has been abused.  In keeping with the law's requirement to report on the fund from time to time, the Treasury Department files a yearly report of the Judgment Fund with Congress, and also maintains a web page that can be searched.  Now, this sounds good. Right? But the cryptic and otherwise limited information related to each payout has made the database almost entirely worthless. There is no information on what the government did wrong. There is no information on the claimant. In fact, journalists and transparency groups revealed in the last few months that from 2009 to 2015, the government paid out more than $25 million to unnamed or redacted recipients. A $25 million secret. We don't know who was paid, we don't know why they were paid, and, in some circumstances, we don't know how much they were paid.  Now, we are all familiar with the previous administration's decision to take $1.3 billion out of the fund, convert it to cash, and deliver it to Iran, yet this isn't the only egregious use of this fund.  Three years ago, The New York Times reported on what was likely an illegal billion-dollar payout to thousands of farmers who had never even sued the government. This isn't just unacceptable, it is crazy. It is horrible government. It is the type of thing that makes people resent the Federal  This bill aims to clarify and to reduce that. It aims to clean up the ambiguity that exists between the current law and provide much-needed transparency. It would require the Treasury to make public any payment from the Judgment Fund and to include very simple things that common sense would surely demand: the name of the agency named in the judgment, the name of the plaintiff, the amount they were paid, any other fees such as attorneys' fees or interest, and then finally a brief description of the facts which led to the claim.  The Judgment Fund Transparency Act may not prevent bad decisions by all government employees or government agencies, but it will shine a light on those decisions to the American people. This is about helping to increase the amount of trust between the American people and a government that they simply don't trust. We give them reasons not to trust us.

732,topic-id,1186,"Madam President, I wanted to reinforce and underscore some of the comments made by my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Lankford, on what is happening in the Senate right now. It is actually really important for the American people to understand what is going on. Maybe we would finally get the press, who sit up there above your chair, Madam President, to write about this topic.  Right now, we are debating a very well-qualified district court judge nominee--a Federal district court judge nominee from Senator Lankford was down here, and he obviously knows the nominee, Scott He is so qualified that the vote for cloture to move forward on this nominee--who, by the way, was nominated by President Trump for a Federal district court position but was previously nominated by President Obama with fairly bipartisan support--was 79 to 18. That is really strong bipartisan support. It just happened about an hour ago on the Senate floor.  So what are we doing? Well, we are still going to be debating for 30 hours. We are not really debating the nominee because he is well qualified. That is what we are doing in the Senate, supposedly. Anyone watching, you know we are not debating him because he is very well qualified, but we are still going to burn 30 hours. Why is this? Well, this raises a much broader issue of the tactics that are happening on the Senate floor right now. The minority leader and his colleagues will not come down and explain what they are up to.  I gave a speech on this a couple of weeks ago, and I just asked: Come on down. Let the American people understand why we are spending all this time on nominees who are very well qualified and have enormous bipartisan support. Why are we being required to go an additional 30 hours? Those are the rules, but normally there would be unanimous consent to move forward. What is happening now hasn't been explained, but it definitely hurts the American people, whether you are a Democrat or What is happening now is, every single nominee from the Trump administration, whether Federal judge or Assistant Secretary for Health and Human Services, is being delayed. Here are the numbers. Eight years ago, President Obama had about 66 percent of his nominees confirmed at this period in the fall of his first term. People were working through them. If you didn't like the nominee, you would just vote against them, but you wouldn't say we are going to burn half the week of the Senate to debate somebody who is not even controversial. This judge, when we finally get through the 30 hours, is going to pass with 80 Senate votes, but we are burning through it anyway. President Obama, 8 years ago, had 66 percent confirmed. The number for President Trump 8 years later is 33 percent. Imagine our friends in the media--the New York Times--if Republicans were doing this to President Obama during his first few months in office. There would be front-page stories every day. The Republican Party is trying to undermine the new President--delaying, delaying, delaying. You don't hear a peep from our national press. They don't write about it.  It is a problem because we have work to do in this country. I have asked the minority leader to just come down and tell the American people why you are doing this. We have had numerous judges, very noncontroversial, very bipartisan, where we essentially spent the whole week ``debating'' them. We are not debating this judge, but we are going to spend 30 hours on him.  Why are they doing that? And why are my colleagues on the other side of the aisle agreeing to it? I asked them to come on down and explain it to the American people, the people watching on TV or in the Why are you doing this? Does it help the country? Whether you are a Democrat or Republican, it doesn't help the country. That is the whole point, but nobody wants to come down and explain their delay tactics. The press will not write about it because some of them like it, I think.  Here is the truth. When we are spending all this time all week on this judge who will get voted on--and he will pass because he is very well qualified. Senator Lankford laid out his resume. He was previously nominated by President We are going to vote for him after this 30-hour period, and he will pass with a strong bipartisan vote. What is the challenge? What happens to the other issues we need to address in this country--in this body? We can't get to them, if we wanted to turn to other issues to start moving them.  My colleague from New Hampshire was just on the floor. She talked about all the things we have to do. I agree with her 100 percent: tax reform, healthcare, budget--we never do the budget here anymore--National Defense Authorization Act, growing the economy, as my friend from Missouri talked about, infrastructure, immigration, and the Dreamer issue. We have so much to do, let alone getting Trump administration officials confirmed and judges confirmed. That is a big list, but because we are spending 30 hours on a debate, which really isn't a debate on the judge, and we can't get consent from the other side to actually work on these other issues, this is what we are doing. We are just burning time.  The minority leader will not come down and explain it. I don't know if he can explain it, but that is what we are doing. Again, if the shoe were on the other foot, the press would be going crazy. Right now, they just let it happen. My view is, it would be great if one of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle would come down and say: Here is why we are wasting all of this time. Just let us know.  As Senator Lankford mentioned, this judge was nominated by the President in Now we are going to spend most of the week ``debating'' him, when that is not what is going on. It is just a delay tactic. My view is, we should just say: You want to play ball like that? We will stay here 24/7 and keep the Senate open 7 days a week. Let's get to work. Let's stay here until See if the minority leader and his team keep doing that, keep delaying. I think we should call their bluff.  Right now, the delay tactics--which nobody on the other side wants to explain--in my view, are not defensible, and they are not helping the country. Whether you are a Democrat or Republican, you want to seat the government. You want to get good people working for the American people. Right now, that is not happening.  I just wish the other side would either explain it or stop doing it. Let's get to work for this Nation.[[Page S6789]]  Thank you.  I yield the floor.

That war ended more than a decade ago, but Hezbollah remains committed to Israel's destruction.

803,topic-id,899,"Mr.President, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria have left a path of destruction along the Texas gulf coast, Florida, and Puerto The damage caused by these storms will be felt for many years to come.  This emergency supplemental is another step forward to recovery for the millions of Americans who call these places home. But I want to remind my colleagues that there is still an ongoing natural disaster in the West that is leaving families displaced, costing taxpayers billions of dollars, destroying structures, and taking human lives.  As of today, 5,000 firefighters are still battling more than a quarter of a million acres of wildfires burning across the  In my home State of Montana, despite an early snowfall, families this last weekend in Musselshell County were forced to evacuate after a fire ripped through a dry landscape and put their homes and livelihoods at risk.  In California, more than 8,000 structures have been lost to wildfires this year alone, and with temperatures expected to be in the 90s all week, there doesn't seem to be any end in sight.  Across the country, in total, fires have burned nearly 9 million acres--significantly more than the yearly average--and 1.2 million of those acres are in These fires have cost the taxpayers nearly $3 billion to date.  Quite frankly, these wildfires have been devastating in Montana and in States across the It is critically important that we take quick action to mitigate the damage caused by these fires and get communities back on their feet.  The funds in this emergency package will reimburse the Forest Service for the funds borrowed to fight wildfires. When the Forest Service has to borrow from its nonfire accounts to cover firefighting on the ground, we lose out on critical maintenance, mitigation, and restoration work. This funding will pay back those accounts and support the work needed to recover after a recordbreaking fire season. This funding can help restore the trails and roads that were lost in fires, as well as keep our fishing streams clean and clear from runoff this spring. It will get folks back in the woods, thinning, cutting, and removing debris. It can provide the Forest Service with the resources to quickly salvage the dead and dying trees that are still usable and get that timber into our local mills.  Unfortunately, though, this bill fails to provide a long-term budget fix to pay to fight wildfires. Fire seasons are getting longer and more intense, which is quickly transforming the Forest Service from a forest management agency into a forest firefighting agency.  Folks, our climate is changing. History is telling us that our fire seasons are becoming more intense and they are becoming longer. Longer fire seasons will mean more borrowing from the Forest Service to fight these wildfires. We need a long-term fix.  Fires are burning a hole through the Forest Service budget, which too often leaves our forests unmanaged and at further risk for more catastrophic fires in the future. Money that should be used to curb the fire risks, maintain and improve forest health, research and develop better forest policies, and fund the work that must get done to make our forests more resilient is borrowed to fight wildfires. We must change the way we are paying for fighting wildfires.  The bipartisan Wildfire Disaster Funding Act is one step toward that fix. We must keep pressing forward to get this bill signed into law. Then we need to adjust the disaster budget cap to make sure this is truly a long-term fix.  As I said, this bill doesn't contain all of the answers we need to reduce wildfires, but it is no doubt a step in the right direction. It lets the Forest Service treat wildfires just like other natural disasters. This means more reliable support for forest management projects and emergency funding for catastrophic wildfire seasons.  These important wildfire and forest resources, combined with providing the necessary FEMA, flood insurance, and food assistance to those displaced by hurricanes, will take us a major step forward after a series of devastating natural disasters. But I want to underscore that we aren't at the finish line yet, and I will work with Chairman Boozman on the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee to ensure that all Montanans and all Americans impacted by natural disasters aren't left waiting for Congress to act.  Folks from both parties are going to have to work together to ensure that every community impacted by hurricanes, floods, and fires will have the resources to recover and turn the page. Americans directly impacted by these natural disasters continue to wake up each morning displaced, hungry, without power, and surrounded by destruction. Congress must remain diligent and ensure these communities have the support that they need and that they deserve.  Finally, I will just say this: We are here today talking about the disaster funding bill. We are talking about the disaster funding bill because disasters are becoming more and more common. It is not going to change. We need to address the root cause of this, which is an ever-changing climate. Until we do, we are going to continue to see taxpayer dollars go out the door for disasters year after year.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

811,topic-id,1368,"Mr.President, I don't need to tell anyone that middle-class Americans have had a rough time in recent years. Stagnant wages and a lack[[Page S6729]]of opportunities have left many American families stretched thin. Sending the kids to college, a secure retirement, putting something away for a rainy day--for too many families, these hallmarks of the American dream have started to seem more and more doubtful.  A recent survey found that 50 percent of people in this country consider themselves to be living paycheck to paycheck. And about one-third of people in this country say they are just $400 away from a financial crisis. If anyone wants to know why we are taking up tax reform, this is why. We are taking up tax reform because it is not acceptable that 50 percent of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck and because it is not acceptable that one-third of voters are one unexpected car repair away from a financial crisis.  How is tax reform going to help? For starters, our tax reform bill is going to make sure that hard-working Americans are taking home more money from every paycheck. We are going to cut income tax rates. We are going to double the standard deduction--the amount of Americans' income that is not subject to any income tax--and we are going to significantly increase the child tax credit. All these things mean that American families are going to see an increase in their take-home pay. They are going to get to keep more of their hard-earned money. We are also going to simplify and streamline the Tax Code so that it is easier for Americans to figure out what benefits they qualify for, so they don't have to spend a lot of time and money filling out their tax returns.  But we are not going to stop with reforming the individual side of the Tax Another key part of improving Americans' financial situation is reforming the business side of the Tax Code so that we can give Americans access to the kinds of jobs, wages, and opportunities that will set them up for a secure future.  In order for individual Americans to thrive economically, we need American businesses to thrive. Thriving businesses create jobs. They provide opportunities, and they increase wages and invest in their workers.  Right now, though, our Tax Code is not helping businesses thrive. Instead, it is strangling businesses large and small with high tax rates. Our Nation has the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world. It is at least 10 percentage points higher than the majority of our international competitors.  It doesn't take an economist to realize that high tax rates leave businesses with less money to invest in their workers, with less money to spend on wages, and with less money to create new and better paying jobs. This situation is compounded when you are an American business with international competitors that are paying a lot less in taxes than you are.  It is no surprise that American businesses that are struggling to stay competitive in the global economy don't have a lot of resources to devote to creating new jobs and increasing wages.  A study from the White House Council of Economic Advisers estimates that reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent would increase average household income by $4,000 annually. That is a significant pay raise for hard-working American families.  Another study shows a similar pay increase. Boston University professor and well-known public finance expert Larry Kotlikoff recently issued a study that concluded that lowering the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent would increase household income by $3,500 per year on average. Specifically, the study concluded that depending on the year considered, the new Republican tax plan raises GDP by between 3 and 5 percent and real wages by between 4 and 7 percent. This translates into roughly $3,500 annually, on average, per American household.  On top of our high business tax rates, there is another major problem with our Tax Code that is decreasing American jobs, and that is our outdated worldwide tax system. What does it mean to have a worldwide tax system like we have here in the United States? It means that American companies pay U.taxes on the profits they make here at home as well as on part of the profits they make abroad once they bring that money back home to the United  The problem with this is that most other major world economies have shifted from a worldwide tax system to what is called a territorial tax system. In a territorial tax system, you pay taxes on the money you earn where you make it and only there. You aren't taxed again when you bring money back to your home country, like what happens here in the United States today.  Most of American companies' foreign competitors have been operating under a territorial tax system for years. They are paying a lot less in taxes on the money they make abroad than American companies are, and that leaves American companies at a disadvantage. These foreign companies can underbid American companies for new business simply because they don't have to add as much in taxes into the price of the products or services they sell.  When foreign companies beat out American companies for new business, it is not just American companies that suffer. It is American workers. That is why a key part of the Republicans' tax plan involves lowering our massive corporate tax rate and transitioning our tax system from a worldwide tax system, like we have in America today, to a territorial tax system, like all of our competitors have.  By making American businesses more competitive in the global economy, we can improve the playing field for American workers. So 57 percent of the manufacturers that took part in a recent survey from the National Association of Manufacturers reported that they would be more likely to hire additional workers if comprehensive tax reform becomes law, and 52 percent reported that they would be more likely to increase employee wages and benefits. That would be a tremendous, tremendous boost for American workers.  Comprehensive tax reform will allow us to see the same kind of results in other industries.  The other part of improving the playing field for American workers is lifting the tax burdens facing small businesses. Small businesses are incredibly important to new job creation. Like larger businesses, right now small businesses are being strangled by high tax rates and, at times, even exceeding those paid by some of the largest corporations in our country. Well, that can make it difficult for small businesses to even survive, much less thrive and grow their businesses. Every dollar that we save small businesses by lowering their tax rates is a dollar a small business owner can use to expand the business, add another worker, or give employees a raise.  We can also help small businesses increase wages and create jobs by allowing them to recover their investments in things like inventory and machinery more quickly. Right now, it can take small businesses years, or in some cases even decades, to recover the cost of their investments in equipment and facilities. That can leave them extremely cash poor in the meantime. Cash-poor businesses don't expand, they don't hire new workers, and they don't increase wages.  Allowing small businesses to recover their investments more quickly will mean more jobs and more opportunities for American workers.  The American people had a rough few years, but economic stress doesn't have to become the status quo for the long term. We can start turning things around right now. Comprehensive tax reform along the lines of what is envisioned by the plan that has been put forward in the Republican framework will put more money in Americans' pockets. It will give Americans access to new jobs and more opportunities, and it will increase American families' wages.  I look forward to passing our comprehensive tax reform bill in the near future and to giving the American people the relief they have been waiting for.  I yield the floor.

733,topic-id,1158,"Madam President, I fully associate myself with the comments just made by the Senator from the great State of We have to get to work here.                               Tax Reform  Mr.President, I am here to talk about one of the most pressing issues we have to deal with. Yesterday, we had lunch where the President spoke about why tax reform was so critical for healing the economy and really having our Nation rise to its full capabilities in terms of economic performance and global competitiveness. You read the headlines. The headlines read like: Republicans are for the big guy, for the corporations, not for the little guy.  You will hear them talk about policies that will have us drowning in red ink. You will hear them talk about unsustainable economic policies. I saw all of those headlines before, about 6 years ago, in the North Carolina statehouse when we inherited a disaster for an economy. It was after the 2008 crisis. We had a State that was drowning in red ink, with a $2.5 billion structural deficit. We had a tax code that was absolutely out of sync with our competition, and we set about to fix it.  This is what we ended up doing. All of the headlines looked exactly the way the headlines looked today, but we had members on both sides of the aisle, Democrats and Republicans, who recognized that North Carolina should be one of the fastest growing, most competitive States in the So we went about trying to figure out how to make that happen. We determined, for one thing, that there was an undue burden on individuals and working families. So we had to simplify the tax code, and we had to reduce the tax burden on the individuals. We also recognized that our corporate tax rate was preventing us from getting the job expansion opportunities. The States like South Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, and Virginia were winning time after time after time.  By the time I came in as the speaker of the house, there had been a long time before we had any major economic development opportunity in North So we were able to put together a corporate tax cut, an individual income tax cut, and, in our case, even a sales tax cut, which all of the pundits said was going to be a disaster. It ended up engineering and serving as the basis for one of the most significant economic turnarounds of any State for over the past 30 or 40 years. It went from a zero rainy day fund to a $2 billion rainy day fund, putting more money into education, putting more money into Medicaid, and creating the resources that would allow us to do the other things we wanted to do.  When I was speaker, I had to go look to see what Texas was doing--I see the Senator from Texas is here--and say: What could we do to be more competitive with Texas? We looked at What could we do as a matter of tax policy that would make us more competitive with Iowa on, let's say, agriculture? Those were our peer competitors. As a State leader, I am looking at my peer competitors in their  For our corporate tax policy, we look at China, at Russia, at Europe, and we look at our competitors and make it very clear that we are out of step. As Senator Blunt said, years ago we weren't out of step, but we are today. We are not competitive with people with whom we should be cleaning their clock in terms of economic expansion. You only get that done if you lower the corporate tax rate. If you actually get people who will invest that capital and hire more people, provide more opportunities for working families, and create more demand for jobs so that wages go up, that is how you ultimately get this economy moving to a point where we create the resources to also ultimately pay down the debt. I still consider that to be the single greatest threat to our national security.  Along the way, the reason I know our tax policy was about right where it needed to be was that virtually every lobbyist in Raleigh was mad at me--and I mean all of them.  If you look at 1986, the last time we did meaningful tax reform, virtually every lobbyist on Capitol Hill was mad at the folks who voted for the bill, and that was on a bipartisan basis. So we have to have Members who are willing to go big, who are willing to actually reduce the corporate tax rate, to work on the tax burden for working families, and to recognize that it is on us.  We are in a historic opportunity to turn this economy around and to take advantage of the fact that other countries are not heeding the call. They are heaping more regulations on their businesses. They are adding more taxes in some cases. This is a historic opportunity for us to just blow past the competition and ultimately create the resources to retire our debt and provide the critical resources we need for so many other things that we need to get here, like strengthening our international defense, making sure our homeland is safe, and securing the border. All of these kinds of things can be done, but they can only be done if we have the courage to move forward with tax cuts and tax reform.  I hope that all of my Members, before Thanksgiving, are in this Chamber and have an opportunity to vote for a bold reform package but, more importantly, for the fulfillment of a promise that we made to the American people if we had majorities in the Senate, in the House, and in the White We have it, and it is time for us to act.  I don't care what the headlines read because I have seen those headlines before. I don't care what the special interests want in terms of exemptions and exceptions because I have had those meetings in my office before. At the end of the day, every single one of those folks who wanted to pick apart one exception or an exemption have come back into my office and said: You know what; you have protected us from ourselves, because if you had listened to us, you would have done far less than you were capable of doing.  There is nobody who follows State politics that would question what was done in North It has been an extraordinary turnaround. Now it is time to do the same thing for this great  I hope that all of my colleagues would set aside the distractions, mute the voices of the special interests that will want their special exemption or exception and fulfill the promise that we made to the American people.

Mr.Speaker, these are commonsense measures. This bill has bipartisan support. The Strengthening Cybersecurity Information Sharing and Coordination in Our Ports Act passed the House unanimously last year, and I am confident that passage today will push the Senate into action.

In Massachusetts, the proportion of overdose deaths attributed to fentanyl is rising at a meteoric rate. At its lowest, in the third quarter of 2014,[[Page H8059]]fentanyl was present in 18 percent of opioid-related deaths in Massachusetts; but by 2016, fentanyl was present in a staggering 69 percent of the State's opioid-related deaths, resulting in 1,400 fentanyl-related deaths in the Commonwealth, a staggering number.  Although pharmaceutical fentanyl can be misused, most fentanyl deaths are linked to illicitly manufactured fentanyl and illicit versions of chemically similar compounds. The primary source of fentanyl is outside of the United States, in Mexico or The drug is smuggled in across the U.border or delivered via mail or express consignment couriers.  The INTERDICT Act will provide U.Customs and Border Protection with the latest in chemical screening devices to deploy across the United States to better detect and intercept fentanyl and other synthetic opioids.  Furthermore, this legislation will ensure that Customs and Border Protection has the resources, personnel, and facilities--including scientists available during all operational hours--to interpret screening test results from the field.  These high-tech devices will also protect law enforcement officers and their four-legged counterparts on the front lines from exposure to the deadly narcotic, which is so powerful that coming into contact with just a few grains can be fatal.

612,topic-id,876,"Thank you, Mr.President, for the recognition this evening.  Mr.President, I rise to support the Consumer Financial Protection Board's arbitration rule that has been spoken about this evening very eloquently by my colleagues here on the Democratic side.  The new rule protects consumers from predatory financial practices. These consumers are our everyday constituents. They are servicemembers and veterans, moms and dads, the elderly, students, and working people. It protects these folks by limiting binding arbitration clauses.  Now, what is a binding arbitration clause? These clauses take away consumers' rights to seek relief in court when they are wronged. This rule puts money in the pockets of consumers who have been taken advantage of.  The Consumer Financial Protection Board estimates that the rule will mean $342 million per year in compensation to consumers. Repealing the rule would take that money, which should go to consumers, and give it to some of the wealthiest corporations in this  When millions of consumers are scammed, what is the most logical remedy? When millions of consumers are scammed, what is the logical remedy--millions of separate cases before arbiters selected by the corporation or a class action case before an impartial judge and jury?  The right to go to court before a jury of your peers is enshrined in the The Seventh Amendment states:       In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy      shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall      be pre-     served. . . .  Now, let's talk about the Seventh Amendment and what one of our Founders said. James Madison wrote:       Trial by jury in civil cases is as essential to secure the      liberty of the people as any one of the pre-existent rights      of nature.  This rule guarantees access to our impartial courts. It is always good to have the spirit of the Constitution and the Founders on your side.  I stand with the supporters of this rule. Who are they? There are many. For example, there is the American Just today, its legislative director wrote in no uncertain terms:       A vote to overturn the CFPB arbitration rule is a vote      against the military and veterans.  The Military Coalition, representing 5.5 million servicemembers, also supports this rule. In July, they wrote: ``Forced arbitration is an un-American system wherein servicemembers' claims against a corporation are funneled into a rigged, secretive system in which all the rules, including the choice of the arbitrator, are picked by the corporation.''[[Page S6750]]  These are incredibly strong statements of opposition from military and veterans groups. Also in July, over 300 consumer, civil rights, labor, and small business groups wrote: ``The rule . . . is a significant step forward in the ongoing fight to curb predatory practices in consumer financial products and services and to make these markets fairer and safer.''  Signers of this letter include the AFL-CIO, the American Federation of Teachers, Consumers Union, the NAACP, LULAC, and dozens of other organizations.  Conservatives also support this rule. One of the early tea party activists, Mr.Judson Phillips, wrote an op-ed in the Washington He said: ``This time, the CFPB is right and the Republicans should stand on the side of American citizens and protect the Constitution and the Seventh Amendment.''  Where are our Republican friends? They are not here on the floor talking about this rule.  Finally, the American people broadly support this rule. A recent poll showed 67 percent supported the rule; only 13 percent opposed it. So who opposes this rule and who is behind this resolution to repeal it? Corporations that want to avoid penalties in court when they abuse their customers and big financial industry trade associations and lobbyists.  It would allow credit card, student loan, and payday lending firms--which would see big benefits if this resolution passes--to keep forcing consumers to sign contracts that take away their right to go to court.  Wells Fargo, one of the largest banks in America, spent years creating millions of fake accounts, just to bill their own customers more fees. They eventually admitted a complete and total fraud of epic proportions. Equifax, one of the largest credit bureaus in America, allowed over half of all American consumers' personal information to be hacked. These companies should not be able to use binding arbitration to avoid the legal consequences of their actions. Today's debate is a perfect example of how policymaking in Washington is broken.  A Federal agency did what is required. It undertook an exhaustive study and created a rule to protect consumers from abusive contracts. Now the affected industry is spending millions on lobbying and public relations to repeal the consumer protection rule--to protect their bottom line at all costs.  This vote will decide the fate of $342 million per year. Should it go to consumers who were wronged? Of course, it should. Or should it stay with the corporations that committed those wrongs? Of course, it should not.  Congress is not popular these days. Americans overwhelmingly believe special interests and lobbyists have too much power compared to the regular people. Today, we can take a step to repair our reputation. We should side with our constituents on this important vote and reject this resolution. I urge a ``no'' vote.  I yield back.

736,topic-id,1279,"Madam President, Republicans have spent months trying to repeal the Affordable Care They knew that tens of millions of Americans would lose their care, they knew it would betray our Federal trust responsibility to Native Americans, and they knew it would throw one-fifth of our economy into chaos. TrumpCare failed because the American people opposed it. Americans spoke out against it in record numbers. TrumpCare failed to pass four times. We hope that now we have put that to bed and we can move on.  But rather than listening to millions of Americans, President Trump has responded by sabotaging the Affordable Care His reckless behavior is already causing chaos in the marketplace. His actions have hyped up the cost of premiums. He has sent out-of-pocket costs through the roof. Instead of helping Americans get better healthcare, he has put it out of reach for millions.  I commend my colleagues Senator Alexander and Senator They have found a bipartisan solution to this new healthcare crisis caused by our I urge Leader McConnell to put it onto the floor.  The Affordable Care Act isn't the only healthcare program at risk. The President and Republicans are letting funds run dry for other critical health programs. Last month, the Children's Health Insurance Program expired. CHIP insures almost 9 million children across the country, including over 11,000 kids in my home State of New The Community Health Centers Program also expired last month.  Republicans failed to extend the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting That is one of the most effective health programs that we have. Without it, more than 1,000 New Mexico parents could miss out on home visits. They will not get crucial information about how to nurse their newborns, recognize healthy behavior in infants, and teach basic skills to their children. The Special Diabetes Program for Indians is also set to expire in  I urge Republicans to work with us to reauthorize these critical healthcare programs. We need to act urgently. We can get this done by Thanksgiving or earlier if we work together.  Madam President, I want to talk about CHIP first.  CHIP provides comprehensive health insurance for kids whose families do not quite qualify for Medicaid but who cannot afford private insurance. CHIP covers basic medical care, like immunizations, prescriptions, routine checkups and dental visits. Thanks to CHIP, the rate of uninsured kids in America has dropped from 14 percent to 4.5 percent.  CHIP has been a lifesaver for some families. This is He is from the small town of Anthony, Colton was 8 years old when he was diagnosed with cancer. Fortunately, the cancer was treatable, and he was insured by So the cost of his treatment and medications were covered. Without CHIP, Colton's family would have had to have paid hundreds of dollars a month for his treatment, which is the cost of a month's rent.  Families should not have to choose between lifesaving care for their children and a roof over their heads.  Colton's father wrote to the Santa Fe New Mexican, and it read:       Watching my son battle for his life was almost more than I      could bear. I couldn't imagine dealing with the stress of      scraping together everything we had to cover the medical      bills if we didn't have coverage. Having [CHIP] allowed us to      focus on what was truly important--Colton's future and being      there for my family as we went through this life-changing      experience.  But, now, States are looking at contingency plans. New Mexico has reserves but only until next spring. Some States will be forced to cover all of the cost in just a few months, and others are preparing to send notices to families that their coverage will end. No parent who is already in crisis because of a sick child should have to go through that. CHIP was a bipartisan success story. I hope that we can get back to working together on this.  The 50-year-old Community Health Centers Program delivers comprehensive healthcare services to some of our Nation's most vulnerable individuals--schoolchildren, people experiencing homelessness, agricultural workers, and our veterans. In New Mexico, 17 of these clinics serve 333,000 patients in 90 underserved and rural communities.  The Community Health Centers are also important to the economy in rural communities. In New Mexico, they employ almost 3,000 people across the These clinics cannot sustain a 70-percent funding cut if Federal support is canceled. Many would be forced to shut their doors.  I recently visited one of these clinics--the De Baca Family Practice Clinic in Fort Sumner, It provides high-quality medical services to over 3,000 patients. Over one-fifth of its patients are children, and another one-fifth are seniors, but if funding runs out, the De Baca Family Practice Clinic will be forced to start laying off essential medical staff and to reduce its hours.  Clinic director Lisa Walraven told me: ``You simply cannot reduce funding by 70 percent from a small frontier healthcare facility and expect anything other than a significant loss of access to care.''  Both CHIP and community health centers provide preventive care to underserved communities throughout New They are supporting our healthcare system to ensure that we don't let any families fall through the cracks.[[Page S6794]]  Indian Country also depends on these programs and others like them to provide vital care to their communities. The Federal Government has a trust and treaty obligation to provide healthcare to Native Yet the Indian Health Service is severely underfunded. CHIP and similar programs help to supplement care that the Indian Health Service cannot provide. CHIP currently covers more than 1,400 Native American children in New Allowing these programs to expire would betray our treaty obligations.  Another program cited that is critical to Indian Country is the Special Diabetes Program for It provides grants to Native communities for diabetes treatment and prevention. Without proper treatment, diabetes can lead to limb amputation and kidney failure. The disproportionate impact on Native Americans is a public health problem that we cannot ignore.  This program is making real progress. It helps to fund over 300 Native health programs in 35 States, including 29 programs in New They help educate communities about how to prevent diabetes and provide care so that Native patients can manage their diabetes more effectively.  It is one of the most effective public health initiatives ever undertaken by the Federal Diabetes-related kidney failure has dropped 54 percent among Native In some States, like Alaska, leg amputations among Native people with diabetes have decreased more than 68 percent. This program literally saves life and limb.  Program directors across Indian Country tell me that without this funding they will have to start laying off staff and limiting their diabetes programming. We need to provide funding to Tribal communities so that they can invest in projects that will be more effective in preventing diabetes over time.  Congress must act to allow this successful program to reach its full potential. We cannot allow diabetes to become a death sentence in Indian Country once again.  The failure to fund CHIP, the failure to fund the community health centers, home visiting health services, and the Special Diabetes Program will force families into another health crisis. Every day that we neglect these programs, more people will suffer. These programs have years--sometimes decades--of proven success.  The American people want Congress to work together to come up with bipartisan solutions. Most of these programs were created through bipartisan cooperation. Let's get back to that spirit and work together for the American people again.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Tillis).

Mr.Speaker, I stand today in support of H.3101, the Strengthening Cybersecurity Information Sharing and Coordination in Our Ports  Port facilities serve as a vital economic function for our Nation and the communities in which they are located. The approximately 360 commercial maritime ports operating across the United States handle more than $1.3 trillion in cargo, annually.  To facilitate and maintain this level of economic activity, the maritime sector increasingly relies on technology to facilitate the movement of cargo into and through port facilities. Collectively, navigation, operations, and communication technologies enhance the competitiveness, safety, and reliability of the U.maritime sector.  However, as port operations have become more automated, exposure to cyber threats and attacks have also increased. This homeland security threat is not unique to the maritime sector. In fact, since 2003, the Government Accountability Office has warned about the vulnerability of critical infrastructure and has called on the Federal Government to support efforts to bolster cybersecurity.  To better protect port facilities from cyber attacks, Congress must ensure that expertise in both the private and public sector is leveraged effectively. H.3101 would direct DHS to be more proactive in how it addresses cybersecurity risks at our Nation's ports.  The first step in reducing cyber vulnerabilities is identifying the weak points in network security through risk assessments. H.3101 requires these assessments. The bill directs the Coast Guard to provide port facilities with guidelines on how to report cybersecurity risks in order to enhance the ability of both the Coast Guard and port operators to respond effectively to such attacks.  By promoting cybersecurity information sharing and coordination between public and private partners at maritime facilities, H.3101 seeks to make a positive difference in how quickly terminal and port operators are able to prevent, mitigate, and recover from such attacks.  H.3101, if enacted, will help foster an environment in which DHS, the Coast Guard, ports, and port stakeholders work together to enhance the cybersecurity at our Nation's ports.

124,topic-id,551,"Mr.Speaker, the world is an ugly place right now. It seems that at every turn there is another crisis--another barrier to peace and prosperity, another obstacle to fight, or another cross to bear. More of our citizens, women, children, and grandkids are turning to something--anything--to mute the pain and create a false sense of peace. Society has been infected by drug addiction, a disease fueled by a loss of hope.  We see it on the news, we watch it online, we feel loss in our communities. This disease is killing our friends and neighbors. Last year alone, over 64,000 lives were lost. That is more casualties in a year than we saw during the height of the Vietnam war.  And this is a war, too--a war being fought in the streets and in our homes. And we are losing. Mothers, sons, daughters, and fathers are dying--from the cold streets of major cities to the quiet fields of rural America--we are all feeling the effects of the opioid crisis.  What can be done? That is a question I have asked countless law enforcement officials, doctors, nurses, addiction treatment professionals, and community leaders. There is no one solution to stopping the opioid epidemic in this country.  This is a man-made disaster. We must face it head on with education and awareness, addiction and recovery services, funding, prescription drug monitoring programs, and prevention. We need to prevent our loved ones from being dragged into the abyss of addiction and hopelessness.  According to the CDC, three out of four new heroin users report abusing prescription opioids before using heroin. There is an easy step each of us can take to help with prevention. We can get rid of our old opioid prescriptions at home. Why chance someone taking them? Why chance your loved one being a statistic?  This year alone, 153 individuals in Louis County have already died of an overdose. How many of them started with prescribed opioids? How many started by taking prescriptions from a parent or a family member? If we could have saved just one of these lives by throwing away old prescriptions, then isn't it worth it?  This Saturday, October 28, local law enforcement and the Drug Enforcement Agency will be set up all around the country and in our neighborhoods for National Prescription Drug Take Back They are providing safe and easy locations for you to throw away unused prescription drugs.  I have no idea how many people can, and will, be saved by this one simple act. But multiply this one act times thousands, and now we are getting something done. Mr.Speaker, this is an epidemic this Nation has never seen. This is a disease of our own making.  This week, there is something we all can do. Think about your household. Go into your hidden cupboards and see if you have old prescriptions. I bet you do. Take them. Find your nearest drug take back location and throw them away.  We need to restore hope in this fight, and it won't happen overnight. It will take work, prayer, patience, and vigilance. Hope can be restored. If and when we band together to fight this epidemic, it will happen.  So let's restore a little hope this week. Let's all join the fight to end the opioid epidemic.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-25-pt1-PgH8150.txt,2137,HONORING THE LIFE OF GARRETT PAIZ,2017.0,25.0,October

First, there is no question I will vote in favor of the budget and encourage my colleagues to do so because there is no doubt this is the best way forward to achieve tax reform and unlock the promise of bigger paychecks, more jobs, and the return of investing in  However, I must also include that the Senate did not do its work. After months of hard work by Chairwoman Black and the Budget Committee, the House was able to get it done. Even acknowledging the difficult position of our country, they put us on a path to balance the budget in less than a decade.  The House's budget included reconciliation instructions to speed up the enactment of $203 billion in mandatory savings, and the House budget included instructions that allowed us for the first time to stay on the path to repeal ObamaCare, to help those who continue to suffer with rising premiums in the individual market.  I would guess that nearly every Republican in the Chamber agrees that the House's budget is superior.  So why are we voting on the Senate's?  Because our Senate colleagues seem allergic sometimes to making tough choices.  But why will the Senate's budget pass?  Because the American people need tax relief. Families and small businesses wrestle with an outdated and complicated Tax Code every year. It is true, we do have a once-in-a-generation opportunity.  The specter of the IRS and devastating corporate rate mean that capital and resources are held outside of the United States and not invested here. Making our Tax Code fairer and simpler will bring this capital back to the market and jump-start investment and growth like we have rarely seen in the United  Despite my ongoing and deep frustration sometimes with the Senate, I encourage my colleagues to pass this budget and bring the promise of more jobs and bigger paychecks closer to reality.

604,topic-id,1384,"Mr.President, Wells Fargo creates 3.5 million fake accounts, charging customers fees and ruining credit scores. Equifax lets hackers steal personal information on 145 million Americans, putting nearly 60 percent of American adults at risk of identity theft. And somehow we are about to vote on a Republican proposal that makes it harder for consumers to hold companies like Wells Fargo and Equifax accountable. I know it sounds nuts, but it is true.  Here is the issue: If you have a checking account, credit card, private student loan, or any number of financial products, there is a good chance you have given up your right to go to court if that financial firm cheats you. That is because tens of millions of consumer financial contracts include a forced arbitration clause that says that if this financial company cheated you, you can't join with other consumers in court; you have to go to arbitration by yourself. Tens of millions of consumers, including around 80 million[[Page S6743]]credit card customers, can't go to court if their banks cheat them.  Think about what this means in the real world. You wake up in the morning and find a mysterious $30 fee on your account statement. You call the bank and say: I didn't agree to this. The bank tells you to pound sand. So what are your options? Well, if there is no forced arbitration clause in your contract, you have a choice: You can go to court, or, if your bank offers it, you can pursue arbitration.  Here is what you want to think about. Chances are pretty good that if the bank cheated you with a $30 unauthorized fee, there are other customers in the same boat. That means, if you want, you can join a class action lawsuit against the bank for free. A class action gives you a chance to get some money back, and it doesn't cost you anything. A class action also means the bank might have to cough up some real money and think twice before hitting you and their other customers with hidden fees the next time around.  Now think about what happens if there is a forced arbitration clause. You can't join with other customers in court. Your only option is to file a solo arbitration claim, which will cost you $200 or more just to get started. Who is going to pay $200 up front to try to get back a $30 fee? No one. That is exactly what the banks are counting on. They can get away with nickel and diming you forever.  But say the bank steals a bigger amount and you just can't stand it anymore, so you decide to be one of the roughly 400 consumers a year who go before an arbitrator. If you don't like the result, there is no appeal. Even worse, the banks are allowed to swipe your wallet in secret. The records of these proceedings are not public, so the regulators and the American people don't get to know what their banks are up to. Does that sound like justice in America?  Earlier this year, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau put a stop to that. They issued a new rule that prohibits financial companies from forcing you to give up your right to join other customers in court and hold your bank accountable. House Republicans already voted to reverse that rule. The Senate will soon decide whether to follow suit and take away American families' freedom to choose to go to court if they are cheated by their bank.  Make no mistake--anyone who votes to reverse this rule is saying loud and clear that they stand with banks instead of their constituents, because bank lobbyists are the only people asking Congress to reverse this rule. Every other organization--all the ones that represent actual human beings, not banks--every one of them wants this rule to be saved. Let me tell you about some of them.  The Military Coalition, which represents more than 5.5 million veterans and servicemembers, supports the CFPB rule because ``our nation's veterans should not be deprived of the Constitutional rights and freedoms that they put their lives on the line to protect, including the right to have their claims heard in a trial.'' The coalition says that ``[f]orced arbitration is an un-American system wherein servicemembers' claims against a corporation are funneled into a rigged, secretive system in which all the rules, including the choice of arbitrator, are picked by the corporation,'' and they warn that ``the catastrophic consequences these [forced arbitration] clauses pose for our all-voluntary military fighting force's morale and our national security are vital reasons'' to preserve the rule. That is from the Military  The AARP, which represents nearly 40 million seniors, says that the CFPB rule should be preserved because it ``is a critical step in restoring consumers' access to legal remedies that have been undermined by the widespread use of forced arbitration for many years.'' Older consumers are often at increased risk of financial scams, so the ``AARP supports the availability of a full range of enforcement tools, including the right to class action litigation to prevent harm to the financial security of older people posed by unfair and illegal practices.'' That is the AARP, which represents seniors across the country.  The Main Street Alliance, which represents thousands of small businesses, says that the CFPB rule will help small businesses fight against big financial firms that try to drive up their fees. Since almost ``20% of [small] business owners rely on credit cards as a source of investment capital--many of which contain arbitration clauses--forced arbitration makes it nearly impossible for small businesses and consumers alike to protest hidden fees, illegal debt collection, and other deceptive practices.'' That is from the Main Street  So there it is. Veterans, servicemembers, seniors, small businesses, and consumers are all lining up to support the CFPB rule. But that is not all. Let Freedom Ring, an organization that proudly touts itself as ``supporting the conservative agenda,'' likes the CFPB rule, too, saying it is ``in keeping with our Framers' concerns that without appropriate protections, civil proceedings can be used as a means to oppress the powerless.''  That is the thing you have to understand. The effort to reverse the CFPB rule isn't about promoting a conservative agenda, and it sure as heck is not about promoting a working people's agenda or a small business agenda. It is about advancing the banks' agenda, period.  The banks and their lobbyists actually have the gall to claim that they want to kill the rule because it is bad for their customers. That claim is just plain laughable. According to a rigorous, 3-year-long CFPB study, consumers recovered an average of $540 million annually from class action settlements, while receiving less than $1 million annually in the arbitration cases the agency reviewed. It is not even close. Even if there are instances in which arbitration is a better option for consumers than a class action lawsuit, the CFPB rule doesn't stop consumers from choosing arbitration. The rule simply says that consumers--consumers--should also have the freedom to go to court if that is what they prefer.  I will tell you one thing: When it comes to what is right for consumers, I listen to servicemembers, veterans, seniors, consumers, and small businesses. I don't listen to bank lobbyists. When a bunch of bank lobbyists tell you they know what is best for consumers, hang on to your wallet.  Millions of Americans of all political parties think the game in Washington is rigged against them, and this vote is exhibit Companies like Equifax and Wells Fargo have hurt millions of consumers and then turn around and try to escape accountability, using forced arbitration clauses.

630,topic-id,4056,"Thank you, Mr.Tonight we are on the verge of passing a Republican resolution to make it easier for financial institutions to cheat people. Earlier this year, the Consumer Financial Protection Board issued a rule that prohibits financial companies from forcing you to sign an arbitration clause that makes you forfeit your right to take a bank to court. So if this proposal passes, that rule will just disappear.  Now, there are no real human beings who think it should be easier for financial institutions to steal money from you and get away with it. Bank lobbyists are the only people asking Congress to reverse this rule, but let's face it, the Wall Street Journal is pretty powerful around here. The question the American people should be asking right now is, Are they powerful enough to win tonight?  The reason this vote is happening so late at night is because we were right on the verge of blocking it. The American people have watched as Wells Fargo cheated its customers and then used arbitration clauses to try to escape liability. They watched as Equifax negligently allowed hackers to steal personal financial information of more than half of all American adults and then used arbitration clauses to try to escape accountability. Politicians have been watching it too. While many of their eyes might be blinded by dollar signs, it may not be enough.  There is bipartisan opposition in the Senate to turning financial institutions loose to swindle their own customers. Right now our best guess is that it is 50 to 50. That means that Vice President Mike Pence is on his way to the Senate to cast a tie-breaking vote. If we can't peel off one more Republican, Mike Pence will decide whether consumers can hold banks like Wells Fargo accountable when they cheat their customers.  Now, everyone assumes Mike Pence will side with the big banks, and I have just one simple question: Why?  President Trump, Mike Pence works for you. His job is to cast his vote the way you tell him to cast it. We spent more than a year listening to you, first as a candidate and then as a President, and you have gone on and on and on about how strong you are, how tough you are, and about how you are going to stand up to Wall  Well, this bill is a giant, wet kiss to Wall Bank lobbyists are crawling all over this place begging Congress to vote and make it easier for them to cheat their customers.

You know, I followed a news story about how tough you are, Mr.President--standing up to Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, and the Republican Well, this is a top priority for them, Mr.So do you work for Mitch McConnell now?

Well, where is the all-powerful Steve Bannon now? Where is he to tell Mike Pence and Donald Trump that they don't work for Mitch McConnell?  Every organization--all the ones that represent actual human beings, not banks--want this rule to be saved, none more than the organizations that represent our veterans and our servicemembers. Do you know why that is, Mr.President? It is because they are sick and tired of being cheated by banks. They are sick and tired of politicians who say ``thank you for your service'' and then turn around and vote to make it harder for them to build a future for themselves and their families.  The Military Coalition, which represents more than 5.5 million veterans and servicemembers, supports the CFPB rule because ``our Nation's veterans should not be deprived of the constitutional rights and freedoms that they put their lives on the line to protect, including the right to have their claims heard in a trial.''

And for Steve Bannon--if this really happens today and Mike Pence casts the deciding vote to make it easier for financial institutions to cheat people, do you want to remake the Republican Party in your image? Do you want to watch primary challenges against Republicans who roll over to Wall Street? Do you want to go after the weak and spineless, the DC-Wall Street swamp, the politicians who will not stand up to Mitch McConnell, and all the globalists who think cash matters more than people?

With the remainder of my time, I would like to read letters and op-eds from veterans begging Congress not to repeal this rule.  The first is from Lee Lange, U.Marine, Retired, with 30 years of service, now serving as Arizona chapter president of the Military Officers Association of He titles his letter, ``I Served to Protect Our Rights; Don't Let Equifax Take Them Away.''       As a career Marine, I served to protect the rights of      Americans as guaranteed by the Constitution and its      amendments. Among them is the 7th Amendment right to trial by      jury in civil cases, a right dismissed by companies like      Equifax and now under siege in Congress.[[Page S6757]]       Forced arbitration ``ripoff clauses'' buried in the fine-     print of bank accounts, auto loans and other contracts strip      servicemembers and veterans of their day in court when big      banks and other financial institutions violate the law.      Instead, people must face companies alone and cannot join      together in a rigged, secretive process where the banks and      lenders often choose the arbitrator.       Men and women in uniform are surely among the 145.5 million      people impacted by the massive data breach of sensitive      personal information held by the credit reporting agency      Equifax--and among those whose access to the courts was      stripped in Equifax's fine print until the company had to      relent. Servicemembers from Sergeant Charles Beard to Army      soldier Prentice Martin-Bowen have also had their rights      limited by forced arbitration.       Wells Fargo continues to use forced arbitration to deny      victims of the fake account scandal access to the justice      system. Arizona and Southern California were the epicenter of      the Wells Fargo scandal and Wells Fargo is Arizona's largest      bank. Some of the state's more than 500,000 veterans were      certainly caught up in its effects. Wells Fargo has been      caught but it is likely not the only financial institution      guilty of illegal practices.       The Department of Defense has long pushed for      servicemembers full legal recourse against unscrupulous      lenders, and members now have some protection against forced      arbitration clauses through the Military Lending But the      MLA protections don't apply to auto loans, to rights under      the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, to bank account fraud      like the Wells Fargo scandal, or to veterans.       The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and its      Office of Servicemember Affairs have worked to protect those      who serve by issuing a rule restoring our 7th Amendment      rights and limiting the use of forced arbitration. The CFPB      rule enhances military consumer protections in the MLA,      restoring the right of servicemembers and veterans to seek      civil justice, including class action suits, for illegal      acts.       For that reason, The Military Coalition, a national      consortium of uniformed services and veterans organizations      representing 5.5 million current and former servicemembers      and their families and survivors, urged Congress to let the      CFPB rule go into effect. The American Legion has done the      same. The general public--including 64 percent of Republicans      and 74 percent of Democrats--also supports the rule to      restore our day in court.       But, despite this outpouring of support, the U.House of      Representatives has voted to block the rule from going into      effect. Wall Street lobbyists are pushing Congress to leave      forced arbitration as the only solution, severely limiting      the recourse of servicemembers and all For      example, only four arbitrations have been filed against Wells      Fargo in Arizona despite up to 178,972 or more fake accounts      in the state.  That is 4 arbitrations against 178,972 or more fake accounts in the       We can't allow forced arbitration to be used as a tool to      block accountability.       The Senate, armed with lessons learned from the Equifax and      Wells Fargo scandals, can still reverse course. Our Senators      must put the interests of active-duty servicemembers,      veterans, and American consumers ahead of Wall Street      lobbyists and reject efforts to take away our day in court.  That was from Lee Lange, U.Marine Corps, Retired, chapter president of the Arizona Chapter of the Military Officers Association of America and president of the Southwest Veterans Chamber of  There is another one that I would like to read, and this is from the chairman of the Alaska Veterans It is titled ``Forced arbitration and a right worth fighting for,'' by Ric       As a veteran, I am proud to have helped protect the      freedoms so zealously guarded for us by our Another      guarantor of those liberties is the right to our day in      court--one especially vital to today's servicemembers who are      so often taken advantage of by financial institutions.       Today, the right to our day in court is endangered because      of actions under consideration by the United States Senate on      the issue of powerful banks and forced arbitration.       James Madison, one of the principal drafters of the Bill of      Rights, wrote that ``trial by jury in civil cases is as      essential to secure the liberty of the people as any one of      the pre-existent rights of nature.'' The Founders saw this      right to be heard before a jury of our peers as so vital that      they enshrined it in the Seventh       This right is not only, in Winston Churchill's words, ``a      safeguard from arbitrary perversion of the law,'' but also a      means to ensure equal access to justice for the powerful and      the powerless alike, and for citizens to signal and set      acceptable standards of conduct in our society.       Why bring this all up now? Because the U.Senate is      considering legislation to roll back a rule recently      finalized by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)      to limit forced arbitration clauses buried deep in consumer      financial agreements. These forced arbitration agreements are      found in the fine print of financial agreements signed by      tens of millions of everyday Americans with the Wall Street      banks, covering everything from credit cards and checking      accounts to prepaid cards and payday loans. And they require      consumers to take disputes over bank wrongdoing not to courts      overseen by judges, but to arbitrators chosen by the      financial institutions--under their own rules.       Arbitration hearings are held in private with no public      record, no meaningful rules, not even a requirement that      arbitrators enforce state and federal laws. And of course, no      jury.       Perhaps most significant of all, Big Banks have leveraged      arbitration to block class action suits, where the ability of      consumers to band together helps balance the extraordinary      legal and financial resources at banks' disposal.       The Wells Fargo scandals--yes, there's more than one--offer      a prime example of how financial institutions use forced      arbitration to rip off consumers.       The bank, with 48 branches in Alaska, opened nearly 6,000      of its infamous fake accounts here on the Last       A California judge ordered the financial giant to repay      customers more than $200 million for manipulating accounts to      generate overdraft fees--another activity repeated here.       Recently, nearly a quarter million Wells Fargo car loan      customers were dinged for nonpayment of insurance policies      illegally taken out for them--and almost 25,000 had vehicles      repossessed.       Most infuriating, Wells Fargo has been fined millions for      foreclosing on servicemembers or repossessing their cars in      violation of the Servicemembers Civil Relief       In every case, Wells has used arbitration to shield itself      from accountability. Since 2009, only 215 consumers      nationwide have filed arbitrations against Wells Fargo--but      not one in The reason: arbitration is often too      expensive for a single consumer with a small claim.       That's why the CFPB rule is so important--and why the Big      Banks' Washington lobbyists are working overtime to have it      overturned. The regulation will ensure all Alaskans retain      the right to their day in court as part of class actions--and      uphold the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to protect the      legal rights of the men and women fighting for this country.       As Congress considers whether to preserve this critical      protection for everyday consumers, and especially for our      servicemembers, our Alaska Republican Senators, Lisa      Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, need to remember that equal      access to justice is not a Republican or a Democratic idea.      It is an American right, as old as our Republic itself, and      it's worth fighting for.       Ric Davidge serves as chairman of the Alaska Veterans       From Robert Mitchell, a Marine Corps veteran: ``Forced arbitration is un-American.'' This is from the Arkansas Democrat-      I am a proud Marine Corps veteran. Abroad, I joined with my      fellow Marines in united pursuit of justice and rights. At      home, I fight for them and other U.military members to be      treated fairly and with dignity in their financial affairs.      I'm disappointed by the actions of my U.Tom Cotton,      who is seeking to roll back a recent rule that restores      servicemembers' and other Americans' legal rights in the      financial marketplace.       So often, military members are unfairly targeted by      aggressive lenders, abusive debt collectors, reckless credit-     reporting bureaus, and discriminating employers. So I devote      my time to help them enforce their rights under federal and      state laws that grant them remedies and other ways to hold      bad actors accountable when they flout these laws.  He goes on to talk about what happens in the fine print in these contracts and how it is that veterans and Active-Duty servicemembers are repeatedly cheated.  His closing remarks are as follows:       Unfortunately, although the rule restores the rights of      active-duty servicemembers and American civilians, it has      become controversial in Washington because the financial-     services industry opposes it. For several years now,      financial institutions have been able to use their strict      terms to wipe away individuals' rights and essentially ignore      legal complaints.       But Senator Cotton and our representatives in Congress must      take the opportunity to look beyond the lobbyists and toward      the experiences of our military members and the U.     They should support, not abandon, a rule that      simply restores our traditions.  I will just reference a letter from The Military Coalition, a consortium of uniform services and veterans organizations representing more than 5\1/2\ million current and former servicemembers and their families and survivors who also wrote in strong support of protecting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau arbitration rule. They conclude:       Our nation's veterans should not be deprived of the      Constitutional rights and freedoms that they put their lives      on the line to protect, including the right to have their      claims heard in a trial by a jury when their rights are      violated.

We also have a resolution passed by the Ninety-Ninth National Convention of the American Legion asking Congress not to roll back the arbitration rule put forward by the CFPB, and we have a letter from more than 30 veterans associations begging this Congress to please not get rid of the forced arbitration clause that has been put forward by the Consumer Financial Protection  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have these letters and resolution printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       The Military Coalition,                                    Alexandria, VA, July 25, 2017.

The final rule addresses the widespread harm      of forced arbitration by preserving the ability of service      members and other consumers to band together to seek relief      through the civil justice system when financial institutions      have broken the law. We applaud the CFPB for moving forward      on this rule that recognizes the detrimental effects of      forced arbitration and class action waivers on our brave men      and women in uniform.       Forced arbitration is an un-American system wherein service      members' claims against a corporation are funneled into a      rigged, secretive system in which all the rules, including      the choice of the arbitrator, are picked by the corporation.      Found in almost every financial services contract, forced      arbitration clauses systematically include a provision      banning the rights of consumers to ban together to hold a      corporation accountable. Given the exponential and expansive      use of these clauses by financial institutions in contracts      with service members, prohibiting the practice of forcing      service members to surrender fundamental Constitutional and      statutory rights through the use of pre-dispute forced      arbitration clauses is now more critical than ever.       Our service members protect our nation against both foreign      and domestic threats. The sacrifices and logistical      undertakings they and their families make in order to serve      are compelling reasons alone to ensure they are not only      shielded from predatory financial practices and unscrupulous      lenders, but are also able to enforce their congressionally      mandated rights through our civil justice system if and when      violations arise.       However, class action waivers work against these rights.      They are particularly abusive when enforced against service      members, who may not be in a position to individually      challenge a financial institution's illegal or unfair      practices because of limited resources or frequent      relocations or deployment. Furthermore, for those service      members on active duty and serving overseas, it is critical      to retain the ability to get justice without having to      interrupt their service and distract their attention from the      mission at hand. Since these types of service members cannot      participate full time in pursuing an individual claim, being      able to enforce their rights through the class action      mechanism is essential. Thus service members should receive      the benefits of participating in a class action despite their      inability to shoulder the burden of bringing a claim alone.       Our nation's veterans should not be deprived of the      Constitutional rights and freedoms that they put their lives      on the line to protect, including the right to have their      claims heard in a trial by a jury when their rights are      violated. The catastrophic consequences these clauses pose      for our all-voluntary military fighting force's morale and      our national security are vital reasons for this rule to take      effect immediately.

757,topic-id,1213,"Mr.President, on September 30, the Children's Health Insurance Program expired. It has now been 25 days since the Congress has put our children's health and well-being on the back burner. My colleagues and I do not think that children's health belongs on the back burner. So we have come to the floor of the Senate to spend the afternoon speaking up for kids.  Thank you to everyone who joins me today to say that we should not wait any longer to make sure that children, community health centers, and new mothers have access to the healthcare programs that they need.  Republicans control It is up to them what we vote on and when we do it. So what was more important to the Republican leadership than the health of little kids? Republican leaders blew through the days before the children's healthcare deadline by trying to repeal healthcare for millions of  Once the Children's Health Insurance Program had already expired, Republican leaders burned through more time by holding a series of votes on a budget with giant tax cuts for billionaires and giant corporations that would also gut Medicare, Medicaid, and a bunch of programs that help working families. Republicans jammed through their terrible budget without a single Democratic vote last week, 19 days after blowing past the deadline to fund healthcare for kids.  Last night, 24 days past the deadline to make sure the kids had healthcare coverage, what were Republican leaders doing? Republican leaders stayed up late into the night holding a vote to make it easier for financial institutions to cheat people.  The days continue to tick by--24, 25. Tomorrow Members of Congress will leave for the weekend, 26 days past the deadline, and still there will be no vote to fund this critical program.  Senator Ted Kennedy and Senator Orrin Hatch, a Democrat and Republican, wrote this legislation together back in the late 1990s. The Children's Health Insurance Program, also called CHIP, provides health insurance to low-income children and to pregnant women. Senator Kennedy and Senator Hatch created this program because they knew that providing healthcare coverage for children would make them healthier as children and healthier even after they grew up. They knew that some children were slipping through the cracks, and this was their solution. The children covered by CHIP didn't qualify for Medicaid, they weren't covered by employers, and they couldn't afford to buy private insurance.  In 1997, 15 percent of all the children in this country lacked any form of health insurance coverage. Today, because of the CHIP program and the Affordable Care Act, that number has shrunk to 5 percent of children. CHIP works with Medicaid to provide health insurance for one out of every three kids in this country.  States choose whether or not they want a CHIP program. Here is the deal. Every single State has chosen one because every single State recognizes the value of providing their children with healthcare coverage. In Massachusetts, the percentage of children with healthcare coverage is even higher than the national average. It is at 99 percent. We are doing something right here.  The original program was set for 10 years, and since then, every few years, Congress has had to act to reauthorize the program so that children can continue to get healthcare coverage. The CHIP program has been reauthorized four times since 1997, and not one of those times has Congress missed the deadline--not one--until now. In fact, in past years, Congress has made sure to reauthorize the program many months ahead of its expiration in order to give States the time they need to plan their budget. It sounds like a pretty sensible thing to do--but not this year. We are 25 days past the deadline for reauthorizing CHIP--25 days and counting. This isn't fair to States, to kids, or to their families.  So what actually happens now?  Well, the money runs out. Eleven States are set to run out of their CHIP funding by the end of 2017, and the others, soon after. Our Republican Governor in Massachusetts sent me a letter on day 3 past the CHIP deadline, and he wrote:       Parents are already afraid that their children's insurance      may be lost in the near future. With each passing week, their      fears continue to grow.  My Governor is right. States have to start making tough decisions. They may have to decrease enrollment, turning away sick little kids who qualify for coverage but don't make it through the door on time. They could start kicking kids off of their insurance saying: Sorry, we just can't help anymore. Or they could be forced to make tough calls on benefits: We can't cover the wheelchair you need to get around. There is no physical therapy or no prenatal care until the funding comes through again.  That is just flat out immoral. Tax cuts for billionaires shouldn't come before making sure that a sick kid gets the help he or she needs. Mothers are lying awake at night. Fathers are tossing and turning, worrying about their healthcare coverage. What is the Republican leadership doing? Tomorrow they will be heading home for the weekend without lifting a finger to fund a bipartisan program that has been reauthorized four times over the past 20 years.  If that isn't bad enough, September 30 wasn't just the deadline for Congress to reauthorize We also blew past the deadline on several other healthcare programs to help children, to help pregnant women, to help older Americans, and to help the chronically ill. We blew past the deadline to reauthorize the Community Health Center Fund and the National Health Service Corps, which funds health centers and supports healthcare workers that provide children with high-quality primary care. We blew past the deadline to reauthorize the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, which funds home visits to new and expectant parents to give them help keeping a new baby healthy and safe. We blew past the deadline to reauthorize the Special Diabetes Program, which funds diabetes research that could offer hope to many children living with diabetes.  When a kid is sick, moms and dads move Heaven and Earth to get them the care they need. They don't wait 25 days to go to the doctor and check to see if something is wrong. They stay up all night to make sure their little ones are all right. They wait outside the hospital room, pacing until they get an answer, but Republican leaders in Congress just don't seem to care. They don't seem to care if these families have the health insurance coverage they need so they can get an x ray or pay for an antibiotic or run some tests.  Twenty-five days, 26 days, 27 days--it just doesn't seem to matter to Republican leaders, but it sure matters to moms and dads and kids in Massachusetts and all over this country.  Senator Kennedy used to say: ``The test of greatness for a nation is how it cares for its children.'' Right now Republican leaders in Congress are failing that test. My colleagues have come to the floor today to say that time is up. We are here to fight for kids.  I yield the floor.

611,topic-id,1463,"Mr.President, I would like to say a few words about the battle between the jury system and a system in which regular Americans are forced into arbitration, which has a terrible record.  I can remember years ago, when I was attorney general, the attorneys general shut down one of the arbitration systems because it was so corrupted and was throwing decisions to big corporate interests, and you cannot really understand that unless you understand the importance of the role of the jury in our country.  For centuries, the jury has served as a last sanctuary within our constitutional structure for people who seek justice and fair treatment under the law. It was designed for a specific purpose. When Big Interests control our executive officials, as the Founding Fathers knew they could, when lobbyists have the legislatures tied in knots, as our Founding Fathers knew they could, and when media outlets steer public opinion against individuals, as our Founding Fathers saw that they could, the hard, square corners of the jury box stand firm against that tide of influence and money.  There is a lot of history here. It was the earliest American settlers who brought the jury to our country as precious cargo from  The Virginia Colony established the jury in 1624, roughly a year before the Dutch even settled the island of Early Americans created juries in 1628 in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, in 1677 in the Colony of West New Jersey, and in 1682 in Indeed, in our Declaration of Independence, our colonists put forward a list of grievances and admonished King George III for--and I quote them in the Declaration of Independence--``depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury.''  When the original Constitution was silent on the jury, Americans sounded the alarm, and the Seventh Amendment was sent to the States in the Bill of  Alexander Hamilton, a famous Revolutionary-era Founder, stated in Federalist 83: ``The friends and adversaries in the plan of the convention, if they agree in nothing else, concur at least in the value they set upon the trial by jury; or, if there is any difference between them, it consists in this: the former regard it as a valuable safeguard to liberty; the latter represent it as the very palladium of free government.''  Going on to the mid-19th century, when Alexis de Tocqueville wrote his famous ``Democracy in America,'' he observed that the jury should be understood in America as a ``political institution'' and ``one form of the sovereignty of the people.'' What did he mean? How does the jury protect the sovereignty of the people? Well, in two ways, as Sir William Blackstone explained.  Sir William Blackstone was probably the most cited source in those early days of the founding of our Republic and in the early days of the development of our laws. Sir William Blackstone explained that trial by jury ``preserves in the hands of the people that share which they ought to have in the administration of public justice, and prevents the encroachments of the more powerful and wealthy citizens.''  Those are two separate thoughts. First, the civil jury devolves a share of government power--power which they ought to have--directly to the people. But second and uniquely, in a Constitution otherwise devoted to protecting the individual against the power of the State, the civil jury is designed to protect the individual against other individuals--more specifically, against other more powerful and wealthy individuals.  Even former Chief Justice William Rehnquist observed about this era that ``the Founders of our Nation considered the right of trial by jury in civil cases an important bulwark against tyranny and corruption, a safeguard too precious to be left to the whim of the sovereign.''  That is at heart what this fight is about. Remember Blackstone's words: The jury ``prevents the encroachments of the more powerful and wealthy'' citizens. That means the jury is intended to be a thorn in the side of the powerful and wealthy. It is intended to make the powerful and wealthy stand equal--annoyingly equal to them--before the law with everyone else. The jury is intended to be the little branch of government that the wealthy and powerful can't get to, can't fix, can't control. That is why jury panels are new every time. If you had a permanent panel of the same jurors over and over, the powerful and wealthy would tend to influence the institution. The jury stands against all that tide of influence. That is what it is there for. That is how it was designed. Who is more powerful and wealthy today than mighty corporations and big special interests? And guess what--big corporations and special interests hate the jury. The small institution has big enemies.  It would astound the Founding Fathers to see how far we have fallen from the popular affection and loyalty for the jury trial in 1776. Juries are indeed about dispute resolution and about making sure that everybody can get a fair shake and that powerful and wealthy interests can't put the fix in, but more than that, the civil jury helps check power.  The American system of government is built on the premise that divided government and separated powers--checks and balances--will best protect individual liberty. The civil jury distributes authority of the State directly to citizens, giving them direct power to resolve disputes--sometimes very important disputes--and it gives them this power in a way that makes it very hard for special interests to control.  Well, if we look around today, the influence of wealth and power suffuses the legislative and executive branches. Corporate lobbying and corporate and billionaire election spending are at unprecedented levels. In our political debate, dark money dollars drown out the voices of average citizens in what has been called ``a tsunami of slime,'' and all that money is not spent for nothing.  Powerful interests love a game that is rigged in their favor--always have, always will. It is a tale as old as time. Well, rigging the game doesn't go over well in the jury box. Special interests may seek special influence with legislators and regulators all of the time. It is their constant activity, licensed and regulated by lobbying and campaign finance laws. Their every waking moment is devoted to tampering with the legislative and executive branches, but tampering with a jury is a crime, and it is a crime for a reason.  In a world where so many feel powerless, juries give regular citizens real authority. In a world of fractious partisanship, juries make citizens work together and decide together. And in a world in which injustices pile up against barricades of well-kept indifference, a jury can blow the status quo to smithereens. This is the vital constitutional role of the civil jury. This is what mandatory arbitration is designed to attack--to remove the access of regular citizens to this institution of our government which was so important to our Founding Fathers because it is an institution that the wealthy and powerful cannot control. They can control mandatory arbitration. Over and over again, it has been shown to be subject to corporate favoritism and control. There is a reason that the big and powerful special interests want to get rid of access to a jury and want to force people into mandatory arbitration. They are not doing it for the sake of having their adversaries and opponents get better access to justice; they are doing it to shut off access to the civil jury. They want everybody forced into rigged games.[[Page S6748]]  We ought to be fighting to preserve and enhance the civil jury as an element of the uniquely American system of self-government. Our forefathers fought and bled and died to create and preserve this system of government in which the civil jury has a vital role. From Alexander Hamilton to Alexis de Tocqueville, to William Blackstone, to William Rehnquist--you can go on and on in our history with people who have pointed out the vital role of our jury. Squelching it is the task of the wealthy and powerful, mighty corporations that seek to squelch it and force everybody into corporate-friendly, mandatory arbitration.  We should think on this question in the long view--not who gets the immediate benefit of not having to face trained lawyers, not having to face people in an open forum, not having to be before a free and independent jury. We should think of the message of our Founding Fathers, who put the need for a civil jury right into the Declaration of Independence, who demanded it as part of our Bill of Rights, and who saw it as an essential element of our liberty.

But my second question goes to a further point, which is that the power of a court in a matter like that includes the power not just to award damages but to provide other relief: to direct the company to quit the fraud, to give orders to people to clean up their act, to promise never to do it again, and so forth. I am not aware of any arbitration panel that has ever been given that authority or has ever used their limited power as arbiters or arbitrators to try to influence the behavior of the corporation.  Is there not also a significant difference between an individual consumer being forced to go to an often stacked arbitration panel to pursue a claim that is so small, it is not worth their money, and the simple power to provide the real remedy the public seeks, as the Senator so wisely said, to protect the next consumer? It is not just about the people who got their pockets picked, who paid their unreasonable fee, who got defrauded; it is about stopping it so the future consumer is protected. I am not familiar with arbitration panels having that power.  ",CREC-2017-10-24-pt1-PgS6738-2.txt,1823,"REMEMBERIG DR. OSCAR PERRY BUTLER, JR.",2017.0,24.0,October

751,topic-id,2097,"Mr.President, it is nice to see the distinguished Senator in the chair presiding. I am not sure, in my 183 ``Time to Wake Up'' speeches, I have yet had the pleasure of speaking while the Senator was presiding.  I am here to once again call for us to wake up to the corporate capture of Congress and this administration--the capture of governance by the fossil fuel industry that keeps us from honestly addressing climate change. There is a saying that ``personnel is policy.'' Well, the Trump personnel for positions at the Environmental Protection Agency reflect a policy to undo the public welfare mission of the Agency and align it with the special interests of the fossil fuel industry.  There is a word for that. It is called corruption, at least as the Founding Fathers knew the meaning of that term. It starts at the top. Trump named Scott Pruitt head of the Pruitt has a long record of dark money fundraising and long, cozy relationships with Big Energy industry political donors. In effect, he is a tentacle of the fossil fuel climate denial operation, wiggling and wriggling in the Administrator's chair, near his new $25,000 ``cone of silence'' secret communications booth that he built so no one would hear him checking in with his masters.  Results are as expected. The New York Times has reported: ``How Rollbacks at Scott Pruitt's EPA are a Boon to Oil and Gas.'' No surprise. In the 4 months that followed his appointment, Pruitt moved to undo, delay, or otherwise block more than 30 environmental rules benefiting his fossil fuel friends. This regulatory rollback, larger in scope than any over so short a time in the Agency's near-half century history, went straight into the pockets of the fossil fuel industry.  Longtime Pruitt benefactor Devon Energy is cashing in dividends on its investment in Scott Pruitt's political career, as Pruitt is working to eliminate rules on the leaking and flaring of methane, and has rescinded requirements for reporting methane emissions. Devon, as you may recall, is that company whose letter to the EPA Pruitt put on his own Oklahoma attorney general letterhead to mask Devon's hand and submit their work as his own official work as attorney general of his  So this hand-in-glove relationship between Devon as the hand and Pruitt as the glove goes back a long way. The EPA has career scientists and legal experts who bring decades of experience in environmental law and science to the EPA who are all being cut out as the Administrator takes drastic steps to undo environmental protections. Just this week, EPA scientists were yanked from a conference in Rhode Island where they were going to talk about climate change. The matter of climate change on Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island is pretty significant. This is the day's Providence Journal, our leading newspaper in Rhode Headline: ``Will climate change negate Bay cleanup?'' It has a big map of Narragansett Bay with all the facilities at risk of being flooded and overwhelmed. It is front page news.  It is a matter of extreme importance in Rhode Island, and EPA yanked out its scientists. They weren't allowed to come down and talk at an event where they were going to talk about climate change. It is not just yanking the scientists. Here is a New York Times article by Lisa Friedman from October 20. Headline: ``EPA scrubs a climate website of `climate change.' '' An EPA website has been scrubbed of scores of links. ``About 15 mentions of the words climate change have been removed from the main page alone. . . .''  It is not just at Here is today's exclusive headline: ``The Interior Department scrubs climate change from its strategic plan.'' I mean, they act as if this is the Soviet Union and the government is allowed to tell scientists what they can say and not say and put phony propaganda onto official websites and keep scientists from going to meetings because they might actually tell the truth about climate change.  I am the son and grandson of Foreign Service officers. I grew up serving in countries that did that, where the government could tell the scientist: No, you don't say that. No, you don't go there. No, this is the party line. I never thought that would happen in the United States of America--and here we are.  To aid Pruitt in his fossil fuel industry crusade, our President has nominated a parade of fossil fuel lackeys, lobbyists, and operatives whose main qualification seems to be allegiance to their corporate clients and benefactors. It is not just the fossil fuel industry that gets their hacks planted in government offices.  Do you remember in the ``Cat in the Hat,'' where they had Thing One and Thing Two running around? Let's look at Hack One and Hack Two, who just cleared committee today in the Pruitt ``EPA for Sale'' roster.  Hack One is a toxicologist who consults for major chemical corporations and has spent the better part of his professional life fighting regulation of potentially toxic compounds in consumer goods. His name is Michael President Trump nominated him to run the EPA Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution A lobbying group for sellers of pesticides, fungicides, and rodenticides called Dourson ``a perfect fit'' for the job--the perfect industry hack for that job, more like.  Hack Two is William Wehrum, nominated to run the EPA Office of Air and Wehrum is a lobbyist who has represented a host of major industrial and energy corporations, and the Rubber Manufacturers Association, the American Forest and Paper Association, and the American Petroleum President George Bush actually nominated this guy to the same post in 2006, but the White House withdrew his nomination because it was so controversial.  Well, that was 2006. That was before Citizens That was before that decision amped up industry power to the point where it can now ram through conflicted and objectionable candidates with--as happened this morning--unanimous Republican support. Not one Republican Senator on the committee would voice an objection.  When Senators asked questions for the record in the Environment and[[Page S6802]]Public Works Committee nomination hearing on Wehrum and Dourson, these captured nominees played dumb about the central issues and programs they will oversee if confirmed.  For instance, I asked Dourson if he agreed that ``the tobacco industry manipulated and obfuscated scientific research into the dangers of smoking for decades.'' Dourson, who conducted scientific studies designed, reviewed, and paid for by the tobacco industry and whose name is all over, in hundreds of places, the discovery records of the tobacco industry's denial operation, replied: ``I do not have firsthand knowledge to comment.''  I ``do not have firsthand knowledge to comment''? This is the President's selection to run the office that protects Americans from dangerous chemicals who doesn't know the tobacco industry's history of falsifying science? He worked for them. He was part of it.  Remember that the tobacco industry was taken to court by the U.Department of Justice--back when the Department of Justice would take an industry to court--and the Department of Justice won a judgment declaring that tobacco had engaged in a fraud conspiracy to deny tobacco's harms. Dourson sees no evil. He knows nothing.  I asked him whether he believes that hydrofluorocarbons are greenhouse gases and about the global warming potential of methane. His response: I am not sufficiently familiar with the definition of greenhouse gases and do not have the expertise to answer these questions.  He is not familiar with the definition of greenhouse gases? This is basic high school science. Every one of us has a home State university that teaches this stuff. This has been science for more than 100 years.  On to Hack Two, Bill When I asked Wehrum about carbon dioxide's role in the observable effects of climate change, he replied: ``The degree to which manmade greenhouse gas emissions are contributing to climate change has not been conclusively determined.'' This claim just doesn't match the scientific record.  The EPA--the very Agency to which Mr.Wehrum is nominated, along with NOAA--states that ``carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas that is contributing to recent climate change.'' This consensus is held by published climate scientists, by scientific agencies and societies, by all of our National Laboratories, and by universities in America and around the globe.  As I said, every one of us in this room--I haven't found an exception yet, and I have looked, but I expect every Senator has a home State university that doesn't just know this to be true, but it teaches it in its curriculum. But Hack Two sees no evil. He knows nothing.  Wehrum's disregard for well-established science provides a grim preview of what we can expect from him if confirmed. His predictable dodging falls in lockstep with Administrator Pruitt, who has stated he does ``not agree that [carbon dioxide] is a primary contributor to the global warming that we see.'' That puts him in a very small circle of people, every one of whom I think is connected by money to the fossil fuel industry.  I asked Mr.Wehrum what he believes is a healthy standard for ozone. Now, bear in mind that one of the goals of the Clean Air Act is to set national ambient air quality standards for ozone, that the office to which he is nominated oversees this ozone standard, and that the EPA has had ozone standards in place since 1971, more than 45 years.  In response to my question, Wehrum answered: ``I am not familiar with the current science on the health effects of ozone, so I cannot comment on your question as to the appropriate level of the standard.'' Really?  I asked Wehrum whether he agreed with EPA's 2009 finding that the current and projected concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations. I asked if he would commit not to narrow or weaken the EPA's endangerment finding. Wehrum wrote back that he had not read the endangerment finding or the record prepared in support of the finding; therefore, he said: ``I currently do not have a view.'' I currently do not have a view? That is funny.  I bet he had a view when he was being paid by the Rubber Manufacturers Association, the American Forest & Paper Association, and the American Petroleum I guess it was the miraculous, evaporating view.  Maybe these ``see no evil'' nominees, Dourson and Wehrum, don't know the basics of the problems they would confront. Maybe they just don't know, but let's not be fooled here. Polluters have paid these nominees well for their services over the years. They were expert enough to be hired by industry groups as lobbyists and consultants. We know where their allegiances lie. We know who has been paying them. We know whom they will serve.  A preview of coming attractions, coming up before the EPW soon is Andrew Wheeler, Trump's nominee for the EPA's second in command. Wheeler was a top lobbyist for the coal mining behemoth, Murray Not only did this company support Trump's campaign and provide $300,000 to help pay for his inauguration, Murray Energy has also donated to Pruitt-affiliated political action committees to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars. I can't wait to hear his answers on the role of coal in climate change, childhood asthma, and mercury poisoning.  The sad part of all of this is, the polluting interests that own these nominees also throw their weight around in So good luck getting an honest look at this mess through congressional oversight.  Over and over, appalling nominees get through confirmation with no Republican dissent, more ``see no evil.'' It is just wrong.  For now, the American public will pay the price of dismantling these regulatory safeguards. They will pay the price in poisonings and carcinogenic exposures, in rising seas and raging wildfires, in childhood asthma and northbound tropical diseases. Mark my words, one day there will be a reckoning for all of this.  When captured EPA officials put payback to their donors first and clean air and public health a way distant second, it stinks. It is crooked by any reasonable definition of the term. It is corrupt in exactly the way the Founding Fathers understood corruption.  The fossil fuel industry will one day be held to account for this binge of corruption and manipulation. ExxonMobil, Koch Industries, Arch Coal, Murray Coal, Peabody Coal, you own this just as the Republican Party does.  I yield the floor.

243,topic-id,1925,"Mr.Speaker, it is budget day. I don't know if you were as excited about that when you got out of bed this morning as I was, but, to be fair, I sit on the Budget  I have the great honor of serving on the Rules Committee, and that is why I have the great honor of bringing this rule to the floor today. But I serve on the Rules Committee by night. By day, I serve on the Budget Committee with my friend Mr.Pascrell and others, and we have been working since January to produce a budget for the United States of  I have got to tell you, Mr.Speaker, we produced a whale of a budget coming out of the House Rules You remember that budget, you supported that budget. We did a fantastic collaborative job bringing that budget to the floor, and then it went to the United States  Now, you know how this happens, Mr.We all grew up watching, ``I am just a bill sitting here on Capitol Well, it is a long, long journey to the capital city, it is a long, long wait while I am sitting in committee.'' We all know the song from our childhood.  It is a long process to move a bill through, and nine times out of ten, it comes back differently from the United States Senate than the way we sent it over there.  Well, Mr.Speaker, we have an opportunity today by concurring with the Senate amendment, and if we pass this rule, that is what we will have an opportunity to do. If we pass this rule, we will have an opportunity to have the debate, concur in the Senate amendment, and bring a unified budget to the floor.  Now, what does that mean, Mr.Speaker?  We have already been working on appropriations bills this cycle, and for the uninitiated, that is the bulk of the Federal spending that goes on. All of the mandatory spending that you and I both know about, Mr.Speaker, Medicare, Social Security, those important income support programs on which so many Americans depend, that money is already going out the door.  So today what we have an opportunity to do in passing this budget is to create what they call reconciliation instructions, because contained inside this unified budget of which the House and the Senate agree are reconciliation instructions that allow us to bring what I believe will be the most comprehensive, fundamental reform of our Tax Code since Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan did it in 1986.  Since 1986, 4 decades ago, Mr.Speaker, we have an opportunity today to do something that no other Congress has been able to do since I have been an adult, and I am excited about that opportunity.  Now, to be fair, we are going to have a lot of disagreement about how to get that done. That is not the debate we are having today. For any of my colleagues or anybody back home, Mr.Speaker, who is worried that right here in this debate on a Wednesday, we are going to sort out our entire Tax Code, fear not, fear not. That is not the debate we are having today.  The debate we are having today, Mr.Speaker, is will we or will we not take on the challenge of reforming our Tax I believe that we will.  The debate that we are going to have today is will we or will we not confront the fact that America has one of the least competitive tax codes in the world, but Americans deserve one of the most competitive tax codes in the world.  The debate we are going to have today, Mr.Speaker, is not about the details of tax reform, but about the premise of can we do better for the American people or can we not.  I have the great benefit, Mr.Speaker, of not having to learn what I know about this Chamber from watching it on TV or reading it in the headlines. I consider myself very blessed to have the opportunity to serve among these men and women. If I just had to read about them in the headlines, I would have a very low opinion of them. I confess, I would have a low opinion. But because I get to work with these men and women, Mr.Speaker, I get to see the real commitment to their constituencies, the real commitment to their home States, the real desire to deliver on behalf of their constituencies and on behalf of the United States of  We may have a divisive debate today. We sometimes do. But my prediction here in hour one, Mr.Speaker, is that by the time we leave this floor, we are going to have an agreement to take on one of the challenges that no party has been able to take on since Democrats and Republicans came together in 1986 to get it done.  It is my great hope that we will use that model, that we will repeat that model, that we will improve upon that model, and that we will produce something that all of our constituency can be proud of. I know that America is hungry for tax reform, and I believe we can deliver it for them.  Mr.Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this rule, support the underlying concurrence in the Senate amendment.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  (Mr.McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia, my friend Mr.Woodall, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in very strong opposition to this rule. Today, House Republicans are pushing a job-killing budget so they can use fast-track reconciliation procedures to steamroll through their billionaires-first tax plan.  Mr.Speaker, we are supposed to be the people's We ought to have the people's budget, a budget that helps the millions of Americans who sent us here to Congress, not a budget that helps only a few, the well-connected and the well-off.  I disagree with Mr.This is not a time to celebrate. This is a terrible budget. This budget will devastate America's investments in good[[Page H8158]]paying jobs, it threatens growing wages and the bedrock promise of a secure and healthy retirement. It makes cuts across the board that would hurt seniors, children, veterans, and the hardworking people across this country who are already struggling to get by.  Why are Republicans doing this?  Well, it is all in the name of fast-tracking the Ryan-McConnell tax plan, which explodes the deficit by $1.5 trillion, and then provides multitrillion-dollar tax breaks for the wealthiest We Democrats think this is a horrible idea.  What is particularly astonishing is the blatant hypocrisy of Republican leaders pushing this deficit-busting budget. Republicans are always telling us how much they care about the deficit, but when it comes to giving their beloved tax cuts to their billionaire friends, they suddenly develop a convenient case of amnesia. They say: What deficit? Don't worry. These tax breaks will pay for themselves.  Mr.Speaker, this is absurd. In this Republican-controlled Congress, we can now say with certainty that the deficit and debt no longer matter. All of the talk by Republicans, well, they didn't really mean it.  If Republicans really cared about the deficit, they would in no way imaginable bring up a bill, a budget that is as reckless as this to the floor. This kind of shows what they truly believe, where their values are, where their priorities are.  How many times have Republicans talked about the importance of a balanced budget?  The Speaker called for a deficit-neutral tax plan in his Better Way agenda. Well, I guess this debt-creating budget is the ``Somewhat Less Better Way'' plan.  Your budget chair took to Twitter just 2 weeks ago to chastise Senate Republicans for not pursuing a balanced budget, yet now she is fully in support of their budget, which adds $1.5 trillion to the deficit with no way to pay for it.  Now, let me spell this out for my Republican friends. This is not a balanced budget. Clearly, Republicans desperately need a refresher on basic arithmetic.  Mr.Speaker, there is absolutely nothing balanced about hitting middle class families and millions of hardworking Americans with cuts while giving billionaires and corporations tax cuts they simply do not need. Billionaires aren't knocking down our door asking for more tax breaks. This is disgusting. This is shameful.  The Republican budget destroys middle class jobs by stealing hundreds of billions of dollars from investments in infrastructure, job training, advanced energy, and research and development. It devastates Medicare and It demands deep cuts to safety net programs like I am talking about food for hungry children and hardworking families. It goes after college affordability. It makes college more expensive for working families. It undercuts key supports for veterans and their families.  What is particularly offensive is that Republicans are using this terrible budget as a means of passing tax cuts for the wealthy as quickly as possible regardless of the consequences and without bipartisan support.  The tax reform framework supported by Republicans in Congress will raise taxes on the middle class and cut taxes for the wealthy. Under the Republican plan, the top 1 percent would receive 80 percent of all tax benefits. Let me repeat that. The top 1 percent would receive 80 percent of all tax benefits. Give me a break.  Those making more than $900,000 a year would receive an average tax cut of more than $200,000. Think about that. A person working full time in minimum wage makes $290 a week before taxes. And under this plan, people who make over $432 an hour, $900,000 a year, would get a massive tax break. Corporations will receive a tax cut totaling $2 trillion.  Who loses in this plan, Mr.Speaker?  According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, one in three middle class taxpayers earning between $50,000 and $150,000 would actually receive a tax increase, and nearly half of middle class families with kids will see their taxes go up.  Can you believe that: raising taxes on the middle class to pay for tax cuts for billionaires and corporations?  This is insane.  To make matters worse, Republicans are planning to steamroll their tax plan through We are reading in the press that we might see actual text of their plan next week and maybe a markup and floor consideration a week or two after that.  Really? Don't you think we owe it to our constituents to have thoughtful, open debate on this legislation which will impact every single one of them?  I guess not.  Democrats agree that our tax system needs to be updated, to be more fair, and especially to be more fair to the middle class and to working families. We have always been willing to engage in real bipartisan tax reform, but the Republican tax framework is not tax reform. It is just one more GOP multitrillion-dollar giveaway to the wealthiest at the expense of the middle class and working  In all my time in Congress, I have never seen a budget and a tax plan that harms so many just to benefit so few. I urge my colleagues to vote against this rule, to vote against this cruel Republican budget, and to oppose a tax plan that puts wealthy corporations and the top 1 percent ahead of hardworking middle class families.

244,topic-id,2629,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I had an opportunity to mention at the beginning that we might be debating the details of the tax reform plan that does not exist today. I see that we are, in fact, going to do that.  There are a lot of studies out there on this tax reform plan that does not yet exist, but let me tell you that we can all agree that we have the single least-competitive Tax Code on the planet today. We can all agree that with the click of a mouse, a company can transfer its assets overseas and grow jobs there instead of growing jobs here.  Let us have the debate that we want to have about who should bear the burden of American taxation. That is a legitimate debate and we should have it. But let us not have the debate about whether foreign workers should benefit or American workers should benefit from American capital, because that answer should be clear in the hearts and minds of every single Member of this  We have an opportunity, Mr.Speaker, to go from worst to first. Now, I confess that I don't actually expect to get all the way to first. I will settle for getting up in the top five and getting out of the bottom five when it comes to being able to lead in this country. But I want to mention, Mr.Speaker, what I think is a source of frustration of constituencies on both sides of the aisle, and that is the us-against-them conversation that goes on day in and day out.  I looked at the chart my friend from Massachusetts brought down to the House floor. It happened to be in university colors of Georgia's red and black, but I can see that as a representative of all the hardworking families in my district, that chart didn't do anything to inspire me about the impact of tax reform going forward.  My friend quoted the Tax Policy Now, The Wall Street Journal called the Tax Policy Center a shill for those groups that don't want to see any tax reform of any kind, but that is currently. The Tax Policy Center has been doing research for a long time. The research my friend from Massachusetts quoted was a study of a bill that does not yet exist. The research I am going to quote is of historical tax rates in this country.  What my friends at the Tax Policy Center said is that about 30 percent of Americans--one-third of Americans--pay no income taxes today; that the Tax Code, as it exists today, protects them from any tax liability at all.  Now, what we are proposing when we get into fundamental tax reform, Mr.Speaker, is to double the standard deduction. For those families that are already claiming the standard deduction, we are talking about doubling it. Now, the brackets are still in question, the details are still in question, but we are talking about doubling the number of folks who don't have to deal with the IRS at all.  Today, about 30 percent of American families don't pay any income taxes,[[Page H8159]]and that same 30 percent gets a refundable tax credit that rebates to them their entire Social Security and Medicare contribution that they make and the entire Social Security and welfare contribution that their employer makes on their behalf.  Now, these are not my numbers; these are the Tax Policy Center's numbers, that a full third of Americans aren't paying one penny in Federal income tax or Federal payroll tax of any kind.                              {time}  1245  Now, I am not here to debate the wisdom of that, Mr.I am here to tell you that I don't know how much lower I can cut taxes in that group. I don't know how in the world I can lower the tax burden on folks who are not only paying no income taxes, but are having all of their payroll taxes rebated to them also.  Is this a group we should talk about, Mr.Speaker? Should we talk about folks who are grabbing onto the bottom rung of the economic ladder and struggling to climb to the top?  We should, and we do.  Should we talk about how it is that the entitlement system, the benefit system in this country, is trapping people at the bottom of the ladder and not allowing them to climb to the top?  We should.  I would say to you, Mr.Speaker, that it would be misleading to the American public to suggest that this tax bill is focusing its attention in one direction instead of another direction. The fact simply is that I can't lower taxes any more at the bottom of the spectrum.  We are talking about lowering taxes on corporations. That doesn't inspire many people. I have that conversation regularly: Rob, what in the world are you doing lowering taxes on corporations?  I support the FairTax, and in the spirit of folks who are not particularly enthusiastic about tax reform, I am not in that camp. I am enthusiastic about tax reform. I just thought there was a better way. I couldn't get the votes to have my better way done.  My better way is the FairTax, and what I would say to you is corporations don't pay taxes. Corporations do not pay taxes. They collect taxes from their consumers in the form of higher prices, from their employees in the form of lower wages, or from their shareholders in the form of lower capital--lower capital returns.  Now, lest you think: Rob, you are just a conservative Republican from the Deep What do you know about this?  I will again quote the Tax Policy Center, which says that a full 20 percent of the corporate income tax burden falls on workers. Fair enough. If we want to argue about where the tax rates are going to end up and how the cuts are going to look and what the policies are going to be, let's have that debate.  Let us not mislead the American people into believing there is a free lunch anywhere in this Tax We have an opportunity to move from worst to first, and every single American, regardless of their region, regardless of their politics, is going to benefit from that change. They benefited from it when Democrats and Republicans came together to do it in 1986, and they will benefit from it when we come together and get it done today, as I believe that we will. We must.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, boy, I don't even know where to begin after that.  My good friend, the gentleman from Georgia, made reference to the Tax Policy Center, and I have the report from the Tax Policy Center here. In fact, it is their analysis that was the basis for that chart that I held during my opening remarks, which said that the top 1 percent would receive 80 percent of the tax breaks based on the Republican framework.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record excerpts from the Tax Policy Center report.  [From the Urban Institute & Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center                          Staff, 29, 2017]            A Preliminary Analysis of the Unified Framework                                Abstract       The Tax Policy Center has produced preliminary estimates of      the potential impact of proposals included in the ``Unified      Framework for Fixing Our Broken Tax Code.'' We find they      would reduce federal revenue by $2.4 trillion over ten years      and $3.2 trillion over the second decade (not including any      dynamic feedback). In 2018, all income groups would see their      average taxes fall, but some taxpayers in each group would      face tax increases. Those with the very highest incomes would      receive the biggest tax cuts. The tax cuts are smaller as a      percentage of income in 2027, and taxpayers in the 80th to      95th income percentiles would, on average, experience a tax      increase.

Did I just make that up?  I will tell the gentleman where I got it from. It is basically the Republican report in the Senate on the budget. Let me read from their report here.  It says: ``This title includes two reconciliation instructions to the Senate committees. The first would allow the Finance Committee to reduce revenues and change outlays to increase the deficit by not more than $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years.''  These are the words of Republicans in the  The gentleman wants to know why we are talking about the tax plan. It is because we are presented here with a budget that essentially fast tracks a tax plan. He is right, we don't have all the details yet because it is being negotiated and written in some back room somewhere in this building. I wish I knew where it was so we could maybe try to find out some more details. But what we do know is the framework that the Republicans have put forward, and that is the basis for the analysis that economist after economist have stated that this budget basically is a giveaway to the wealthiest individuals in this country, and it is not somehow a break for the middle class. It is the exact opposite.  This is a gift for billionaires and millionaires, and it does nothing for working families. That is why this is all relevant. This budget puts in place procedures for the Republicans to fast track a tax bill that they are now writing in some back room somewhere that nobody will see probably until the last minute, and basically it will be rushed through here, and it is a big giveaway to the wealthiest individuals in this country. I just wanted to clarify that for the  Mr.Speaker, let me say that Republican plans for tax reform would also eliminate the State and local tax deduction, called This deduction prevents millions of middle class families from being taxed twice on the same income by deducting already-paid State and local taxes from their Federal income tax.  Half the people hit by this tax hike would be middle class families earning a household income of less than $100,000, and local communities will also feel that pain.[[Page H8160]]  Repealing the SALT deduction, which would effectively make State and local taxes more costly for taxpayers, would put pressure on local governments to lower taxes.  The bipartisan National Governors Association said in a September 22 letter that the SALT deduction, ``has contributed to the stability of State revenues that are essential for providing public services.'' These services include healthcare, police and fire departments, and schools.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record the letter from the National Governors                               National Governors Association,                               Washington, DC, September 22, 2017.     Re Tax Reform (State and Local Tax Deduction and Municipal          Bonds).

Federal and state tax systems      are complex and often interconnected. Therefore, as Congress      considers reforms, we urge you to maintain the balance      between state and federal tax systems by preserving the      income exclusion for municipal bond interest and the      deductibility for state and local taxes.       The financing engine that drives U.infrastructure is the      $3.8 trillion municipal bond market. Changes to federal laws      and regulations should not increase issuance costs to states      for municipal bonds or diminish investor demand for them. If      federal changes make issuing municipal bonds cost-prohibitive      for states and local governments, then fewer projects could      be funded, taxes could rise, fewer jobs created, and economic      growth will suffer.       Governors also believe that no federal law or regulation      should preempt, limit, or interfere with the sovereign rights      of states. A mark of sovereignty includes the ability to      develop and operate revenue and tax systems. Deductibility of      state and local taxes has contributed to the stability of      state revenues that are essential for providing public      services. We encourage you to avoid changes to the tax code      that would undermine the ability of state and local      governments to meet the needs of the citizens whom we all      serve.       Eliminating state and local tax deductibility, moreover,      exposes a higher share of an itemizing taxpayer's income to      federal taxation because it adds back mandatory payments of      state and local taxes already paid, as taxable income.       Federal tax reform requires an intergovernmental      partnership because decisions at the federal level will      affect state and local governments profoundly. We look      forward to working with Congress on bipartisan tax reform to      maintain balance between our systems and modernize the      federal tax system to meet the needs of our citizens.           Sincerely,     Brian Sandoval,       NGA     Steve Bullock,       NGA Vice  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I want to ask Members to vote to defeat the previous question; and if we do, I will offer an amendment proposed by Representative Schneider that would prohibit any legislation from limiting or repealing the State and local tax deduction.  Mr.Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts?  There was no objection.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, to discuss this proposal and to discuss the importance of the State and local tax deduction, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.Pascrell), who has been outspoken on this issue on behalf of States and communities and middle class taxpayers.

248,topic-id,598,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, if you have wondered what kind of passion we have on the Budget Committee, I will just once again recognize how much I enjoy serving with my friend from New Jersey on[[Page H8161]]the Budget Everything you just heard from him was from the heart. I get to hear it in committee day in and day out, and I will tell you, we end up with a better product as a result of that. It is a legitimate debate to have about the State and local tax deduction. It is perfectly legitimate.  There are those from low-tax jurisdictions that ask: Why would the Federal Government and the Federal taxpayer want to subsidize those States that are higher-tax jurisdictions? There are those jurisdictions that are low-tax jurisdictions.  Because the gentleman's constituency in New Jersey makes so much money, they pay so much more in Federal income taxes. And States like mine in Georgia, States like Alabama, States like Mississippi are the beneficiary of those dollars as the Federal Government distributes them. Undeniably, there is a case to be made on both sides of this issue.  The falsehood, Mr.Speaker, is to suggest that we are deciding that issue today. We are not. We are not.  I don't blame any of my colleagues for fighting for their constituency at the height of their ability, at the highest vocal point of their capability, because issues are, at their core, local and personal to each and every one of us.  We are going to have to have this conversation and we are going to have to sort it out, and I believe it is not going to be a partisan conversation. In fact, I know it is not going to be a partisan conversation.  I know Republicans who share my friend from New Jersey's opinion, and I know Democrats who share Shelley Moore Capito's opinion on the Senate side. We know this to be true. We are going to sort this issue out, Mr. What I fear, though, is that emotions are going to run so high that we are going to miss an opportunity to figure these things out. For example, to conflate personal deductions with business deductions is to create confusion where there needn't be any.  Every business in America can deduct the meals that they serve throughout their day as a business expense. I will share with the gentleman that my family cannot deduct our meals from our income taxes.  Every business out there that has rented an apartment somewhere in order to conduct business, they can deduct that rent from their income taxes as a business expense. I will share with my friend, in the great State of Georgia, I am unable to deduct my rent as a business expense from my income tax.  There is just a fundamental difference between families and businesses, and that fundamental difference goes back to what I said at the very beginning, and that is there is only one taxpayer in this country. It is not Walmart, it is not Apple, it is not It is the American consumer. We are the only ones. At the end of the day, the buck stops with each and every American family.  The debate over how to structure a corporate income Tax Code, Mr.Speaker, is perfectly legitimate. To suggest that the fact that the personal code and the business code look different and that is somehow nefarious is to deny what is just now over 100 years of income tax policy in this country.                              {time}  1300  ",CREC-2017-10-25-pt1-PgH8157.txt,2008,LIFE IS WASHABLE PROVIDES FRIENDLY ACCESS SENSORY SAFETY KITS,2017.0,25.0,October

Everybody is entitled to their own opinion; they are not entitled to their own facts. The words my friend is reading are absolutely accurate. What they are not are absolutely binding. That is what they are not.

I would just ask of you, Mr.Speaker, and of my friends here on the floor, we have two things we can do with our voices: we can either sow consensus, or we can sow discontent.  I know that we are passionate about these things in which we believe, but to suggest, Mr.Speaker, that we are not going to come together and sort it out and do the very best we can for Americans is to sell this institution short and is to further the misunderstanding, the misimpression, the misinformation that the media sends out about us every day.

255,topic-id,381,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  We have heard a lot about the distributional analysis of tax reform, and, as I have suggested, it is hard to do. Folks who make a whole lot of money, like my friend from New Jersey's constituency, they pay a whole lot more in taxes. I hope that one day my constituency makes as much money as my friend from New Jersey's constituency, and if we can stimulate the economy the way that I believe that this tax proposal will, we are going to have a shot at getting that done.  But we have to have these conversations about limiting tax deductions for the wealthiest Americans if we are going to solve the issues that my friends have raised. And reading right out of that Senate budget report, the whole purpose of considering the State and local tax deduction and considering modifying it, capping it, eliminating it, whatever you want to insert there, Mr.Speaker, is designed around limiting those tax deductions that only benefit the wealthiest among us--that only benefit the wealthiest among us. That is the conversation that folks are trying to have.  Again, Mr.Speaker, there is so much more that we agree on than that we disagree on in this But it appears, time and time again, we come to the House floor and focus, in the most shrill voices, on the 20 percent of those things that divide us instead of the 80 percent of those things that we could come together and deliver on for our constituency.  Tax reform doesn't have to pass with 51 votes in the We move reconciliation bills through the Senate with 60 votes. We have moved them through the Senate with 70 votes. We have moved them through the Senate with 80 votes.  Growing the American economy, Mr.Speaker, is a commonsense goal that is shared in every single region and in every single political quarter. Let's not make this about us here. Let's make this about our bosses back home. We can, and we should, and I believe that we will.  I reserve the balance of my time.

258,topic-id,865,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to agree with some of what my friend had to say.  There will be absolutely no family that goes untouched. If you would like to go to the Council of Economic Advisers web page, Mr.Speaker, you can see their most recent report, which suggests, on average, $4,000 in additional wages for every wage earner in this country, every family in this country, making a difference for economic growth.  We all know that economic growth matters. More jobs mean more pressure on labor. More pressure on labor means higher wages. Higher wages mean more income for the Federal Government in taxes and more income for families to put into their pocket.  We are hearing about zombies and surprises and tricks. You can tell that Halloween is right around the corner, and scaring folks is kind of the tagline of Halloween, Mr.Speaker; and, sadly, that is what we see going on here today.  I promise you, you have not heard a single bipartisan word about this tax plan from my friends on the other side, so I am going to provide those words for my friends. I will read from yesterday's Wall Street Journal, Mr.Speaker: ``In 2012, President Obama and his advisers proposed lowering the corporate tax rate because it `creates good jobs and good wages for the middle class folks who work at those businesses.' ''                              {time}  1315  We can argue about what the tax reform ought to look like. What we can't argue about is the benefit for American families of tax reform.  In 2013, Lawrence Summers, President Clinton's Treasury Secretary and[[Page H8163]]Chairman of President Obama's Economic Council, argued that the tax on corporate profit creates a burden without commensurate revenues for the government, and that changing it is as close to a free lunch for the American taxpayer as reformers will ever get. That was President Obama's Treasury  Again, we can argue about what it looks like. What we can't argue about is what it is intended to do and what leading experts believe it will do. In 2015, Democrat Chuck Schumer and Republican Rob Portman cosponsored a Senate bill to reduce the top corporate tax rate, which is the highest of the 35 countries in the OECD today.  As Chuck Schumer says: ``Our international tax system creates incentives to send jobs and stash profits overseas, rather than creating jobs and economic growth here in the United States.'' We can fix that together, and we will fix that together.  Bill Clinton, in 2016, said he regretted raising the corporate tax rate to its current level for exactly those reasons.  Who is advantaged by trying to persuade the American people that something nefarious is going on here? Who is advantaged by that? I don't know about my friend's constituencies, Mr.Speaker, but my constituency wants to believe we are making things work together. My constituency wants to believe in rolling up our sleeves and sorting things out together. My constituency wants to believe that we are united in making a difference for them together.  We have this opportunity. If we pass this rule and we concur in the underlying Senate amendment, we will move forward on tax reform that will leave no American family behind.  The best government program we have in this country is the program that allows jobs to develop so folks can have one. The best program we have in this country, Mr.Speaker, is one that allows wages to rise so that folks can earn more. My constituency is not looking for anything from the other side of the aisle except cooperation on freeing up the marketplace so that my constituency can go to work, so that folks can go and make their own pathway and future forward. We can do it in ways we haven't done together since 1986, Mr. Who is advantaged by convincing folks that cooperation, consensus, making a different together is dead? I don't believe anyone. In fact, I would tell you that not just the debate but the body politic is damaged by those concerns, Mr. Mr.Speaker, I hope we will join together and refute those. I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I would just say to the gentleman from Georgia, we don't need lectures on cooperation and bipartisanship. We have offered to work with Republicans on tax reform. We have offered to work with Republicans on improving the Affordable Care Every time the Republicans talk about rolling up their sleeves, we are not there. We are not invited.  So if you want bipartisanship, open up this process. Go back to regular order. Hold hearings. Listen to our ideas.

We want bipartisanship, but we don't need any lectures from anybody on the other side of the aisle.  This has been the most closed Congress in history.

I can't disagree with a word he said right up until it got to the end where he said to vote against the budget. Right up until there, we were on the same page.  There is so much that we could do together. My friend spoke out on behalf of small businesses and family farmers. As the Tax Code exists today, when you see my friends put up charts about tax benefits going to the top 1 percent, they are talking about those small business and family farmers. They are talking about that small business in my district that has plowed every single penny back into the business--back into the business for new technology to make their employees more productive, back into the business to open up a new facility, back into the business to add more distribution, because they have got 350 families who depend on them to make that business successful so that those 350 families can put food on their table.  But when the Tax Code is analyzed, Mr.Speaker, when the IRS sends back the statistics, that small business in my district that sends every single penny back into the business, they look rich. They look like they are the wealthiest, and they are not. They are those small family farmers. They are those small family businesses that are trying to make a difference.  I want to say, because my friend from Wisconsin had a very significant concern about blowing holes in deficits, Mr.Speaker, as you know from your experience, one cannot pass tax reform that is permanent through reconciliation if it adds to deficits in the out years. That is what is so wonderful about this process, Mr.I support what my friend from Wisconsin said about keeping an eye on deficits. I[[Page H8164]]support what my friend said about making sure Medicare and Social Security are growing, which they do when people go back to work and when folks earn more money.  I don't want to be in the business of lecturing my colleagues, Mr.I want to be in the business of working with my colleagues. But folks have a choice when they show up to work every day.

You can't talk about open, transparent processes and then, as we just heard from the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Doggett), have the Ways and Means Committee which is writing this tax bill behind closed doors without any help from the Democrats, but having no hearings--not allowing any administration official to come up and testify.  How is that an open and transparent process? How does that encourage the spirit of cooperation and bipartisanship? I mean, I thought my friends would have learned from their terrible experience with their repeal and replace of the Affordable Care Act what happens when you write bills behind closed doors without bipartisan input, without even the committees of jurisdiction, by the way, in that case, deliberating on what the final product should be.  I thought you would have learned from that process, and you ended up failing at the end of the day. I hope that this effort that my Republican friends are now undertaking for tax cuts for wealthy people in this country, I hope that that fails as well.  A lousy process usually leads to a lousy product. My friends on the other side of the aisle have mastered the art of lousy processes. In the Rules Committee, almost virtually everything is closed. Everything is shut down. Germane amendments routinely deny the ability for Members to offer them on the House floor because the Republicans don't want to deal with them. They are afraid they might lose. They don't want to have the debate.  If you want cooperation, if you want a bipartisan tax reform bill, then you just can't say it; you have to do something. In 1986, the last time Congress did a comprehensive tax reform, we had 30 days of full committee hearings spanning over a year. There were 26 days of markup between September and This time, the timelines being reported in the press are maybe just a week, or a little bit more, if that.                              {time}  1330  Again, if recent history is any indication, we might not even get that. A bill might just miraculously appear one day and be rushed to the floor so that no one has time to read it or analyze it and so that none of our constituents have time to understand what is really happening here.  So I go back to that chart. One percent--1 percent--of the wealthiest interests in this country get 80 percent of the tax breaks.  If you think that that is fair, then vote for this budget, because this budget paves the way for that tax bill to move forward.  If you care about a balanced budget and if you care about deficits and debt, please vote ``no'' on this budget, because this allows us to increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion.  Whatever happened to deficits matter? I guess it is inconvenient because tax cuts for billionaires matter more than deficits and passing on that debt to our kids.  So I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question, to vote ``no'' on the rule, to vote ``no'' on this budget, and to fight like hell against this horrendous tax cut plan that my friends on the Republican side are pushing. This is bad policy. This is bad for our country. This is bad for middle class families. This is bad for not only my constituents, I would argue it is bad for your constituents.  It is about time that the people's House starts enacting legislation that benefits the people of this country, not just a few who are well off and well connected.

263,topic-id,623,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, sometimes I wish I could bring school groups down here onto the House floor just to help the next generation understand why we face some of the challenges that we face. We are down here today confronted with a tax bill that folks are certain is going to give away everything to everybody whom they don't want it to go to, and we are down here confronted with the fact that there is[[Page H8165]]no tax bill whatsoever to look at and it is going to get sprung on folks with absolutely no notice and no ability to read it.  Now, either one of those things could be true. It happens to be that neither of those things is true. But how in the world do folks listening to this debate think that we are advancing the cause of reform?  Deficits do matter, to my friend's point. They do matter, and the stranglehold that the Obama regulatory economy created here in America on economic growth reduced economic GDP growth by a full one-third--by a full one-third.  For every 0.1 percent of GDP growth, we talk about 200 billion additional dollars coming in to the Treasury over the 10-year window. So a full percentage point that we have lost is $2 trillion coming in to the  Mr.Speaker, if we had Bush-era growth instead of Obama-era growth over these last 5 years, the budget would be balanced today. But we are where we are, and the question is: Can we do better tomorrow? We can.  Now, before I talk about that, Mr.Speaker, I want to recognize some of the folks who helped to get us here. My friend from Massachusetts and I come down here and carry the debate, but the work goes on behind every single one of these doors and in every single one of these committee rooms.  I serve on the Budget Committee, Mr.Speaker, and our staff director over there, Rick May, has done an amazing job shepherding this process, standing up for the House's work product.  Jenna Spealman, Andy Morton, Tim Flynn, Robert Cogan, Patrick Louis Knudsen, Jim Bates, Mary Popadiuk, Jonathan Romito, and Elise Anderson are all working day and night--and weekends, many times--to get this product to the floor.  Steve Gonzalez, Eric Davis, Robert Yeakel, Ellen Johnson, Emily Goff, Brad Watson, Brittany Madni, and Steve Waskiewicz are folks, Mr.Speaker, who don't come here because they have political passion; they come here because they have policy passion. They want to do those things that matter. They could go anywhere they want to in town and make more money, but they stay here working for the American people because they believe they can make a difference, and they are right.  Mr.Speaker, they are right. They can make a difference. We can make a difference. This rule--this rule--if we pass it today, Mr.Speaker, will allow us to concur in the Senate amendment. Concurring in the Senate amendment does not bind us to the Senate process, but it enables us to move a bill that direction that they can process.  We have seen the holdups in the Senate, Mr.I am not happy about that. That is just the way Senate process is. We can do better. Reconciliation allows us to do better, and passing this rule enables us to do better.  Vote ``yes,'' Mr.Vote ``yes'' on this rule, and vote ``yes'' on the underlying budget and open yourself up to doing together what has not been done together in 31 years. I don't just believe we can, I believe that we will. I am excited about it, I am proud of it, and I am ready to get to it, Mr. Vote ``yes.''

366,topic-id,1910,"Mr.President, across the West, 2017 will be long remembered as the year when fire was seared into our collective consciousness and ash rained down on homes and cars. There were mass evacuations, and scores just lost their hopes and dreams.  Devastating fires have hit my home State of Oregon, but Idaho, California, Washington, Colorado, Montana, Nevada, and more all were hit by fires that always seemed bigger and hotter and more powerful than what we have seen in the past.  These are not our grandfathers' fires. There are a whole host of reasons behind this, and today I just want to talk a bit about what happened, what it has meant, and at least a commonsense approach that Senator Crapo and I have advocated for moving forward on a bipartisan basis.  The fact is, in the West, dozens of lives have been lost. Entire communities have been wiped out. An iconic national treasure in my home State, a place that Oregonians have always regarded--a special love for our Columbia River Gorge is practically in our chromosomes--it was burned over this year.  This month, a huge part of Northern California was burned. We talked to our colleagues Senator Feinstein and Senator Harris about that. It is not just rolling hills and unoccupied land; the fires swept through entire cities. Some of the stories about those whose lives were lost in California just break your heart. School has been disrupted for more than a quarter million children. In some cases, it could be weeks before classes are back up and running.  In my home State, more than 600,000 acres were burned, nearly a third of that in the Chetco Bar fire that burned through southwestern I was there to visit with folks in the community and the volunteers. There were volunteers from all over the country who were stepping up to help us deal with these fires. It sure was needed because, nationwide, almost 9 million acres burned. It is an area bigger than the size of eight States in our country--all of it up in flames. Compare that to the 1980s and the 1990s, when an average of around 3 million acres burned per year.  A brandnew report is out from the Department of the Interior forecasting how much the cost of fighting these fires is going to climb in the near future. The agency predicts a jump of 20 percent from fiscal year 2018 to 2019, and they believe that is a conservative estimate. If conditions are dry and temperatures are high, it could be even worse.  I am of the view--and it is something Senator Crapo and I have worked on[[Page S6823]]together for years now. Sometimes we believe it is the longest running battle since the Trojan It is based on the proposition that Congress should no longer sit back and accept that these fires can only get larger, cost more, and that somehow the Forest Service is not all that big a problem. We just call it the fire service, which is the way a lot of people describe it in our part of the world.  Now, the way the Federal budget works for these fires is a broken, commonsense-defying policy, and it literally adds fuel to the fires and in effect disrupts not just the West but the rest of the country because the consequences of this broken budgeting process for fighting fires takes a toll on communities across the country.  A few years ago, I came back from Oregon for a visit, and I learned that our colleague and friend, the distinguished senior Senator from New York, Mr.Schumer, had signed on to legislation that I am going to describe shortly that Senator Crapo and I have been working on. When I heard Senator Schumer had signed on to it, I, of course, was very pleased to have someone of his influence. I said to my colleagues: What am I missing here? I don't remember there being a lot of Federal forests in  Well, it turns out that at that time, Senator Schumer, because he goes all over his State, was I believe in Upstate New There was a company that made baseball bats. As a result of this broken system of fighting fire, when Senator Schumer's constituent had a problem with the baseball bats because there was an invasive species that was eating its way through these baseball bats, the local Forest Service folks didn't have the money to help him deal with this economic issue.  It might seem like a small thing to some people, but when you are talking about these smaller communities, if they don't have the resources because they are victims of this broken system of fighting fire, this is a problem. It is a problem that Senator Crapo and I have taken on now to ensure that, once and for all, we substitute common sense for a system that is everything but common sense.  What I am going to describe now is something called fire-borrowing. It starts like this: Over the years, prevention, which everybody talks about--Smokey is the symbol of prevention. Prevention gets short shrift. It gets hot and dry in our part of the world in the West, and if you don't go in there and do the preventive work, if you don't thin out the forests and it gets hot and dry, and then all of a sudden you have a lightning strike on your hands, you will have what amounts to an inferno. It just whips through the area. It knows no boundaries. Federal land is affected. Private land is affected. State land is affected. There are bigger and more expensive fires, and I can tell you that what we have seen are unprecedented fires.  In our Columbia River Gorge that I mentioned, we saw a fire leap the river. It used to be that rivers were a break. They were a break to ensure that the communities were safe. Now, in my home State, we have seen a fire actually leap the river.  So what is happening is, as prevention gets short shrift, these big fires break out, the Federal Government borrows from the prevention fund to put the fires out, and the problem just gets worse. Common sense is defied. There is absolutely irrational budgeting that ripples not just through the West but through communities all across the country, producing what I think most colleagues would say they would never expect, which is forestry personnel--when Senator Schumer visits in New York--having challenges paying for local forestry matters.  Fire prevention programs help thin out dead and dying material from forests and clear dried grasses from open landscapes--the kindling that goes up in flames when lightning strikes or when a small ground fire grows out of control. Those are the very real problems we have in the The programs we need to deal with this are being robbed because of the cycle I just described. Fire-borrowing. Short shrift. The government borrows from the prevention fund to put the fire out, and the problem gets worse. That is fire-borrowing in our part of the world.  You can look at the recent fires in California to see how dangerous this is. If fire prevention had gotten a fair shake, lives could have been saved, and businesses and property might have been spared. Western communities would not be trying to recover from the ravages of summer and fall 2017.  Many of our colleagues of both parties and now 205 groups--timber companies, scientists, environmentalists, academics, and people from all across the political spectrum--are joining Senator Crapo and me in saying that what is needed is a clean fix for the wildfire budgeting system and a complete end to fire-borrowing. We have been working on this, as I said, for years.  We know some of our colleagues want to see a variety of other policies attached, particularly policies dealing with forest management. One of the reasons I wanted to come to the floor tonight was to say that I take a back seat to no one when it comes to finding the right approach to forest management. I have written bipartisan forest management laws. But let's make sure that as we go forward on this issue, we understand that we cannot let other matters get in the way of stopping the cycle of fire-borrowing once and for all.  What Senator Crapo and I have proposed is essentially to say that the really big fires, once and for all in America, will be treated like what they really are--natural disasters. And you can look at that relatively small number of fires and say: We are going to deal with them through the disaster fund. Then you don't raid the prevention fund. And what the government scorekeepers have said in the past is that not raiding the prevention fund through fire-borrowing will, in their judgment, means fewer fires in the first place; hence, there will be fewer natural disasters if you end fire-borrowing once and for all.  My view is that we are going to go forward this year on the disaster relief issue, and I want it understood that I am going to work with Senators of both political parties to finally see this matter wrapped up and an end to fire-borrowing.  I think anyone who has kept an eye on the news or has read stories or seen reports about natural disasters understands that unfortunately disasters have visited too many of our communities--hurricanes flooding Houston, violent winds and rain in Weeks after Maria made landfall, millions of American citizens in Puerto Rico are still in desperate need of help. Our neighbors to the south suffer with the aftermath of a massive earthquake. Tornados are a threat across much of the country. In our part of the world, these wildfires are our natural disasters.  The Congress can't get up one day, come to the floor of the Senate, and just say: We are going to stop all the hurricanes and the earthquakes. There is something that Congress can do about preventing so many wildfires. We, with our legislation, want to build a new ethic of fire prevention. That is what ending fire-borrowing is really all about. It is saying that we are in effect going to take--it is almost like an old stage with a dilapidated set on it, and you just pull it out because it is outdated. That is what we are talking about with fire-borrowing. It is like an old stage that is dilapidated. It doesn't make sense for the times. We are talking about replacing fire-borrowing with a modern policy so that we can deal with the big fires as the natural disasters they are and get back in the business of putting fire prevention first and replacing a commonsense-defying Federal budget plan that has caused so much harm to folks in the  I hope my colleagues will support the Wildfire Disaster Funding Senator Crapo and I want to work with every single Senator in this Chamber to get across the finish line. We are not saying that ending fire-borrowing is going to mean there will never be another fire in this country. What we are saying is that it is past time to replace such an illogical, commonsense-defying budget system as that presented by fire-borrowing. With that, we can reduce the risk of major wildfires to communities across the  With that, Mr.President, I yield the floor.[[Page S6824]]                            ____________________",CREC-2017-10-25-pt1-PgS6822.txt,1247,DHS ACCOUNTABILITY ENHANCEMENT ACT,2017.0,25.0,October
709,topic-id,2405,"Madam President, I don't often come to the floor of the Senate to give a speech like the one I am going to give now, but today I plan to start sounding the alarm, both from the standpoint of the process and the substance of what is known about the Republican tax plan as of this afternoon.[[Page S6837]]  This morning, the House passed the budget so now it is on to tax. The debate, if the Republicans have their way, will happen at the speed of light. If they have their way, this all could be wrapped up before most Americans have even been able to put a dent in their holiday shopping.  That is exactly what the majority of Republicans is counting on. The Republicans are rushing to drive the tax giveaway to the superwealthy and the powerful corporations and to do it so quickly that most of America will really have no idea what will be going on. Their hope is simple--to do it in a way so that nobody catches on. So this afternoon, as the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, I am going to look at this from a few different angles--first, as to the process and, then, as to the policy that is on offer from the Republicans as of right now.  Right off the top, I am sure that Senators have heard that, here in the Senate and Congress, there is going to be a real debate that is going to play out in a careful and deliberate way and that there is going to be plenty of give and take. As of right now, my message to the American people is this: You have been fooled. Don't buy that. Here is what is going to happen. Anybody who expects a repeat of the kind of bipartisan, deliberate process that took place in 1986, when the Democrats and Ronald Reagan got together, is in line for some very disappointing times.  Our former colleague Senator Bradley, who served on the Finance Committee with such distinction and was a key author of the 1986 reform bill, called a couple of days ago, and I explained to him what was going on. He was just incredulous. He could not believe that this was going to be the process--that it would all be over in a matter of weeks and that it would not even be like healthcare, with the debate moving in fits and starts and stretching out over months.  If Republicans have their way, as my family used to say, this is going to be over lickety-split, and it is coming up quickly. The House plans to offer up a bill in about a week, and the Ways and Means Committee is going to jump into action. The Senate bill could come out in a matter of days later, and then it would be the Finance Committee's turn.  As most people in the Senate know, there is a normal process for these debates in committee. You usually put out draft legislation. You refine your ideas. You update your work. You share with both sides of the aisle the ideas that would make sense--those that get both sides to say: Hey, bipartisanship is about taking each other's good ideas, and politics is about taking each other's bad ideas. In this case, it is not about trying to make any bipartisan efforts at all. The normal process involves exercising a little patience, giving the officials at the Joint Committee on Taxation and in the Congressional Budget Office time to really make sense of what the numbers mean.  This is not Washington lingo. What do the numbers mean for middle-class people--the folks who are really hurting now, who are walking on an economic tightrope in trying to pay bills? We ought to make sure that people who are knowledgeable about this have the time to really look at the numbers and give us some general sense of what this means, particularly for America's hard-working middle class. Yet for this partisan tax cut and a process that will be hyperpartisan--it is designed to be an off-ramp to partisanship only--the Republicans are just blowing right by those steps that constitute the normal process that I have described.  The Congress is headed for a debate on legislation that has the potential to reshape our entire economy at a crucial time when we understand the challenge from global competition and change, but the Republicans, as of now, are not going to wait to see the facts and figures, never mind that the bill is going to affect every taxpayer in the country in one way or another. The Republicans have said that we are going to do some leaping without looking. They may not even have legislative hearings to examine the Republican tax cut bill and what the impact of it could be, which was what Senator Bradley was just stunned about because he and others worked for months with the Reagan administration in trying to do what was normal and, as of now, is not going the happen.  What is even more ominous is that, if the bill clears the Finance Committee, the debate on the Senate floor will happen in a flash. That is because, since day one of this administration, the Republicans have said--and Leader McConnell has said this repeatedly--that they want to use the most partisan process around to move the tax cut. It is another round of what is called budget reconciliation.  What this comes down to is a rejection of the kind of bipartisanship that has been proven to work on tax reform. Ronald Reagan worked hand in hand with Democrats on tax reform in 1986. The two sides brought forward their best ideas. They worked for months and months and, as Senator Bradley told me, for several years. There were dozens of hearings that dug into the specifics and carefully examined the issues. After the bill came out, the committee met over 18 days to debate and vote on the amendments. There was committee consideration--what is called a markup--that lasted a total of more than 45 hours. Then the bill came to the floor of the Senate, and, as is fitting for a piece of legislation that can reshape the whole American economy, the debate took almost a month. That is the textbook of how you successfully write bipartisan tax reform legislation. By the way, that is the model by which our former colleague Dan Coats--now a member of the Trump administration--worked with me to produce a bipartisan Federal income tax reform bill.  Yet we are not going to see any of that kind of work this time around. The road that the majority is taking us down in 2017 makes a mockery out of the bipartisan process that brought Ronald Reagan and the Democrats together. As of now, there will be 20 hours of debate--20 hours. That is it--on a bill that will transform the bottom line for every American family and will affect the hopes and aspirations of our middle class, which will drive 70 percent of the economic activity in our country for years and years. Then the debate will be over, and it will be time to vote.  What I am going to try to do here--and we will be talking often in the days ahead--is to lay out what this really means for hard-working middle-class people, because, so far, what we have seen is kind of one hand giveth and the other hand taketh away. The details for the top of the top, the megawealthy, are spelled out, but we do not see exactly how the middle class is not going to go into the hole. As of now, the numbers suggest, particularly if you have a couple of children and are in a place with high State and local taxes, that you really could fall behind. If we do not spell out what is actually at stake here and give the American people the opportunity to tune in and be heard, this process is just going to race by before anybody notices, and that is what the Republicans are counting on.  The bottom line is that, when the middle class and the American people find out what is in the Republican tax plan as it is known today, the less they are going to like it. There have been sort of two versions of it. The first came out, I believe it was, late in the spring. It was a page long--shorter than the typical drug store receipt. We got a bit more information a few weeks ago, but in both instances, as I have described, it looks like the middle class is going to get hurt, and folks who are successful and those who are at the top of the top are, basically, going to get even more.  We want all Americans to be successful. We want to give everybody the chance to get ahead, but we do not want tax breaks skewed to the very top. As of right now, the Republican tax plan is a feast for the very wealthy, and the middle class is on the menu. Even the President's top campaign adviser on taxes said that the Republicans have made $4 trillion worth of promises in this tax proposal, perhaps even more, but because of budget rules, that pricetag has to come down to $1.5 trillion for the bill to get through the That means that somebody has to pay for a whole lot of that $4 trillion of corporate goodies and handouts to the wealthy.  The Republicans seem almost allergic to raising revenue by asking those at the top to pay their fair share. Every proposal that the Republicans have put forward to pay for this tax giveaway to the top has reached right into the pockets of the middle class. Take the elimination of the State and[[Page S6838]]local deduction. It will cause pain for millions of Americans across the country, not just in the West--in places like California and Oregon--and the Northeast but for those in scarlet red areas who voted for the President on election day--places like North Carolina, Georgia, Wisconsin, and Then there is the plan to double the standard deduction while simultaneously getting rid of personal and dependent exemptions.  When you cut out all of the tax lingo--as I have said, one hand giveth and the other hand taketh away--what it means, based on the information that is out now, is that a family of six in Medford, OR, could see its taxes increase by thousands of dollars per year. That is a holiday surprise. My guess is that people are going to say that it is the nightmare before Christmas if this plan becomes law.  Even more middle-class Americans who checked on the news over the last few days probably had the wind knocked out of them when they read that their 401(k)s may be on the ropes under the Republican plan. A few days ago, the President said: No, do not touch the 401(k). But it seems to me like Republicans just cannot help themselves. When the President was asked about it again, the new Trump position was that middle-class retirements are a bargaining chip to get this lopsided tax handout through the  Let me repeat that last part. The President of the United States said that middle-class retirements are a bargaining chip in this crusade to cut taxes for the most fortunate. Nothing illustrates more clearly how this process has gone horribly wrong, and I want to make clear to the American people to watch the details. Watch the details because every time a new detail leaks out, the middle class loses.  So my bottom line, colleagues, is real tax reform ought to be about putting more dollars back in middle-class pockets, but right now the majority is taking a different tack. It amounts to a hunt for ways to force the middle class to pay for the tax breaks for those at the top.  This scheme will explode the deficit. It is a con job on the middle class. It is failed economic policy, but it could rocket in the Congress in the weeks ahead before the American people catch on.  So my counsel is, everybody ought to strap in and get ready for what is coming. Every step of the way in the Finance Committee and here on the floor, I will continue working with my Democratic colleagues to fight for middle-class priorities and tax reform, and I hope we will have some from the other side of the aisle join us. We intend to keep sounding the alarm on a Republican plan that as of now gives trillions of dollars of handouts to those at the top while hiking taxes on millions of middle-class families.  Now that the House has passed its budget, this is kicking off the debate, and the idea that we would have a bunch of fake promises to the middle class, very specific gifts to folks at the top, and somehow unicorn theories of growth that will justify this, while really creating deficits that hurt Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and our safety net--those are the issues the American people deserve to know more about. We are going to tell them a lot more about the details in the days ahead because we believe in tax reform that puts the middle-class first, doesn't give gifts to the people in the very top 1 percent, doesn't clobber Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid, and, as Bill Bradley said earlier this week in a conversation with me, is based on the kind of bipartisanship that a hugely important issue like tax reform warrants.

1002,topic-id,470,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, the bill we are debating today is not a real effort at responsible budgeting. It is a means to an end: a single-minded plan to make it easier to enact tax cuts for the wealthy and big corporations, regardless of the consequences for everyone else.  If approved by the House today, an irresponsible $1.5 trillion tax bill will come to the floor in a matter of weeks. It is being rushed because Republicans don't want the American people to know what is in it. They don't want you to find out that it overwhelmingly benefits the wealthy while increasing taxes on millions of middle class families.  Rushing through legislation that impacts nearly every American family and business is reckless, and voting on a bill that rewrites our Nation's Tax Code a week or two after it is introduced without any real input from the people who will be impacted is negligent. But that is what you do when you can't defend your own policy.  And there are a lot of unjustifiable provisions in this budget. On top of massive tax cuts for the rich, it cuts vital national investments, threatening our economic progress and our national security. It cuts more than $4 trillion in mandatory spending, including nearly $2 trillion from Medicare and Medicaid alone.  The enormity of these cuts and the severity of the consequences for American families cannot be overstated. But more cuts will be coming once the Republican tax cuts blow an enormous hole in the budget. We will see a tax on Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, nutrition assistance--on important benefits that help American families get ahead.  I know my Republican colleagues desperately want to believe that the tax cuts in their budget will pay for themselves and usher in a new era of economic growth--or at least they want the American people to believe that. But the record is clear, this approach has failed time and time again.  And now, even though the evidence and experts have concluded that these tax cuts will not create an economic boom but will, instead, lead to a higher concentration of wealth among the rich while dramatically increasing deficits and debt, my Republican colleagues are trying to do it again.  Everything we do in Congress should be about making the lives of American families better and more secure. We owe them a budget that invests in their future, a Tax Code that is fair, and a full and honest debate on both. This budget and the tax cuts that will follow are a failure on all fronts.  I, therefore, urge my Republican colleagues to abandon this dangerous budget and start addressing the needs and priorities of the American people.

1053,topic-id,402,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  As we wind down our arguments here, once again, we have had a very fascinating discussion and, once again, we seem to disagree on virtually everything.  For instance, I have heard from the other side many times over the last few days and today that we really can't say what the impact is, the claims that we are making about whether this bill will help the rich or help the middle class or help lower income individuals, because we don't have the details. Well, that is absolutely correct; we don't have the details.  But then, if we don't have the details, how can the other side talk about the huge benefits that this proposal, this tax proposal that is yet unwritten, will provide for the middle class? And how can they deny that it will benefit the wealthy disproportionately?  We know from the outline that was released by the other side in recent weeks that they intend to eliminate the estate tax. The estate tax only benefits wealthy Americans, people with estates over $11 million for a couple.  They want to eliminate the alternative minimum tax. We know the alternative minimum tax only affects wealthy individuals. There was one estimate that the one year of President Trump's tax return that we have, that in that year alone, the alternative minimum tax, if it were repealed, would have saved him $30 million. So we know that affects very wealthy people.                              {time}  1015  We know that if you reduce the top rate from 39.6 percent to 35 percent, that benefits very high-income people. So we do have enough information to draw some pretty definite conclusions about the impact that the released outline, at least, will have on wealthy Americans, and we can draw some of the same conclusions about how it will hurt middle class  If, in fact, the Republican tax bill repeals the deduction for State and local taxes. In my State, there will be half a million people who will lose an average of $9,900 of deductions every year. So we absolutely know the impact that the proposal, as we know it now, will have, and I think it is fair--given that there will be no hearings on this bill--it is fair to raise the alarms about what the potential for this bill is.

Maybe the most remarkable achievement in human history is the fact that, over the last 40 years, about 80 percent of the world's worst poverty has been eliminated.  We know the right combination of smart investments in things like research, education, infrastructure, and defense; fewer burdensome regulations; and simpler and fairer taxes creates the perfect environment for growth and innovation.  So far this year, we have secured investments in things like boosting programs for early childhood education and Head Start, and medical research at the We have done away with job-killing regulations, saving hardworking Americans billions in compliance costs and millions of hours in paperwork.  Now we have the opportunity to reform our Tax Code to help millions of Americans keep more of their hard-earned money, help small businesses create millions of new jobs, and help millions rise out of poverty.  Mr.Speaker, now is the time to act.

579,topic-id,683,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate the leadership of Mr.Zeldin and I appreciate him using that word ``learned.'' It feels good.  You know, this is an interesting thing, because I was there during the time that John Kerry and the President were negotiating this deal.  Keep in mind, this is a deal that John Kerry and the President agreed to, but nobody signed. We didn't sign it, our Senate never voted on it, and Iran didn't sign it. So this is a deal in paper only that nobody has signed. If you[[Page H8214]]were to do any business transaction in the real world, this piece of paper would be worthless.  I want to mention words of one of our previous It has been about 60 years after President Dwight Eisenhower announced that Atoms for Peace Program, and one lesson is clear: ``Civilian nuclear programs flourish only through cooperation and openness. Secrecy and isolation typically are signs of a nuclear weapons program.''  So here we are. I have in front of me the Institute for Science and International Security, August 31, 2017, and in the introduction, it says: ``One of the most serious compliance issues concerns the IAEA's access to military sites and credible verification of Section T, which prohibits key nuclear weapons development activities and controls dual-use equipment potentially usable in such activities. In this report, the issue of verifying Section T is discussed. The absence of credible implementation and verification of Section T undermines the effectiveness of the JCPOA.''  My colleague, Mr.Zeldin, brought up that we know they are using IR-6 and IR-8 centrifuges. We know they have the carbon fibers that they are not supposed to have. We also know that they have overproduced heavy water more than two times. The first time, we bought it at the American taxpayers' expense. The other two times, it has gone to The only reason you would have an excess of heavy water is if you are producing nuclear fissile material.  In addition to that, the heavy water--the inspections that we are supposed to do anytime, anywhere,--John Kerry said this over and over--anytime, anywhere, that we can go, and if they are noncompliant, the sanctions will snap back. They must have used an overstretched rubber band because nothing has ever snapped back.  With the IAEA supposedly being able to inspect anywhere, there are so many places that are off limits. It is only those areas that Iran says that we can go in and inspect. Parchin military site is a place that we know they detonated a nuclear trigger. We have not been able to go in there and check the soil, Yet we have to accept their word that they are checking the soil.  I brought this up in the committee, and I am going to repeat it here. It would be like having a drug addict testing his own urine sample and taking it to the lab. It is just not the way to do business in the 21st century on something that is so important.  During that time, when we negotiated or when the deal was being negotiated, there was an intelligence report--I don't know if you were in the Congress then, but there was an intelligence report that had always had Iran as a state sponsor of terror. The year this deal was done, state sponsor of terror was taken off. And when we questioned about it, they said it was an oversight. This deal just stinks from the beginning.  John Kerry said: No deal is better than a bad deal.  This is a bad deal. The President should decertify it. It does not take us out of the deal, but it allows us to put the pressure back on Iran so that they are fully compliant with the letter of the law.  If we don't hold up people to the letter of the law as we move forward in future negotiations, i.e., North Korea, why should they follow the letter of the law?  So this is high time that we do this. I appreciate it, and I thank the gentleman for doing this.  ",CREC-2017-10-25-pt1-PgH8212-4.txt,2115,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018,2017.0,25.0,October
744,topic-id,1463,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague for his leadership on this issue. It has been a pleasure to lead a subcommittee in the Foreign Relations Committee with Senator We have always worked in a constructive fashion on some consequential issues and none more consequential than the one before us today.  With respect to the crisis in Burma, we recently met with the lead person on an international NGO who just returned from camps in He briefed us on some of the horrible circumstances facing these individuals who have been forced out of  This last Friday, as Senator Merkley indicated, we also led a letter to Ambassador Haley regarding the Burma crisis. I would also note that we had an important hearing on this topic yesterday in the full Foreign Relations I commend our leadership for putting that together.  I want to share some of my thoughts about this crisis. Before I do, I would like to acknowledge folks back home in the State of I happen to represent a significant number of Burmese These are patriotic fellow Hoosiers, who have played an instrumental role helping to educate me and members of my team on this crisis, and I am happy we can be responsive to their concerns.  It is important for all Americans to understand what is happening in America and everything outside our shores. Burma is a country that doesn't typically capture the imagination or attention of people in the United States, but, right now, in light of this humanitarian crisis, it requires all of our attention.  The Burmese military has conducted a deplorable campaign of violence against the Rohingya Muslim minority, including the systematic use of arson, murder, and rape. Our State Department tells us that nearly 300 villages have been either partially or completely destroyed by fire just since August 25 of this year by the Burmese military. That is more than half of the approximately 470 Muslim villages in northern Rakhine  Ambassador Haley has indicated that the Burmese military's actions constitute a sustained campaign to cleanse the country of an ethnic minority--ethnic cleansing. The U.High Commissioner for Human Rights has referred to this situation as a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.  We have seen more than 600,000, who are mostly of the Rohingya ethnic minority, flee the violence in the Rakhine State and seek refuge in They travel on foot for days, carrying what they can of their belongings, carrying their young children. It is mostly women and children who make this trek. Upon arrival in Bangladesh, we have been briefed that many of them require immediate lifesaving assistance.  To put this severity in some measure of context, yesterday, our Department of State and U.Agency for International Development characterized the resulting population movement as ``almost unprecedented''--almost unprecedented--amidst all of the other challenges we have seen in recent years, including the migrant crisis coming out of the Middle East and across the shores of the Some research suggests the refugee flow from Burma has been swifter than the exodus from Rwanda in 1994.  Many Americans will say: You know, honestly, we have a lot of challenges in the world. Why should I care about this one? Well, here is why: In Burma, we see a group of people--the Rohingya--being systematically targeted because of their ethnicity. This, of course, runs afoul of our basic values, the principles upon which our country was founded. These principles inform the rules of the international order that has existed for some number of decades now. These rules are the mortar that holds the order together. We simply cannot allow certain rules of international behavior to be violated or that will encourage other bad actors, and they will continue to be undermined, thus, undermining our national interests.  Recent history demonstrates that the systematic violation of fundamental human rights sooner or later engenders security threats to Americans, to our allies, and to our collective interests--think of Tunisia, think of Syria, think of the countries of Yemen or There are almost countless examples just in recent history where we have seen or are seeing right now the depravation of basic human rights. That, in turn, is undermining our values and our national interests.  Let me apply this observation about the linkage between our values and our interests--not just domestically but internationally--to the situation in We know the past and present Burmese Governments have systematically deprived the Rohingya population of their most fundamental human rights. Not surprisingly, this has compelled a small number to join the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army,  The most recent wave of ethnic cleansing began after ARSA conducted a coordinated attack on Burmese security outposts, and the Burmese military responded with disproportionate military actions and deplorable attacks on civilians.  Here is a point the Burmese Government and the Burmese military must understand. By refusing to treat the Rohingyas as full, equal citizens and by attacking their own people who just want to live in peace, the Burmese military is only going to increase the number of Rohingyas who will be radicalized, exacerbating the very problem the Burmese military says it is trying to address. So this is not in Burma's interest. I can't emphasize that enough.  Before the most recent iteration of this crisis, in December 2016, the International Crisis Group--an international nongovernmental organization--issued a report titled ``Myanmar: A New Muslim Insurgency in Rakhine State.'' The report said a number of things, among them that the ``continued use of disproportionate force that has driven tens of thousands from their homes or across the border to Bangladesh . . . could create conditions for further radicalizing sections of the Rohingya population that transnational jihadists could exploit.''  As we saw in Syria--to choose just one comparative example--when the government fails to respect the basic human rights of their citizenry, then conflict ensues. It can lead to far wider radicalization. The conflict becomes a magnet, a magnet for international terrorists. It becomes a factory that creates more international terrorists.  In short, when governments commit systematic and large-scale violence, oppression, and injustice against its own people, it creates a fertile ground for Islamist terrorist recruitment and radicalization. This is contrary to the interests of everyone, including the Burmese  Further, if left unaddressed, the humanitarian and security situation in Burma and Bangladesh will worsen and increasingly threaten regional stability and U.national security interests.  The United States must continue to lead. There has to be an international response in We need other partners to step up and participate in that response, but the United States must continue to lead. Part of leading comes down to clarity. What do we want of the Burmese Government? I see at[[Page S6798]]least four things the Burmese Government must do.  First, the Burmese Government and their military must immediately end its ethnic cleansing campaign against the Second, the Burmese Government must address the root of this conflict by implementing the recommendations of a U.panel, the so-called Advisory Commission on Rakhine Third, the Burmese Government must permit safe access for journalists, for humanitarians, and for a United Nations fact-finding mission and all of their personnel so we can figure out precisely what is going on and who is responsible. Finally, the Burmese Government must facilitate the safe and voluntary return of all these individuals who have been displaced.  When I leave the Senate floor today, I am scheduled to immediately visit with Burma's Ambassador to the United The points I just mentioned are points I intend to reiterate directly to that  Moving forward, the United States should lead efforts to document atrocities in Burma however we can so the perpetrators can be held accountable. I also support the administration's announcement yesterday that it is exploring accountability mechanisms that are already available under U.law, including the so-called Global Magnitsky targeted sanctions.  I call on countries like China and Russia to support the suspension of all international weapons sales to the Burmese military. They should not be transferring weapons to this murderous regime.  In conclusion, as Senator Merkley and I stated in our letter on Friday to Ambassador Haley, now is the time. Now is the time to take bold and effective actions against the Burmese Government to end the violence, not just to help the Burmese people but to help stabilize the region and protect U.national security interests. Now is the time to uphold our fundamental values, the values, frankly, of civilized nations. Now is the time to work with this administration and colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make sure we can reach as peaceful and as positive a resolution to this horrible situation as possible.  I want to close by once again acknowledging the tremendous leadership of Senator I thank him for his partnership in this effort.  I yield the floor.

576,topic-id,738,"Mr.Speaker, earlier this month, President Trump decertified the Iran nuclear deal. Tonight, during this hour, several Members of Congress will be speaking here on the House floor about the President's correct and necessary decertification, and discussing the urgent need to address Iran's problematic nuclear and nonnuclear activities.  The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA, otherwise known as the Iran nuclear deal, is deeply flawed and very one-sided for what is in it, and it is fatally flawed and deeply one-sided for what is not in it.  The so-called deal props up the wrong regime in Iran, the world's largest state sponsor of terror, with a jackpot of $150 billion of sanctions relief.  The United States made a slew of permanent concessions in exchange for temporary concessions on the part of the Iranians--a point that comes into greater focus as the sunset provisions are analyzed.  This deal is not a pathway for how to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, it is a blueprint for exactly how Iran can acquire a nuclear weapon.  We can and must do better. President Obama said this agreement was not built on trust, it was built on verification. I am still waiting for an answer on how you can support a deal based on verification without knowing what the verification regime is.  The verification agreement between the IAEA and Iran still hasn't been submitted to Congress, and Secretary Kerry has admitted that he never read it.  We have learned, though, that Iran collects some of their own soil samples and inspects some of their own nuclear sites. No U.inspectors are permitted to participate in any of these inspections at all.  The verification regime must become adequate and transparent, and Americans should know what the verification agreement is.  Since the JCPOA was entered into, Iranian aggression in the Middle East, Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere has only increased. These bad activities have only gotten worse since all of the leverage that brought the Iranians to the table was negotiated away in the  Iran has continued to illegally test fire intercontinental ballistic missiles and finance terror. They even seized one of our naval vessels, subsequently holding hostage and publicly embarrassing 10 American sailors.  Iran has committed to wiping Israel off the map, and they chant, ``Death to America,'' in their streets on their holidays, all while unjustly imprisoning American citizens. They call Israel ``the little Satan'' and America ``the great Satan.'' These are, unfortunately, just a few of Iran's bad activities.  It is so important to note that Iran has not only violated the spirit of the nuclear deal with its nonnuclear bad activities, it has also violated the letter of the deal. For example, Iran spins[[Page H8213]]more IR6 centrifuges than they are allowed to under the They have assembled more IR8 rotor assemblies than they are allowed to. They have attempted to acquire carbon fiber that they agreed that they wouldn't. They stockpiled more heavy water than they were supposed to under the Iran is also not allowing any inspections at all at any of their military sites. Iran is not only violating the spirit of the deal, but they are also violating the letter of the deal.  President Trump was absolutely correct to decertify the If Iran is serious about helping turn the JCPOA into a truly reasonable agreement, then they should make those intentions clear, both in private conversations with the United States and the other countries of the P5+1, but also in their public rhetoric. Many of Iran's other bad activities will need to cease.  If Iran does not want to save the JCPOA, then the sanctions should immediately ramp up.  Throughout this next hour, we will discuss the President's correct decision to decertify, as well as the urgent need to eliminate Iran's problematic nuclear and nonnuclear activities.                              {time}  1900  Joining me tonight are Members of Congress from all across our great country who are deeply passionate about America's best interests and supportive of the President's decision to decertify the Iran nuclear deal.

I recognize House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce, Congressman Pete Roskam, and former Congressman, now CIA Director, Mike These are some of the voices during the course of these last few years on this very important issue on the need to hold Iran accountable and to fight for the best possible agreement for the United  Over the course of tonight, we discussed what was in the JCPOA, and we discussed the JCPOA as far as what wasn't in it and some of the challenges that we have faced since the JCPOA has first been entered into.  We all want to deal with Iran's bad activities. We have to ask ourselves: How are we going to do that? What is the leverage that brought the Iranians to the table to negotiate the Iran nuclear deal? How do we get that leverage back?  Now, some people out there are saying that Iran is abiding by their word and that the United States would somehow be going back on our word by the President decertifying the Iran nuclear deal. We can have a discussion about what violates the spirit of the Iran nuclear deal.  We talked about Iran's other bad activities: their financing of terror, their overthrowing of foreign governments, illegally test-firing intercontinental ballistic missiles, holding Americans hostage, and publicly embarrassing American Navy sailors. We had to pay a ransom to get hostages back in January of 2016. They call Israel the Little Satan, America the Great They pledge to wipe Israel off the map. They chant ``death to America.'' They are supporting Assad in Syria and  What do we do to deal with Iran's nonnuclear bad activities? Right now we don't have the leverage to deal with that. We really needed to bring that to the table when we were sitting down with Iran last time because, when you negotiate away the leverage that brings them to the table, what is left to deal with all of those activities that we would say violate the spirit of the JCPOA?  But people say that if the President decertifies the Iran nuclear deal, then that would mean that we are going back on our word and that Iran has been abiding by the deal. We cannot forget about all of the ways that Iran is violating the letter of the  Why is there no accountability in debate, as we know, that Iran spins more IR-6 centrifuges than they are permitted to under the JCPOA? Why aren't we talking about that?  Why aren't we saying that Iran is not following their word when they assemble more IR-8 rotor assemblies than they are allowed to under the JCPOA?  Why aren't we saying that Iran is not following through with their word as they attempt to purchase carbon fiber that they are not allowed to try to purchase under the JCPOA?  Why are we giving Iran a free pass?  Does the President's opposition despise him so much that they are willing to literally take Iran's side when Iran says that we will never be able to inspect any of their military sites?  Before, during, and after this deal, they said that we will never be able to[[Page H8217]]inspect all their military sites. The Obama administration said we will inspect their military sites. So you have a material disagreement on this JCPOA, this Iran nuclear deal.  We said that sanctions were going to be phased in over time based on compliance. The Iranian regime said sanctions relief was going to be immediate, no suspension. But why are we not holding Iran to their word on the ways that they are violating the letter of the JCPOA?  Why is it that before implementation day when inspectors, the last time they got to Parchin and they found particles in the soil that are consistent with nuclear capability, and then after we discover those particles the Iranians say, ``That is it. No more access to Parchin,'' why are we not saying that Iran is not following their commitments under the JCPOA? This is the letter of the  Now, it would be great if we can have a discussion here about what the verification regime is. I would love to read the deal between the IAEA and When I was at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing with then-Secretary of State John Kerry and I wanted to engage with him, have a conversation about what the verification agreement was, I was shocked that even he said that he hadn't read the verification regime between the IAEA and It really makes you scratch your head.  I asked the question here on the House floor last Congress while we were debating the President Obama says that we are entering into the JCPOA not based on trust, but based on verification. So the question that I posed then, and I still haven't gotten an answer today, is: How do you support a deal based on verification without knowing what the verification is?  We are propping up the wrong regime. In 2009, during the Green Revolution, an undemocratic election, millions of Iranians went to the streets. These are people who go to the streets that right now there are people--millions of Iranians today--who would love a free, stable, democratic After an undemocratic election, they went to the streets. We said that it was none of our business.  Fast-forward years later, we are paying ransom of $400 million that was disputed for good reason for decades, claims going both ways. There is a reason why that money wasn't paid out. There was a dispute, multiple claims, U.to Iran and Iran to the United States, and $1.3 billion of interest. They said that it wasn't a ransom. $1.7 billion in cold, hard cash in pallets that had to get delivered at the exact same moment of the American hostages--by the way, not all of them--at the exact same moment of the American hostages being released, and we are saying that that is not ransom.  That was a coincidence that we are signing documents in the middle of January on the same exact day within 24 hours of each other.  Now, after we provided a jackpot of sanctions relief in exchange for this very one-sided deal, there was an election. After that election in Iran, members of the American media and around the world said that this was evidence of progress in Iran that the most moderate candidates were elected.  But do you know what that completely ignores? The 12,000 most moderate candidates not being allowed access to the ballot. We are propping up the wrong regime.  After our American sailors were detained, held hostage, and embarrassed in videos and photography all around the world, we said, ``Thank you.'' That was our response, ``Thank you.''  After all the concessions that were made as part of the JCPOA, our Secretary of State became president for the Tehran Chamber of Commerce, and here we are. Fast-forward to today, and everyone who wants to see this President fail will stand with Iran before they would stand with the United They will ignore Iran's violating the spirit of the They will turn a blind eye with their head in the sand over Iran's violating the letter of the  Mr.Speaker, we gathered here this evening to talk about the President's correct decision to decertify the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear agreement, and to talk about the need to eliminate Iran's very problematic nuclear and nonnuclear activities. We heard from a half dozen other Members of Congress: Congressman Joe Wilson of South Carolina's 2nd Congressional District, David Kustoff of Tennessee's 8th Congressional District, Congressman Ted Yoho of Florida's 3rd Congressional District, Congresswoman Claudia Tenney of New York's 22nd Congressional District, Congressman Andy Barr of Kentucky's 6th Congressional District, and Congressman Todd Rokita of Indiana's 4th Congressional I thank them, and I thank all of my colleagues for their leadership on this issue.  There is important work ahead. There really should be more Members on both sides of the aisle working together on behalf of the American people putting country first on this issue.  People since the election pledged to entirely oppose and obstruct this President on everything and anything. While the President's hand was on the Bible, the streets of the parade route were lined up with people holding up signs that said ``impeach him now''--while his hand was on the                              {time}  1945  Last November, Americans all around this country elected a President whose hand was on the Bible, yet people are calling for his impeachment just for the fact he got elected. Every day we are here, we have Members who come to the floor doing whatever they can in any way that day, that minute, to try to tear the President down.  I had disagreements with President Obama, but he was my We disagreed on the Iran nuclear deal. That is okay. We can disagree. We should disagree with President Trump, President Obama, President Bush before that, when we have strong philosophical differences on policy. That is what we are elected to do. We are not elected to all just come here and agree with each other.  But for those who are so set politically on trying to bring this President down, so much so that they will take Iran's side in this over the United States' side, I encourage you to rethink that and put country over party, because we need to work together as colleagues representing the greatest country in the world on a better path forward.  It is a privilege for all of us to be able to serve here in the United States Capitol in the United States Congress, because there is so much history on this floor. There is going to be much debate ahead on what challenges lie ahead for us with regard to  With servicemembers in harm's way, we understand and we reflect that that is what is most important. We should never send our troops into harm's way unless they are sent to win. We send our troops to win, or we do not send them at all. When they come home, they are treated with the love, dignity, and respect that they deserve on behalf of a very grateful nation; and with a strong, consistent foreign policy and taking care of our vets and setting up our military for success. It is having the right foreign policy with challenges that are in front of us in the Middle East and elsewhere.  That is why we are here for this Special Order hour in support of the President's decision to decertify the Iran nuclear deal. Mr.President, you made the right decision. We stand with you. We stand with the United We want to hold Iran accountable. We want the best path forward for our great country.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-10-25-pt1-PgH8212-4.txt,2261,THE PRESIDENT'S CORRECT AND NECESSARY DECERTIFICATION OF THE JCPOA,2017.0,25.0,October
