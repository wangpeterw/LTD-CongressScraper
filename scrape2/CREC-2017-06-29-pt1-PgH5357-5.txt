                        NO CITY IS ABOVE THE LAW

  (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary 
for Criminals Act.
  Many cities across America have adopted sanctuary policies over the 
past few years. This is an obvious disregard of Federal law and puts 
American lives at risk.
  In my home State of Georgia, sanctuary cities have been outlawed 
since 2009. Last year, Georgia's law was amended to require local 
governments to certify they are cooperating with Federal immigration 
officials in order to get State funding.
  The way I see it, the law is the law. Sanctuary cities' policies are 
dangerous to all American communities as they can shield unlawful and 
criminal immigrants from Federal immigration enforcement. President 
Trump promised to end sanctuary cities, and this is the first step 
toward keeping that promise.
  How many more innocent American lives need to be stolen because our 
immigration laws are not being enforced?
  No person or city is above the law, and that is why my colleagues and 
I passed this very important bill today.
