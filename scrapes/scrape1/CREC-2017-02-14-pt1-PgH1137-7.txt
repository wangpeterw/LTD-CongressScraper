                   INVESTING IN A WORKING GOVERNMENT

  (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the

[[Page H1138]]

House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, recent executive actions have 
resulted in confusion, demonstrations, and late-night court rulings. 
Many executive orders have been announced with little notice, and the 
American people have had to wait hours afterwards to see the text.
  Federal agencies have also been blindsided by these orders. The 
Secretary of Homeland Security found out about the President's 
immigration orders through cable news. In some cases, the President 
himself has been uncertain of what his executive orders contain.
  Sir, we need transparency today. Congress has a responsibility to 
eliminate this confusion and make sure that executive actions are clear 
and transparent to all Americans.
  That is why I am introducing the Executive Order Transparency Act. 
This one-page bill requires that all executive orders be posted on the 
White House website 72 hours before each is signed. This simple bill is 
an investment in a working government, and I urge all my colleagues to 
join me.
