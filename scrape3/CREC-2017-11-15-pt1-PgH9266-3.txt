 HOUSE DEMOCRATS CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON BETTER JOBS, BETTER WAGES, AND A 
                             BETTER FUTURE

  (Mr. JEFFRIES asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, while House Democrats continue to focus on 
better jobs, better wages, and a better future for the American people, 
House Republicans have put forward a phony, fraudulent, and fake tax 
reform plan.
  The Republican tax scam will raise taxes on 36 million middle class 
families, undermine Medicare, and explode the deficit. It will saddle 
our children and grandchildren with more than $1 trillion in additional 
debt simply to pay for massive tax cuts for millionaires, for 
billionaires, for special interest corporations, and for the privileged 
few.
  It is all being done simply to subsidize the lifestyles of the rich 
and shameless. It is a Ponzi scheme. It is a heat-seeking missile aimed 
directly at middle class families. It is a flimflam, and it must be 
defeated.
