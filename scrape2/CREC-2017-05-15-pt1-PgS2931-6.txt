                        TRIBUTE TO SEAN O'BRIEN

 Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I would like to take the 
opportunity to express my appreciation to Sean O'Brien for his hard 
work as an intern in my Washington, DC, office. I recognize his efforts 
and contributions to my office as well as to the State of Wyoming.
  Sean is a native of Illinois and a graduate of American University, 
School of International Service. He received a degree in international 
studies. He has demonstrated a strong work ethic, which has made him an 
invaluable asset to our office. The quality of his work is reflected in 
his great efforts over the last several months.
  I want to thank Sean for the dedication he has shown while working 
for me and my staff. It is a pleasure to have him as part of our team. 
I know he will have continued success with all of his future endeavors. 
I wish him all my best on his journey.
