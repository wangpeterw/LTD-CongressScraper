                     CONGRATULATING SENATOR HASSAN

  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I just wanted to say how pleased I am to 
be able to join my colleague from New Hampshire on the floor for her 
official maiden address. It is so nice to see so many of our women 
colleagues here for this as well.
  As she pointed out, I just wanted to echo the great work Senator 
Hassan has done, especially as Governor, in expanding the Medicaid 
Program in New Hampshire so that it provides treatment for so many 
people, especially when it comes to the heroin and opioid epidemic, and 
why we are so concerned about any efforts to roll that back--because 
that would kick thousands of people in New Hampshire off of treatment 
with nowhere else to go. I certainly plan to continue to join her as we 
fight for this effort, and I know our colleagues are going to help us 
in that. I believe that if we all work together, we can make progress, 
as she has so eloquently stated.
  So congratulations to Senator Hassan for her first official maiden 
speech. I know it will be just one of many more to come.
  (The remarks of Mrs. Shaheen pertaining to the submission of S. 630 
are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills 
and Joint Resolutions.)
  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
