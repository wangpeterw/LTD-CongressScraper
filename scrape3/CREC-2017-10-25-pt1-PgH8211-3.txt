     LIFE IS WASHABLE PROVIDES FRIENDLY ACCESS SENSORY SAFETY KITS

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Life Is Washable, 
an organization that provides comfort and support to individuals 
suffering from sensory processing disorders.
  Locally, through their partnership with the Jim and Juli Boeheim 
Foundation, Life Is Washable provides friendly access sensory safety 
kits at sporting events and concerts across the region.
  Often, guests suffering from a sensory disorder or a medical 
condition that impacts the senses, including autism or dementia, find 
it difficult to enjoy loud, brightly lit events.
  The tools in these kits range from earmuffs to antiglare glasses, and 
help ensure that those with sensory needs can enjoy a sporting event or 
concert comfortably without the usual burdens they experience. This 
innovative approach has helped improve the quality of these events for 
those with sensory disorders across the country.
  So far, several major venues in New York have begun using these kits, 
including the Veterans Memorial Arena in Binghamton and the Carrier 
Dome in Syracuse.
  We are grateful to Life Is Washable for the important steps their 
staff has taken locally to reduce the burdens on those suffering from a 
sensory processing disorder.
