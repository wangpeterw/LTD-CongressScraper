    RECOGNIZING CLINTON COUNTY'S MISS TEEN UNITED STATES AGRICULTURE

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Haili Marie Frank from Mill Hall, Pennsylvania, who has been named 
Clinton County's Miss Teen United States Agriculture.
  Haili is 16 years old and is the daughter of Eric and Clinta Frank.
  She is a 10th grader at the Sugar Valley Rural Charter School, where 
she is a member of the National Honor Society and an officer in the 
school's FFA chapter.
  In 2017, Haili competed in the FFA Creed Speaking competition, 
placing first in the county and second in the region, which qualified 
her for the State competition, where she came in 10th.
  Haili loves animals and is a member of two 4-H groups. Over the past 
7 years, Haili has exhibited pigs, goats, lambs, chickens, and rabbits.
  Haili is also an accomplished archer and shoots with one of her 4-H 
groups. Last August, she competed in the archery competition at State 
Days in Rock Run, Pennsylvania, and placed second in her age division.
  Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly congratulate Haili on being an 
outstanding role model for her peers and a representative for 
agriculture in Pennsylvania.
