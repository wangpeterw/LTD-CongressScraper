                              GOP TAX PLAN

  (Ms. MATSUI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Republican tax 
plan. This bill is nothing but a giveaway to America's wealthiest and 
corporations on the backs of middle class families.
  The GOP tax plan gets rid of commonsense policies that the American 
people rely upon:
  It eliminates the student loan deduction that helps young people pay 
for college;
  It eliminates the medical expense deduction, which helps families 
struggling with diseases like Alzheimer's afford care;
  It eliminates the deduction for teachers that helps them purchase 
supplies for the classroom; and
  It sharply reduces the State and local tax deductions that my 
constituents in Sacramento rely upon.
  Meanwhile, when the national debt grows as a result of the GOP's 
unfunded tax breaks, Republicans will turn around and justify cuts to 
earned benefits like Medicare and Social Security.
  Middle class Americans shouldn't be punished so that the megarich and 
corporations get a break.
