MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING MARSHALL COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL SHOOTING VICTIMS

  (Mr. COMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, last Tuesday, January 23, at 7:57 a.m., shots 
erupted through the commons area of Marshall County High School in 
Benton, Kentucky, taking the lives of two students and wounding many 
others.
  The school is the cornerstone of life and activity, and the 
incomprehensible events of last week have shaken the community to its 
core. In the aftermath of the devastation, a vast network of spirited, 
compassionate students and alumni have united to support and further 
strengthen the tight-knit, resilient community of Marshall County.
  As students and faculty attempt to return to some semblance of 
normalcy this week, I am joined by my colleagues from the Kentucky 
delegation to express our gratitude for the educators and first 
responders who acted bravely and efficiently.
  We pray for the survivors who are continuing to recover from their 
injuries, and we remember Preston Cope and Bailey Holt, whose young 
lives were cut tragically short, as well as their families and friends 
left behind.
  Mr. Speaker, please rise and join me in a moment of silence to honor 
Preston and Bailey.
