                    HONORING THE LIFE OF ANGIE GOMEZ

  (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Angie 
Gomez. Angie visited Las Vegas on October 1 for the Route 91 music 
festival.
  Angie is described by her friends as a natural-born caregiver. It was 
only natural for her to want to get certified as a nursing assistant, 
so she did. Outside of caring for others, she loved theater and choir, 
participating in both throughout middle school and high school.
  Angie loved nothing more than to spend time with her two nieces, whom 
she adored. Friends and family remember her as a team player who wasn't 
afraid of being herself. She was fun-loving, sweet, and had a great 
sense of humor.
  I would like to extend my condolences to Angie's family and friends. 
Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, and the 
whole country grieve with you.
