                         WELCOMING NEW SENATORS

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as we open the 2nd session of the 115th 
Congress, I am pleased to welcome my colleagues back to the Chamber.
  I would like to extend a particular welcome to our two new Senators, 
who were just sworn in. First, Senator Doug Jones of Alabama will have 
big shoes to fill. His State has sent very distinguished legislators to 
Washington, including our Attorney General, Jeff Sessions. Senator 
Jones brings a background in law enforcement, having served as a 
Federal prosecutor in the Northern District of Alabama. We welcome him.
  We also welcome Senator Tina Smith. For 3 years, she has served the 
people of Minnesota as their Lieutenant Governor. Now she will join 
Senator Klobuchar in representing them here in the Senate.
  I congratulate both of these new Senators. I look forward to working 
with them in the months ahead to make bipartisan progress and to find 
common ground on behalf of the American people.
