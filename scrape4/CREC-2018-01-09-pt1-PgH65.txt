               IRANIAN PEOPLE ARE ENSLAVED BY THE MULLAHS

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, cracks are beginning to form in the 
iron grip of the Iranian regime. The oppressed people of Iran have 
taken to the streets to demand an end to the corrupt and brutal 
dictatorship.
  The mullahs in Tehran have stolen the wealth of the country and the 
people, lining their own pockets and funding terror throughout the 
Middle East.
  Like in 2009, when the Iranian people rose up to confront the 
corruption of the regime, these Iranians have been met with harsh 
violence and been murdered in the streets. Thousands of others have 
been imprisoned. In 2009, however, the United States sat in the stands 
as a spectator and watched the Ayatollah crush freedom.
  I applaud this President's show of support for freedom in Iran. The 
United States must show political and public support for our friends 
for liberty in Iran.
  As President Kennedy once said: ``Let every Nation know, whether it 
wishes us well or ill, that we will pay any price, bear any burden, 
meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to 
assure the survival and the success of liberty.''
  Like our friends in Iran.
  And that is just the way it is.
