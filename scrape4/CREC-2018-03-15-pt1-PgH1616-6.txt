                          PUBLIC SCHOOLS WEEK

  (Mr. LANCE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. LANCE. Madam Speaker, I rise in honor of Public Schools Week to 
recognize the incredible work in public education done every day in 
every State in our Union.
  I have the honor of representing some of the finest public schools in 
the Nation. This did not happen by accident. Our public schools lead 
the country because of the tremendous work of our public educators.
  I attended public schools, I respect our teachers, and I proudly 
support our public schools here in Congress.
  I know the work of educators can be difficult, but the life of a 
teacher is a vocation, not an occupation. Educators give their lives in 
service to future generations of leaders, thinkers, writers, doctors, 
scientists, and visionaries.
  We need teachers, and we need the public education system to remain 
strong in the United States. Public schools are where our students 
realize their talents and their potential.
  We need good educators to continue offering encouragement and advice 
and to be champions and mentors.
  Let us celebrate this Public Schools Week by thanking the teachers 
and educators in our lives.
