                       TRIBUTE TO SANDRA BOARDMAN

 Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Sandra 
Boardman of Chinook, MT. Originally from Chinook, Sandi has served as 
the Blaine County clerk and recorder for 44 years. As she steps into 
retirement, she will be remembered for her many years of service.
  Thank you, Sandi, for your commitment to Blaine County and Montana. 
Your years of dedication and service show the true meaning of being a 
Montanan, and, for that, I am very grateful. You are an inspiration to 
us all. Congratulations on your well-deserved retirement, and I wish 
you all the best in the days ahead.
