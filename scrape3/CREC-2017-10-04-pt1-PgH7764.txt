       CRITICAL NEED TO FUND CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM

  (Mr. CARBAJAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in disbelief that this 
Congress has shamefully allowed the Children's Health Insurance 
Program, CHIP, to expire earlier this week. CHIP provides healthcare to 
8.9 million low-income children in our country and to over 2 million 
children in my home State of California.
  My Republican colleagues have spent all their time and energy this 
year fighting to repeal healthcare for millions of Americans covered by 
the Affordable Care Act, and now they have failed to protect healthcare 
for our country's children.
  If we do not act quickly, it could soon lead to States not enrolling 
children and potentially even denying them coverage altogether due to 
the lack of funding.
  It is critical that we fund the CHIP program without delay and 
provide certainty to these families that they will not lose their 
health coverage because of this irresponsible and derelict 
congressional inaction.
