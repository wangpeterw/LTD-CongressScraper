                            VOTE EXPLANATION

 Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I was unavailable for rollcall 
vote No. 250, on the motion to invoke cloture on Scott L. Palk, of 
Oklahoma, to be United States District Judge for the Western District 
of Oklahoma. Had I been present, I would have voted nay.
