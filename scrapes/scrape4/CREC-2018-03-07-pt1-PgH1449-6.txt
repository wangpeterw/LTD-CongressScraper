       MANUFACTURING EXTENSION PARTNERSHIPS ARE GOOD FOR BUSINESS

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, this week we have 
representatives from the South Carolina Manufacturing Extension 
Partnership, MEP, visiting for their annual legislative day. MEPs are 
public-private partnerships that help small- and medium-size 
manufacturers grow their business. There are MEP centers in all 50 
States and Puerto Rico.
  Manufacturing is one of America's major economic drivers, comprising 
over 12 percent of our annual GDP, with most manufacturing firms in the 
United States having 500 employees or less. MEPs provide much-needed 
assistance for manufacturers to become more successful. MEPs help 
manufacturers grow their global market with export guidance on where to 
eliminate waste.
  Last year, MEPs across the country generated $1.7 billion in cost 
savings, $3.5 billion in new client investments, and helped create and 
retain over 100,000 jobs. You can see these benefits firsthand in the 
Second Congressional District, where the South Carolina Manufacturing 
Extension Partnership, led by Chuck Spangler, served over 40 companies 
last year, resulting in $25 million in new sales and 25 retained jobs.
  I am grateful for the MEP's positive impact in communities across the 
country.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
