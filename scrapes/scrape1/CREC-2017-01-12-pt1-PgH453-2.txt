     IN SUPPORT OF NOMINATION OF SECRETARY OF EDUCATION BETSY DeVOS

  (Mr. MOOLENAAR asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MOOLENAAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the nomination of 
Betsy DeVos, of my home State of Michigan, to be the nextSecretary of 
Education.
  She shares our belief that all children should have the opportunity 
to learn in a world-class environment and that they,along with their 
parents, should be able to choose the schools that are best for them. 
In Michigan, she has improved learningopportunities for students from 
low-income backgrounds all across the State. She knows that local 
control plays a key role in aneducator's ability to tailor lesson plans 
that best provide the education for our students.
  For decades, Betsy DeVos has worked tirelessly on education issues, 
and she has been a champion for parents and students. Asa parent of six 
children who have attended public schools, I am confident that she will 
do an outstanding job as our nextSecretary of Education.
