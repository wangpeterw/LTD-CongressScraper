SENATE RESOLUTION 207--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF JULY 9 THROUGH JULY 15, 
  2017 AS ``SARCOMA AWARENESS WEEK'' AND DESIGNATING JULY 15, 2017 AS 
                    ``LEIOMYOSARCOMA AWARENESS DAY''

  Ms. STABENOW submitted the following resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on the Judiciary:

                              S. Res. 207

       Whereas a soft tissue sarcoma is a rare type of cancer, 
     accounting for approximately 1 percent of all newly diagnosed 
     cancers, that arises in the connective tissue of the body;
       Whereas the National Institutes of Health designates 
     sarcoma as a rare form of cancer, with sarcoma containing 
     approximately 70 different subtypes;
       Whereas sarcomas are largely resistant to current 
     chemotherapy agents, immunotherapy agents, and radiation 
     therapies, posing a formidable challenge for researchers and 
     specialists;
       Whereas sarcoma subtypes have largely not received benefit 
     from immunotherapies due to the complexity of the DNA, 
     genomes, and mutations associated with the many variations in 
     the sarcoma subtype landscape;
       Whereas leiomyosarcoma (referred to in this preamble as 
     ``LMS'') is a malignant, aggressive subtype of soft tissue 
     sarcoma derived from smooth muscle cells typically of 
     uterine, gastrointestinal or soft tissue origin, and can 
     metastasize to the bone, spine, brain, and liver;
       Whereas the National Institutes of Health classifies LMS as 
     a rare disease, accounting for approximately 15 percent of 
     all sarcomas, and LMS itself encompasses at least 4 different 
     LMS subtypes;
       Whereas LMS primarily affects adults without regard to 
     gender;
       Whereas research and clinical trials for LMS remain 
     complicated and the prospects for long-term survival remain 
     poor;
       Whereas multidisciplinary care coordination teams, because 
     of their expertise and experience, are critical to the health 
     of sarcoma and LMS patients;
       Whereas sarcoma and LMS research will allow medical 
     professionals to improve the quality of care for affected 
     patients, lead to better clinical outcomes, and promote 
     longer survival for patients; and
       Whereas increased education and awareness about sarcoma and 
     LMS will contribute to the well-being of the communities of 
     the United States: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) designates the week of July 9 through July 15, 2017, as 
     ``Sarcoma Awareness Week'';
       (2) designates July 15, 2017, as ``Leiomyosarcoma Awareness 
     Day'';
       (3) recognizes the challenges faced by sarcoma and 
     leiomyosarcoma patients; and
       (4) commends the dedication of organizations, volunteers, 
     researchers, and caregivers across the country working to 
     improve the quality of life of sarcoma and leiomyosarcoma 
     patients and their families.
