                  SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, TEXAS, SHOOTING

  (Mr. CUELLAR asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that we rise today 
to address the American people.
  Yesterday morning, a gunman stormed into a church in Sutherland 
Springs, Texas, a small town of about 400 or 500 individuals, and 
brutally murdered 26 innocent lives, including at least 12 children, 
marking the worst shooting in Texas history.
  Today we grieve the horrific loss of dozens of innocent people. We 
pray for the victims' families, who are grasping for answers with 
broken hearts.
  I have spoken personally with Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt, 
County Commissioner Albert Gamez, and other citizens of that area to 
assist in any way that we can.
  In the coming hours and days, we will learn more about the victims of 
this tragedy, their names, their faces, their stories, the joy they 
brought their families and their friends.
  We are fully committed to helping Sutherland Springs recover from 
this senseless tragedy, and we ask every Member of Congress to join us 
to support this recovery.
  To the people of Sutherland Springs, I stand with you, we stand with 
you, the House of Representatives stands with you, and the people of 
the United States of America stand with you. May God bless all of you.
