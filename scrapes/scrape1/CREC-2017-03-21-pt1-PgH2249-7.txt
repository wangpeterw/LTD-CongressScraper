                      WELCOMING PASTOR CHRIS BELL

  The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. 
Byrne) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, it is written in Philippians 4:6:

       Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by 
     prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests 
     be made known to God.

  As this body debates important issues, it is critical we begin with 
prayer. I am honored my constituent Pastor Chris Bell was able to lead 
today's prayer.

  Mr. Speaker, Pastor Bell studied theology and communications at the 
University of Mobile and Luther Rice Seminary, and he has over 20 years 
of ministry experience.
  Pastor Bell is currently the lead pastor at 3 Circle Church in 
southwest Alabama. 3 Circle Church has five campuses, with weekly 
attendance reaching over 2,000 people.
  In addition to their regular services, Pastor Bell and 3 Circle 
Church have a focus on mission and serving others locally, regionally, 
and around the world. These missions make a real difference.
  So on behalf of Alabama's First Congressional District, it is an 
honor to welcome Chris and his wife, Nan, to the people's House.
