                   BRIDES MARCH FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

  (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, earlier today, close to 100 women in 
wedding gowns from all over our country came to Washington, D.C. They 
came here to give a face and a voice to victims of domestic violence.
  I was also floored by the courage of my colleagues, other Members of 
Congress, whose loved ones had been victims and had even been killed 
because of domestic violence. Domestic violence is something that can 
impact anybody on any day, even on your wedding day.
  The Brides March honors the memory and tragedy of Gladys Ricart, who, 
on September 26, 1999, lost her life on her wedding day at the hands of 
her abusive ex-boyfriend.
  This march has now spread beyond New York, to Massachusetts, 
Wisconsin, Florida, Washington, D.C., and even other countries like the 
Dominican Republic, Mexico, Brazil, and Spain.
  That is why, Mr. Speaker, today I am Gladys Ricart. We are all Gladys 
Ricart. The Brides March and the advocacy of New York Latinas Against 
Domestic Violence is a thundering statement against domestic violence 
and a reminder that domestic violence remains a pressing issue in our 
communities and sometimes in our families.
  Mr. Speaker, domestic violence and violence against women is 
unacceptable.
