                         OPPOSING THE TAX BILL

  (Ms. TITUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the 
Republican's tax scam that has been jammed through this Chamber without 
normal order, without public debate, and without consideration for our 
Nation's future.
  I represent the heart of Las Vegas, a city that was one of the 
hardest hit during the financial crisis. Many of my constituents are 
just beginning to recover from the worst financial crisis since the 
Great Depression, and this tax bill will greatly hinder their progress.
  Some 20 percent of my constituents itemize their deductions, the vast 
majority of whom earn under $75,000 per year. These families will all 
see a tax hike if this bill becomes law because the deductions for 
student loans, medical expenses, sales tax, and some mortgages will all 
disappear.
  The sad reality is, they won't just feel the hit on April 15, tax 
day. They will feel it every single day. The deficit that this bill 
will create will lead to State and local governments missing out on 
needed Federal funding, and they will either have to slash vital 
programs or raise taxes at that level. If the Senate has its way, they 
will cut Medicare by $25 billion and repeal the ACA. This is not a tax 
reform. It is a system that will be rigged.
