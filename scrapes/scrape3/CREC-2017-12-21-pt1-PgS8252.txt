                      RECOGNIZING GLASGOW, MONTANA

 Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this week, I have the distinct 
honor of recognizing the community of Glasgow for leading the way with 
their generosity during the holiday season. Earlier this month, members 
of the community successfully conducted their annual Block of Bucks 
program to help raise funds for local families to have warm clothing 
during the winter months.
  This charitable effort brought together a broad collection of the 
community, including the Glasgow Soroptimists, student council leaders 
from Glasgow High School, members of the National Guard, the local Elks 
Club, a host of local businesses, and dozens of other volunteers. 
Through their focused actions, the community of Glasgow raised over 
$30,000 to provide more than 300 hundred children with winter clothing. 
If you have ever experienced winter along the Hi-Line in northeast 
Montana, you will know how important it is to have the proper gear. The 
generosity of neighbors in towns like Glasgow is something that we can 
all appreciate.
  It is a Montana hallmark for neighbors to identify a need and then 
gather the people and resources to meet that need at a local level. 
Going into Christmas, I would like to offer a heartfelt thank you to 
the folks in Glasgow for giving their time and talents to help others 
by adding warmth to the holiday season.
