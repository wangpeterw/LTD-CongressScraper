            AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT IS BETTER FOR AMERICANS

  (Mr. HARRIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the good things 
that are going to happen on Thursday if we bring the House Republican 
plan to the floor.
  For the first time in 6 years, we are actually going to lower 
premiums for Americans. We are actually going to take the problems with 
the ObamaCare bill, the failures of the ObamaCare bill, and correct 
them.
  You just heard, for instance, about Jimmy Kimmel. I guess the 
comedian published a YouTube video. I suggest you watch the YouTube 
video and then just google about newborn coverage.
  Mr. Speaker, we have the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act--it has been on the books for decades--that covers 
newborns. This is not an issue. We are a compassionate nation, Mr. 
Speaker. You and I were both physicians. We understand that we have to 
take care of Americans.
  The American Health Care Act that is forthcoming from the Republicans 
does exactly that. It not only covers people with preexisting 
conditions, it adds two layers of protection for them.
  So, Mr. Speaker, I urge all Americans look at it and just see how 
much better their health care will be and how much more affordable it 
will be after we pass the American Health Care Act.
