                 LWCF PARITY FOR TERRITORIES AND DC ACT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Guam (Ms. Bordallo) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, I am indeed proud to introduce the LWCF 
Parity for Territories and D.C. Act, with the support of all six 
Members of the House representing our U.S. territories and the District 
of Columbia as original cosponsors.
  Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan bill gives parity to Guam, the other 
territories, and D.C. in annual funding from the Federal Land and Water 
Conservation Fund.
  Current law requires the territories and D.C. to split six ways a 
single State's annual LWCF allocation. This bill fixes this disparity 
by providing a full, State-equivalent share of Land and Water 
Conservation Fund funding for each territory and D.C. every year.
  This additional funding is needed to improve our public parks, our 
outdoor sports fields, and our community open spaces on Guam and the 
other territories, especially as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin 
Islands rebuild from recent hurricanes.
  So, Mr. Speaker, I encourage our colleagues to cosponsor this 
bipartisan legislation and support the LWCF parity for the territories 
and the District of Columbia.
