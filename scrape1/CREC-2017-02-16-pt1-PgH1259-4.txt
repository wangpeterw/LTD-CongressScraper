                           WE DESERVE TO KNOW

  (Mr. RUPPERSBERGER asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Mr. Speaker, we live in a dangerous world, and the 
President needs a National Security Adviser who isn't under a cloud of 
suspicion. But this resignation isn't the end. Americans now deserve to 
know if General Flynn was operating under anyone else's authority.
  The American people deserve to know if Russia has financial, 
personal, or political grip on President Trump or his campaign. I am 
urging the agencies involved in the investigation to continue their 
important work vigorously.
  I also ask my colleagues in House leadership to launch a bipartisan, 
independent congressional investigation into Russia's influence on the 
election and the new administration.
  Lastly, I once again am calling on President Trump to remove his 
cheap political strategist, Steve Bannon, from the National Security 
Council and reinstate the Director of National Intelligence and the 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to restore some semblance of 
respectability to the organization's structure.
