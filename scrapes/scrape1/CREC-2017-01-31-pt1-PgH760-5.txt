                      OPPOSITION TO THE MUSLIM BAN

  (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to President 
Trump's Muslim ban because that is exactly what it is. It is a mean-
spirited ban against members of a religious faith. I love my country, 
and I am saddened by these divisive and hateful actions being 
wrongfully taken in the so-called name of national security.
  Mr. Trump's actions make us less secure as a nation. They take a 
sledgehammer right through the founding principles of our Nation. 
America is not this nonsensical, antirefugee Nation. Quite frankly, Mr. 
Trump's actions are un-American, beneath us, and downright dangerous.
  Let me remind my colleagues, there has been a protest every day since 
Mr. Trump took office. The people have hit the streets. We will 
continue to march, and we will keep demanding what is right. We will 
keep fighting to ensure American values are upheld and that our civil 
rights are not trashed like yesterday's news.
  To our Muslims, LGBT, immigrants, women, and all our brothers and 
sisters hurt by Mr. Trump's garbage, I mean executive orders, I am with 
you.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from 
engaging in personalities toward the President.
