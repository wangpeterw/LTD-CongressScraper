                            FUND OUR TROOPS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler) for 5 minutes.
  Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, here we are again, having to vote on a 
continuing resolution instead of a full-year appropriations deal 
because of political reasons.
  Mr. Speaker, I am appalled that much-needed defense dollars are once 
again being held hostage for political reasons. We have heard time and 
again from military leaders about the devastating readiness crisis 
plaguing every corner of the military. We have planes that cannot fly, 
troops that cannot deploy, and we are literally running out of bombs.
  It is irresponsible and morally wrong to send our troops into harm's 
way without adequate resources and training. Last year alone, there 
were 80 deaths related to readiness and training accidents. It is clear 
that insufficient and unreliable funding is wearing our military to the 
bone and costing precious lives.
  As Members of Congress, we have the power of the purse. We can 
relieve the military from this deadly cycle. I call on my colleagues to 
end the political games. Support the men and women in uniform who risk 
their lives every day to defend this country. Support a budget 
agreement that provides our servicemembers with the funding they so 
desperately need.
