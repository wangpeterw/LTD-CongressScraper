                           HONORING BARB LUTZ

  (Ms. CHENEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Barb Lutz. Barb has 
spent her entire adult life faithfully serving our military as a 
Federal civil service employee, primarily at F.E. Warren Air Force Base 
in Cheyenne, as well as in Europe.
  Barb has held numerous positions at the base and is currently the 
executive assistant to the commander of the 20th Air Force and Task 
Force 214 at F.E. Warren. She is responsible for providing the 
commander and vice commander with executive support, as well as serving 
as protocol specialist for the headquarters staff.
  After a distinguished 43-year career, Barb is retiring this week. 
When Barb's current and former coworkers at F.E. Warren reached out to 
me about recognizing her, General Cotton best summed up how her 
colleagues feel about her when he said: ``We all know Barb is a 
national treasure.''
  I want to thank Barb for all she has done for Wyoming and for the 
country over her 43-year career, and I wish Barb and her family the 
best in retirement.
