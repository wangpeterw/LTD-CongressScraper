                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  O God, who remains the same when all else fades, thank You for loving 
and using us for Your glory.
  Guide our Senators in the footsteps of those who were willing to risk 
all for freedom, who transformed dark yesterdays into bright tomorrows.
  Lord, uphold our Nation with Your wisdom and might, enabling it to 
continue to be a city of refuge for those whose hearts yearn for 
freedom. Keep us all from untimely and self-made cares, as we continue 
to look to You, the Author and Finisher of our faith.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
