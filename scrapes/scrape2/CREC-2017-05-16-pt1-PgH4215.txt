            54TH ANNIVERSARY OF PEACE OFFICERS MEMORIAL DAY

  (Mrs. DEMINGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, this year marks the 54th anniversary of 
Peace Officers Memorial Day, so I rise tonight to pay tribute to the 
law enforcement officers from Florida who were killed in the line of 
duty last year.
  Today we remember them and honor them for their service and 
dedication: Deputy Sheriff Eric James Oliver from the Nassau County 
Sheriff's Office; Major Jorge Sanchez from the Miami Police Department; 
Deputy Sheriff Michael Scott Williams from the Taylor County Sheriff's 
Office; Sergeant Jorge Ramos from the Florida Department of 
Corrections; Deputy Sheriff John Robert Kotfila, Jr., of the 
Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office; Police Officer Henry Malcolm 
McAleenan, Jr., of the Miami-Dade Police Department; and, as you have 
already heard tonight, Special Agent J. Scott McGuire of U.S. Homeland 
Security Investigations.
  Mr. Speaker, we remember these brave men and pray for their families 
and the countless others who have mourned their loss.
