                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Loving God, Lord of us all, we give You thanks for giving us another 
day.
  You, O Lord, are the source of life and love. You hear the prayer of 
Congress, both for the good of this Nation and for the good of humanity 
around the world. Help this Congress and the President to discern Your 
will in our day.
  By drawing upon the truth taken from a diversity of opinions, may a 
solid foundation be formed upon which a stable future may be built.
  May short-term gains or self-interest never prove to be an obstacle 
to true vision. Rather, Lord, grant to each Member depth of perception, 
clear analysis, and creative response to the needs of our time.
  In these days, give wisdom to all the Members, and may all that is 
done be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
