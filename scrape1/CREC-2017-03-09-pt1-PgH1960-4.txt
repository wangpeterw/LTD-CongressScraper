     CONGRATULATIONS TO THE CHURUBUSCO HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL TEAM

  (Mr. BANKS of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. BANKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a 
historic accomplishment that took place this past Saturday night in 
northeast Indiana. As you may know, in Indiana, we love basketball. We 
affectionately refer to our passion for the game as Hoosier Hysteria.
  This is a special time of the year for Hoosiers. Every year, high 
school teams across our State compete in the annual Indiana high school 
basketball tournament. For one team, this year turned into a special 
season. Churubusco High School, located in Whitley County, first 
competed in the Indiana boys high school tournament in 1981. Over the 
years, many great players wore the Eagles uniform, but Churubusco High 
School never won a sectional title until this year.
  This past Saturday night the Eagles claimed the Class 2A Woodlan 
Sectional, winning Churubusco's first sectional championship trophy in 
the 99-year history of its boys basketball program. Eagle senior Luke 
Foote, who scored 26 points in the sectional championship game, said 
after the win: ``It is huge for the community knowing that history was 
made. It means a lot to the guys that put on the jersey before us. . . 
. `'
  I congratulate the Churubusco Eagles, head coach Chris Paul, and the 
entire Churubusco community on this historic accomplishment. The 
celebration of this sectional title is truly a century in the making.
