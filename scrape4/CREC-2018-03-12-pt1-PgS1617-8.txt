             CONGRATULATING KENTUCKY NCAA BASKETBALL TEAMS

  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I want to start with what I know is 
on everybody's mind, and that is Kentucky basketball.
  The University of Kentucky Wildcats men's team won their 31st SEC 
title--their fourth straight, by the way. Hall of Fame coach John 
Calipari is leading Big Blue Nation back to the NCAA tournament and, we 
hope, to the school's ninth national championship.
  At Western Kentucky University, the Lady Toppers just brought home a 
second straight Conference USA title. They are hoping the hardware 
keeps on coming as they head to their school's 20th showing in the NCAA 
tournament.
  I proudly join many Kentuckians in congratulating both UK and WKU. We 
will be rooting for them in the Big Dance.
