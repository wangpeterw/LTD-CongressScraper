                              HUB OF HOPE

  (Mr. EVANS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, today I had the wonderful opportunity to join 
with a group of civic, business, and community leaders to introduce a 
new program in the city of Philadelphia called Hub of Hope. The 
brainchild of SEPTA and Project HOME, Hub of Hope is a new initiative 
to address homelessness in our city.
  According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, more 
than 6,000 people are homeless in the city of Philadelphia, and 15,000 
are homeless in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
  Ending homelessness requires a team effort on the city, State, and 
Federal level. I am committed to doing my part to ensure that people do 
not have to sleep on the streets and that their personal, physical 
security, and mental health needs are addressed in a comprehensive 
manner. I look forward to working with the people of SEPTA and Project 
HOME on the new Hub of Hope program.
  Hub of Hope is another tool in our toolbox to help move our middle 
neighborhoods forward. With tools like Hub of Hope in our toolbox, I 
know that, together, we can continue to work to build a stronger 
Philadelphia, block by block.
