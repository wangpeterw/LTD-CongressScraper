                  WE MUST NOT MAKE AMERICA SICK AGAIN

  (Mr. BEYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to read a letter from my constituent, 
Mrs. Karen O'Hern, of Alexandria, Virginia:
  ``Congressman Beyer,
  ``We are a family of four. The company my husband worked for went 
bankrupt in 2009 after the 2008 financial meltdown--losing income, 
retirement savings, and health care.
  ``He now owns a small business and we now get our healthcare 
insurance through healthcare.gov.
  ``We need you to defend the ACA. We depend on the availability of 
this insurance option.
  ``My son had surgery on December 30 at Fairfax Hospital to remove a 
brain tumor. His prognosis is good. I cannot imagine how we would 
manage financially without this health insurance.
  ``Please be strong on this matter and represent the needs of your 
constituents.
  ``I need my Affordable Care Act health insurance.
  ``Regards, Karen O'Hern.''
  Mr. Speaker, millions like Karen O'Hern will lose their coverage if 
the Affordable Care Act is repealed. We must not make America sick 
again.
