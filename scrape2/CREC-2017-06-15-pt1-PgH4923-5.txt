            BRING MORE CIVILITY INTO OUR POLITICAL DISCOURSE

  (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I join my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle in Congress to express my deep sorrow after yesterday's 
shooting.
  At the end of the day, we are not Republicans or Democrats; we are 
Americans. We may disagree with one another, but we cannot allow those 
disagreements to change how we treat each other as fellow human beings.
  I believe we need to change our tone and bring more civility to our 
political discourse. Young people across the country look to us to set 
an example, and we all must rise to the occasion.
  This horrible violence will not divide us and it will not stop us 
from getting back to business on behalf of the American people.
  Let us come together as Americans above all else, and, of course, 
keep our good friend, Steve Scalise, and all of those affected by the 
shootings in our prayers.
