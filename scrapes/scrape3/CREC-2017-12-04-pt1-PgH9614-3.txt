                          REPUBLICAN TAX BILL

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, we hear a lot of negative about the tax 
reform bill that is moving through. Gladly, tonight, we have moved to 
conference committee, where we can continue the process and the 
conversation. We can now take more and more opinions people have on how 
to make the bill better. It has been getting better as we go.
  In my own district, the First District of California, when all is 
said and done, this will simplify the Tax Code for more and more tax 
filers. Already, 70 percent of taxpayers do not use the method of 
trying to itemize every single item. Instead, they use the standard 
deduction. That will save time in tax preparation, netting them a 
better tax situation for their families.
  I see a direct guaranteed tax cut for most people in rural 
California, rural America, and those who earn $100,000 or less. That is 
the middle-income folks we are targeting and who we need to help. That 
is what this bill will do. It will also create more jobs by the job 
creators in this country.
  This is a good step and a good direction for America's taxpayers.
