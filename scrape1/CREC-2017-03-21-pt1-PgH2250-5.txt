         CELEBRATING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I, too, am excited to celebrate the 
signing of the Affordable Care Act signed by President Barack Obama.
  In the hearing last Thursday of the Budget Committee, we noted that 
Medicaid that provided health insurance in this bill, now the TrumpCare 
bill, will be cut $880 billion for working people, for seniors in 
nursing homes, for the blind, and for the disabled.
  We note that this meaningless TrumpCare amendment, for which the 
President is now rallying his troops, coming up to the Hill two and 
three times--maybe he will be here tomorrow--is as meaningless as the 
first part of it was: 24 million Americans will lose their insurance--
TrumpCare will double that amount in 2026; 52 million will not have 
insurance--giveaways to billionaires, 1 percent of the rich people in 
America; and destroying 2 million jobs.
  But what I am most concerned about is my constituent in the Heights 
who could not take her medicine before the Affordable Care Act. 
Tragically, a young woman had a stroke and a heart attack and now is in 
a nursing home. She uses the health insurance of Medicaid, $880 
billion, to provide for her lifeline, but yet TrumpCare comes to 
destroy that.
  I want to celebrate the Affordable Care Act because it saves lives.
