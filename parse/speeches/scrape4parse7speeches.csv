325,topic-id,320,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support this Defense Appropriations bill.  It has been noted here already: a total of $659 billion for full-year funding for the Department of Defense, including $584 billion for base funding and $75.1 billion for overseas contingency operations. It also fully funds a 2.4 percent pay raise and supports an increase in troop numbers.  When you add the $4.7 billion in emergency missile defense and other funds requested by the President in November, funding for this DOD appropriations totals $664 billion--fully consistent with the NDAA for FY 2018.[[Page H723]]  The House passed nearly identical legislation last year back in July, and then again in  Despite the best efforts in the House, here we are again. We are doing this legislation again--the other body has failed--and we are operating on the fourth continuing resolution for FY 2018. That is the 30th CR--or continuing resolution--that Congress has passed since January of 2011.  The House passed each of the 12 appropriations bills and their individual subcommittees and each of the 12 appropriations bills in full committee markup, and each bill has seen the light of day on the House floor.  The other body, Mr.Speaker, is a different story. Not one single appropriations bill has seen the light of day on the Senate floor. No progress has been made on any individual appropriations bills because that body can't seem to get them on the calendar. Part of that has been the demand of every administration nominee be discussed for a full 30 hours--something that this Congress never did under President  If going to a 51-vote process for appropriations bills is the only way to break this logjam, then such a decision should be made. I am on record for that idea, as are many Senators as well.  Mr.Speaker, we find ourselves in this situation once again. The real question is: Will the other body do theirs?

289,topic-id,2662,"Mr.President, I want to thank the Senator from Utah for his leadership. He is not only the senior Republican Senator and former chair of the Judiciary Committee, which will hear this legislation, and chairman of the Finance Committee, he is a songwriter himself. He is not[[Page S503]]just a songwriter; he has a platinum record, he has a gold record, and he has another one that might become gold. So he knows what he is talking about.  I think, for all of us in the Senate, when Orrin Hatch says that in his 40 years or so here--more than any other Republican Senator--this is the capstone of his career in his work on copyright and it is personally important to him, that means something to the rest of us here. I think that means--among all of the other issues here--we are going to pay more attention to this, and we are going to work hard to pass it. I hope it also means something to those outside this Chamber--the songwriters themselves, the digital music companies, the music publishers, the broadcasters. This is something we intend to do. We intend to make this a law because it is right thing to do, because the songwriters aren't being treated fairly, and because it is important to Senator Hatch, whom we respect.  When Senator Hatch stands up on the floor and says: I have been working since 1977 on copyright issues--and we know how many important issues he has dealt with--and he says this is a capstone of all those issues, we should pay attention to that, and we should deal with it. I think we will be able to deal with it because we start off with very strong bipartisan support.  This afternoon, Senator Hatch and I will file the Music Modernization We will begin with eight Members of the Senate, including Senator Hatch, as the lead sponsor; I will be there, in addition to Senator Whitehouse, a Senator from Rhode Island, a Democrat; Senator Corker, a Senator from Tennessee; and Senator Dick Durbin, the Senator from  Dick Durbin is in Nashville nearly as much as Orrin Hatch is in He is not a songwriter, but he loves country music, and he loves songwriting and music, and he is the 2 Senator in the Senate, the Democratic whip. To begin to have that sort of cosponsorship, in addition to Senator Isakson, Senator Coons of Delaware, and our newest Senator, Mr.Jones of Alabama--those are the eight of us in the Senate who are starting this bill. We hope others on both sides of the aisle will see the wisdom of it.  Italy has its art, Egypt has its pyramids, Napa Valley has its wine, and Nashville has its songwriters. Songwriters are the lifeblood of Music The mayor of Nashville was in my office today and we talked about that. We have thousands of songwriters in We have a lot in Memphis too. We have many in Bristol and Knoxville in East Tennessee, where country music really started. They are waiters, they are bus drivers, they are teachers. They have other jobs as they build their songwriting careers. Their paychecks ought to be based on the fair market value of the work they create. Songwriters are paid when their songs are played. We want to make sure that their hits that are heard around the world are felt in their pocketbook.  The arrival of the internet has transformed the music industry, but it has also meant that many songwriters simply aren't paid their royalties when their songs are played online. This is the first problem--the arrival of the internet.  The second problem is, when the songwriters are paid, they are not paid a fair market value for their work. Senator Hatch, as I have mentioned, has long been an advocate for musicians. He understands this.  We have worked together for over a year with Representative Doug Collins in the House of Representatives on the Music Modernization Act, which eight of us will introduce this afternoon. It is bipartisan. It represents the first major consensus legislation that has the support of songwriters, music publishers, digital music companies, and the record labels. Senator Hatch and I are going to continue to work together to make sure it has the support of broadcasters as well.  More importantly, the legislation will have a real impact on songwriters in Tennessee and elsewhere. First, it creates a simple licensing system for direct music services, like Pandora and Amazon to reflect a changing music industry. Second, it will make it easier for the songwriters to be paid when their music is played or someone buys a song that they wrote. Third, it will allow them to be paid for the fair market value of their work.  Now, to give you an idea of what this really means, let me tell you a story about songwriting. I do not have the experience that the Senator from Utah has. He has written more than a hundred songs over the years and cowritten some of them with a number of Nashville songwriters, as a matter of fact, and he even has a song that is a platinum record. But a few years ago, I was in East Tennessee, in my hometown of I walked out of the pharmacy, and I saw an older couple sitting in a pickup truck, and I asked them how they were doing. The woman said of her and her husband: ``We're just falling apart together.''  Well, that weekend my son Drew was having a songwriters' retreat at our home in East He is in the music business. So I told one of them, Lee Brice, about what the woman said to me: ``falling apart together.'' Lee Brice said: I think I can do something with that. So he, Billy Montana, and Jon Stone, the songwriters, wrote a song called ``Falling Apart Together.'' Lee Brice put that on one of his albums, and I got one fourth of the song rights. That is the way it works in If you contribute anything, including just the song name to a song, you get a part of the royalty. Well, Lee Brice is a pretty well-known singer, as well as a songwriter, and he put the song on his album. You would think the royalty would add up to a lot of money, but in 2016, on my Senate financial disclosure, I reported receiving $101.75 in royalties from my one-fourth of the song ``Falling Apart Together.'' If you are a songwriter living in Nashville, Memphis, Los Angeles, New York, or anywhere--or Provo or Salt Lake City--you can't make a living on $101.75.  The other problem facing songwriters is that music is increasingly played online. Companies like Spotify, Pandora, Amazon, and Apple offer listeners virtually unlimited access to digital music libraries that they can play using the internet whenever they want. According to Nielsen, there are nearly 86 million paying subscribers to these types of digital music streaming services--86 million paying subscribers. In 2016, these subscribers listened to more than 252 billion music streams, including repeated songs. So in 2016, for the first time in history, streaming music services--songs played online--generated more than half the music industry's revenues. Digital music services such as Spotify, Pandora, and Apple Music generated the majority, or 51.4 percent, of the music industry's revenues.  So we know that the internet has changed our world. It has changed politics. It has changed newspapers. It has changed retail. We have seen the effect of it. It has changed the music industry too. One half of the music industry's revenues come from online songs that are played and, as Senator Hatch has said, our laws have not kept up with that and, as a result, our songwriters--the creators who have a right under our Constitution to be paid for their work a fair market value--aren't being paid. In many cases, when they are paid, they are not being paid a fair market value. Sales of compact discs fell below $100 million in 2016, a 17-percent decline from 2015. This means that it is getting much more difficult for songwriters to make a living and Congress can't change the fact that the internet and other new technologies have changed the music industry, but we do have a responsibility to update our laws to keep up with what has happened.  So how did we get in this mess, and what laws are we talking about updating? In 1909, more than a century ago, Congress gave copyright owners of musical works the exclusive right to make, reproduce, and distribute their own musical work. At the time, the works were primarily piano rolls. So we are talking about laws that were created for player pianos. Congress sets a royalty to be paid to the owners of those piano rolls at $0.02 per copy. The Copyright Royalty Board, a three-judge panel at the Library of Congress, still sets those royalty rates today. The current rate is 9.1 cents, and it is based on a below-market standard.  Another problem, as Senator Hatch mentioned, is that ASCAP and BMI, the two largest performance rights organizations, are subject to a 76-year-[[Page S504]]old consent decree with the Department of Justice--that means an agreement agreed upon in 1940 or so--and ever since then, it has been governing these performance rights rates. These consent decrees never contemplated the internet, and today they are harming national songwriters. The biggest problem with these outdated consent decrees is that songwriters don't get paid the fair market value for their work.  Songwriters negotiate with radio stations for the right to play their music in exchange for ``reasonable'' performance royalty. If songwriters and the radio stations can't agree on the reasonable royalty, the songwriters have to go to a Federal rate court, which means their case is heard by district judges in the Southern District of New Under current law, the judge is not allowed to consider what the song's performer earns when he sets a reasonable royalty. The Music Modernization Act changes that by allowing ASCAP and BMI to present new evidence about the fair market value of the songwriter's work, like what a performer might earn, to a Federal rate court judge when there is a dispute about royalty rates.  The legislation also allows more Federal district judges to hear these types of cases. The music industry has changed dramatically in the past 109 years. It is time to update our music licensing laws to ensure that songwriters can continue to make a living.  Now, what the Music Modernization Act does to solve the problem is this. It creates a new simplified licensing entity to make it easier for the digital music companies--this is Spotify, Pandora--to obtain a license to play songs and ensure songwriters are paid when their music is played. Instead of Spotify and Pandora tracking down each songwriter or a songwriter's publisher to get permission to play his song, they will be able to submit one license and start playing a song right away. Transitioning to a blanket license for reproductions was recommended by the Copyright Office of the Library of In a February 2015 report on music licensing reforms, the Copyright Office recommended this blanket licensing approach that is included in the Music Modernization The Copyright Office report concluded that ``song-by-song licensing is widely perceived as a daunting requirement for new services and as an administrative drag on the licensing system as a whole.'' The move to a blanket system would allow marketplace entrants to launch their services--and begin paying royalties--more quickly.  Another important point is that the new licensing entity will not be a new government agency, and the digital music companies will pay to set it up and keep it running, not songwriters. The new entity will be governed by songwriters and music publishers, giving songwriters a say in how their work is used for the first time. The new entity helps songwriters because it will collect royalties each time a song is played, look for the songwriter, and hold on to the royalties for 3 years until they can be found. This helps songwriters because it ensures they are paid royalties for their work, whether they have a publisher or not. This helps digital music companies because it makes sure songwriters are paid and that means fewer lawsuits.  The legislation also improves transparency by creating a publicly accessible database for all music works, and it requires digital music companies to pay songwriters their royalties every month. Songwriters will receive usage reports on music that is played to make sure the money is all there. The new database is important because maybe a young aspiring songwriter co-wrote a song under an alias or moved or simply can't be located. The legislation allows songwriters to audit the licensing entity once a year, if the songwriter chooses.  Finally, the legislation requires the Copyright Royalty Board at the Library of Congress to use a fair market standard of what a ``willing buyer'' would pay a ``willing seller'' when the Board sets royalty rates. This helps songwriters receive a fair market royalty when their song is played online.  The Music Modernization Act, as Senator Hatch said, has broad support--unprecedented support. It is a consensus piece of legislation. It is supported by the National Music Publishers Association; the Digital Media Association; the American Society for Composers, Authors and Publishers, or ASCAP; Broadcast Music, or BMA; the National Songwriters Association International; and the Songwriters of North On January 8, these groups joined the Recording Industry Association of America, the Recording Academy, and more than a dozen music industry groups in endorsing the Music Modernization It will help thousands of songwriters in Nashville, across Tennessee, and across this country.  Songwriters, music publishers, and digital music companies have reached a consensus. Now it is up to Congress to provide a result. That is why I am working in such a bipartisan way and am so glad to be working with such imminent leaders as Senator Hatch, Senator Durbin, and others to pass the Music Modernization Act and give Tennessee and our Nation's songwriters the fair pay they have earned.  I want to thank Senator Hatch's staff, as well as my own staff, once again, because they have been working on this issue for some time. Senator Hatch was the original cosponsor of legislation in the 114th Congress, titled the Songwriter Equity I am proud to work with him.  I want to thank Representative Doug Collins and Representative Hakeem Jeffries, who are the sponsors of the bill in the House of They are leading the effort to get the bill through the House Judiciary Committee so it can be considered by the full  Finally, I wish to thank Bart Herbison, with the National Songwriters Association; David Israelite, with the National Music Publishers Association; Beth Matthews, with ASCAP; Mike O'Neil, with BMI; and Greg Barnes and Chris Harrison, with the Digital Media These individuals have all worked together and negotiated for months to try to produce consensus legislation to help songwriters and modernize the music licensing laws.  So let me end where I began. This is a bill to help songwriters. This is a bill to modernize a copyright system. This is a bill to help our laws keep up with the digital age, the internet world. This is a bill that has consensus among digital companies and songwriters and publishers for the first time. This is a bill to honor Orrin Hatch, who has served in this body since 1977, who is a songwriter himself, and who has been our leader on modernizing copyright laws from the very beginning. I intend to work as hard as I can in a bipartisan way, both in the Senate and the House, to pass this bill for the good of our country and as a capstone of the career of our senior Senator, Mr. I yield the floor.

136,topic-id,437,"Mr.President, I offer this statement to ensure the record reflects my opposition to the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, 2311, calendar 294, as considered by the Senate on Monday, January 29, 2018. Cloture was not invoked on the motion to proceed to 2311 by a vote of 51 to 46. Unfortunately, I was unable to be present for the rollcall vote to invoke cloture on this measure due to multiple flight delays traveling from Wisconsin to Washington,  I oppose this divisive legislation and would have voted against it, as I have previously when I voted against cloture on the motion to proceed to this legislation, H.36 when it was considered by the Senate on September 22, 2015. Let me be clear: I believe every American woman deserves access to quality, safe healthcare and the freedom to exercise her individual and constitutional rights to make her own private health decisions with her family and her doctor, without political interference.  Too many States have already enacted record numbers of laws that restrict a woman's access to reproductive health services and the freedom to make her own healthcare decisions. In Wisconsin, numerous measures have been signed into law that impose unreasonable requirements on providers and clinics that often leave families with nowhere to turn and threaten the ability of clinics in my home State to keep their doors open. Like the measure before the Senate, introduced by Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican politicians in Wisconsin have already enacted a 20-week ban on abortion procedures in our state, which has real and grave consequences for our families. Politicians are doing this because they think they know better than women and their doctors. The fact is they don't. It is not the job of politicians to play doctor and to dictate how these professionals practice medicine, nor is it the job of government to intrude into the private lives and important health decisions of American families.  The threat in Wisconsin and in States across the country is clear: When politicians play doctor, American families suffer. This is why my good friend and colleague Senator Richard Blumenthal and I have introduced the Women's Health Protection Act, 510, which would put a stop to these attacks on women's freedoms. This measure would prohibit laws, including State and local regulations,[[Page S575]]which unduly limit access to abortion services, including laws that single out providers, close down clinics, and impose onerous restrictions that do nothing to further women's health or safety.  I will continue to work for access to comprehensive reproductive care and vote against proposals that threaten a woman's right to make her own health decisions.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-30-pt1-PgS574-2.txt,1558,PAIN-CAPABLE UNBORN CHILD PROTECTION ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED,2018.0,30.0,January
630,topic-id,1760,"Mr.President, I am proud to be a Wisconsin Washington is broken. Washington isn't working for Wisconsin or Minnesota or the rest of America, for that matter. I rise today to call on all my Senate colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to fix it.  I think it is very important for all of us to be honest with the American people and shoot straight with how we got to this point where we are today, amidst a government shutdown.  At the end of September, nearly 4 months ago, the Republican majority missed a major deadline--a deadline to pass a budget for America and its government and appropriations bills that fund the government for the year. Republicans have the power of the majority here in the U.Senate, in the House of Representatives, and the Yet the Republican leadership has failed--failed to put together a budget for America and its government that provides certainty for our country. Families in Wisconsin who are struggling paycheck to paycheck put together a budget for their families because they have to in order to make ends meet. But here in Washington, my friends on the other side of the aisle have played by a different set of rules.  On Friday night, they didn't put forward a budget for America and its government. Instead, they offered their fourth short-term continuing resolution in the last 4 months. This is no way to govern, simply kicking the can down the road each month and ignoring the real needs of our country.  The Federal budget is not a calendar year budget; rather, it runs from October 1 to September 30 each year. There are all sorts of historical reasons for why that is, but among them, if we get our work done on time, the local governments and other entities that have calendar year budgets get to see what Federal funds have been allocated for the things that we do jointly that make a real difference in people's lives. The Congress is actually supposed to get its budget done in the spring and then finish its appropriations process by September 30. In fact, today we should be starting our work on the 2019 budget. Instead, we are still working on the 2018 budget that should have been completed last spring and appropriations bills that should have been done by September 30.  The majority had from September 30 until December 9--that was the first, short-term continuing resolution, as it is known--to get the job done. On a bipartisan basis, we allocated that time through a continuing resolution. The majority then had from December 9 until December 22, another short-term continuing resolution, and then from December 22 to January 19, another continuing resolution. But the governing majority still hasn't done its work, so they asked for yet another 4 weeks. This month-by-month approach from the majority has failed. It has failed to provide our military and troops with the budget certainty they need.  We heard from Secretary Mattis and his team this week about how harmful these continuing resolutions are to our Nation's military, and the majority should heed those words because it impedes the military's ability to plan for the defense of our Under repeated continuing resolutions, the Department can't start new programs, hiring and recruitment are limited, and our national security funding priorities are left on autopilot. The Defense Department has made it clear that they need a long-term budget, not week-by-week and month-by-month measures, but the majority has failed to deliver results.  Our veterans need VA reforms so that they can get the healthcare services they have earned, and I have worked in a bipartisan manner on a number of reforms of the VA Choice Program, but the continuing resolution offered--and rightly rejected by both Democrats and Republicans--shortchanges veterans' health when we should be working together to serve those who have bravely served this  Four months ago, congressional Republicans let funding for children's healthcare expire. They refused to pass legislation that funds the Children's Health Insurance Program, otherwise known as CHIP, and 170,000 children in the State of Wisconsin rely on CHIP for their healthcare. But the congressional Republicans were more concerned during that period of time with giving away massive tax breaks; 80 percent-plus of the benefits go to the upper 1 percent and big corporations. In fact, while these children were ignored, Republicans gave permanent tax cuts to powerful corporations and now won't provide permanent funding for the CHIP program for children's health insurance for low-income families.  Four months ago, the majority party that controls Washington let funding for community health centers lapse. In my home State, 300,000 Wisconsinites are served by community health centers, including kids on Two weeks ago, I visited one of those community health centers in Green Bay, The healthcare workers and staff describe the anxiety and uncertainty they feel every day because they don't know whether they will have the funding they need to minister to the healthcare needs of those whom they serve. Many community health centers can't move forward with longer term contracts for services or repairs or invest in new medical equipment because they don't know if or when Washington will act. They found out on Friday night that the continuing resolution offered, just like the three before it, failed to address funding for community health centers once again, but it did give tax breaks to big insurance companies. We cannot leave our community health centers without the funding they need to serve the people for whom we all work. We should take action now to fully fund them because they can't wait any longer.  I know that every one of my colleagues here in the Senate has come face to face with the opioid epidemic. I know I have. I have traveled my State and met with healthcare workers, local officials, people from law enforcement and the judiciary who are working on the frontlines of this crisis. I know what it is like to have a loved one dependent upon narcotics. I have met with families who have lost a loved one to this epidemic. I have met with family members who are currently finding their own lives totally upended because of a loved one who is hooked on opioids. There is bipartisan support for doing more. There is support across party lines for the Federal Government to step up and be a stronger partner in this fight. A short-term, stopgap measure isn't going to do it, and we all know it. So let's find the will to work together to provide strong investments in local communities so that they have[[Page S403]]the resources they need for prevention treatment and recovery efforts. Let's work together to save lives.  We are where we are right now because I think Washington has lost sight of what our work here should be about--making a difference in people's lives. Hundreds of thousands of young people have had their lives placed in limbo by the politics of The Dreamers, who have only known America as their home, are working hard. They are going to school. They are serving in our military. President Trump has threatened them with deportation. Right now, we have a bipartisan solution that Republican leadership in both the Senate and the House have refused to make a commitment to passing. This bipartisan solution strengthens border security and does right by the Just a couple of weeks ago, I spoke with an education leader in He told me that his school, a Catholic K-12 school, employs by his count 23 He can't imagine the devastating impact it might have if we don't figure this out.  On Thursday of last week, I spoke with a Wisconsin She made her way to DC--and this wasn't her first trip--to tell her powerful story. She asked for an update, and I told her what I thought was happening here. She told me she had just 8 days left before her DACA status expires, and she said: I don't know what I am going to do, how I will be able to work. Today, she has only 5 days left. We have a bipartisan solution that Senate Republicans and Democrats have worked on together, so let's do our job and let's get it done.  I have the privilege of working for a State with a work ethic that is second to none. I am deeply humbled by that privilege, and I do everything I can to respect and reward the hard work of That is why I have been working for months on pension reforms. When people work hard and they play by the rules and build their retirement security, they should be able to depend on the pensions they have earned. Right now, 25,000 Wisconsin retirees and workers have had their pensions threatened through no fault of their own. I have visited with these workers throughout the State of Wisconsin in Green Bay, in Endeavor, in Milwaukee, and Brookfield--hundreds of them. They each have a powerful story. I spoke to one worker who started his job as a trucker at age 23. He worked for 40 years. At several stages in his career, he had the opportunity, if you will call it that, to forgo a potential increase in wages so that he could put more into his pension, so he and his wife could enjoy a secure retirement. But today he and thousands of others are facing the prospect of massive cuts to the pensions they have earned, unless Congress acts. They can't afford to have us kick the can down the road once again. They need us to act and keep the promises of the pensions they worked so hard for. Let's work together. Let's work together and get the job done by passing the Butch Lewis Act and save the pensions that over a million workers and retirees across this country are counting on.  Mr.President, enough of round after round of fighting. The American people are fed up with it. They did not send us here to perform a monthly melodrama. They sent us here to get things done. They didn't send us here to play political games and create chaos. They sent us here to work together on solutions to the problems that they face and that we face jointly as a nation. The biggest problem we face right now is that Washington is broken. It is up to us to fix it, so let's start working together to get the job done.  I yield the floor.

234,topic-id,1772,"Mr.President, we have finally ended this government shutdown that was produced and directed by the Democrats in the  The reason Democrats decided to take this extreme step and shut down the government was because of the narrow issue of illegal immigration. They shut down services for citizens of the United States to provide services for people who are not citizens of the United States, and the Democrats have admitted it was all about this issue of illegal immigration.  There may have been another reason, as well, that Democrats wanted to shut down the government, and that was so they could change the subject being debated by people, talked about by friends, noticed by Americans, and making the headlines. That subject, of course, is the competence and optimism in the American economy--by workers, by people who are paying taxes, by people who realize how the Republican tax relief legislation is going to help improve their lives personally.  I think the success of the Republican tax relief bill scares a lot of It scares them because every one of them voted against it. They didn't think it was a good idea to let people keep more of their hard-earned money. The Democrats thought it was a better idea for possibly the government to keep that money and use it and spend it in ways many people--certainly in Wyoming--feel is not a good use of that money. Families know how to get more value out of their dollars than the government ever will. Democrats voted[[Page S510]]against it--the tax cuts that would actually create jobs all across the country, and we have seen that job creation occurring. They voted against the tax relief that is going to allow money to be brought back to America so investments are made in  It was so interesting to listen to Nancy Pelosi--the former Speaker of the House and now the minority leader in the House--refer to what we were doing in the Senate and in the House as She said it was the end of the world. That is what she said.  The American people, hard-working people, don't believe that at all. They believe it is good for them personally. It turns out that people who work at more than 200 companies in this country have already gotten a raise or some kind of a cash benefit or additional contribution to their retirement because of the tax law. That is why all those companies said they did it. Over 2 million people have obtained this benefit of the tax relief law, and more are going to benefit in the years ahead. Millions of Americans are going to start seeing more take-home pay in their paychecks next month. That is because of this tax relief law the Democrats--every one of them--opposed. We are seeing it not just with American families; we are seeing it with investments coming in from abroad.  This law has totally changed how we tax the money companies earn that sell things to people overseas. This chart goes through it. It used to be that when U.companies made money somewhere else; they paid taxes there. If they wanted to bring it back home, they had to pay taxes again, a double taxation. Very few countries do that, but the United States was one of them--double taxation. Businesses then had to make a decision, had to make a choice. It could bring money back home, pay taxes a second time, or keep the money overseas, invest it there, and not have to pay that second tax. A lot of companies, looking at the tax laws the United States had on the books previously, decided it was too much of a penalty to bring that money back home and invest it in the American economy. There was something like $2.8 trillion in American business that American businesses had been holding in other countries.  We actually had a tax code that worked to the advantage of foreign countries, not to the advantage of the United It was locking money out, keeping it overseas, keeping it from helping American workers at home. That is a very backward way to look at how the Tax Code should work. We changed the law when Republicans voted to change the tax law, give taxpayers relief. Now the money gets taxed once, not twice. It changed the system in America the way most countries around the world do it. That means businesses no longer have this warped incentive to keep their money out of the United It makes it much easier for that money to come back from overseas to the United It is good for It is what an America first economy looks like. It gets rid of this crazy Tax Code that we had, giving other countries an advantage--not anymore.  The second thing this tax relief law has done is actually cut taxes. When American businesses had to pay this second tax, the rates were very high--one of the highest in the world. It was adding insult to injury. Other countries have actually been cutting taxes for years--not the United States, not on our own companies in the United Here at home, we had one of the highest and most punitive taxes in the world. There wasn't a major country in the world where businesses paid as high a tax as we did in the United Washington was taxing companies about 35 percent if they tried to bring home some of the profits from overseas. Because of the tax law we passed and President Trump has signed, this rate has now dropped to 21 percent--from 35 percent to 21 percent.  Now our tax rates are actually below the average of other countries around the world. That puts American businesses at a significantly stronger position to compete around the world. It puts us at a competitive advantage. We got rid of the double taxation system--Republicans did--when we passed this law, and we cut tax rates significantly as well.  When you put these two things together--cutting the rates, making it easier to bring money back to the United States, eliminating this double taxation--it is a big help to American workers, to the men and women who work in America, as well as the businesses that employ those people. Businesses are much more likely now to invest in America, put their money back home, in American workers, in the American economy. We are seeing it already.  The tech company Apple recently announced it is increasing investments in U.operations. They said their total contribution to the American economy over the next 5 years will be $350 billion. They are planning to bring home as much as $250 billion in money that right now is parked overseas. They are talking about employing 20,000 more workers, hiring 20,000 more people. They have been letting that money sit overseas because of this system that locked the money out. Now, with the new tax law, it is going to be much easier to bring this money home and invest it in  It is not just We are seeing it with Fiat Chrysler, with Boeing, with AT&T, and with others. They are increasing investment in the United States and in the workers at home, and it is all because of the tax law the Republicans voted for, and every one of the Democrats voted against. It is no surprise that Democrats may have wanted to shut down the government to knock off the front page of the paper the headlines of the success of the tax law and instead see reports about the Democrats shutting down the government.  It is interesting. There has been so much economic activity after this changed that other countries are beginning to become nervous. Other countries used to know they had the upper hand over the United States when it came to investments in the economy, and they figured the United States would never get its act together enough to change the tax laws to make us the competitive, thriving economy we know we can be. These countries knew the U.tax law was working in their favor--not anymore.  Countries like China, the United Kingdom, and Japan are considering changing their own taxes in response to what we have done. We are leading the way. They are trying to play catchup with their economy. In Australia, as a matter of fact, they expect the loss of significant amounts of economic activity and growth to the United States because of the new tax law. Other countries are running scared because President Trump and Republicans in Congress are doing exactly what we promised the American people we would do. We are keeping our promises. We are putting American workers first. Tax relief is working. It is helping hard-working American families. It is creating economic growth. It is giving America the competitive edge we deserve because of the work we do, and we haven't had it in a long period of time.  Democrats said it would never happen, during the debate, on the tax law. First, they did everything they could to make sure we wouldn't get it passed--slowed it down, voted against it, talked against it. They were wrong, and now they know they were wrong. They have seen the money come back. They have seen the growth in the economy. They have seen the number of jobs created. They have seen the growth in wages. They are seeing people keeping more of their hard-earned dollars. They see people happier. They see a level of confidence and optimism that wasn't there in a previous administration.  The Democrats seem to be trying to change the subject by putting up a smokescreen--shutting down the government to avoid and try to deflect from the success the Republicans have allowed the American people to recognize in themselves because the tax laws have changed, and the American people will benefit from it for years to come.  It is time for the Democrats to give up the games, come to the table, join Republicans, and do what we know we need to do, which is put the American workers first. It is time for the Democrats to join the Republicans and work on behalf of all the American people who have sent all of us here in the first place, and we are seeing it now with the tax law and the tax relief and the tax cuts that are benefiting people all across this country.[[Page S511]]  I yield the floor.

Exactly 11 nights ago, Mr.Speaker, I walked into a secure vault, signed one of the most detailed nondisclosure documents I have ever seen, and viewed ``the memo.'' Everything I read was what I expected to read. That is what is outrageous to me. There was not much that I did not expect to find.  I thank Chairman Goodlatte, Chairman Gowdy, Chairman Nunes, and members of the House Intelligence Committee who have now voted to present that memo to the public. I am looking forward to President Trump shortly declassifying that memo permanently.  I have heard people say to me: You are eroding trust in government and in the finest law enforcement agency in the country, the FBI, with your continual attacks. But they don't understand that we are not attacking the We are seeking clarity, transparency, and an understanding of what went on under the leadership of the Department of Justice and the FBI in the previous administration. To not reveal that to the public is what erodes trust in their government.  Nothing in this memo will impair our national security. But if we are to withhold this memo from the American people, I believe that, instead, would harm our national security because it would harm the integrity of those agencies, and it would further erode the trust that Americans have in their government.

59,topic-id,970,"Madam President, today is a proud day but also a painful one for me. I am proud because I am honored and proud to join my distinguished colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Shaheen, and others on the floor. I was proud to join Connecticut organizations and advocates this morning in Hartford for a rally that involved Planned Parenthood of Southern New England, NARAL Pro-Choice Connecticut, the Women's March of Connecticut, AIDS Connecticut, and the Center for Medicare These groups are proud and steadfast and have strong activists who joined me to support a woman's right to determine her medical future, the right of privacy, and the constitutional right to be left alone, as one of the Supreme Court Justices once called it.  It was a proud moment for me also because it reminded me of my days as a law clerk for Justice Harry Blackmun, who was the author of Roe v. Wade and who taught me the constitutional principle that underlies a woman's right to determine her own healthcare decisions.  Harry Blackmun was a Republican appointee. He was a Republican before he became a jurist. But there was nothing partisan for him--and there should be nothing partisan for us--about this decision. I am tempted to call this 20-week abortion ban a Republican proposal, but when I think about the Republicans I know--and especially Justice Harry Blackmun, whom I revered--there is nothing Republican about this proposal. There is nothing partisan about a proposal that seeks to interfere in this fundamental right of privacy. It is an extremist, rightwing proposal that happens to have been brought here by 46 of our Republican colleagues--all of them men, except two--who are essentially trying to tell the women of America what to do with their own bodies, when to have children or not. That is fundamentally unconstitutional. It flies in the face of Roe v. Wade and all of its progeny. It is a restriction that has been struck down when adopted at the State level in at least two courts, and the others that have adopted similar proposals will be struck down, in my view, as well.  The consensus of the medical community, the legal community, and ordinary citizens, particularly women, is that women have reproductive rights that would be violated, dramatically and directly, by this proposal. It violates those rights for totally baseless reasons--policies founded on falsehoods. It is another excuse for rightwing dogma and ideology, out of touch with America, to seek to put opponents at a political disadvantage. It is transparently a political ploy.  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists--the doctors who are most qualified to present scientific, evidence-based facts--disagree with the assertions and falsehoods that fetuses can feel pain at 20 weeks. In fact, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists wrote--and I am quoting directly from medical experts on fetal health:       Sound health policy is best based on scientific fact and      evidence-based medicine. The best healthcare is provided free      of governmental interference in the patient-physician      relationship. Personal decision-making by women and their      doctors should not be replaced by political ideology.  Worse than the fabrications behind this bill are the very real consequences that will come if it is passed. This nationwide abortion ban would provide virtually no adequate exception when a woman's health is at risk, when there are fetal anomalies or when there are dangers to the health and well-being of a mother who is sick; or if her life is threatened, this bill fails to guarantee that she has access to the healthcare that she needs. If there is a fetal anomaly and a woman learns that her child will be born with significant impairments or, worse yet, a short life filled with pain, it would force her to carry that child to term. If a woman is advised that her child will not survive pregnancy at all, the most personal medical decisions of her life would be usurped by a cruel, heartless, unconscionable, unconstitutional law. She would be deprived of the right to make those decisions with her family, her clergy, her doctors.  The American public disagrees strongly with this potential law, as does the medical community, and individual doctors who have real-life experiences disagree strongly with it as well. One doctor who practices in Connecticut told me that for patients who are treated in that office who choose to get an abortion after 20 weeks, it is oftentimes ``an agonizing decision, an unexpected one, and too often a lonely one--a decision that is deeply personal and altering.''  For many women, he told me, medical tests show a devastating issue with a future child. ``A joyous event becomes a tragic one, as they learn of a lethal condition, or a syndrome that will lead to a brief life of suffering.''  I could quote other doctors. I could quote women who have been through this experience. But without exaggerating, it is one of the most deeply difficult, personal decisions that women have a right to make, without the interference of a politician, an insurance bureaucrat, or anyone else in positions of authority. It is their decision.  Congress must keep its hands off women's healthcare. To my colleagues, keep your hands off of women's healthcare. It is their lives and their well-being and their personal privacy that are at stake.  I am going to continue to fight this ban, painfully, because its consequences would be so cruel, but also because it is certainly not the Republican Party that I know that would advocate for it. It certainly should not be partisan in any way, and it certainly should not even be before us in this great Chamber, which has such respect and such a profound role in our To consider violating the Constitution so dramatically is a disservice to this great body.

83,topic-id,1302,"Mr.President, we are here at a historic moment. The President of the United States will come before us for his first State of the Union tonight, at a time when there is a credible case of obstruction of justice against him and an overwhelming case to show that the campaign that elected him was aided and abetted by the But the immediate threat is even more dire.  Yesterday was a new low for the House Intelligence The House Republicans, in an act of partisan gutter politics, voted to release a four-page, misleading, deceptive characterization of warrants submitted to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance This partisan gutter politics brings us to a dark day of character assassination much like the McCarthy days, when Members of this Chamber were counted in history as to whether they stood up and spoke out against this kind of smear campaign.  Not only is there character assassination at work here but also, equally dangerous to our democracy, the potential compromising of sources and methods vital to our national intelligence and our national security. That is the reason President Trump's own appointee at the Department of Justice, Stephen Boyd, stated that the release of this memo would be ``extraordinarily reckless.''  Those words come from a former staffer for a Republican Congresswoman and then-Senator Jeff Sessions--hardly a Democratic partisan. ``Extraordinarily reckless.'' Why? Because this memo, four pages long, summarizing a warrant that typically is tens or hundreds of pages, will reveal sources and methods vital to the continued operation of our intelligence community.[[Page S573]]  My colleague, Senator Whitehouse, has very powerfully and eloquently stated why this development is so threatening and so deeply troubling, but my Republican colleagues are apparently averse to listening to this kind of reasonable and sensible need for caution. They are about to ask the President to defy his own Department of Justice and disclose this memo.  Now, let's be very clear. I am one of the leading advocates in this body for transparency and disclosure. In fact, I believe strongly that all of the transcripts of interviews before the Judiciary Committee on the obstruction of justice investigation should be disclosed, and all of those witnesses should be called before us--in open hearings, under oath--to tell their stories so that the American public can understand what happened. I am in favor of challenges to warrants in the FISA Court--the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court--that may be defective or fallible. In fact, I was the leading advocate and drafter of a provision in the law now that provides for challenges to those warrants. It does so within the bounds of confidentiality that are necessary to protect our secrets and our national security.  What the House Intelligence Committee and potentially the President of the United States are about to do is essentially defy the law, an end-run so as to avoid the need for secrecy and confidentiality when it comes to intelligence gathering vital to our national security.  There is a procedure for challenging warrants when they are fallible. The House Republicans are refusing to follow it, and they are also refusing to provide any rebuttal to the distortions and mischaracterizations in that four-page memo.  Here is the reality: The United States was interested in Carter Page, who was viewed by the FBI as a Russian agent well before the 2016 Presidential campaign. In fact, their interest dates back to 2013, well before the Steele dossier, well before the election when Russian operatives sought to recruit him as a spy.  I am going to repeat that. The FBI thought Carter Page, who became a Trump campaign official, was an agent of the Russian That is a stark public truth. That, in and of itself, would have been enough to obtain a FISA warrant to surveil him. Remember, he doesn't have to be convicted. He doesn't have to be proven a spy beyond a reasonable doubt. It is the probable cause standard and sufficient suspicion that he is a Russian spy that provide the opportunity, legally, and indeed the obligation to do surveillance.  We also know that European and other intelligence agencies--including from the UK, Netherlands, Germany, France, Poland, Estonia, and Australia--all discovered interactions between Trump's inner circle and Russian intelligence beginning in 2015. In fact, the Australian Government told the FBI that George Papadopoulos bragged to an Australian diplomat over drinks at a bar that Russia had ``political dirt'' on Hillary Clinton while he was working for the Trump campaign. We know also that the Dutch Government informed the FBI of Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election through hacking. We know that Carter Page openly traveled to Moscow to give a pro-Russian speech, and we know he met with Russian officials just as the Kremlin was working to undermine the 2016 election.  The purpose of releasing this memo is to create, very simply, a false narrative, a distraction, a red herring--call it whatever you wish. Its purpose is to discredit and degrade the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Justice--law enforcement agencies that deserve the American people's support no matter who they are investigating as long as they are doing it objectively and dispassionately, as they are doing here.  Republicans conveniently ignore the facts--not only the facts that I have just recounted, the facts that are declassified, but also facts that they know well, facts that may continue to be classified. A 4-page memo simply cannot accurately summarize what is typically 100 pages or more in a FISA warrant application without cherry-picking facts to suit the Republican author's message.  I want to paraphrase one of our former colleagues, my friend and mentor Senator Patrick Moynihan: Everybody is entitled to their own opinion but not their own facts.  The American people should not be selectively presented with the facts and deceived by a memo that amounts to character assassination, a memo that endangers our national security, compromises the sources and methods of our intelligence community, and has only the purpose of degrading and discrediting the FBI and our Department of Justice as they engage in a valid, necessary investigation, through the special counsel, of Russian collusion in the last campaign, with the campaign itself, electing Donald Trump, and potential obstruction of justice afterward.  The hypocrisy and silence of many of my Republican colleagues in both Houses is deeply disappointing. Now is the time for people of conscience to stand up and speak out in favor of the rule of law and know that the fate and future of our democracy depends on it.  There will be a lot of rhetoric tonight in these Halls, but what matters now is action to defend our democracy. I am grateful to my very distinguished colleague for calling attention to the continued Russian meddling and interference in our democracy.

House Republicans are playing right into the hands of the The President of the United States, defying the law, declined to impose sanctions even after an overwhelming number of our colleagues here--98 to 2--voted in favor of those sanctions. Why is it that Donald Trump is so much enthralled with Vladimir Putin and the Russians? Perhaps it is because of the last campaign.  They are continuing with their interference and meddling, and they will do it again in 2018. CIA Director Mike Pompeo said today that they will do it again. And indeed they will unless they are made to pay a price. The absence of sanctions speaks louder than my words.  It is time for us to stand up and speak out.

The Presiding Officer has demonstrated repeatedly his convictions and conscience, and I want to say how much I have admired much of what he has done during his Senate career. My hope is that others in this body will step forward and say: Enough is enough.  The FISA Court--Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court--is a carefully crafted bipartisan institution meant to protect our country against foreign threats that would destroy our democracy--the very kinds of threats that Russia has repeatedly mounted against us. Its function is balanced by a concern about civil rights and civil liberties, which is why it is a court that must approve warrants for surveillance and searches. Its secrecy goes to the core of what it does so that the agents, operatives, and informants who are the sources of intelligence are protected.  The House Intelligence Committee is about to trash that carefully crafted structure. They are about to release a memo that says, in effect: That court--that carefully crafted balance as a result of bipartisan work over many years, involving many in this Chamber--means nothing. We will use it for the most gross partisan purposes, partisan gutter politics, and character assassination.  It is a reminder of the darkest days of the McCarthy era when similarly there was a contempt for basic fairness which persisted until Senator McCarthy was asked: Have you no sense of decency?  We are at that moment now, but it is a moment that is dark for all of us in this democracy. It is a moment that should elicit our strongest impulses for decency and democracy.  We know that the special counsel is proceeding with his investigation. We know there is a need to protect that special counsel against firing and political interference. We know there is a need for legislation that is bipartisan, and the need is now. This use of the most gross partisan politics and tactics is proof-positive that there is a need for this legislation.  My hope against hope is that the President will, in fact, impose sanctions; that there will be a bipartisan outcry against this defiance of a 517-to-5 vote, and in this body, a 98-to-2 vote; that there should be sanctions when there is this defiance of our interests by the Russian Government; and, rather than simply listing oligarchs from a Forbes magazine account, that there be real action and accountability.

It is a Trump shutdown because the President has enabled--indeed, encouraged--it to happen.  Across the aisle in the Senate, there are efforts to provide leadership and to fill the gap that has been created by a President who is AWOL in The lack of leadership is potentially tragic for this country. He has thrived on chaos and confusion, personal invective and insult.  The time is now for us in this body to fill that vacuum. We are divided in our Nation in many ways, but we are united in support of our military men and women. Two of my sons have served. And always in this Chamber and throughout the country, there is support for them and their families, who equally serve and sacrifice.  No speech on the floor here and no tweet by the President will change that fundamental unity and bipartisan support for our military men and women. That is why there was bipartisan support for rejecting a short-term, ``kick the can down the road'' patch in a continuing resolution.  A continuing resolution that flatlines funding for our national defense, both military and nonmilitary, is against our national interest. The most eloquent and persuasive voice on that topic is our Secretary of Defense, General  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the September 8 letter be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                             Secretary of Defense,                                                     Pentagon,                                Washington, DC, September 8, 2017.     John McCain,     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,     U.Senate, Washington,       Dear Mr.Chairman: I am writing in response to your August      29, 2017 letter regarding the potential impacts of another      fiscal year under Continuing Resolution (CR) authority. I      appreciate and share your concern in this matter.       Long term CRs impact the readiness of our forces and their      equipment at a time when security threats are extraordinarily      high. The longer the CR, the greater the consequences for our      force. A CR, if required, avoids a government shutdown and      provides an opportunity for a longterm solution that lifts      the BCA caps.       In the long term, it is the budget caps mandated in the      Budget Control Act (BCA) that impose the greater threat to      the Department and to national security. BCA-level funding      reverses the gains we have made in readiness, and undermines      our efforts to increase lethality and grow the force. Without      relief from the BCA caps, our air, land, and sea fleets will      continue to erode. BCA caps obstruct our path to      modernization, and continue to narrow the technical      competitive advantage we presently maintain over our      adversaries.       The Service Secretaries and Chiefs have identified many of      their specific concerns about operating under a CR      (enclosed). I appreciate that you share our concerns, and      look forward to working with you in FY18 as we build a      solution to alleviate the BCA caps.       I have provided similar letters to the other Chairs and      Ranking Members of the House and Senate Committees on Armed      Services and     James                                  ____    Impacts of a Continuing Resolution Authority in Fiscal Year 2018       This summary describes the most likely impacts of operating      under a Continuing Resolution (CR), if enacted for Fiscal      Year 2018 (FY18). The impacts of a CR depend in part on the      level of funding provided and the duration of the CR period.       The Military Departments and Defense Agencies are      justifiably concerned that under a CR, the Department cannot      reprogram FY18 funds until a full appropriation is enacted.      Inability to reprogram CR funds drastically reduces the      ability to respond to urgent requirements or to address      funding gaps that damage readiness.       During a CR, we remain committed to supporting the      warfighter. The Military Departments will realign or execute      CR and existing budgetary resources within the limits of      their authorities to fully support forward-deployed      operations, direct support activities, and urgent operations      of the Combatant Finding ways to fully fund such      essential activities while operating during a CR does not      make CRs any less disruptive or detrimental--in reality,      doing so imposes a great burden on DoD's foundational      capabilities, and immediately manifests in impacts on      training, readiness and maintenance, personnel, and      contracting.       Training: Impacts begin immediately, within the first 30      days of a By 90 days, the lost training is unrecoverable      due to subsequent scheduled training events. These training      losses reduce the effectiveness of subsequent training events      in FY18 and in subsequent years.       Most major exercises and training events are scheduled for      the spring and summer, and presume individual and unit-level      training was completed. Training scheduled during the period      of the CR, however, must be re-scoped and scaled to      incorporate only mission essential tasks and objectives, so      units enter the major exercises less prepared.       For example, the scope of a Joint live fire field training      exercise (FTX) scheduled to execute in conjunction with      annual Marine Corps weapons certification events may have to      be reduced during a CR by limiting weapons crews to firing at      levels that firing tables specify as necessary to maintain      certification, thus forgoing the added training benefit of      firing weapon systems in a Joint operational context. Without      this experience, the Marines would then enter their major      exercises and training rotations without the benefit of      having practiced coordinating joint fires, or the experience      of firing in an operational environment.       Air Force must preserve core readiness training for      deployed or next-to-deploy units, at the cost of      institutional training and flying hours. Lack of funds to      stand-up two F-16 training squadrons, reduced aircraft      availability, and inability to grow the force (military and      civilian) will further reduce pilot production, leaving the      Air Force unable to train the number of pilots necessary for      continued readiness recovery. Cancellation of exercises will      further degrade pilot training and readiness.       Readiness and Maintenance: The impacts of a CR are felt      immediately, and grow exponentially over time. Although      maintenance impacts can be mitigated for some activities      operating under a 3-month CR, in areas such as Navy Ship      Depot Maintenance, funding shortfalls result in delays in      Naval vessel availability, which may affect subsequent      deployment rotations.       Under a CR, funding reductions will impact all major      activities not related to deployed forces, including: depot      maintenance, individual and collective training, and      munitions procurement. Failure to properly fund readiness      restoration initiatives in a stable and consistent manner      will impede the recovery of our readiness, which has just      begun to see tangible results, and may prove fatal in a      future conflict with major-power adversaries. Furthermore, a      ready force requires continued and stable investment in our      munitions inventory and a CR will not provide the Services      the necessary flexibility to procure and develop weapons, nor      build sufficient infrastructure to align with the      Department's readiness recovery efforts.       Navy will delay the induction of 11 ships, which will      exacerbate the planned ship maintenance in FY18, and will      slip ship availabilities into FY19, further impacting that      plan.

VirginiaMAHAN DDG-72....................  19 Feb............  Virginia------------------------------------------------------------------------Under a 90-Day CR, all listed ship inductions will be delayed, as the  shipyards' capacity is not capable of fully ``catching-up'' lost work,  thus the entire schedule slips to the right. This means that even a  relatively short CR creates delays in ship depot maintenance, thus  deployment timelines, into subsequent years.       Under a 3 month CR, Army will defer supply transactions,      and then later have to pay more to get parts fabricated or      shipped quickly, in order to keep up with maintenance      timelines. Under a 6 month CR, Army will order parts from      sources outside the DoD supply system, just to keep up with      operational demand. These external transactions will cost      more and fail to leverage the efficiencies built into the      centralized supply system.       Under a CR, the Army will have about $400 million per month      less in their operating accounts. Beginning in a 3 month CR,      it will be forced to restrict home station training       Immediately under a CR, Army will postpone all non-critical      maintenance work orders until later in the year.       Within the first 3 months of CR, Navy will reduce flying      hours and steaming days for those units not deployed or next      to deploy. It will delay the replenishment of spares and      repair parts on supply shelves in our ships, submarines, and      aircraft carriers across the non-deployed       The Military Departments will limit execution of      infrastructure funding by prioritizing life, health and      safety requirements. For the Air Force, this will affect 79      major installations worldwide and negatively impact aircraft      bed-downs and mission generation.[[Page S414]]       The lack of a National Defense Authorization Act, the legal      requirement for specific appropriations for major military      construction projects, and new start restrictions within the      CR combine to mean that no new major military construction      projects can be initiated using CR funds, with an inevitable      delay in project schedules and potential increased costs. For      the Navy this will impact 37 projects; the Air Force has 16      projects; the Army has 38 projects.       Personnel: The uncertainty imposed during a 3-month CR      causes most hiring actions and recruitment to be curtailed,      and vacancies to then be re-announced once an appropriation      is enacted. This disruption leaves critical gaps in the      workforce skill set and causes unnecessary angst among      military and: civil servants, making the Government a far      less attractive option to the highest-skilled potential      candidates.       Both Congress and the President agree need exists to add      military personnel to meet critical skill gaps such as      pilots, maintainers, cyber experts, and nuclear trained      personnel. A CR will delay the accession process, with the      consequence that units and organizations will continue to      lack the full complement of personnel they need to be      effective.       Professional development and training for both military and      civilians will be delayed.       Non-critical travel, which includes PCS moves for civilians      and military members and their families, will be curtailed.      This often results in missed hiring opportunities as      potential employees pursue other options. It creates      unnecessary turmoil for families who had otherwise planned to      relocate, whose orders are delayed; and may then result in      missed schoolyear timing for dependent spouses and children.       Adverse outcomes for medical beneficiaries experiencing      potentially life threatening illnesses due to delays in      receiving the required treatment. Beneficiary health care is      an entitlement and there is no mechanism to slow down or      reduce the demand for services.       Payments to medical care providers for services rendered      for patients will be delayed. This results in a potential      reduction in future access to private sector health care for      DoD beneficiaries, as a result of providers discontinuing      services to patients paid by       Contracting: The impacts of a CR on DoD contracting efforts      are significant and begin within the first 30 days of each      Every contract that has to be re-competed represents      additional work for the already-pressed DoD acquisition      workforce. In addition to these increased administrative      costs, new start rules and funding constraints carried      forward under each CR extension combine to increase the      likelihood that costs of material and labor in the contracts      themselves will also grow. To the vendors and manufacturers,      the Government becomes a less reliable, higher-risk customer.       As is the case in the private sector, DoD saves money by      buying in quantity. When we are forced to sever contracts and      renegotiate terms with each CR, our costs grow to offset the      increased risks and delays; we offer vendors less stability      and predictability, and pay accordingly.       Acquisition programs are forced to use incremental contract      actions to preserve efforts and schedules, which inevitably      results in higher program costs and schedule delays. Each      iteration of contract rework further taxes the DoD      Contracting community, doubling or tripling their workload      annually.       Under a CR, there are generally no new-starts, and no      production rate increases for acquisition programs with      budgetary program quantities of record.       In FYl8:       In the first 3 months under a CR, the Army has 18 new      starts and 8 production rate increases that would be      impacted. These include the Paladin Integration Management      Improvement, Interim Combat Service rifle, Multi-role Anti-     armor Anti-personnel Weapon System, Lightweight 30mm cannon      and the Armored Multi-purpose Rate increases are      planned for handguns, TOW2 missiles, M240L medium machine gun      and the Advanced Tactical Parachute system.       Beyond three months (4-12 months), the Army would have 24      additional new starts and 7 additional production rate      increases. The new starts include the Udairi Range Target      Lifters, Heavy Equipment Transporter System, and the Modular      Catastrophic Recovery Production rate increases      include modifications to Stinger and Avenger, Guided Multiple      Launch Rocket System, and the Reduced Range Practice       The Navy has 7 procurement contracts that will be delayed      by a 6-month CR due to the new start restrictions. It also      has 12 planned production rate increases that will be      deferred and 3 research and development new starts.       The Air Force has a total of 6 new starts that would be      impacted by a 6-month These include multiple F-15C and F-     16 upgrades and the Joint Space Operations Center Mission      system.       Funding limitations for all resarch and development will      result in the Services assessing the relative priorities of      their programs, resulting in providing only minimum      sustaining funding to the selected programs.

670,topic-id,633,"Mr.President, Secretary Mattis informed Congress:       Long term CRs impact the readiness of our forces and their      equipment at a time when security threats are extraordinarily      high. The longer the CR, the greater the consequences for our      force.  So my Republican colleagues should take no solace in the harmful CR--whether it is 3 weeks or 4 weeks--that they are continuing to insist that the U.Senate approve.  In fact, I believe we can fully fund our government today without requiring the mass draconian deportation of children in March, without abandoning our commitment to opioid treatment programs, without ending the Children's Health Insurance Program, without forgoing community health centers, and without forgoing pensions our veterans need. We can do all of it. We must do all of it. The elements of consensus are there. There is bipartisan support for every one of these programs.  Opioid treatment and addiction were supported in the Cures Act, as well as other measures, by overwhelming bipartisan consensus. We all support opioid treatment programs.  We support addressing the pension needs of veterans of this Nation and their challenges. We cannot abandon them.  We support making sure there is disaster relief for Puerto Rico, Texas, and  We support measures that will preserve the Children's Health Insurance Program and the community health centers.  These measures should not be options, luxuries, or choices. We have an obligation. We are a nation strong enough in the courage of our convictions to do all of it and to meet the obligation.  It is a moral obligation and an economic obligation to provide a path to citizenship for the We have a moral obligation because we made a promise--great nations keep their promises--to those 800,000 young people brought to this country as infants and children without any choice of their own. There is a bipartisan consensus to give them that path to citizenship.  There is growing acceptance of the funding that the minority leader, Senator Schumer, put on the table to build a wall, if that is what is necessary to achieve a compromise. It is a compromise on our part, but that is what an agreement is. Each side must give something.  There is bipartisan consensus for every one of these elements, and every one of them should be part of a full budget. A full budget is what is necessary.  Most Americans want their government open. Most Americans want bipartisan agreement that will keep their friends--coworkers, neighbors who were brought to this country as children--safe from arbitrary seizure and deportation from the only home they have ever known. Most Americans recognize that moral obligation, and most Americans recognize the economic advantages. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, half a trillion dollars would be lost in economic activity and in workforce contribution if there were these mass deportations.  Most Americans want us to face our national opioid addiction epidemic. Americans want community health centers and a host of our pressing priorities that were all pushed aside, delayed, and denied in the mad dash by our Republican colleagues for a tax bill that benefits mainly the rich.  The Republicans who have spoken today seem to imply we have to make a choice. They want to falsely blame or frame this debate as if we must choose between the Dreamers and our troops. That is a false choice. It is an unnecessary and, in fact, irrelevant choice. There is no such choice that has to be made. We can do both.  A great nation can be strong militarily and also be a nation that keeps its promises. In fact, the two go together.  We are a nation of immigrants. Our strength is our diversity, and we have made a promise to the Dreamers, and that promise is one that we must keep.

67,topic-id,766,"Madam President, I join Senator Grassley and my colleagues in supporting the bill before us today.  As we debate this issue, it always seems to be such a defining issue in terms of who we are and whom we hope to be. No country in Europe allows a pregnancy to be ended this late in the pregnancy. No country in Africa allows a pregnancy to be ended this late in the pregnancy. Only six other countries in the world allow pregnancies to be ended at any time. As I have listened to the debate today, the debate about 20 weeks, it sounds to me like it wouldn't matter to the opponents of the bill if it were at 30 weeks, certainly, or at 21 weeks or at 20. There is no week one can pass here.  The other bill we should vote on, which the House has passed, is the born-alive bill. There are people in the country today who actually oppose the born-alive bill. When a baby during an abortion process is born alive, my understanding is, you can't step in and take the life of that living child, but you can all step back from the table, on which that baby lies in front of you, and let the baby die.  Obviously, there is a point at which we are not going to be able to talk to each other in a way that apparently will persuade anybody. Maybe hearts will not change, and maybe minds will not change in the Senate today, but as many of my colleagues have pointed out, they are changing in the country. People realize there is a time when that child has every opportunity, with a little help, to live independently. That, surely, would be too late to end that life in the minds of most people. In the minds of younger people? It is more of the view of older people that life should be saved, but 63 percent of all Americans say we shouldn't continue to allow this to happen.  Senator Grassley just said and others have said a majority of women, a majority of Democrats, a majority of Republicans, a majority of young people all believe this is not an acceptable place for us to be. Why would we want to be one of seven countries in the world that would allow abortion at any time? Why would we want to be one of four countries in the world that would allow abortions at a time when it is widely accepted that the child being aborted--the life being taken--is a child who can feel pain?  As we come to this point today--and while a majority of Senators, I think, will vote for this, though not a big enough majority to put it on the President's desk--I think, once again, we have to ask ourselves: At what point do our friends on the other side, who clearly disagree with us on this issue, feel a life is clearly a life that should be saved? Would you vote for the born-alive bill? Would you vote for this bill if it were at 25 weeks? Would you vote for this bill if it were at 28 weeks? I don't hear any of that in the debate. It is just: This is not the government's business. At some point, it is the government's business. Protecting life is at some point the government's business.  When the Presiding Officer and at least one other person and I served in the House, we changed the law. It was Laci and Conner's When a homicide is committed and the woman is pregnant and the child is lost also, that is considered in law as a double homicide--two lives having been taken at that point, two lives at 20 weeks or at 12 weeks or at 15 weeks. I am not sure where that threshold begins, but I do know we have decided this is not just one crime; that it is two crimes when that happens.  We have an opportunity today to define something that is pretty clearly and significantly defining as to who we are as a nation. Otherwise, virtually every country in the world wouldn't have stopped doing this, if it ever had allowed it to happen in the first place.  I urge my colleagues to join in passing this bill--in standing up for those who cannot defend themselves--and to understand that harm is done, and when harm is done in this way, our society is harmed by that harm.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Moran). The Senator from  ",CREC-2018-01-29-pt1-PgS527-6.txt,1464,CHILD PROTECTION IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2017,2018.0,29.0,January
668,topic-id,2143,"Mr.President, one of the unusual things about the moment we find ourselves in is that we are debating on virtually all fronts on topics that 70 percent of the Senators agree on. When you look at the appropriating bill, at least 70 Senators are for the Children's Health Insurance Program--maybe 90, maybe more than that. It is a widely supported program. Nobody really believes that the Obama taxes and ObamaCare on medical device taxes ever made any sense, or the so-called Cadillac tax, where if you have worked hard and, in many cases, worked and negotiated an insurance coverage package, now the government says it is better than it should be and you should pay taxes on that, or that everybody should pay an individual tax on their healthcare. Nobody is for that.  Surely everybody wants the government's doors to stay open and so, on that front, one of the major criticisms of stopping the continuing resolution from going on is that nobody is opposed to it. So they are using that totally as leverage on an issue that we, also, almost all agree on. As to these kids who came here as kids--and I have met a number of them as the Presiding Officer has--one of the first questions I often ask is, Well, how old were you when your parents brought you here? The answer is often 18 months, 2, 3, followed by something like: Now I work at an architectural firm, or I just graduated from college--or whatever else they might say about what they are doing now. They clearly grew up in this country; we all get that. This is not a hard problem to solve, I don't believe. But leverage has somehow become the big issue here.  First of all, we let the appropriations process collapse, where only a few people have anything to say about how we spend our money, and then we have decided we will let the whole legislating process collapse and have spent way too much time on confirming people who there is no opposition to.  And then our friends on the other side, like the Democratic leader, insist on 30 hours of debate or 8 hours of debate where there is no debate. All you do is use up that time so nothing else can happen. He says: Why can't we debate this issue? We could debate this issue if we hadn't just spent an entire week confirming four district judges. These are not four Supreme Court Justices and they are not four circuit judges who will handle appeals from the district court. We spent an entire week last week doing nothing but that. And these judges were all confirmed. On Monday, we all knew they were going to be confirmed. They were all confirmed by the end of the week, but we spent the whole week doing that. The same people who insisted on that wonder why we don't have time to debate the issues we would all like to debate.  I would like to have seen the children's health insurance bill debated, but we ran out of time. We are now beyond the time when the bill expired. States are beginning to have stress on that. I would have loved to have seen a debate there, and I would love to see that debate include expanding excellence in mental health to a few more I would have loved to have seen that debate include the expansion we need in community health centers. But we didn't have time for that. We were[[Page S412]]spending needless time confirming people who were ultimately going to be confirmed.  Remember, the rules on this are 30 hours of debate on the floor if anybody insists on it. For a circuit judge, we had 30 hours of debate. There are only so many hours in a week, and we are wasting those hours. That rule has to change, and if we can't change it one way, my guess is eventually the frustration will become so great, we will change it another way.  We find ourselves here in a government shutdown with no disagreement on what we are talking about. This is just to show who is running the The majority, at the end of the day, is going to run the That is what always happens. If our friends on the other side want to run the Senate, they need to get in the majority, but this will not be the way they get there.  My good friend the Senator from Hawaii and I have a common health issue with kidney cancer. We both lost a kidney, and that is a binding sort of thing. So when I say I care about her a lot, I do. But she said: How dare people talk about kids who were brought here illegally as people who came here illegally.  I think a great disservice was done to the DACA kids when the other side decided they wanted to make them a focal point on a debate that has nothing to do with them.  Don't act surprised that other people are going to come to a conclusion that the weakest point in the argument for DACA kids is that every one of them came to the country illegally. They were brought here illegally, but every one of them came to the country illegally. And we need them. They grew up here. They went to school here. We need that vital, strong population that is part of a growing the economy. Seventy percent of the country, if not 80 percent, agrees with that. This is an issue that could be solved, but we see the further deterioration of how we spend our money.  The appropriations process, for a decade now, has come down to one big bill at the end that almost nobody had anything to say about. It certainly has strengthened leadership on both sides. It has weakened membership on both sides. I don't think the leaders want the power that they have gotten through this wrecked process.  For 200 years, we appropriated our money by bringing bills to the floor. I imagine that initially there may have been one bill. In recent years, there have been a dozen--one or two at a time--on the floor. Every Member of the House and every Member of the Senate could propose any amendment they wanted to as long as it was about spending and didn't add any money. We haven't seen this enough times in recent years. People can hardly remember the process in the Senate, although the House has rediscovered it. A bill comes to the floor, and you say ``I think we ought to spend $1 million more here than we are spending, and I propose we do that by cutting this other category by $1 million,'' and then all the Members vote.  We are never going to have that debate this year. The Speaker saw that debate on the other side. We will never have that debate here because starting a decade ago, roughly, the Democratic leader of the Senate decided that we were not going to bring those bills to the floor unless they are unamendable. Four or five years ago, when--I think my math is right--Barbara Mikulski, the great Senator from Maryland, an incredible legislator, had become chairman of the Appropriations Committee for the only 2 years in her career, she aggressively argued with the leadership on her side all the time: Let's bring these bills to the floor and debate the bills. Let's not have one big bill at the end of the year or, even worse, one big bill 4, 5, 6 months into the next year.  We have to figure out how to recapture the process of our responsibility. This works. It includes the Members and the people they work for in a way that we are not now included. The debate on how we spend our money becomes public in ways that are not now public.  We can't bring an appropriations bill to the floor in the Senate without 60 Members being willing to debate the bill. One way we could do this is just figure out how to change it to where an appropriations bill--maybe all bills--don't need 60 Members just to debate the bill. I am a believer that once you got these bills started and once you started debating them and once Members got to see that their own amendment wasn't nearly as popular as they thought it would be, that we would then get to the final vote, and we would then pass a bill or maybe a package of a couple of bills. The House would do the same. We would have a conference. They would go to the President's desk. He would sign those bills, and that part of the government would be funded for the next year.  Year after year, this has been brought down to where virtually nothing is funded on September 30 for the October 1 fiscal year. Here we are, January 21. To still be talking about work that should have been completed in September is unacceptable.  If we can't see this moment where we are debating two big issues that everybody agrees on--the component parts of both of those big issues--if we can't see this as a moment where we need to fundamentally change how we get this work done, we may have lost the constitutional responsibility that the Congress has to set our priorities based on how we spend our money.  The one thing I know for sure is how we are deciding to spend our money now is not the best way to do it. It has now led to where it is now a late-year fight about, well--and I think defense is the principal reason for the Federal Government to exist. The 1 priority of the Federal Government is to support the common defense. But we have gone beyond ``I want more money for defense, but before I do that, I would like to have more money for something else, as well'' to--it is not even about the appropriations bill. We are not even going to give you a number to appropriate to on the appropriations bill. We don't want to fund the government now until we do something that has nothing to do with funding the government.  Maybe that is the logical conclusion of years of bad behavior. Maybe that is the logical conclusion of thinking you can hide the work of the Congress behind a massive bill that nobody understands, that everybody says: Well, I want to be in that massive bill that nobody understands either.  I believe one of the issues that was debated the last few hours was, we want to put our bill that would help DACA kids on a bill that must pass. We are not going to be happy unless our bill is guaranteed to get on another bill that would have a better chance of passing than our bill.  What we need is a DACA bill that can pass on its own. Surely you can take a 70-percent or 80-percent issue and combine it with another 70-percent issue of people who believe we ought to do a better job securing the border and managing people who have come into the country in other ways, as well--surely you can take those two issues and find a way to put them together in a bill that winds up on the President's desk. But there appears to be little confidence in that and frankly little confidence in the way we appropriate money.  This is an outrageous place to be in. You and I, Mr.President, and other Members of the Senate and Members of the House need to figure out what we can do to convince enough of our colleagues that either the rules need to change or the behavior needs to change so that everybody has an opportunity to talk about the priorities of the government, how those are funded, and so that we also have time to get to the important debates that we would all like to be part of.  I hope we can reach a conclusion quickly. People deserve for their government to be open. People deserve the very opening of the government not to be held hostage to things that have nothing to do with appropriating money but everything to do with a Congress that no longer works the way the American people deserve to see it work.  I hope we find a conclusion quickly and let the doors of the government be open to the people the government is supposed to serve, rather than those very doors to be used as a leverage because legislators couldn't figure out how to legislate.

698,topic-id,919,"Mr.President, I think we have just witnessed here what the problem is. This should not be a situation where Americans are being hurt, and right now Americans are being hurt. We have heard it from the Senator from North We have heard it from my colleagues from Connecticut, from Ohio, and from We all agree that Americans right now are getting hurt. We don't have to do that, but we have just heard one Senator--and I imagine other Republicans agree--reject a simple idea.  Let's not hurt folks. Let's stay here for 3 days and just extend the U.We can stay in our seats and get this work done and work something out. It is an easy way to go forward, and nobody gets hurt. That was objected to.  We said 1 day, a 24-hour period. Let's do 1 day. That was rejected.  The Senator from North Carolina made a suggestion that maybe we stand up straight. I love that suggestion. He suggested that we stay through the night instead of having people stressed and worried and some people missing work and missing paychecks. Let's stay here all night. Let's make everybody feel uncomfortable. I would work on that unanimous consent as well. But it seems the Senator from North Carolina has rejected his own idea.  This is what I don't understand, because I agree with the Senator from North Carolina, who keeps commenting about the military, when the military itself--the Secretary of DOD, through the spokesperson--has said a 4-week CR, if I remember the quote exactly, would be wasteful and disastrous. So military leaders are saying what we are doing is wrong.  Let's not kick the ball down the road for four weeks and instead stop hurting people and get the work of the Senate done. I am willing to stay here all night. It is not like the Senator from North Carolina is not willing to stay here all night.  So we stand together today to say: Let's minimize the damage of this. Let's do what we can to not hurt people.  That brings up the unanimous consent that I would like to propound. If 3 days is rejected, if 1 day is rejected, if just staying here through tonight and working on this as a Senate, facing discomfort, facing exhaustion is worth it, then let's take some of the worried people in the U.off the table.  That is why I have an amendment to permanently extend the Children's Health Insurance Program and provide funding for community health centers. The reason why I say this is because, somehow, our children--the most vulnerable children in our country--have been pushed into a political debate, which is a political debate because nobody denies that they are in favor of providing healthcare for our children.  This program expired 112 days ago. For those of you who think that this is[[Page S424]]going to cost us money to provide health insurance for children, it doesn't cost any money. The CBO actually said it saves the government money. Why? Because it is something that every one of the 100 of us knows--that when you protect children, neonatal children, babies, when you give them healthcare, you actually save long-term healthcare costs.  So here is something that would provide millions and millions of dollars of savings and take vulnerable children and States who are worried about providing for those children and that anxiety out of this political debate. If we can't do something for our most vulnerable children, I don't know what that says about our body. This is a moral moment. It was 112 days ago that this bill expired and, somehow, suddenly, that has been put into a 4-week CR at a time of a political debate. It seems to me that we are trying to use our children as a political pawns.  There are so many kids that are being affected by this--9 million nationwide, 159,000 kids in New Jersey, about 47,000 in Hawaii, and about 197,000 in  I believe this is something that is just common sense. It should be a matter of just conscience.  So I would like to make sure that the children in this political fight are not hurt. I would like to make sure that our community health centers in both rural spaces and urban spaces, all over our country--our community health centers that serve 25 million people nationwide, 300,000 veterans--are not hurt. We are concerned about the military, and we should also be concerned about our veterans, and 7.5 million children in our community health centers.  Let me say again that America's community health centers serve 7.5 million children. Let's fund them both, move them off the table, not inject them into a political debate to be used as pawns for leverage to do something that the U.military and the Department of Defense has criticized--what we are doing right now, what the proposal is, four weeks.  So I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar 36, H.1301; that the Stabenow-Casey-Brown amendment at the desk, providing for permanent extension of the Children's Health Insurance Program, a 5-year extension of the community health centers program, and extensions of other expired Medicaid, Medicare, and health extenders, be considered and agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.

1009,topic-id,1148,"Mr.President, tonight in the State of the Union Address, President Trump will discuss the importance of infrastructure investment. This is an important conversation for the administration to lead because our Nation's infrastructure is in need of an overhaul. Having the support of the administration provides us tremendous opportunity to revamp the way we prioritize and fund our Nation's infrastructure.  As a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, I understand the importance of infrastructure investment. Since I came to Congress, I have been a constant advocate for increased investment, particularly for our Nation's water resources. Last Congress, I supported the passage of the Water Infrastructure Improvement for the Nation Act, as well as a comprehensive highway bill, the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Passing these pieces of legislation was a major step forward, but only a step in the process. There is still more to be done, and I am looking forward to the opportunity to make critical infrastructure investments this  Like many Americans, I am encouraged by the President's commitment to improving our Nation's crumbling infrastructure. Looking at the example set by President Dwight Eisenhower and the establishment of the Interstate Highway System, it is clear that infrastructure investment boosts our economy, creates immediate jobs, and produces decades of economic prosperity and opportunity.  Unfortunately, since President Eisenhower signed the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, we have relied on a fix-as-fail approach to our Nation's infrastructure. Not only is this approach more expensive, increasingly causing delays to commerce, but it also poses a risk to public safety. By ensuring that our roads, bridges, and water systems meet an American standard for excellence, we can save many lives. In water infrastructure funding alone, the United States faces a shortfall of over $500 billion, which includes drinking water, wastewater, storm water, and water supply projects. This funding shortage is reflected in the American Society of Civil Engineers' overall grade for America's infrastructure, which is a D-plus. This is not a rural issue or a big city issue. It is not a red State problem or a blue State problem. This is a national emergency, one where we can find bipartisan support.  We can, and must, work together to provide all Americans with safe and reliable drinking water and effective wastewater and storm water treatment. Access to safe and clean water is critical to the livelihood of every  Senator Booker and I am introducing commonsense legislation that will revolutionize the way we invest in needed water infrastructure. The Securing Required Funding for Water Infrastructure Now--or SRF WIN--Act takes the best of State revolving funds, SRFs, and combines them with the best of the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act, better known as  The SRF WIN Act creates a significant pot of money within the WIFIA Program that is available only to Further, the bill allows State SRFs to bundle their priority drinking water and wastewater projects together and make a single loan request. This dramatically increases the availability of SRF funding to communities across the Nation while substantially reducing the time and related costs for completing projects.  Because all 50 State SRFs have a triple A bond rating, they have a very low risk of default, less than one-half of 1 percent. This, combined with the leveraging power of WIFIA, has given the SRF WIN Act the leveraging capacity of an incredible 100 to 1, according to technical assistance provided by the EPA's Office of  Simply put, the SRF WIN Act is a critical component to future water infrastructure financing. With a $1 billion investment, the U.Government will create over $50 billion in project money.  This is not a handout; this is a loan from the Federal Government to the States that will be paid back over 35 years. The SRF WIN Act gives communities the tools they need to help themselves. Instead of waiting decades for funding, communities will be able to invest in their crumbling water infrastructure now. With 35 years to pay back their loan, ratepayers will avoid harm and not see massive rate spikes.  What the SRF WIN Act does is simple. It combines the efficiency and trust associated with the SRF with the leveraging power of This legislation makes the process easier and more affordable for States and communities to access Federal water infrastructure funding. I encourage my colleagues who support the SRF, WIFIA, and more funding for water infrastructure projects in rural communities and big cities alike to cosponsor the SRF WIN  This has been a monumental effort of bipartisan work. Senator Booker and I have been working for months to meet with everyone in the water industry to ensure that our bill helps people all over the country, in communities both big and small. This bill is the result of months of negotiations, taking the best ideas available to ensure this commonsense, bipartisan legislation will work effectively and efficiently, providing billions in project dollars to communities that have traditionally not had access to these types of funds.  I would like to specifically thank the EPA Office of Water, the Council of Infrastructure Financing Authorities, the American Water Works Association, the Water Environment Federation, and the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies for providing us technical assistance to ensure that we preserve the WIFIA and SRF  The fact is, communities need every possible funding tool at their disposal, and this bill is another great tool that will work with the WIFIA and SRF  The SRF WIN Act has strong support from rural and municipal water and[[Page S584]]wastewater organizations. This landmark legislation also has the support of our Nation's leading construction, engineering, labor, and manufacturing organizations, including the National Rural Water Association, the Council of Infrastructure Financing Authorities, the American Society of Civil Engineers, the Associated General Contractors of America, the American Council of Engineering Companies, the National Association of Clean Water Agencies, Ducks Unlimited, the American Public Works Association, the Rural Community Assistance Partnership, the Water Systems Council, the International Union of Operating Engineers, the Vinyl Institute, the Hydraulic Institute, and the California Association of Sanitation  Congress needs to do a better job of providing basic public services, such as safe roads, bridges, and an up-to-date water infrastructure system. This is the time to act to make water infrastructure investment a priority.  With innovative financing and private sector investment, not only will we be providing Americans with basic water infrastructure, but we will also be creating jobs, keeping commodity and utility prices low, and remaining competitive on the global stage.  We can no longer kick the can down the road and ignore our infrastructure problems. It is time for the United States to be realistic about its water problems and start investing in water infrastructure today.  I ask my colleagues to join Senator Booker and me in supporting significant new investment in our Nation's water infrastructure and to cosponsor the SRF WIN Act today.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-30-pt1-PgS582.txt,1687,FEDERAL SAVINGS ASSOCIATION CHARTER FLEXIBILITY ACT OF 2017,2018.0,30.0,January

22,topic-id,1256,"Mr.President, today, we consider the nomination of Federal Reserve Board Governor Jerome Powell to be Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, one of the most important jobs in our government. The Federal Reserve System is the central bank of the United It is responsible for monetary policy, ensuring the stability of the financial system and the safety and soundness of our banks.  The Federal Reserve in Washington, DC, also has 12 regions or districts around the country. One of them is located in my hometown of Governor Powell has been a member of the Federal Reserve Board since 2012. He supported important principles of monetary policy and critical elements of financial regulation. His track record over the past 6 years shows that he is a thoughtful policymaker.  As the Chair of the Board of Governors, he would lead the Federal Open Market Committee within the Federal Governor Powell supports the statutory dual monetary policy goals of maximum employment and price stability--the cornerstones of a well-functioning economy.  Senator Crapo, who is joining me today, is chairman of the committee. We listened to testimony today about the nomination of another Fed Governor--not the highest position, as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, but a Federal Reserve Governor--Mr.The answers we elicited from him seemed to be, from my interpretation, that it was not clear that he has the same belief and respect for the dual mandate. The dual mandate, unlike what the Europeans do, is especially important for workers in this country. In Europe, the only charge of the central bank is to keep inflation down. In our country, the Federal Reserve, what we call our central bank, has two jobs equally balanced--the dual policy--and that is to keep inflation down and to keep employment up. They are maximum employment and price stability, the cornerstones of a well-functioning economy.  To advance those policy goals, Governor Powell supports the Federal Reserve's current path of gradual increases in interest rates. He believes they should continue. At the same time, Governor Powell recognizes the importance of an independent Federal That is very important. I don't want Members of Congress--with our prejudices, biases, and political ideologies--to influence or to compromise the independence of the Federal Governor Powell recognizes that independence. He is committed to following an example of prior Federal Reserve Chairs by doing the job without a view to political outcomes.  Governor Powell played a significant role in implementing crucial reforms under Dodd-He understands the importance of the rules for stress tests, capital standards, and resolution planning. We need the Federal Reserve to make sure that those rules are applied thoroughly and consistently so that gaps or failures don't create larger risks through the financial system.  We know that too many people in this body seem to have a collective amnesia about what happened 10 years ago. It is up to us to remind Governor Powell, and it is up to him to remember what happened 10 years ago and to learn from it. As Chair, Governor Powell is responsible for making sure the Fed fulfills its consumer protection role.  Americans work hard to make ends meet. They shouldn't have to struggle with unfair and abusive practices by financial institutions.  The Trump administration is engaged in an effort to undermine important financial system protections and reforms put in place in the wake of the great recession.  Governor Powell has seen the developments in the safety and stability of our banks during his time at the I expect him to maintain and to improve those standards. Ohioans, still recovering from the last financial crisis, can't afford the consequences of another financial crisis. I know Governor Powell wants the Fed to play a part in the success of the economy and American families. I call on him to continue the Federal Reserve's measured path for monetary policy and to support the strong regulations he helped put in place.  For some people, it is easy to forget how much damage was done by this lack of strong oversight of our financial system, especially during the last 4 years of the Bush administration, where millions lost their homes. I know Chairman Crapo and I have talked about this. The 44105 ZIP Code that my wife Connie and I live in, in Cleveland, in the first half of 2007, we had more foreclosures in that ZIP Code than any ZIP Code in the United Think of what it does to people's lives. Think of what it does to our families. Millions of people lost homes, millions lost jobs, millions lost much of their life savings.  For the wealthiest Americans, the nearly 9 years of gains in the stock market makes the crash of a decade ago a distant memory, but for the vast majority of Americans who have little in direct holdings in the stock market and not too much in other areas either, their wages have been flat, and many still have not recovered from the crisis.  The Fed's latest survey of household wealth indicates--get this--44 percent of Americans can't cover an emergency expense of $400. Forty-four percent of Americans can't cover an emergency expense of $400 without selling something or borrowing. For some, if their car breaks down, and they need $400 to fix their car to get to work, they have to go to a payday lender, and then their trouble starts. Then they have to go get a second payday loan and then a third payday loan.  Income inequality is the worst since the 1920s. The racial wealth gap is enormous. The median Black household has only $11,000 to its name, one-twelfth of its White counterpart.  The Fed can't solve all of our problems, but it can make them worse. Right now, the Fed seems puzzled by why low unemployment is not producing more inflation. Perhaps it is because more Americans are struggling paycheck to paycheck. They can't bid up the price of goods until they get out of debt. Yet even in the face of continued low inflation, there are those pushing for rate increases to give bondholders better returns. Others want to go back to some of the same banking practices that brought about the financial crisis.  The independence of the Fed is critical but only if it is used to make decisions based on data and experience, not ideology. That is exactly what Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen did over the past decade in helping to guide the Nation to one of the longest lasting recoveries in our history.  Go back to the year 2010. We know when President Obama took office, we were losing 800,000 jobs per month in this country--700,000 the second month--hundreds of thousands, millions of jobs at the beginning of his administration.  Starting in 2010, in large part because of the auto rescue and other things, our economy began to turn around. Since 2010, we have had job growth in every single quarter--every single quarter--since the auto rescue. President Trump loves to take credit for the job growth month after month. The fact is, it was launched early in the Obama years, and we have been able to sustain it--not economic growth to the level we want, not job growth to the level we want, certainly not pay increases to the level we want but something.  I hope Governor Powell will uphold that tradition that Chairman Bernanke and Chairwoman Yellen began.  I plan to support Governor Powell's nomination. I urge my colleagues to do the same.

243,topic-id,1764,"Madam President, I rise to honor a member of my staff, Jonathan Miller, who has dedicated his life to serving his country and his  Not only does Jonathan serve the people of Ohio each day on our staff, helping Ohio servicemembers and veterans, but he also wears the uniform himself, first as a member of the National Guard and now as a member of the Army Earlier this month was his last day in the office for a year as his unit is deploying to fight for our country.  Jonathan grew up in Macedonia, OH, and graduated from Nordonia High School and Ohio In 2011, while working toward his master's degree, he enlisted in the National Jon told me he enlisted, in part, because he was ``inspired by the debate and repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell and the stories of veterans in my family,'' like so many who join the armed services because of patriotism, family values, and family precedent.  He said: ``The Army seemed like the place for me to help my community and my country and to experience new people, places, and ideas.''  Jonathan went through officer candidate school in 2013 and now serves with the 300th Chemical Company, Army Reserve, out of Morgantown, He has worked in our office since 2015 and has impressed all of us with his dedication to both of his jobs. In the Senate, he handles veterans and military issues along with energy and environmental policy. He has read, literally, thousands of letters from Ohio servicemembers and veterans over the years and has always worked to make sure their views and concerns have been heard and that our office has helped them whenever we have been able to. He has often called the families directly to follow up and listen to their stories.  In 2016, during a meeting with the Gold Star Wives of America, Jon learned that education benefits for some spouses who had lost their loved ones in the earliest days following 9/11 would expire before they could make full use of this benefit their families had earned. He immediately brought this issue to my attention, and we worked to introduce the Military Spouses Achieving College Education for Survivors We passed this bipartisan legislation as part of a larger veterans package that will directly affect veterans and their families in my State, in Nebraska, and other States across the country.  Jonathan has played a critical role in ensuring that our military installations in my State have the support they need to perform critical national security missions--from the 180th in Toledo and the 910 in Youngstown, to Camp Ravenna, to the base in my hometown of Mansfield, to Springfield, and of course to Wright-Patterson Air Force He often attends visiting Ohio Honor Flight ceremonies, representing our office and supporting Ohio veterans who visit the memorials that have been built in their honor.  His love for the outdoors and for Ohio has also shone through in his work on issues like protecting the Great Lakes, including the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative and in preserving the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, which is near his childhood home.  I would add that Ohio is one of the lucky States east of the Mississippi in that it is one of the few States that has a national park, and it is not far from the population centers of Cleveland and Even though the Trump administration tried to zero out--the way we talk about it--or dramatically cut funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, I and Senator Portman, a Republican, worked together to restore that funding.  We know keeping Lake Erie clean is an ongoing challenge. Right off the city of Toledo, Lake Erie is only 30 feet deep, contrasted with Lake Superior, which is 600 feet deep, on the average. That means, whether it is Ashtabula and Cleveland in Lake County to the east or it is Toledo to the west, Lake Erie is much more vulnerable to pollutants than are the other Great This is why the work Jonathan does is so important in keeping that Great Lake clean.  At the end of the week, while others might look forward to a relaxing weekend with family and friends, so often, Jonathan heads out for drill with his unit. He used to drive from Washington to Illinois and, later, to West Virginia for the weekend as part of his service. Now his unit is deploying. While we will miss his expertise, his enthusiasm, and his unique perspective in this office this year, we are also so grateful for his service to Ohio and to our country.  One final note, before his deployment, last month, Jon got engaged to his partner Jon and Kevin will join so many of Ohio's military families who understand the unique challenges of having a family member serving far from home.  One of the things that is so important that we as Members of the Senate must do is recognize the service of our men and women in uniform. We should also recognize the importance of the service and sacrifice of those family members who are left behind and who often live in the margins financially.  On behalf of my whole office, we congratulate Jon and Kevin on their engagement. We wish Jon well on his tour overseas, and we thank him for his sacrifice and his service.                   CHIP and Community Health Centers  Madam President, Congress finally did the right thing, after having failed to do the right thing in September and October and November and December and early January, by reauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance The bill passed out of the Senate Finance Committee with only one ``no'' vote. The Children's Health Insurance Program has been around for 20 years, and it has always been bipartisan.  There are 209,000 children in Ohio who benefit from the Children's Health Insurance These are children--sons and daughters--of parents who generally work full time but who only make $8 or $10 or $12 an hour. These families often don't have insurance themselves, but the Children's Health Insurance Program will provide insurance for those children.  It is particularly aggravating to many of us that so many Members of Congress--all of us who have health insurance provided by taxpayers--failed to continue the program, which has always been bipartisan, in September, when the program expired, as well as in October and November and Now, as our vote the other day demonstrated, the Children's Health Insurance Program will be around for 6 more years as we continue to make improvements with it. The problem is, while we provide insurance for 6 more years for these 209,000 children in Ohio and 9 million children all over the country, we[[Page S516]]haven't, in so many cases, provided the place and the environment for these parents to take their children.  One big shortcoming is Congress's refusal to do its job to reauthorize the community health centers, the so-called federally qualified health centers. My State is home to several dozen federally qualified community health centers. They provide all kinds of healthcare services, in many cases, including pediatric, dentistry, all kinds of preventive care, all kinds of emergency care, and other help for so many families, particularly for low-income families, in their neighborhoods, where this can make a difference.  I want to briefly share three letters to illustrate the importance of this.  Stephanie Wiersma, the CEO of Lorain County Health & Dentistry, wrote to me 2 weeks ago before we passed the most recent continuing resolution:       We desperately plod on, doing all the right things for our      health centers and patients, yet for months we have been in      limbo and, frankly, sick with fear.       I worry about the impact on my staff and patients. I know      the impact on recruitment of providers . . . what      professional wants to chance a funding crisis to come work      for a health center at this point in time?       Open provider positions means less access to care, plain      and simple. Access is especially important now with all the      flu and illness going around.  What Stephanie is saying is that when Congress doesn't do its job--when all of us who have health insurance that is paid for by taxpayers fail to do our jobs--these community health centers, which are professionally run and close to home for so many families, cannot plan for the future. They cannot recruit a physical therapist or a pediatric dentist or an internist or a family practice doctor. Is a professional provider, who has invested a lot of money in her education, going to want to go to a health center where Congress simply doesn't do its job in providing funding? I think Stephanie wrote that so very well.  Jared Pollick, CEO of Third Street Family Health Services in my hometown of Mansfield, wrote:       It is nearly impossible to make sound strategic decisions      for our organizations without the security of our funding. We      are always told both sides of the aisle love Community Health      We really need them to show it with funding.  That is exactly right. I have heard my Republican colleagues talk almost ad nauseam about how much they like the Children's Health Insurance Program, how much they like the community health centers, and I think they really in their guts do. But then Senator McConnell and the Republican leadership let them expire on September 30, did nothing in October, nothing in November, nothing in They did a tax cut for the rich. We know that, but they didn't reauthorize, didn't provide additional significant, predictable, sufficient funding for the community health centers or the Children's Health Insurance A week ago, finally, we did the Children's Health Insurance Program, but we left hanging the community health centers.  The last letter is from Julie DiRossi-King, chief operating officer for the Ohio Association of Community Health Centers, which represents 512 health centers in She said:       We have hit that critical point . . . that the Community      Health Center Program as we know and rely on it today will      soon be on life support. There literally is no room for      additional delay.  I appreciate that Congress finally did the right thing on the Children's Health Insurance I ask Congress to do what is right for the community health centers. It will literally save lives and will matter for so many families in my State and States all over the country.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

682,topic-id,452,"Mr.President, Senator Murphy is right. It is not just what is in the resolution that concerns a number of us, including funding for the Affordable Care We remember debates here in this body--there are a whole lot of Members of Congress, who have insurance paid for by taxpayers, who are willing--by cuts in Medicaid and other repeals as far as the Affordable Care Act--who are willing to take insurance away from so many of our constituents. Constituents who make $8, $10, and $12 an hour aren't lucky enough to have the health insurance we have, but we have provided for it through this bill. I am a Democrat, and I stood for months with my Republican Governor, John Kasich, in fighting for that.  As a number of people have pointed out, there is not what there ought to be for community health centers in this bill. I know that in North Carolina, as in my State, there are a number of rural hospitals. We have had two major hospitals announce their closure--one in Massillon and one in The one in Massillon is a hospital that serves a town of slightly under 40,000 people. The closest hospital is 15, 20, 25 minutes away for emergency care in The hospital in the middle of Dayton has announced its closure, partly because of what this body has done--the unevenness and the attacks on health insurance, what was in the tax reform law and what that will mean for insurance prices. We know it has made our healthcare system less stable. And we know how this bill has been written.  Down the hall about 100 feet, is the office of Senator McConnell, the majority leader. The Affordable Care Act repeal was written in that office, behind closed doors, by insurance companies and Wall Street lobbyists. The tax reform bill, where 80 percent of the tax cuts went to the richest 1 percent of the people--that was written in Senator McConnell's office by a bunch of Wall Street and tax lawyers. Now this resolution to ``keep the government open'' again was written down the hall in Senator McConnell's office. There was no input from There are 49 Democrats in this body. I believe we represent more than half of the population of this country. Yet we were not even included in this discussion.  This is the first time ever where one party controls the White House, the House, the Senate, and the Supreme Court, and yet they have not even included--one, they are not competent enough to run the government. They just do this ``limp along one month at a time'' resolution.

1059,topic-id,1079,"Mr.President, the news is good today. It looks as though we are close to a resolution, and what makes that resolution attractive to me is not just that we are going to see the government run, which is the job of this Congress--this is the first time, as we know, that Congress, the House, the Senate, the White House, and the Supreme Court were controlled by one party--it is the first time that that has been the case in a government shutdown, so we know where responsibility lies. But that is the past. I want to look at the future. The future is, this should make it easier because of the discussions so many of us had over the weekend with Senators in our own party and the other party. Regardless of the party of any of us, I think we are reaching a place where we can get serious about negotiations on a whole lot of issues. Once this is behind us, after this vote later today, once the House passes the continuing resolution and once the President signs it, I am hopeful that we can get serious about a whole host of other issues.  In Ohio in the last 2 weeks, two hospitals have closed down--one for-profit in Massillon, a small, industrial city not far from Canton, OH, and a not-for-profit hospital in Dayton, Both announced the closure of those hospitals, and we know what that means to people in the neighborhoods, people in the region. It means slower response time, lost jobs--the loss of all the things that a good hospital means in a community.  Part of the reason for those hospital closings, frankly, is that we haven't done our jobs here--the attacks on the Affordable Care Act, the unrelenting attacks from the President and from the majority party here. I stood with my Governor, a Republican Governor--I am a Democrat--Governor Kasich and I--against these Medicaid cuts, against the attacks on the Affordable Care Act, against the shrinking of the signup period, the undercutting of the marketing campaigns, and all the things that have caused more volatility and instability in the healthcare market.  I am hopeful that after this bill is signed by the President later today and the government reopens, we can then get serious about what we do about not just CHIP--I thank people of both parties here for finally--although it took 4 months--giving CHIP not just new life but 6 years of life. I am thrilled about that. But to make CHIP work, we need community health centers because in a working family, each making $10 an hour--if they don't have enough money to buy insurance or if they don't have a job, perhaps, that has insurance, they rely on Well, if their child gets sick and wants to go to a health center, if the community health centers are closed or underfunded or underoperating, there is no place to go. So you don't need just CHIP; you need the community health centers too.  We need to pay attention to rural hospitals. A lot of my State is rural. I have been, for instance, to the Bryan Phil Ennen is the president of that hospital and does a very good job with a difficult task, because in small towns--it is a county in the northwest corner of the The county borders Indiana to the west and Michigan to the north. Small towns like that have more challenges running their hospitals, and I am hopeful we can focus on that.  We can focus on 340B, which is a Medicaid prescription drug cost provision. I am hopeful that we can focus on the disproportionate share of payments. I am hopeful that we can focus on some of the Medicare extenders so that we can, in fact, bring some stability to this healthcare system.  These two hospitals in Dayton and Massillon that have announced their closure--we are working to try to keep both open. It is a real challenge. I hope the closure of those hospitals isn't just the harbinger of more to come because of the volatility created in the healthcare market by this administration and this Congress's attack on the healthcare market and the healthcare laws over the last year, but that is why we need serious, long-term negotiations here.  The other issue that is so important is pensions. In the Presiding Officer's home State of Indiana, in my State of Ohio, in Pennsylvania, North Dakota, Missouri, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, there are literally hundreds of thousands of teamsters, coal miners, ironworkers, carpenters, and confectionary workers who, even though they paid into a pension for 30 years, even though they gave up dollars today at the bargaining table so they could put dollars aside for the future, often matched by their employer--because of Wall Street greed and Wall Street malfeasance and misfeasance, in part, these pensions are going to face huge cuts.  Senator Young, Senator Donnelly, Senator Portman, Senator Johnson, and a number of us are working out some--I hope working toward some agreement on pensions so we can make sure that if you didn't work 40 years you wouldn't see a 40-percent cut in your pension. I start with the Butch Lewis Act legislation that I have introduced with a number of cosponsors. We[[Page S436]]want to work with both parties to make sure this works. I am hopeful this deal today helps to clear a path so that the two Senators from Indiana and I and Senator Portman and others can work together to make this happen. It is so important. In my State alone, it is 50,000 teamsters. It is another 5,000, more or less, coal miners. It is another 7,000, 8,000, or 10,000 other workers.  The last thing I want to say, again, is that every one of these cases is a union plan. These union members gave up wages today. They understood: I don't take as much pay today, but that money will be set aside so I have healthcare and my pension is there when I retire in 30 years.  They did it right. They played by the rules. Their government needs to back them up. That is the importance of this pension bill. That is why I appreciate the work of the Presiding Officer and others in coming to some agreement and making this work.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The language in section 148 of the CR is of concern to the Intelligence Let me just read the language:       148. Funds appropriated by the Department of Defense      Missile Defeat and Defense Enhancements Appropriation Act,      2018 (division B of Public Law 115-96) may be obligated and      expended notwithstanding section 504(a)(1) of the National      Security Act of 1947.  This language is troublesome for the committee because it would authorize the intelligence community to spend funds ``notwithstanding'' the law that requires prior authorization by the Senate Intelligence Committee or by the House Intelligence  The vice chairman and I were on the floor, I think, last week, and we had a 65-to-34 vote to reauthorize the most significant intelligence tool to keep America safe. In that debate, both Senator Warner and I said to our opposition that we would do everything within the committee's power to make sure we did aggressive, real-time oversight over the entire intelligence community.  Sometimes that means that when we see there might be something we are uncomfortable with, we alter the ability to access funds. In congressional terms, we call it fencing off money. But we utilize the tools as an authorizer to affect what, in fact, individuals within the intelligence community can choose to do.  When you take away section 504 authorities that the committees have, for the next 3 weeks we will have an inability to exercise, in our estimation, the tools that we might need to keep our commitment to 34 individuals who still voted against us but, more importantly, to the American people, for whom we would do everything to make sure our intelligence communities act in a way that those educated and elected in this body see fit. As a result, this language can erode the powers of the authorizing committee. Effectively, the intelligence community could expend funds as it sees fit without an authorization bill in place and with no statutory direction indicating that an authorization bill for 2018 is forthcoming.  Let me just say to my colleagues, a situation like this is untenable. We have worked with our colleagues in HPSCI to develop language to change this. I might say, we have had a couple of opportunities to do it, and we should have done it literally when we changed the date of the When we changed the date from the original date, which I think was the 16th, to the 8th of February, we should have inserted this new language. But because there is a fight between appropriators and the Intelligence Committee in the House, we weren't able to do that.  I have a feeling that Senator Warner and I are going to find there is now a fight between the Intelligence Committee and the appropriators in the U.Senate because, I fear, someone might object to the unanimous consent request I will ask after Senator Warner speaks.  Let me read what the committee has come up with. This is bicameral. The House Select Committee on Intelligence is in agreement. In section 148, it would say:       Funds appropriated by the Department of Defense Missile      Defeat and Defense Enhancements Appropriations Act, 2018      (division B of Public Law 115-96), for intelligence or      intelligence related activities are deemed to be specifically      authorized by Congress for purposes of section 504 of the      National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.414) during fiscal      year 2018 until the enactment of the Intelligence      Authorization Act for fiscal year 2018.  The vice chairman is a lawyer; I am not. I really rely upon the legal counsel that we have within the committee to interpret U.law. It really doesn't take a law degree to understand that there is a huge difference between ignoring section 504, ``notwithstanding,'' and applying section 504, which our change makes.  This isn't really a misinterpretation. This is a question of whether you want to take section 504 of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.414) and continue to let it apply or whether you are going to provide the intelligence community a waiver that exempts them from having to adhere to a part of U. The reason I wanted the opportunity to speak before we ask unanimous consent is, I want my colleagues to understand that we take our oversight role extremely seriously. We want to have every tool in our basket that we can to give the American people the assurance that we know exactly what is going on and that we are at least in agreement that they proceed forward, not that they have free rein only because they have been appropriated a pot of money because an executive request was made.

They are tasked with that degree of knowledge.

842,topic-id,890,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I appreciate all of the work that she does on behalf of our Nation's military men and women.  Mr.Speaker, here we are again. Once again, this House will vote to fully fund our Nation's military and critical national security programs.  I have said this many times before, but I will continue saying it because the point is so very important: the global threat environment facing the United States today is greater than at any time since the conclusion of World War  North Korea is continuing to build its nuclear weapon program, which poses a direct threat to the United States and our servicemembers stationed abroad.  Terrorist groups, like ISIS and al-Qaida, may be weakened in Iraq and Syria, but their influence continues to spread to other areas throughout the Middle East and  The situation in Afghanistan is deeply concerning. Look no further than the recent wave of attacks by the Taliban in  China is continuing to build up its military and exert aggression in the South China  Russia and Putin remain emboldened as they take provocative actions in Ukraine, throughout Eastern Europe, and even in the  Other countries continue to catch up to our Nation's capabilities in the space domain.  Iran is showing more and more involvement in the Middle East and continues to support terrorist groups that threaten our allies, like  Not to even mention the evolving and serious threats posed to the United States by state actors and rogue actors when it comes to cybersecurity.  Despite so many real and wide-ranging threats, our military has not received the funding that is necessary to keep up.  As the gentlewoman said, we have the smallest Army since before World War II, the smallest Navy since before World War I, and the smallest and oldest Air Force we have ever had.  The military does not work like a spigot. You can't just turn it on when a crisis happens and expect everything to work and all of our servicemembers to be ready. Training takes time, and building equipment takes even more time. We have to prepare now for the crisis of tomorrow.  The commandant of the Marine Corps, General Robert Neller, put it best when he said:[[Page H694]]  ``Marines don't get ready when the crisis occurs.''  ``The instability of the current fiscal environment, compounded by current shortfalls in our operation and maintenance accounts, impact our ability to maintain a `ready bench.' ''  Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson also recently stated that: ``We are stretching the force to the limit, and we need to start turning the corner on readiness.''  I could go on for hours talking about the real challenges facing our military. But, instead of looking back, I want this Congress to look ahead and solve these problems, instead of just continually talking about them.  This Defense funding bill includes $659.2 billion in full-year funding for the Department of That includes increases in military operations and maintenance accounts. That includes a 2.4 percent pay raise for our troops, which would be the largest in 8 years. That includes increased funding for missile defense systems and programs, which is so important, given the threat posed by North  That includes funding for 11 new Navy ships, including three littoral combat ships, which are built, in part, by Austal USA in my district. That includes critical funding for training and readiness operations.  That also includes much-needed money for research and development to ensure our military continues to have the most innovative and state-of-the-art equipment at their disposal.  All told, this bill would be a landmark step toward rebuilding our military, standing up to our adversaries, and supporting the men and women who work every single day to keep the American people safe.  Now, I hear my colleagues on the other side of the aisle saying that this bill has no chance in the While I don't understand why our colleagues and the Senate would not want to fund our military, I have a strong rebuttal to that argument.  If the Senate wants to add nondefense programs to this bill or make changes, then they should take this bill up, make whatever changes or additions that they desire, and send the bill back over to the It simply makes no sense to just declare this bill dead and not take a vote on it.  I intend to talk to my two home State Senators about passing this bill, and I expect they will be supportive of this effort because they understand the need to fund our Nation's military.  But I reject the notion that we shouldn't be passing this bill and sending it over to the I am tired of the Senate not acting on our government funding bills, and I think we should keep sending funding bills over there until they take one up and actually pass it. This ridiculous crisis of funding our government from one crisis to the next must end.  So, Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and, once again, send a military funding bill over to the Here, in the House, we must continue to fulfill one of our most basic responsibilities outlined in the Constitution: to provide for the common defense.

844,topic-id,688,"With this funding bill, we can move back toward a position of peace through strength, and we can keep American families safe.  Mr.Speaker, I urge the adoption of the rule and the underlying legislation.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I would just respond to my colleague from Wyoming who said that talk will not fund our military, or that talk will not upgrade our military equipment, and I agree. Nobody is asking the other side to talk. We are asking them to do their job. We are asking them to go and sit down with Republicans and Democrats and work out a deal on the budget caps.  In order to do any of this stuff, we have to know how much we can spend. Before you go shopping, you have to know how much you are going to spend.  I know my Republican friends don't want to take responsibility for what is clearly incompetence, but, the bottom line is, in the Senate, the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense hasn't even marked up the Defense Appropriations bill yet. And the last time I checked, the Republicans controlled the Senate--I wish they didn't, but the Republicans control the And as my colleague from Wyoming knows, bills don't move in the House or the Senate without the Republican leadership moving it.  So I think it is clear that this Republican-controlled government can't do its job, and November can't come soon enough, for me, because I think there needs to be a major change here. We need people in charge who understand that the American people come first, not some rightwing ideology, who understand the meaning that the American people comes first means doing your job.  Mr.Speaker, I am going to urge that my colleagues vote to defeat the previous question, and I will give a little explanation why.  Mr.Speaker, this past weekend, President Trump tweeted that he wants to show that ``Democrats do not want to solve DACA, only use it.'' Well, I would beg to differ. This is the 19th time that we have attempted to bring the bipartisan bill, H.3440, the Dream Act, for a vote on the House floor, and, if we defeat the previous question, we will bring that bill up.  We have made our position clear: we want immigration policies that make America safer, without betraying our core values as a nation.  President Trump made his position clear as well. He has tweeted and said, time and time again: ``My standard is very simple: America First and Make America Great Again.''  Exactly what does he mean by America First?  According to the conservative Cato Institute, repealing DACA would cost the government over $60 billion and would reduce economic growth by $280 billion over the next decade. That doesn't sound like an America First policy to me.  If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up H.3440, the Dream Act: this bipartisan, bicameral legislation that would help hundreds of thousands of young people, who are American in every way, except on paper.  I regret very much that the leadership in this House has refused, time and time again, to allow us to debate and deliberate on this issue. We have a bill called the Dream If it was brought to the floor, it would pass overwhelmingly. Every Democrat would support it, and I bet a big chunk of Republicans would support it as well, and we could end this once and for all.                              {time}  1300  The Republican leadership is so pathetically terrified of a narrow, xenophobic, bigoted element of their base that they cannot bring themselves to allow us to even consider such a bill, and I regret that very much.  Mr.Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts?  There was no objection.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Gonzalez) to discuss our proposal.

Today marks the 122nd day that our military has gone without funding for FY 2018. Like the rest of the Federal Government, it has been forced to operate under a CR for the past 4 months. Secretary of Defense James Mattis explained the impacts of operating under a CR, particularly those related to readiness and maintenance. They include a scaled-back training exercise across the services, the delayed introduction of 11 ships by the United States Navy, the postponement of all noncritical maintenance work orders by the Army, the curtailment of hiring and recruitment, rising acquisition costs from severed contracts, and renegotiated terms due to the  A CR means no new starts, and impacts to current readiness and future plans are disastrous.

I commend Chairman Frelinghuysen and Chairwoman Granger on their tireless persistence and relentless determination on behalf of the U.servicemembers. The bill provides robust funding for shipbuilding, aviation, combat vehicles, and more.

60,topic-id,377,"Madam President, I join many of my colleagues in voicing my strong opposition to 2311, the 20-week abortion ban bill. This legislation puts political ideology ahead of women's health and tramples on women's constitutional rights.  First, the 20-week abortion ban intrudes on private healthcare decisions. Reproductive health choices are highly personal and individualized and should be left squarely in the hands of women in consultation with their physician, healthcare team, and loved ones. 2311 violates this principle by subjecting private healthcare choices to an arbitrary and unscientific blanket ban.  Second, the 20-week abortion ban violates the longstanding constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy. In 1973, a 7-2 majority of the U.Supreme Court held in Roe v. Wade that the constitutional right to privacy includes the right to terminate a pregnancy. Since then, the U.Supreme Court has repeatedly rejected bans on abortions before viability, which generally occurs well after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Today, 7 in 10 Americans support upholding Roe v.  A diverse coalition of Americans--including physicians, civil rights advocates, and faith organizations--has come out against this legislation for a number of reasons. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American College of[[Page S537]]Nurse-Midwives, for instance, have said that the legislation ``. . . would dictate how physicians should care for their patients based on inaccurate and unscientific claims.'' The American Civil Liberties Union has said this legislation ``. . . directly contradicts longstanding precedent holding that a woman should `be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion' when deciding whether to continue or terminate a pre-viability pregnancy.'' And Three dozen faith-based organizations have written in opposition to this legislation, saying, ``The proper role of government in the United States is not to privilege one set of religious views over others but to protect each person's right and ability to make decisions according to their own beliefs and values.''  We should be working to open up access to reproductive healthcare for more women and families, not fewer. Effective family planning services, including birth control, have a proven record of boosting health and economic mobility while reducing unwanted pregnancies.  The U.Senate has urgent priorities to address. We should not be wasting time on another misguided attempt to take away women's healthcare and constitutional rights. I strongly oppose 2311.

Last year, I spent hours on the Senate floor presenting data and information to my colleagues showing why cutting and capping Medicaid is a very bad idea. I met with Medicaid patients, safety net hospitals, community health centers, and local elected officials in every corner of my They had a crystal-clear message for me: Cutting and capping Medicaid will be bad for patients, bad for the healthcare delivery system, bad for local economies, and bad for our They expressed a consensus view that capping Medicaid is not healthcare reform, nor is it innovation; it is simply a budget mechanism to throw people off of healthcare.

There is bipartisan agreement that we need to make health insurance more affordable, particularly in the individual market, where about 7 percent of Americans buy coverage; yet the Trump administration has rejected bipartisan consensus and moved us backwards. This administration has proposed to unleash ``junk insurance'' under the guise of association health plans, cancelled cost-sharing reduction payments, created roadblocks to insurance enrollment, and pursued backdoor schemes to rescind protections for people with preexisting conditions. I have every indication that Mr.Azar will continue this trajectory of higher costs, less coverage, and more uncertainty.  I believe we can and must tackle rising healthcare costs by innovating in the delivery of healthcare, instead of simply capping programs and kicking people off coverage. To that end, I hope that Mr.Azar will advance true delivery system change in the Medicare Program, as he says he wants to, and engage with Senators of both parties to work on good ideas to bring more value and efficiency to our healthcare system.

61,topic-id,478,"Madam President, I rise today to express my opposition to the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection This blatant attempt to ban later abortion undermines decades of legal precedent and directly challenges the landmark Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision. The Supreme Court made clear that women in this country have a constitutional right to autonomy over their individual health and well-being. If passed, this bill would impose burdensome and medically unnecessary limitations on women, particularly those in low-income, medically underserved areas.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that nearly 99 percent of abortions are performed before 21 weeks of pregnancy. Many of the abortions that are performed after 20 weeks are medically necessary because the mother's health is at risk or because of a fetal anomaly. This bill has no exception to protect a woman's health and no exception for cases where there is a fetal anomaly.  This bill harms women who are victims of sexual assault and minors who are the victims of incest. It requires rape victims to provide written proof that the victim obtained counseling or medical treatment from a specified list of locations, and it requires the minor to provide written proof that she reported the crime to law enforcement or a government agency.  These provisions are designed to perpetuate a culture of not believing women and trying to discredit the victims of sexual assault.  To make matters even worse, this bill punishes doctors by threatening them with 5 years of jail time for violating the ban. This bill, if passed, will take women back to the days of back-alley abortions, where doctors were in fear of providing lifesaving, medically necessary procedures to women and where women were forced to take drastic and dangerous measures in order to have the procedure performed.  Many of my Republican colleagues talk about keeping Big Government out of people's lives, but when it comes to one of the hardest and most intimate decisions a woman can make--a decision that she wishes to make between herself, her family, and her doctor--these same colleagues believe that the government, and not the woman, knows better. They believe that the government, and not the woman, should dictate what a woman should do with her body. They believe that the government should have the power to force a woman to forgo a medically necessary procedure. They believe that a woman should be stripped of that power, stripped of the choice of what is best for herself.  Empowering women is one of the most important things we can do for the future of our country. Core to women's constitutional liberties is autonomy over their own health and well-being. In order to truly support women, we need to safeguard and improve, not limit, access to comprehensive healthcare, including abortion.  For all of these reasons, I will be opposing 2311.

236,topic-id,2220,"Mr.President, I come to the floor to reflect on the troubling foreign policy 1 year into President Donald Trump's administration.  A recent poll out from Gallup showed a dramatic reduction in global public opinion toward the United Confidence in the United States by the global community has plummeted to 30 percent under President A low public opinion of our great country, among other nations, is not a good thing, and it is not something to celebrate. In fact, it makes the world less safe for America and It limits our economic opportunities, and it undermines our ability to promote our values of portraying President Reagan's vision of a city on a hill. In just 1 year, the Trump administration has betrayed America's values, abandoned our allies, and appeased our enemies.  America's alliances, for example, with the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization keep our country safe and prosperous while they also build a more secure world, but President Trump has repeatedly questioned the worthiness of both organizations and has attacked leading members of each body--almost always key American allies.  These concerns were made much worse when, early in the administration, Secretary Tillerson said that America's interests would no longer be dictated by our values. It was almost unfathomable to hear the Nation's top diplomat speak in such a narrow, myopic way. Also, the games the administration has played with the mission statements of the State Department and the U.Agency for International Development have been clear attempts to depart from the values that define who we are--support for democracy, human rights, transparency, and good governance.  President Trump has praised strongmen leaders in Russia, China, Turkey, Egypt, and the Philippines even as they imprison, torture, or kill their own citizens. If support for world leaders who lack almost all of our values is not bad enough, President Trump's attacks on some of America's closest friends have undermined the credibility of America's word and America's commitment to its values. Launching verbal broadsides against the United Kingdom, Australia, and South Korea--the latter during the ongoing standoff with North Korea--are deeply regrettable and completely counterproductive.  Speaking of verbal mistakes, you cannot conduct high stakes diplomacy through the use of We should never normalize such conduct by a President of the United Secretary of State Rex Tillerson conceded last week that he, essentially, learns about the President's foreign policy statements--or even of his positions--because his staff at Foggy Bottom prints off the President's tweets for him. That should give everyone a moment for pause.  Besides the nuclear crisis with North Korea, nowhere have the President's statements been more damaging than in the tenuous relationship between Washington and Frankly, the President's words and actions send a clear signal to Mr.Putin that he can continue to attack democratic institutions and values with impunity. Each time Mr.Putin denies to Mr.Trump that the Kremlin was involved in attempting to influence the 2016 election--a bald-faced lie--the American President races to say that he believes him. Never before in history has such a clear threat to our national security been so clearly ignored by a President of the United  Last week, I released a report through the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that documented Mr.Putin's pattern of 20 years of attacks against democratic institutions in In order to best understand what he did here in the United States in 2016--a matter still under investigation--as well as to protect ourselves in 2018, 2020, and beyond, we need to understand the big picture and respond accordingly. We will never be fully protected or have a robust enough response with the President's repeated public appeasement of Mr. We have seen again this week how that has been playing out in a matter that is being debated in The Russian Government continues to interfere in our political debates here in the United There are reports that Russian internet bots and trolls are working to support Congressman Nunes's efforts to produce and release a Republican staff report on the investigation into Russia's interference in our 2016 elections. We know that Russian bots and trolls are vigorously promoting these attacks and corroding our political institutions and norms of behavior, seeking to paralyze our government and undermine our democracy. This sort of behavior carries a possible grave risk to our democratic system and our very way of life.  I am not surprised to find that Russian services are attacking us, as a recent report that we released made it clear that it was part of their strategy, but I do hope that all of us--Democrats and Republicans--will stand up for our democratic institutions and speak out against Russia's interference in our political system.  The President refers to his foreign policy strategy as ``America first.'' ``America first'' is a risky and chaotic proposition and will, certainly, lead to America alone. The Muslim ban, hastily handed down not 1 week into his administration, was the early defining moment of President Trump's tenure--the clearest sign yet he would actively work to denigrate our values and isolate us from the rest of the world.  President Trump's rhetoric has made a multifaceted conflict with China more likely at a time when we need to work with the Chinese on stronger diplomatic ties between our nations to improve regional stability in East  The President's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement--an accord that every nation on Earth is a member of and which the majority of the President's senior advisers recommended against--is a gross abdication of American leadership and a narrow-minded rejection of basic science and fact.  I and other Members of this body are engaged in an attempt to prevent the President from withdrawing without reason from another major international agreement--the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, otherwise known as the Iran nuclear deal. The President has jeopardized the agreement by not certifying Iran's compliance and without his producing any evidence that Iran is in violation of the agreement. He has now made a number of aggressive demands of Congress and of our European allies, once again demonstrating that he is no negotiator.  America first, supposedly, but as communities in Maryland and across the country struggle with a nationwide epidemic of opioids, heroin, and fentanyl overdoses, President Trump's budget has proposed a 27-percent reduction in America's global counternarcotics efforts, which will directly weaken our ability to work with international partners to stem the illegal flow of drugs that are entering our country.  The President sought to slash $1 billion from America's global efforts to fight HIV/AIDS in Africa, Asia, and elsewhere. Thanks to bipartisan American leadership, we have made enormous strides against this disease. We should not turn back from that progress. This kind of fear, insecurity, and even xenophobia are damaging our reputation abroad and corroding our core identity as Americans here at home.  The President has doubled down on the disastrous wall rhetoric and continues to belittle Mexico, one of our closest friends and partners in the world. Even the White House Chief of Staff's attempt to clean up the President's wall position ended embarrassingly for him.  President Trump's campaign to undermine American values resulted in slashing refugee resettlement into the United States, while asking other countries to do more. His policies damage our moral leadership, condone other countries' rejection of refugees on their borders, and strengthen the[[Page S512]]hand of those who wish to do us harm through recruitment and radicalization. U.leadership on this issue is key to our counterterrorism strategy.  President Ronald Reagan admitted 140,000 refugees in just 1 year of his By contrast, at a time of extraordinary international need--far greater than when President Reagan was in office--President Trump capped refugee resettlement at 45,000 this fiscal year. Since he announced that policy, refugee admissions in this country have fallen to a level unseen in modern history. At the current rate, the United States may grant entry to fewer than 20,000 refugees--the lowest number since the program was established in 1980. The President's stealth attack on refugee resettlement is a war on a program that has embodied America's compassion and global leadership.  Much attention has been drawn to the despicable uncertainty that President Trump has injected into the lives of hundreds of thousands of Dreamers, preparing to deport young people who are essentially American citizens to countries they have never known. But equally as troubling is the President's denial of temporary protected status, or TPS, for hundreds of thousands of people from Haiti and El Many more from Honduras and Syria sit in the President's crosshairs. These people have lived in our country, sometimes for decades, contribute to our economy, and many have American citizen children. Sending them back to their home nations at this time--countries that are already destabilized to various degrees--will exacerbate local and regional problems.  I am proud of the legislation I have written with Senators Feinstein and Van Hollen that is supported by numerous colleagues to create a legal pathway to residency for TPS recipients who only seek a better life for themselves and their families, enriching our country and all that it stands for in the process.  The U.military is the finest in the world, but increasingly, President Trump wants our men and women in uniform to do what should be the responsibility of our diplomatic and development corps--our forces for peace. And it is not just a slow and steady transfer of responsibilities from Foggy Bottom to the Pentagon; President Trump has failed to fill critical national security jobs and is gutting our development and diplomatic institutions.  It infuriates me when the President or his team dares to accuse the Senate of failing to do its constitutional responsibilities regarding nominations. Of 163 Senate-confirmed positions across the State Department and USAID, the administration does not have nominees for 72 of those jobs--just under 50 percent--1 year into office of this administration.  The administration has proposed an illogical and ideological cut of over 30 percent to the State Department and USAID budgets, attempting to disembowel critical national security tools. Secretary Tillerson has maintained an unexplained hiring freeze at the Department and Diplomats are leaving the government in large numbers, and his attempt to reorganize the Department many view as a solution in search of a problem. The President has little interest in how diplomacy advances our interests, promotes our values, and makes us safer and more prosperous.  To make matters worse, the President and his family continue to conduct themselves in a manner that promotes their business interests, making our foreign policy more difficult. In his dealings with China alone, the writing is on the wall. Candidate Trump said that on day one of his Presidency, he would declare China a currency manipulator. American businesses are still waiting. Did he sacrifice the American worker in order to appease the Chinese banker who paid him rent at Trump Tower? Or perhaps it was so he could secure those long sought after business trademarks with China--38 in all.  The American people should not lose sight of the fact that the President has refused to divest himself from the Trump Organization, ignoring decades of ethical norms and precedent. The President of the United States is engaged in foreign policy while maintaining unprecedented business interests in about 20 countries. Today, the President has a financial stake in real estate projects in India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and elsewhere--developments that require approval and intervention from governments, financing from banks, and cooperation from local partners. He continues to earn royalties from properties located throughout the world, from Panama to the United Arab  Reaping a financial profit while serving as President begs the question of whether he is working in his own best interest or the Nation's best interest--exactly why the Constitution's emoluments clause exists and of which I believe he is in violation. President Trump could easily rectify this by cutting his financial ties and leaving no doubt that his first and foremost priority is serving the Nation's interests.  In closing, let me say that American foreign policy led by our values, support for our allies, and a desire to make the world a better place, keeps us safe at home and advances our country's prosperity and security. President Trump has not put the strategies in place to deal with the complicated national security crises facing our country. Instead, he has made international security challenges more difficult to solve, including the crisis with Iran, the nuclear weapons dilemma with North Korea, and the Kremlin activities sowing discord in our country and throughout the world. President Trump has been unwilling to engage in the delicate diplomacy and tough national security decisions that are required to keep this country safe and maintain our global leadership.  The role of Congress in shaping and advancing U.foreign policy has never been more important, and I will continue to advance legislation, conduct oversight, and speak out about these important issues in the name of the American people and the values and norms that define us and our place in this complicated world.

Teachers qualify for the program once they have taught full-time for at least 5 consecutive years at a low income school or educational service agency. Teachers who are forced to move in the middle of the school year to follow their spouse lose eligibility for the program and must restart their 5 years of service under current law.  Last summer, a Maryland constituent brought to my attention the barriers her daughter faced when seeking Federal student loan forgiveness despite her commitment to public service. Her daughter, a teacher married to a member of the military, was in the middle of her fifth consecutive year teaching at one of Maryland's lower income schools. As any military spouse knows, relocation or reassignment orders can come at any time, upending the lives of the service member and their family. Rather than being able to complete a 5th year of teaching in a Maryland school, this family had to relocate with 3 months left in the school year. Despite this family's double commitment to service for our military and our schoolchildren, this military spouse missed the opportunity to have a portion of her Federal student loans[[Page S551]]forgiven. No military spouse should be punished for following his or her spouse's relocation or reassignment.  The legislation that the Senior Senator from Texas and I have introduced is a common sense proposal to allow military spouses to earn the benefits that they have dutifully worked towards and continue to incentivize individuals to teach our hardest to educate children. Our legislation provides a waiver from the Department of Education's Teacher Loan Forgiveness program's 5 consecutive years of service requirement for qualified military spouses if their spouse is relocated during the school year pursuant to military orders from the Armed This waiver will allow individuals to remain eligible for the Teacher Loan Forgiveness program should they resume teaching full-time at a qualifying low-income school district within one year of their relocation. In addition, this legislation requires the Department of Education to provide a report to Congress every two years on the number of military spouses who remained eligible for Teacher Loan Forgiveness due to this legislation.  I urge my colleagues to join in this effort to help families who are wholly committed to public service by supporting the Preserving Teacher Loan Forgiveness for Military Spouses No family in service of our Nation should lose out on earned benefits due to a technicality.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                2351         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives      of the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

1050,topic-id,1840,"Mr.President, let me tell you how pleased I am for the people in Maryland that we are now in the process of ending this government shutdown.  A government shutdown does not benefit anyone. It certainly doesn't benefit the Federal workers who live in Maryland and the Federal workers around the There is the uncertainty that a shutdown brings. Those who are exempted are asked to work without knowing when they will get a paycheck. Those who are on furlough don't know whether they will ever get a paycheck or not. It is not in the interest of our Federal workforce. It is certainly not in the interest of Federal contractors, who depend upon contracts that have been put on suspension. It is not in the interest of the public, who depends upon governmental services. It ends up costing taxpayers more money.  I am pleased to see that we are on a path to end this shutdown and to get the government back up and with a path forward. I also am pleased that we have at least accelerated the deadline for getting a budget done by 2 weeks.  Many of us have expressed major concern about continuing to operate under a continuing resolution. That makes no sense. We heard from the Department of Defense that they cannot keep our country safe on continuing resolutions. We know that agencies, when they are trying to plan their mission, cannot operate on continuing resolutions.  For the public, continuing resolutions state that we are going to operate on last year's budget. It doesn't reflect this year's priorities, and that is what we should be doing every year.  So in this case, the Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White We would think that a budget could have been done by October 1 of last year, which is when the fiscal year began. We are now approaching 4 months under the fiscal year 2018 budget, and we still don't have a budget.  One of the parts I am pleased about is that, as we move forward, we have had really positive discussions that by February 8 it is realistic to expect that we are going to be able to enact budget numbers so that the Appropriations Committee can recommend to the full Chamber, and we can pass, appropriations bills or a CRomnibus or an omnibus that will allow our agencies to have the remainder of this year's appropriations.  I certainly hope it will include fiscal year 2019--that would certainly be the best--and that it will be balanced between the needs of the Department of Defense and the nondefense agencies.  We have critical functions that require to have a full year of appropriations, which include our national defense, the Department of Defense, the State Department, the Department of Health and Human Services, the work that is done in the National Institutes of Health, food safety and the Food and Drug Administration, and the ability of the Social Security Administration to deliver checks to our seniors and to take care of our healthcare needs. All[[Page S433]]that requires that we have the predictability of a budget.  I wasn't pleased we had a shutdown, but I am pleased that during this debate, we had great discussions among Democrats and Republicans that we are committed to bringing out a budget by February 8 so that we can give that type of predictability to the people of this country. That was one of the principal frustrations, that many of us didn't want to go for another continuing resolution without knowing how we were going to deal with the budget.  There are some special needs that we have paid particular attention to that we really also need to get done by no later than February 8.  One of those is the opioid funding. It is in our national interest to recognize that we have a national crisis. Every community in the country is suffering from the opioid crisis, and we need to make sure we have the wherewithal for the Federal Government to be a strong partner in dealing with this crisis.  Many of my colleagues have talked about disaster relief. We certainly need to help the communities of Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and deal with the wildfires in the We know we have to get that done now. We can't wait another month. Let's make sure that by no later than February 8, we have also dealt with those issues.  In the legislation we are considering now, I am pleased that we will deal with the Children's Health Insurance I wish it were permanent. Rather than putting another deadline on the program, we should try to make it permanent. It has been a bipartisan success in all of our States, and the Children's Health Insurance Program needs further attention for permanency.  However, the legislation we are in the process of passing does not deal with community health centers. We know that most of our children and their parents who are using the CHIP program are going to be using health centers. We need to extend the program for our health centers.  There are a lot of extenders out there on which we need to act. Just to mention one, the one that I have been interested in and have authored legislation on deals with the therapy cap. A therapy cap means that those who have the most serious need for therapy services--those suffering from strokes and those types of injuries--are not able to get the full services or are at least threatened to not get the services because of a therapy cap. We have extended it ever since we put it into law. The cap should never have been put into law. We also need to pay attention to it in this budget debate. That also needs to be dealt with by February 8.  My colleagues brought up the serious pension issues that affect the workers of this country. That needs to be addressed.  There is reason to say that I am pleased that the government is back up--or will be back up shortly--but we really need to negotiate and not operate under continuing resolutions.  I think that because of the amount of spotlight that has been put on these issues, we have a much better chance to get these budget issues resolved through an appropriations or a CRomnibus or an omnibus rather than a continuing resolution.  Then there is the issue of the Dreamers that I have talked about numerous times on the floor of the The Dreamer issue is urgent. It is urgent. Many Dreamers' lives have already been affected, and their lives have been changed as a result of President Trump's announcement last September that he was putting a 6-month time limit on when the Dreamers would be subject to deportation. That deadline occurs in early  In the meantime, those who are up for renewal status--there has been uncertainty as to whether they will be able to continue to reside here in America, whether they will be able to continue to have a driver's license or to work. They feel like they have--and they do have--a sign on their backs saying that they expire on a particular date. That anxiety needs to end. It should never have been started under President Trump's edict in September, but we need to respond to that in an urgent way.  I was very pleased that we have a commitment from the majority leader that by no later than February 8, if we have not passed the bipartisan DACA protection, Dreamer protection bill, we will have that bill on the floor of the Senate in a manner in which the Senate can speak on the issue.  I am very confident that because of the compromise that has been negotiated with Senator Graham and Senator Durbin, we will be able to pass that bill that will protect the What it does is it allows them to maintain their Dreamer status, and it puts them on a pathway so they can have permanent citizenship here in the United States, and they will know their future is here in After all, it is the only country most of them know. That is certainly a very encouraging sign.  I was also very pleased to hear in the negotiations that took place that this legislation would also provide the protection for those who are here in temporary protected status. In some of the cases, President Trump has extended dates and said: This is the last extension. That could expire within the next 18 months. In some cases, he has deferred making that decision for some countries.  What we know about those in temporary protected status is that they are very similar to the Many know no country but the United States as their home, and it is important that we protect their status here in the United States and provide them a pathway for permanency and citizenship here in the United They are part of America, and they are part of our economy.  In the meantime, I would hope that there would be consensus here and support from the White House that the enforcement procedures that are being used against the immigrant community be mindful of the efforts being made here to provide them a permanent status and that the priorities on enforcement that we have heard mentioned many times--which, quite frankly, are very confusing to the immigrant community--that those priorities would not be aimed at those who are going to be protected under the legislation we will be considering in the next few weeks.  We all are pleased that we are now able to move forward to keep the government open, that we have a commitment to deal with the budget of our country by February 8 and the Dreamer issue by that date. We have made real progress.  As Senator Durbin observed--and I must tell you, I think each of us did also--during this very difficult time, the conversations we have had among our colleagues on both sides of the aisle have been very encouraging. I think the Members of this body want to return to the great traditions of the Senate where we listen to each other, where we work together, where we compromise, and where we are able to come to successful completion of our work. Virtually no work has been done, but too much is on the table right now that needs to get finished. Let's take advantage of these next few weeks to show the American people that indeed we will work together in the best interest of our country, putting partisan politics aside, dealing with our budget issues, dealing with our immigration issues, dealing with our healthcare issues, and dealing with our pension issues.  We can do the people's work. Let's get that done, and let's start right now getting that work completed.  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Daines).

216,topic-id,197,"Mr.President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the heroic life of Scranton firefighter Captain James Robeson on the 10th anniversary of his death.  Captain Robeson was more than just a firefighter. He was a loving husband to his wife, Linda, and a caring father to his son, He was a friend to many, a mentor to his colleagues, and a hero to us all.  Captain Robeson made a career out of service and protection. He willingly served and courageously protected his colleagues, the city of Scranton, and all of us who inhabit it. Each time duty called, Captain Robeson heroically was one of the brave individuals running into the flames and chaos, while everyone else was running out. Captain Robeson was a man of high honor and integrity, two qualities demonstrated when he laid down his own life in an attempt to save another.  Ten years after his death, it is still my honor to have been given the opportunity to serve a man as brave, honorable, and respected as Captain His unquestioned willingness to serve others and courageous ultimate sacrifice is a reminder to me about the true meaning of public service.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-24-pt1-PgS500.txt,1828,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENTS TO H.R. 695, CHILD",2018.0,24.0,January
430,topic-id,914,"Mr.President, tonight I rise to speak about two matters. The first is the issue of community health centers, which, of course, is a major issue for States across the country.[[Page S555]]  Millions of Americans get their healthcare through community health centers. I will mention it more than once--800,000 of them are in the State of As we come closer to working out bipartisan agreements on a whole range of issues that are ahead of us literally in the next 2 to 3 weeks, I hope there will be a strong consensus to provide a funding plan and funding certainty to community health centers across the country.  These community health centers provide access to healthcare through education, rehabilitation, preventive services, and direct care. These centers focus on meeting the very basic healthcare needs in a community. They provide critical services, especially for people in both urban areas and rural areas, where there are often limited options for primary care and prevention clinics.  Despite the critical importance of these health centers, Congress failed to act to extend the majority of funding for community health centers before it ran out on September 30, 2017. After funds expired, the health centers were facing a funding reduction of between 60 percent and 70 percent of their funding.  Last December, Congress passed a continuing resolution that included $550 million in funding for community health centers. That is nowhere near what they need to get through even 1 year. While this funding patch will provide some short-term relief, the funds do not provide the long-term funding stability for health centers that they need and that the patients who depend upon them should have a right to expect.  It is time for Congress to end the delays and get a long-term funding plan in place for these community health centers by the next deadline for the continuing resolution for funding, which is, of course, February 8. Because there is a deadline, it does give us the chance to work toward that date, to get funding in place by the 8th.  Across the United States, health centers serve more than 25 million patients per year. That is about 1 in 13 Americans overall. Consider this: I live in a State where we have 67 counties, but 48 of the 67 are so-called rural counties. That is the way they are categorized. There are a lot of healthcare needs in those rural communities and rural counties. Health centers provide care to one in four rural If that ratio were applied to Pennsylvania--we have at least 3 million people who live in rural communities. You can see the numbers. Hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians in rural areas depend upon healthcare from these community health centers.  In terms of the centers themselves, in 2016, Pennsylvania had 264, and that meant there were thousands of people working in those health centers. There are close to 5,000--above 4,900 Pennsylvanians who work in these centers. These health centers provide quality care and vital services, as I said before, to a total of 800,000 Pennsylvanians--rural, urban, and otherwise.  To give you a sense of some of the testimony I received from people in our State, one story came from Emily, who works at the Family Practice and Counseling Network, a location I just visited today in She wrote this letter to me a number of weeks ago. I won't read the whole excerpt, but this is what she said in pertinent part about the people who are served by these community health centers:       They have lives filled with trauma and in turn suffer from      social, physical, and behavioral issues that will go      untreated if funding for [community health centers] goes away      . . . our services are so needed.  The words I want people to remember are ``lives filled with trauma.'' That is, unfortunately, a good description of the lives led by a lot of Americans when healthcare--in this case, a community health care center--is not there for them or when healthcare itself is threatened. ``Lives filled with trauma.''  Another person who works at the same place and who has been the leader of this particular institution, the Family Practice and Counseling Network in Philadelphia, is the executive director, Donna I met her just today. She sent me a letter prior to today about her concerns. She is concerned about the funding cliff resulting in a barrier to care for people who need mental health services that are critically important. Donna said in pertinent part:       The impact on our community will be devastating. Our health      center provides behavioral health services that are already      limited in Without funding, we'll need to close      a site and cut jobs, causing patients to go without the care      they desperately need.  For purposes of this debate, I would consider that expert testimony on community health centers because I know that in Donna's case, she has worked in this field something on the order of 25 years. We appreciate her weighing in on this.  I know there is concern on both sides of the aisle on this issue. I hope that concern results in a bipartisan agreement to fund community health centers to at least--and I would like to do a lot more, but at least give some funding certainty for the next year, meaning from now until the end of the fiscal year. I hope we can get an agreement that would give funding certainty for 2 years or more. That would be ideal.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-29-pt1-PgS554-8.txt,1828,FEDERAL REGISTER PRINTING SAVINGS ACT OF 2017,2018.0,29.0,January

855,topic-id,1176,"Mr.President, I want to spend a couple of moments tonight--I know the hour is late for the Senate and people working here, but I want to end the night with a message about a law enforcement official in Pennsylvania whose memorial service I attended on This individual was a deputy marshal. His name is Christopher David He lost his life on January 18. He was living at the time in York, He was killed in the line of duty in Harrisburg--not far from York--while attempting to apprehend a fugitive.  I commend Deputy Marshal Hill for his service to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and his service to our He happened to be working in the Middle District of Pennsylvania, which meant he had responsibility for work through counties from the bottom of the State all the way up to Northeastern Pennsylvania, which is my home area.  I offer our deepest condolences to his family. Law enforcement officers like Christopher Hill accept the special duty of protecting the rest of us and keeping our communities safe. I have to say that we often don't think about that in the context of Federal marshals who do critically important work every day of the week and are often in horrifically dangerous circumstances.  In this case with Deputy Marshal Hill, the murderer was shooting from a higher position in a house. They didn't know this individual was in the house. He was shooting down at him. He had protective gear on. I won't give a full description because I am not qualified to do that, but the problem is the bullet came from a direction like this and entered his body from above and killed him even though he had protection on and all the proper protocols were followed. It was, in essence, a one-man ambush because they were trying to apprehend another individual on the floor below where the assailant was. That is the kind of danger Federal marshals face every day of the week, and sometimes we don't realize it.  Chris and his loving family made the ultimate sacrifice for the Nation and for the people in For his bravery and the contribution of his family, who supported him, we are eternally grateful for that commitment to law enforcement and the country.  Christopher David Hill was born in Sacramento, CA, but he was raised in Central He graduated from Warrior Run High He served his country as a Ranger in the U.Army, where he was assigned to the prestigious 3rd While in the Army, Chris earned many awards, including the Army Commendation  For the last 11 years, he served as a deputy U.marshal. He was a member of the agency's Special Operations Group, so-called  At the memorial service, there were lots of references to that Special Operations Group because members of that group were there to not only pay tribute to him but to speak about his life, to speak about his service and to speak about his character and his bravery in very moving testimonials. The Special Operations Group is a specially trained and highly disciplined tactical unit.[[Page S556]]  In 2012, Chris served on a SOG assignment in Afghanistan, for which he was recognized with a Director's Distinguished Group  In 2014, he was instrumental in the capture of notorious cop killer Eric Eric Frein was the individual who killed a State police officer and also injured another State police officer. In this case, Chris commanded U.marshals, FBI agents, and State troopers in one of the largest rural manhunts in recent American history.  Chris was known as a dedicated and extremely capable law enforcement officer, and his numerous awards are proof of that.  During his time at the Marshals Service, he received the FLETC Director's Leadership Award, a Special Act Award for Distinguished 300 Shooter, and a Special Act Award for achieving 95 percent weapons proficiency.  Christopher was described as the person you wanted to go through the door with, someone on whom you could completely rely. He was also known for his sense of humor and his positive outlook on life.  Outside of work, he enjoyed hunting and golfing with his friends and family, but most of all, Chris is known for his devotion to his family. Chris is survived by his devoted wife Sylvia, his loving son and daughter Travis and Ashlynn, his father John, his brother Joey, his sister-in-law Michala, and his sister He was preceded in death by his mother  As I mentioned before, on January 18, he was shot and killed in the line of duty. The U.Marshals Service apprehends approximately 100,000 fugitives every year--100,000 every year--including the worst of the worst, violent felons whose capture makes our communities safer.  Also shot in this altercation were Kyle Pitts, a New York City police officer, and a Harrisburg police officer who took a bullet to his ballistic vest but was not injured. We are praying for Kyle Pitts' full recovery.  Last week, I joined law enforcement officers from around the country for the memorial service, as I mentioned. You could tell how Chris was loved and respected by the testimonials from those law enforcement officials. You can't see it from a distance, but this is a program from the memorial service. It has a list of those who spoke--I will not read all of them--and then it has Chris's biography, with a picture of him on the back.  I could go through virtually every name of the ones who spoke in tribute to Chris--friends of his who worked with him. I am not sure I have ever been to a more emotional and moving ceremony in my life, where you had speak from the podium, one after another, these dedicated law enforcement professionals who are as tough and as determined as any man can be. Each person was very, very emotional, overcome with emotion in some cases. I am not sure I will ever be at a ceremony that is as moving.  On a night like tonight, when we have a lot of debates and a lot of arguments on a range of issues, these are times we can come together to express not only condolences, not only tribute and appreciation but express, I think, what is the solidarity of our State and the Nation in paying tribute to a fallen law enforcement official.

62,topic-id,970,"Madam President, as we vote this evening on the Pain-Capable Child Protection Act, I speak to the bill as a doctor who practiced in a hospital for the uninsured for decades. I mention working in a hospital for the uninsured because the uninsured are vulnerable, but if the uninsured are vulnerable, among those, the uninsured pregnant woman is particularly vulnerable. If we are to say she is particularly vulnerable, then we can say her unborn child is most vulnerable of all. So I speak to these folks with that background.  Our country has struggled to find a balance between those of us who are pro-life and those who are pro-choice. As a pro-life doctor, I think the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act strikes a balance. Again, as a physician, let me say it is an obligation--our society's obligation--to care for the woman who is pregnant. Again, she is among the most vulnerable. Her child is the future of our society.  We all agree to this. You can see we agree because our social programs provide a safety net both for her and her unborn child. Example: Society pays for well-baby visits through Medicaid or through special programs for women if they are uninsured. If that child is born healthy, then he or she is more likely to be a healthy person, to contribute to society, to have life, liberty, and be able to pursue happiness.  Those of us who are pro-life and pro-choice can differ when the child within the womb deserves protection as a distinct human, but society has agreed at some point that protection is allowed. Again, I am pro-life. I think the protection should be when the child is conceived, but right now the law is divided.  If a pregnant woman and her child were killed by a reckless driver, there are two counts of manslaughter filed against that reckless driver--one way society acknowledges the life within the womb.  On one hand, let's be clear, a woman has the right to terminate that pregnancy at another point in the pregnancy. On the other hand, partial-birth abortion says that child's life cannot be terminated when she is coming through the birth canal. I think the rationale for this is that as a child comes through the birth canal, we recognize that child can live independently, if allowed to proceed. If you will, the criteria is: Does the child have the ability to live independently from the mother? Again, I think that is the rationale for the partial-birth abortion ban.  As it turns out, a child who is 5 months old within the womb has the ability to live independently. Again, I speak as a physician. When you see a baby in the womb at 5 months, it is incredible.  A friend of mine who works for me--actually, he and his wife are expecting now, and they are excited. They went and got the ultrasound, and they saw the child sucking on his thumb or her thumb--they don't know or they don't want to know. Nonetheless, it is marvelous what they see inside--the child. You can see him yawning, stretching. At 18 weeks, you can find out if it is a boy or a girl--and, thanks to modern medicine and the amazing neonatal intensive care doctors and nurses we have in this country, babies delivered as early as 20 to 22 weeks can survive and live healthy lives, perhaps one day to become the Presiding Officer in the Senate of the United  In recent years, medical research has shown that unborn children can feel pain as early as 20 weeks after they are conceived. As a doctor, I have to look at the scientific evidence we have when it comes to the beginning of life. At 20 weeks, studies have provided strong evidence that babies can feel pain despite the fact that the nerve connections between the different parts of the brain are still developing. That is why fetal anesthesia is routinely administered when unborn children require surgery in the womb.  By the way, doctors know this. I just got a letter from the Louisiana Academy of Family One of their folks, Gravois, called me last night. Here is a statement from their letter:       Representing more than 1,900 physicians, including active      practicing physicians, residents in training and medical      student members, as well as the patients in Louisiana, the      Louisiana Academy of Family physicians[[Page S538]]     is the voice of family medicine in As advocates      for our patients, in August of 2015, the LAFP Congress of      Delegates passed the following resolution on Late Term      Abortions:       Resolved, that the LAFP is against performing elective      abortions 20 weeks and after, and further be it Resolved . .      . .  It goes on, but that is the take-home point. Family physicians take care of both the mother and her child, the totality of it.  By the way, I will say this bill includes explicit--explicit--exceptions when a mother's life is at risk or in cases of rape and incest, again, attempting to strike society's balance between those of us who are pro-life and those who are pro-choice.  Versions of this law have already been passed in 20 States, including my State of Louisiana, but all babies who feel pain deserve the same protection. Most Americans agree, even some who believe abortion should be legal. Polls show that majorities of women, Independents, and Democrats support this protection. So I hope my colleagues will join in supporting this commonsense, humane legislation.  It is estimated this bill will protect 12,000 to 18,000 babies per year. Protecting unborn babies who can feel pain is the right thing to do. Protecting their right to life is the right thing to do.  I urge my colleagues to vote for this important legislation.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2018-01-29-pt1-PgS527-6.txt,1925,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2018.0,29.0,January

Madam Speaker, we meet here today, 122 days into the current fiscal year. FY 2018 is one-third over, and yet the United States Congress has been unable to appropriate funds for the defense of our  I ask my colleagues, Madam Speaker, to pause and let that sink in.

The United States Congress has forced the U.military to operate like this under continuing resolutions for 9 of the last 10 years. The rule and the underlying bill that we are debating and voting on today, Madam Speaker, is a crucial step towards reversing this dangerous trend.  This Defense Appropriations bill is a clean bill. It clears away all the politics. It clears away all the posturing. It clears away all the jargon and the process arguments.  Madam Speaker, this is an up-or-down vote on the one issue that matters more than any other: providing for the common defense of our  The question before this House today is whether we will do our constitutional duty and provide the funds for those who are putting their lives on the line for all of us. There is no other question, Madam And for those who vote ``no,'' there will be no place to hide when history comes to ask why they failed to do their duty.  Our military has been strangled for the last decade, Madam Obama-era budget cuts are certainly to blame. The Obama administration's defense budgets were based on a set of dangerous policies and false assumptions:  They assumed we could withdraw from the Middle East and the terrorists would stop fighting.  They assumed we could talk North Korea out of their nuclear program with a policy of ``strategic patience.''  They assumed Russian and Chinese efforts to upend the global world order the United States built and sustained with our allies over 70 years were no threat to our national security.  Perhaps worst of all, Madam Speaker, they assumed that paying billions of dollars to the regime in Tehran in exchange for unverifiable promises from the mullahs about their nuclear program would serve America's interests. Never before, Madam Speaker, has an American President been so wrong about so much at the expense of so many.  But we in Congress must also accept some of the blame. While the previous administration was pursuing policies that aided our adversaries and harmed our national interests, the United States Congress adopted the Budget Control Act, a law that has proven devastating to the security of our  Beginning with the Budget Control Act in 2011, the United States Congress imposed arbitrary spending caps on domestic and defense discretionary spending. We handcuffed the military, Madam No longer could they ask: What are the threats, and what do we need to defend ourselves? Instead, our men and women in uniform were faced with arbitrary caps and, in 2013, sequestration.  When the supercommittee that was established by the Budget Control Act failed to come to any agreement on cuts in mandatory spending--mandatory spending being the real driver, Madam Speaker, of our national debt--sequestration kicked in. This was like taking a meat cleaver to every account in the defense budget at a time of war when our adversaries are gaining in strength, readiness, and capability every day.  By every measure, Madam Speaker, the Budget Control Act has failed. Since its passage in 2011, the national debt has grown by nearly $4 trillion.                              {time}  1230  Five years ago, the CBO estimated that the U.debt would reach 80 percent of GDP by 2029. Today, Madam Speaker, the CBO projects that will happen by 2022. The Budget Control Act has failed to do what it intended to do.  Madam Speaker, we have got to acknowledge something else. The Budget Control Act created the concept on which our current budget negotiations are stalled. The idea, espoused especially by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, that we must have ``parity''--for every dollar we increase defense spending, they demand a dollar increase in domestic spending--is lunacy, Madam  We are the people's elected Representatives with the responsibility for stewardship over taxpayer dollars. We are responsible for appropriating funds for the Those funds should be appropriated based upon our determination of the needs and priorities, not based upon some arbitrary concept of parity.  The dysfunction in this budget process is now so great, Madam Speaker, that, because of the BCA, we are in the process of actually spending more on programs we don't need. It is time to fully repeal the  Madam Speaker, my colleague on the Rules Committee, Mr.McGovern, will no doubt shortly point out that Republicans control the House and the Senate and the White He is right, of course. But Mr.McGovern also knows that it takes 60 votes to pass anything in the Senate, which gives the Democrats and their leader, Chuck Schumer, power far beyond what they would otherwise enjoy to block action.  Mr.Speaker, as you know, we have passed all 12 appropriations bills through this body, including this Defense Appropriations bill, only to have these bills languish in the  Mr.Speaker, the defense of this Nation must no longer be held hostage to the rules of the United States If 60 United States Senators cannot be found to do what is right and fund our military, then, Mr.Speaker, that body has a constitutional obligation to change its rules and stop allowing a small minority to hold our military hostage for political reasons.  The threat is real and the situation is dire, Mr.Today, we have the smallest Army since before World War II, the smallest Navy since before World War I, and the smallest and oldest Air Force we have ever had.  Only 5 of 58 brigade combat teams in the Army are ``ready to fight tonight.'' Funding for future readiness against competitors like Russia and China has been cut by over 70 percent in the last 10 years. As North Korea's missile program advances, the U.inventory of missile defense interceptors is dangerously low. Less than half of the Navy's aircraft can fly, due to maintenance and spare parts issues. Only 50 percent of the Air Force's combat forces are sufficiently ready for a highly contested fight against a peer adversary.  Mr.Speaker, we are running out of bombs. Our supply of precision munitions has been depleted by budget cuts and increased operations. Fatal accidents are increasing. This is all happening, Mr.Speaker, as the global threat environment is more complex, more imminent, and more grave than at any time since World War Every day we fail to do our duty in this body, the risk to our troops increases, and it becomes easier for our adversaries to close the capabilities gap.  Surely, Mr.Speaker, on this issue we can set politics aside and do what is right for our Republic, for our freedom, and for every man and woman standing watch on the front lines for all of us. Therefore, Mr.Speaker, I urge support of this rule and the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

841,topic-id,404,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I appreciate, as always, the candor of my colleague, Mr.But, I have to say, I am having a hard time understanding why it is, when he is so clearly knowledgeable about the damage that CRs do to the military, we are, today, presenting an opportunity for this entire House to stop that process for this entire House to provide the kind of reliable, secure, sufficient funding that our troops need; yet, I would imagine, many colleagues on the other side of the aisle are going to vote ``no'' on that.  I think it is important, though, to recognize some facts, Mr.Speaker:  The first of those is, for all the talk about a budget agreement, it was the leadership on the other side of the aisle that refused to go to a meeting at the White House a couple of months ago and pulled out completely of the talks last year.  It was also, with all due respect, Mr.Speaker, the leadership on the other side of the aisle, the Democrat leadership, that shut the government down 2 weeks ago. So it is awfully hard, I am sure, to be able to convince constituents back home that they really want to get this job done and get things moving when they continue to stop the process, to gum up the works, and even to shut down the government.  Mr.Speaker, I know that every Member of this body cares deeply about the U.troops. And I know that every Member of this body wants what is right for this But there is a big difference between having the luxury of talking about support for the troops and actually voting for the funds they need to do their job.

Mr.Speaker, we have seen now on display in this debate exactly the problem and, frankly, it is despicable, Mr. We are in a situation where our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are holding hostage funding for our troops over the issue of illegal immigration. There is no other way to describe it. There is no other way to--I can't put it into words. The people who are watching, I am sure, have seen it on the floor right now.  If my colleagues feel so strongly about support for the troops, there is a very easy answer. And that answer is to vote for this bill, to vote to support this appropriation, not to try to divert attention, not to try to talk about other issues, not to try to talk about the extent to which we haven't reached a deal.  We have got a bill and we are putting it on the floor. It funds the troops. It ends the damage that has been done by the continuing resolutions. They ought to vote for it, we ought to pass it, and then our colleagues in the Senate should do the same.  They cannot, at the same time, say that they support our troops, that they support resources for the troops, and then go through all of these contortions trying to explain why it is they are going to vote ``no'' on this issue.  I would also just say, Mr.Speaker, the fact that the United States Senate right now is either incapable or unable of doing its constitutional duty does not absolve us in this House of the obligation to do ours, and that is to provide funding and resources for the U.military.  It is absolutely a broken system. We are in a situation where I would ask my colleagues to think, as they are arguing on this floor, debating on this floor today, about the parents of men and women who are deployed, to think about what this debate must sound like to them, to think about trying to explain to them why it is when we have a bill that provides the funding the military needs, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are going to vote ``no'' because of some budget process, some budget procedure, because of negotiations over DACA, because of any other reason under the sun they can imagine.  Vote ``yes'' on this bill, vote ``yes'' for this rule, and then we can go on and deal with these other issues. But, Mr.Speaker, none of those other issues will matter. If we fail to do what is right for the military, none of those other issues will matter.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I really appreciate the people who write the Republican talking points because they keep on trying to change the subject to try to confuse the American people.  My colleague knows that this battle is not over the DREAMers, although we all think it is immoral that these young people have been treated so terribly and so cruelly, and we believe that there needs to be a resolution to that.  The bottom line is that we need to negotiate budget caps so we know how much we can spend on not only defense, but nondefense appropriations so we can keep our government running. This should have been done months ago.  So if we really care about our troops, then where is the bipartisan agreement to raise the budget caps so that we know we have a budget deal? Where is this bipartisan agreement?  My Republican friends have known that this is the deal for a long time, yet, again, they are tied in knots because they are fighting amongst themselves. Their rightwing is having a battle with their extreme rightwing; and there is even an extreme, extreme rightwing that not only does not want to raise any nondefense spending budget caps, but wants to cut domestic spending.  I would say to my colleagues that this is about more than the In fact, this is about community health centers. I mean, people rely on community health centers all across this country to get their healthcare. We are not dealing with that.  This is about funding our veterans.

I mean, Homeland  So, I mean, there is a whole bunch of stuff here, but this is really simple to fix. It requires the Republican leadership and this Republican government to do its job.

Mr.Speaker, I think that if my colleague on the other side of the aisle spent more time focused on doing his job and less time on telling us to do ours, we would be in a lot better shape. I think the American people deserve to know what is going on in these budget negotiations.  What is going on in these budget negotiations, Mr.Speaker, is that the leadership on the other side of the aisle continues to move the goalpost. They enjoy this political fight, this political dance. They enjoy the sense that they can hold us hostage, they can hold the troops hostage.  They seem to not have any concern at all about the fact that we are now 30 percent of the way through the fiscal year and our troops have not been funded.  So behind closed doors, what is going on is moving the goalpost; it is Lucy and the football. They want to continue playing these games.  So I would suggest that my colleague on the other side of the aisle ought to turn his focus and attention on his own leadership and ask them to do their job.  In the meantime, Mr.Speaker, we are in a position where we are today considering a bill that will fund the military.[[Page H696]]  I applaud my colleague's efforts to try again and again and again to make the case that he believes in funding the military, he believes we ought to have a full year appropriation, he believes we have got to get out from under the CR, and, therefore, he is going to vote ``no'' on this bill. It takes, really, focus and attention and talent to be able to do that, so I applaud that effort, but the reality is the reality, Mr.We are in a position today where we have the opportunity to vote to fund the troops, and we ought to do that.  Mr.Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, let me say again, the Republicans are in charge. I wish we were in the majority. If we created this mess, the Republicans would have every right to criticize us, but we are not in charge. I regret that very much. I think it is not good for the country that we have a Republican House, a Republican Senate, and a Republican President, because I think a lot of the priorities of the American people are not being addressed.  All the Republican leadership needs to do is get together and do their job and negotiate a deal on the budget caps, and let us approve defense and nondefense spending for the rest of the year and get away from these It is in their hands.  As I said, the Senate Subcommittee on Defense Appropriations hasn't even had a markup in their committee. I mean, they are controlled by You can't blame us for everything.  Bottom line is you are in charge. When you are in charge, you have to keep the lights on. That is your responsibility. Unfortunately, my Republican friends don't want to do this.  I have never, ever, seen this kind of incompetence in our government, ever, in all my years. This has to end. Again, the way it ends is when the Republican leadership decides to negotiate a budget agreement with the House and Senate leaders, Republicans and Democrats alike.  Mr.Speaker, we all believe that we ought to support our military, we ought to make sure we have the best military, second to none. We want to fund that, but we also understand that it is important to fund the Department of Homeland Security, which protects us from terrorist attacks here at home. I am sorry my Republican friends don't see that as a priority.  We also believe we ought to fund veterans' health. I am sorry my Republican friends don't see that as a priority.  We believe in funding community health centers. We believe in making sure that our States have the money to be able to rebuild their aging infrastructures. I am sorry that that is not a priority, but it is to us.  The entire budget is a priority to us, and I don't think it is too much to ask the leadership of this House and the leadership of the Senate to make sure that everything is funded and that the needs of the entire country are met, and not kind of picking one over another over another.  The other thing I would say is that, if we want to have a talk about national security, we ought to focus on what is happening right here with the Republicans and the House Intelligence Committee playing politics with an investigation into Russia's attack on our democracy.  You ought to be concerned about a President of the United States who doesn't seem at all worried that the Russians interfered in our election, that according to his own CIA head says they are still trying to interfere in our election, and we can't even get this President to impose congressionally mandated sanctions.  Is there anything that Russia can do to us that will cause this President to stand up and defend our country or to even say something mildly critical about Vladimir Putin, whom he praises, a man who kills journalists and human rights defenders and political opponents?  I mean, stop this politicization of the Russia investigation. This should be bipartisan, getting to the bottom of this. Wherever it leads, it leads, but this is serious. You want to talk about a threat to our country, to our homeland, and to our democracy, look at what Russia is doing to us each and every day.  Finally, Mr.Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question so that we can bring up the Dream Act so we can actually protect these wonderful people who have been such great members of our community, who have been first responders, who have saved lives in the aftermaths of hurricanes, who serve in our military.  We have to stop holding them for ransom. They are not hostages. We ought to stop holding them for ransom for a stupid wall that costs $25 billion.  When I think about $25 billion, I can think of a lot of things to do with $25 billion that could help the people of this country rather than building a ridiculous wall that someone could buy a ladder to climb over or a shovel to dig under.                              {time}  1315  We have to do better, so vote ``no'' on the previous question, vote ``no'' on this rule, and send a message to the leadership of this House: Get back to work and do your job.

847,topic-id,1471,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, some things are complicated, but this one isn't. Our colleagues, if they are so concerned about the national security of this Nation, there is a very easy thing for them to do, and that is to vote for this Defense Appropriations bill.  It is really important for us, as we are having this debate, to remember the facts; and the facts of the budget negotiations are that it was the Democrat leadership that walked away from the table and stalled the negotiations. It was the Democrat leadership, Mr.Speaker, that shut down the government.  So the Republicans, right now, understanding and recognizing how crucial it is for us to get the Defense Department out from under these damaging continuing resolutions, to provide them with sufficient, secure funding, reliable funding, we are moving a clean Defense Appropriations bill.  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle can yell all they want about having us do our job, and, Mr.Speaker, I appreciate that. Our job, our most important job, our job that is crucial and sacred above all others, is to provide funding and resources for the military of this That is what this bill does. That is why we are, today, presented with an opportunity to do the right thing.  With this bill, with a vote in support of this rule, and a vote in support of the underlying bill, we can begin to reverse the damage of the last 7 years.  It is time, Mr.Speaker, to stop with these political games. It is time to stop moving the goalposts. It is time to stop holding defense spending hostage to illegal immigration issues, holding defense spending hostage to increased domestic spending. It is time to stop. Our troops are on the front lines fighting and dying for us, and our actions in this body are putting them at greater risk.  It is not, Mr.Speaker, as though we can sit here and fail to act, and we are just delaying. Our failure to act is putting our men and women in uniform at greater risk. Our failure to act is aiding our adversaries.  I would urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, frankly, to look in the mirror and to recognize that they are the ones right now who hold the key, as do the Members of the United States Senate, to making sure that we get these resources to our men and women in uniform.  I would say, once again, Mr.Speaker, if we fail to do this, if we fail to do our constitutional duty, nothing else we do matters. There are no other individuals in this Nation who are charged the way we are with providing for the common defense, and it is an individual duty and obligation of every single one of us.  Mr.Speaker, I would like to call to mind the words spoken by Ronald Reagan 35 years ago. As we engage in the political theater that my colleague on the other side of the aisle mentioned in this House, it needs to stop,[[Page H697]]and we need to remember what is important.  Ronald Reagan said: ``It is up to us in our time to choose, and choose wisely, between the hard but necessary task of preserving peace and freedom, and the temptation to ignore our duty and blindly hope for the best while the enemies of freedom grow stronger day by day.''  Mr.Speaker, it is truly up to us. It is an individual obligation on each Member of this body. Therefore, I urge adoption of both the rule and the Senate amendments to H.695.  The material previously referred to by Mr.McGovern is as follows:          An Amendment to 714 Offered by Mr.McGovern       At the end of the resolution, add the following new      sections:       2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the      Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare      the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on      the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.     3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment      of status of certain individuals who are long-term United      States residents and who entered the United States as      children and for other purposes. The first reading of the      bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against      consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be      confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally      divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority      member of the Committee on the After general      debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the      five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in      the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of      the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report      the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been      adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered      on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without      intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or      without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and      reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then      on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately      after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of      rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further      consideration of the bill.       3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.3440.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

868,topic-id,634,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for yielding. He has pulled us together. Those of us who have been able to work with him over the years, as I have--13 years on the committee--we appreciate the gentleman's work from Georgia's 13th  Mr.Speaker, my colleagues have already very eloquently reminded you of the significance, the history, and the benefits of unions. I want to talk to you about the power of unions, the power to effect change in the workforce.  Next month, the U.Supreme Court will hear arguments in Janus v. This will decide whether workers can receive all the benefits of a union contract without contributing any funding in return. We call them fair share fees.  Unions work because the workers pay their fair share, and they all benefit from what is negotiated. Each worker chooses whether or not to join a union, but the union is still required by law to represent and negotiate on behalf of all of the workers. Some people want to see an end to that, which is why this case is headed to the U.Supreme A negative decision could reverse a 40-year unanimous precedent supporting State's rights.  Now, I want to say that I believe in the power of unions. It allows employees a voice when some of them feel that they have been silenced. When they can't speak and ask for increased wages or a safe working environment for fear of retaliation, the unions speak. The unions are their voices and they demand fair and reasonable working conditions.  We saw that power in 1970 during the Postal Workers' strike. Workers had had enough. And as the gentleman from Georgia mentioned earlier, we saw that power during the Memphis Sanitation Workers' strike. Workers were willing to sacrifice their lives.  The Reverend James Lawson, a good friend of mine, was a United Methodist pastor in Memphis at the time. He made a phone call to a man he had met about 10 years earlier. Jim Lawson had just gotten out of prison for refusing to go to Jim Lawson met Martin Luther King after he got out of prison. They both ended up in India, studying under  Jim Lawson realized that Martin Luther King had started this organization with four others called the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, so he called him and said: ``Would you come to Memphis? We need you to help with this sanitation workers' strike.''  It is little known that when King tried to get the SCLC board to vote to come to Memphis, they were not in support. King struggled around a couple of days by himself, and then let everybody know on the board he was going to go by himself. That, of course, changed everybody else's minds and they joined him in  We all know what happened to Martin Luther King, Jr., when he went to He was killed on the balcony of the Lorraine He sacrificed his life for workers, the people who built this country.  I owe my ``middle classness'' to my maternal and my paternal grandfathers. Both of them worked for the Southern Pacific Railroad and became members of a union and earned enough money to buy a house.  In my little town where I was born, Waxahachie, Texas, an African American owning his own home, not a shanty?  So it inspired his three boys, one of which was my father, to raise his four kids in a middle class way. We all went off to college. We owe that not only to the ingenuity of my grandfather and my parents, but also to the unions.  So I will support unions as long as I can. Long after I am out of Congress, I intend to support unions because they have power to change lives. I am an example.

If you look at all that has been said about the Children's Health Insurance Program, what you are going to find is that we extended that program in this CR for 6 years with a savings of $1 billion.  It is a sleight of hand, because we did not fund community health centers; we did not fund the disproportionate share hospitals, mostly rural in my district; we did not fund adequately the teaching hospitals.  So if you wanted to really be honest with the American people, we could have extended the Children's Health Insurance Program permanently and saved $6 billion and would have had enough money in the savings to expand our community health centers, to fund disproportionate share hospitals, and to fund teaching hospitals, that which we did not do, and I voted ``no.''                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-22-pt1-PgH623-3.txt,208,FEDERAL REGISTER PRINTING SAVINGS ACT OF 2017,2018.0,22.0,January

It further provides that ``changes to the allocation of such funds shall be subject to the reprogramming requirements set forth in the annual appropriations Act.''

Mr.Speaker, the reason we are here is because Republicans care more about the extremely wealthy than they do about average American citizens. They got together and passed a tax scam bill that gave 86 percent of the moneys to the top 1 percent in our society.  They gave crumbs to the middle class that will expire, unlike the corporate cuts they gave that will not expire. And then they come up with a children's healthcare plan as a bargaining chip to get what is not a clean CR through, but a CR where they took funds that will help the ACA continue and take those down for 2 years so the ACA is further crippled.  To hear the Republicans talk about their care for healthcare is laughable. They were never for Medicaid or Medicare or the Affordable Care They are not for a permanent children's healthcare plan. They are not for community health centers, where 40 percent of those CHIP children get their healthcare.  If they wanted to bring the government back and get us open, they would offer us the medical extenders like Mr.Pallone talked about. This is unfortunate.

51,topic-id,195,"Mr.President, last week marked the 45th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, but many of us were not celebrating because last week gave us another opportunity to consider the real damage caused by the Supreme Court decision, which even liberal scholars have now said is flawed in the type of damage it has done to the social fabric of our Nation over the last four and a half decades.  During this period of time, more than 50 million unborn children in America have been denied the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness--50 million. In other parts of the world, unborn children have been killed by the sheer fact that they happen to be girls instead of boys or because one has a disability like Down syndrome.  For me, Roe v. Wade hits close to home because I come from the State where the lead plaintiff was living at the time of that now famous lawsuit. Her name is Norma McCorvey, or Jane Roe in the case.

105,topic-id,2785,"Mr.President, as we all know, tonight the President will address the Nation from the Chamber of the House of This is called the State of the Union, and its tradition dates back to George Washington's time when he gave his first annual message in 1790.  Tonight is an important speech. It gives the President a chance not only to look forward but to look back on the first year of his term in office. That first year was marked by a steady stream of impressive accomplishments working together with These successes are easily missed when the decibel level here in Washington remains so high. The good news all too often gets drowned out by the noise, although, the truth is that the President's policy decisions have been spot-on, particularly when it comes to our Nation's economy.  First and foremost, last year he signed comprehensive tax reform into law. This is something we haven't been able to do since 1986. Our reforms lowered rates across the board for every tax bracket, doubled the child tax credit, and incentivized U.businesses to create jobs here at home rather than overseas, and, finally, it repealed the ObamaCare individual mandate, making the Affordable Care Act voluntary and not mandatory.  All across the country, we have seen the chain reaction as at least 263 businesses, large and small, have used the tax savings to increase workers' wages, expand their operations, and create jobs. According to one poll, small businesses' optimism is now at an 11-year high. The economy, thank goodness, continues to improve. A key economic indicator rose more than expected last month, but the momentum has been building over the last 12.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average has reached record highs. Everyone with a 401(k), a savings account, a pension, or somebody who dabbles in the stock market has seen the value of their holdings go up by about 25 percent in this last year. Federal workers who invest in their thrift savings plans through these index funds have seen their retirement funds grow to a huge amount--25 percent--consistent with the stock market.  President Trump's economic policies have been joined by his administration's strong insistence on suspending or eliminating job-stifling regulations. Now, don't get me wrong. Regulations are necessary for public health, safety, and welfare, but they can go too far and stifle innovation and economic growth. Unfortunately, that is what has happened.  He signed an Executive order when he first came to office and has cut at least 16 rules and regulations for every new one that was created. I think his original goal was to cut two for every new one, but, actually, he has done better than that. He has cut 16 for every new one that was created, and that has saved roughly $8.1 billion in compliance costs.  We need to keep in mind here in Washington that when we pass a law or when we pass a regulation, somebody often has to hire somebody to comply with that law. If there is a change in the Tax Code, you have to hire an accountant to help you figure out how to comply with the law or, if you are a manufacturing facility, you want to make sure OSHA and other Federal agencies don't come in and fine you so you hire people to help you comply with regulations and laws. These aren't people who necessarily help you become more productive; these are just people to keep up with the rules and regulations that emanate from The savings, as a result of rolling back some of the unnecessary regulations, has been pretty dramatic.  We in Congress did our part using the Congressional Review Act to eliminate heavyhanded regulations passed during the eleventh hour of the last administration.  President Trump's policies have stimulated the economy in other ways too. They have expanded energy infrastructure projects like the Keystone Pipeline and, with the help of Congress, opened part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas exploration. This is something that was set aside specifically for energy production years ago, but as a result of the logjam in Congress, that important natural resource for America was out of bounds because of congressional inaction. Well, no more.  I have flown over the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and, believe me, it is not someplace you would go on a vacation. It is a pretty rough area, but because people think of it as a wildlife refuge, they think, well, maybe this is a threat to the wildlife. Just the opposite is true. We know the caribou population has sprung up in areas where they have an oil pipeline because they use it for nesting grounds. It just goes to show how little the bureaucrats here in Washington who believe there is nothing they shouldn't regulate or overregulate--they can be wrong.  Meanwhile, the President has been hard at work enforcing our immigration laws, something he was elected to do. He has added immigration judges and removed more than 36 percent more criminal gang members than in fiscal year 2016.  When it comes to immigration in the Senate, we have been working together to find a bipartisan solution for the recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals--the so-called DACA  People will remember this was something President Obama did, unilaterally circumventing Congress, and the courts later told him, no, he couldn't do it, placing the future of some 690,000 young DACA recipients in jeopardy. President Trump wisely has given us a deadline of March 5, but kicked it back to Congress to do what only Congress can do; that is, to come up with a solution. The President, helpfully, has laid out his priorities, and now we in this Congress have to come up with a consensus on how to move forward.  We know these young adults deserve future certainty, but also we don't want to repeat the mistakes of the past. We finally need to secure our borders and fix the flaws in our immigration laws that are exploited by the human traffickers and coyotes, and we aim to do both. There has to be symmetry. On one hand, we can show the sort of compassion that Americans have always shown, but we also need to have the security and knowledge that our laws and our border will be enforced.  The President shares this dual aim. On Sunday, my friend and fellow Texan, Roger Rocha, the head of the League of United Latin American Citizens--or LULAC--sent a letter to President Now, you wouldn't ordinarily think that LULAC and President Trump would see eye to eye, but here, President Rocha congratulated the President for setting what LULAC called a reasonable framework for immigration reform and border security. LULAC stated that as long as we stay within the President's parameters, the organization can support the eventual proposal because they are eager to make sure these young people--some 690,000--have a positive future. The President has gone over and above that and said, not only the people who signed up for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, but those who were eligible and who did not sign up can still participate in this pathway the President has prescribed for them, as long as we do our job when it comes to border security--dealing with the diversity lottery visa and dealing with chain migration.  I think LULAC's endorsement of these four parameters is very encouraging. It is huge news. LULAC has more than 145,000 members, and it is heralded as one of the oldest civil rights organizations in America itself.[[Page S571]]It believes that now is the time to move forward, and that is something, hopefully, all of us will agree with.  LULAC believes the President's framework will keep the momentum of progress on its proper trajectory, they say. What this means is, President Trump is now on the brink of delivering something to the American people--certainty to DACA recipients, enforcement of our immigration laws, and securing our borders--that previous Presidents have been unable to do. Let me say that again. What this means is, President Trump is now on the brink of delivering to the American people certainty for the DACA recipients, enforcement of our immigration laws, and securing our borders, something previous Presidents have been unable to accomplish.  Democrats remain at a standstill on the very issue they have advocated for years, though. To my Democratic colleagues, I say the following: We are still waiting to see your alternative that could become law. The President has made a proposal. So you owe it to the American people, and you certainly owe it to the DACA recipients--whom some people call the Dreamers--you owe it to them to come up with an alternative. We can't negotiate with ourselves; we need a negotiating partner who will work with us in good faith to get to a solution that can get a Presidential signature. We are running out of time, and we need to get this done.  One unsung story of President Trump's first year has been the reshaping of the Federal judiciary. He nominated 73 Federal judges, including Neil Gorsuch, above all, who was confirmed to the U.Supreme Court last spring. We have helped him see that 12 appellate court judges have now assumed the robe and taken to the bench. This, of course, is the intermediate appellate court that, for all practical purposes, is the court of last resort, since the Supreme Court of the United States only hears about 80 cases a year. They decide cases where the appellate courts disagree or where there is a dissent by one of the judges, and usually it is the circuit courts that are the final word, interpreting, of course, Supreme Court precedence.  I am particularly proud of two of those supreme court justices: Don Willett, formerly of the Texas Supreme Court, and Jim Ho, who has served as my chief judiciary counsel, among other distinguished service, and who was a law clerk for Clarence Thomas and served as solicitor general of I am proud of the fact that these two men are now serving on the Fifth Circuit Court of  Last but not least, the President has worked to increase defense spending and shown deft leadership in handling a broad array of foreign threats. I think that is, in part, responsible and due to the incredible team he has surrounded himself with, including General McMaster, the National Security Advisor; Rex Tillerson, the Secretary of State; and James Mattis, Secretary of They are a strong and impressive team, and they serve the President and the Nation well by providing the President the kind of advice he needs to lead and to keep our country safe and to maintain America's leadership in world affairs.  We know, for example, that under our military leaders' strategy, as authorized and enabled by the President himself, the terrorist organization ISIS has lost most of its territory and many of its followers.  This administration has also strengthened U.policy in Iran, which is the 1 state sponsor of international terrorism. He has held Syria accountable for crossing redlines when they violated international norms by using chemical weapons--something the previous administration declined to do. This administration has stood up to an increasingly belligerent North Korea and used diplomacy to encourage China to use its clout as a bordering nation to North Korea to try to dissuade Kim Jong Un from pursuing his nuclear power goals. I hope that is successful.  It is no surprise, then, that based on polling data, Americans are substantially more satisfied with the Nation's military strength, security from terrorism, and the state of the economy now than they were at the end of the previous administration.  Our President is only 1 year into his term, but he has already changed this country's political landscape. I share his goal of continuing to build a safer, stronger, and prouder  The question then becomes how, working together, we can do that. During tonight's State of the Union Address, there are a few specific topics I look forward to hearing more about--shared priorities for the upcoming year--for example, rebuilding our Nation's depleted infrastructure. I recently introduced a bill with our colleague the senior Senator from It would expand an infrastructure financing authority already in use by many States and local governments. I come from a big State, where we have a growing population, and we need to continue to build our infrastructure there to keep commerce flowing and to keep our roads safe and to protect our environment. This legislation I have introduced with my colleague from Virginia would raise the statutory cap on something known as private activity bonds, which assist various types of transportation construction.  In the near future, I expect to introduce other infrastructure initiatives, and I look forward to working with my colleagues as well as this administration to see them signed into law.  I am also keen to hear the President's thoughts on issues relating to public safety and law enforcement. I myself am a strong proponent of the Second Amendment, but I believe tragedies like that which occurred in Sutherland Springs prove the incredible danger of dangerous felons purchasing and possessing firearms. That is illegal, but it happens, and, unfortunately, the consequences can be devastating to the families affected.  That is why I have introduced the bill we call the Fix NICS NICS, of course, is the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which makes sure that when you go in to purchase a firearm, if you are a convicted felon, if you have been committed for mental illness, or if you are guilty of domestic violence, you cannot legally buy a firearm in America, but if the background check system isn't uploaded properly, as in this case the Air Force declined--or I should say failed--to provide the necessary information to the criminal background check system, somebody can go in and lie and purchase firearms they can't otherwise legally purchase. That is why it is so important that we fix the National Instant Criminal Background Check That is something that has broad bipartisan support, and I hope to see it passed into law soon.  I see my colleague from Rhode Island here whom I have been working with on prison reform, another issue I hope the President touches on this evening, and I believe he will. I believe one of the most effective ways for us to legislate is to let the States be the laboratories of democracy. In this case, many of our States have been laboratories of democracy when it comes to reforming our criminal justice system and specifically our prison system. I know, for a long time, people had this idea that we are going to lock up folks and throw away the key, but the reality is, people who go to prison usually get out of prison. The question is, Are they going to be better prepared when they get out and hopefully avoid reincarceration and hopefully become productive members of society or are they just simply going to be warehoused and then let out, only to repeat their criminal acts and end up back in prison again?  We have had some enormous success in Texas and others States about incentivizing low- and medium-risk offenders, to provide them an opportunity to deal with their drug or alcohol problem or to learn a skill that they can earn a living with once they get out of prison or to get a They have been very successful in cutting down on the rate of recidivism, decreasing the crime rate, and along the way saving the taxpayers money because they don't have to just build another prison to warehouse more people. We can keep the hard-core criminals locked up while we extend an olive branch and some help, a helping hand to those who will take advantage of it to turn their lives around and become productive members of society. So I am looking forward to the President talking about that.  I know the President will be talking about that and other important issues, such as immigration, and he will be[[Page S572]]speaking from the heart tonight, and we should all listen to his words carefully. Whether we voted for this President or not, he is the duly elected President of the United States, and we, I believe, are obligated--those of us in Congress--to work with him, where we can, to try to help make things better for the people we represent.  Once he concludes his remarks tonight, then the ball is in our court to follow up on his calls to action, and I hope we will.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

238,topic-id,2227,"Madam President, now that the government is up and running again, we need to look ahead at what our legislative priorities should be. I can't speak for everybody, but I can speak for myself. My priorities are threefold.  First, we need to expedite disaster relief. In December, the House passed an $81 billion disaster relief bill designed to address the natural disasters caused by Hurricane Irma, Hurricane Harvey, as well as the wildfires out That has been sitting in the Senate since We need to act and act with dispatch.  Everybody remembers Hurricane Harvey--we certainly do in Texas--which pummeled us last It was last August; this is Most of the media attention in the months since has focused on the city of Houston, which quite literally was torn apart. This was the most intense rain event in American history--more than 50 inches of rain fell in 5 days.  Other areas beyond Houston fared worse--I am thinking of cities like Rockport and Port Author on the Texas coast. I am thinking of cities like Victoria and More than 28,000 square miles were flooded. Crops rotted, livestock died, and almost 6 months later people are still piecing together their lives.  In addition to Hurricane Harvey, as I said, there was Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria, and there were the wildfires that burned across California that later resulted in mudslides after the rains fell. I know the Federal Government is not the only entity charged with ensuring help gets to these places, but it certainly has an important part to play.  This morning, I attended the U.Conference of Mayors and saw a number of my mayors from Texas who were part of the success or at least the management of this natural disaster in[[Page S513]]They have done their part. The State has done its part. It is time for the Federal Government to step up, and it is time for the Senate to pass this supplemental bill that was passed by the House in  The second priority I have, personally, is lifting the spending caps that impair our national defense, particularly our men and women in uniform. In my remarks yesterday, I said this is a problem set in motion by the Budget Control Act of 2011. While well-intentioned--for a while it did hold down discretionary spending and reduced our deficits and our debt--its implementation has not stemmed our national debt, but it has tied the hands of our military. This is an important lesson. It is not defense spending, it is not tax cuts, it is not discretionary spending; it is the mandatory spending in our entitlement programs which continue to run up deficits and debt and which threaten us and our financial future, to be sure.  In the meantime, our military faces readiness challenges across the globe. We simply must listen to people like Defense Secretary Jim We should lift the caps, end sequester so our military no longer suffers and so our national security is on safer ground.  The third on my immediate to-do list is working with a bipartisan group of legislators as well as President Trump on the issue of the DACA recipients. As everybody who has been paying much attention in recent days knows, this is a group of about 690,000 young adults who came into the country as children because their parents brought them in illegally, in noncompliance with our immigration laws.  In the United States, we don't hold children responsible for the mistakes of their parents, nor should we punish these young adults who have now grown up because their parents broke our immigration laws. We know they face an uncertain future, and much of the responsibility for our porous borders should be borne by Congress--not only the present Congress, but past Congresses--for basically turning our heads the other way while people continued to immigrate illegally into the United  We are going to need to improve our infrastructure, personnel, and technology to make sure we don't experience that sort of rush of illegal immigration in the future, which is why some of our Democratic colleagues like to say that we need to protect DACA recipients, which we are willing to do. But we want to make sure there is not a repetition of this in 3 years or 5 years hence. So there are important measures we need to combine with that, and the President has told us that he is going to insist upon--and he is correct in doing so--a robust border security component, as well as ending chain migration and the diversity lottery visas. From the news I saw this morning, it sounds like the President made some statement about the first piece of that puzzle last night. We are expecting to hear more from the White House on how they expect Congress to respond and what the President would find acceptable here in the next few days.  This bill can't become law without the President's signature. So the President's views are not irrelevant, but we are the ones who have the primary responsibility to resolve these complicated issues. Getting 60 votes is not the only thing we are aiming for. Certainly, that is the hurdle we have in the Senate, but it would be a futile act if the President wouldn't sign it or if it wouldn't pass the House of So we have our work cut out for us, and I know the American people will not support it unless it is a serious and well-thought-out proposal. The blowback will be strong, and we will face a harsh reprisal if we don't take into account the opinions and the views of our constituents back home, which I intend to do.  Beyond these short-term actions, which we need to move on as soon as possible, there are other priorities I would like to mention as well. Infrastructure is something everybody likes to talk about, until you ask the question: How are we going to pay for it?  Recently, I introduced a bipartisan bill with Senator Warner from Virginia that would expand an infrastructure financing authority already in use by many States and local governments across the United This legislation is called the BUILD Act, which would raise the caps on a specific category of what are known as private activity bonds, giving additional access to tax-exempt bond authority for the purpose of constructing highway projects.  I was with a number of Texas mayors earlier this morning, and they told me they see that as a positive development, something they can use in their cities. They appreciate that during the tax reform debate we maintained the tax-exempt status of municipal bonds used for those kinds of purposes.  In the near future, I intend to introduce a few other legislative initiatives to help rehabilitate our Nation's infrastructure. I come from a State that is growing because we are creating so many jobs, and that is putting a strain on our existing infrastructure. So for the interest of public safety and the environment, as well as our economy, we need to repair and build out our infrastructure. I know the White House has some plans in this area as well, and we look forward to hearing more about them and working with the administration when it comes to infrastructure.  Thinking about other areas that we could work on in a bipartisan fashion, I firmly believe it is important for us to look at success stories in the States, and then, once these laboratories of democracy have done things that actually result in positive things, we can then learn from them and scale them up at the Federal level.  That is one reason I am very interested in taking the lessons we learned in Texas and other States on prison reform and offering a better, more enlightened, and sensible path to reentry for people who made mistakes and ended up in our jails and prisons. Not everybody is going to take advantage of it. In my visits in Texas prisons, I know illiteracy is rampant. Some people have drug or alcohol problems that need to be addressed. Some people just need to learn basic job skills if we expect for them to succeed once they get out of prison. We have used various incentives for low-risk offenders in Texas to provide them opportunities to address each of those concerns, and it has been quite successful. Not only have fewer people recommitted crimes and ended up back in prison, but our communities have become safer as a result, and taxpayers have had to build fewer prisons in the process.  I have been working in the Senate on a bipartisan way with my colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Whitehouse, and my colleague from Utah, Senator I know this issue has gotten some real traction thanks to President Trump and the roundtable he hosted at the White House earlier this month.  More than 11 million people go to jail each year in the United States, and there are currently 2.3 million people under confinement. This is a matter of great public concern, but to me the 1 concern is public safety. If we can keep the public safer, if we can save taxpayer dollars, and if we can help people who are willing to accept the opportunity to turn their lives around and become productive members of our society, it seems to me that we ought to be doing that.

Finally, we have to keep filling our judicial vacancies.

They go through a very extensive vetting process. Senator Cruz and I have created something we call the Federal Judicial Evaluation Committee, which is a group of our[[Page S514]]most experienced practitioners in the State, on a bipartisan basis, to evaluate the people who apply for these important life-tenured positions.  I want to compliment the President for his sterling picks for the judiciary, certainly so far, starting with the Supreme Court of the United But at the intermediate appellate courts, like the Fifth Circuit and these district courts, these are the people who do the day-in and day-out work of the judiciary to make sure that all Americans have access to justice and the opportunity for a fair hearing before an impartial judge. That is one of the most important things the Federal Government provides through our judicial branch: ``Equal justice under law,'' as the words above the Supreme Court building say.

Emily is originally from Crossville, TN, and we will not hold that against her. She is not a Texan, but many people from Tennessee eventually came to Texas, as I tell a couple of my Tennessee colleagues, most of them one step ahead of a great spouse or one step ahead of the law. Those are the Tennesseans who made their way to Texas at the time of our founding. Things have gotten better, by the way, but that is sort of an inside joke between Tennesseans and  Emily has been director of Member services in my whip office and is the longest serving member of our operation. Before working in her current capacity, she served under my predecessor, Senator Jon Kyl, and before that for my colleague, Senator  Everyone who has had the privilege of meeting Emily knows that she is one of a kind. Her smile lights up rooms, and her personality is contagious. Everyone loves being around her. But she also works incredibly hard. Some nights she is here until 1 in the morning and goes home and works even harder alongside her husband Together, they have two small children, Brock and Madge, who, I am sure, require a lot of love and attention.  So we are sad to see Emily go, but we wish her nothing but the best and want to express our sincere gratitude for her service to the We know her future will be bright in whatever path she decides to take.

I am glad we can finally get back to work here.  Amid the political gamesmanship, the past 3 days have highlighted the commitment of many of my colleagues to honest and bipartisan work. I would like to particularly thank Senator Graham, Senator Collins, Senator Flake, and several of our Democratic colleagues who worked tirelessly to bring this impasse to a conclusion.  Soon, Federal operations will be getting back to normal for the American people. We all know what comes next--challenging negotiations on a host of serious issues. The weeks ahead will require the best from all of us.  I hope we can remember some lessons from this regrettable incident. Brinksmanship and hostage-taking do not work. They make bipartisan progress harder, not easier, to achieve.  Senators must focus on the common good of the American people, not the warped priorities--the warped priorities--of extreme voices, no matter how loudly they shout at us to do otherwise.  With the pointless, damaging, partisan theatrics of this government shutdown behind us, serious and bipartisan negotiations can resume. We have been talking for months about how to address military spending, disaster relief, healthcare, immigration, and border security, and the rest of Congress's unfinished business.

626,topic-id,3270,"Mr.President, President Trump didn't vote to shut down the government. He is not a Member of the U.President Trump did not shut down the government. Now, Senate Democrats are reeling because the President has said that while the government is shut down, he is not going to negotiate a change of our immigration laws that our Democratic colleagues, and, frankly, many Republicans like me would like to see changed relative to the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, young adults.  It seems to me, our Democratic colleagues have figuratively shot themselves in the foot; reloaded and shot themselves in the other foot. Now they expect President Trump to somehow rescue them out of this box canyon.  I know I am mixing my metaphors here, but this is the situation they find themselves in. They shut down the government, and now they are hurting the very people they shut down the government to help because there are no negotiations going on to find a solution that we would all like to try to achieve.  This is really surreal. There is an old saying: Everybody is entitled to their opinion, but you are not entitled to your own facts. Facts are facts. Democrats voted to shut down the government because they are impatient to get a solution for these DACA young adults. Now they have to blame somebody else because they are unwilling to own up to their own responsibility.  Growing up, my parents told me one of the most important things I could do--and my sister and brother could do--is accept responsibility for our own mistakes, not blame somebody else. That is simply juvenile.  We could work this out today. We could work this out now if our Democratic colleagues would simply acknowledge that they, themselves, are the ones who shut down the government. They, themselves, have now caused negotiations for the solution they want to cease because the President rightly says: Why reward bad behavior by continuing the negotiations when they shut down the government? As I said a moment ago, it is surreal.  There are casualties. There are casualties, not just to the DACA kids, who are now young adults. These are children who were brought here by their parents without complying with our immigration laws. Being children, they are not responsible. They are not culpable. The law doesn't hold them responsible.  We all agree they ought to get some relief, and we would like to be able to negotiate that. But we can't do that when the government shuts down as a result of their miscalculation.  The DACA kids, now young adults, aren't the only casualties here. It is our military. It is the National Guard that can't train. It is the 9 million children who are depending on an extension of the Children's Health Insurance Program, which enjoys broad bipartisan support.  I almost couldn't believe my ears. The Democratic leader is a talented politician. He is a very intelligent guy. I enjoy working with him on occasion, but he has been driven into this untenable, unsustainable filibuster because he simply refuses to say no to the most radical fringe of his political base.  This isn't like him. This hasn't been my experience working with the senior Senator from New York on a myriad of other things. But as the Democratic leader, he simply could not say no to this narrow fringe of his political base that insists that a solution today on the DACA problem is more important than funding the military, paying our Federal law enforcement officials, or providing health insurance to 9 million vulnerable children.  As people begin to realize this miscalculation, we start seeing it reflected in public opinion polls. CNN reported that only 34 percent of the people they polled said that this kind of miscalculation was justified--34 percent. I bet as people learn more, as they are personally affected more and more by this government shutdown--now in day 2--then there is going to be an even greater majority of people who say: This just is not worth it. Why won't you take yes for an answer from Republicans who want to work with their Democratic colleagues? Why would you shoot yourself in one foot, reload, and shoot yourself in the other foot?  I realize it is hard for our Democratic colleagues to save face in this outcome, but sometimes in life, when you make mistakes and you can't blame them on anybody else, then you simply need to acknowledge your own responsibility and say: Do you know what? I had the best of intentions, but I was wrong. I made a mistake. That could be[[Page S398]]liberating sometimes, but not in politics, apparently, and not on this topic--at least not yet.  At 1 o'clock tomorrow morning we are going to have a vote. Democrats filibustered a 4-week continuing resolution, but in an effort to provide them a face-saving way out of this dilemma of their own making, the majority leader has offered them a vote on a 3-week continuing resolution, during which we will continue to work on this DACA solution. My guess is it is going to pass because there are a dozen or more Democrats--I understand 19 were at a bipartisan meeting after the government shutdown, trying to figure out how can we help our leaders find their way out of this mess.  Do you know what? People who are on the ballot in 2018, which isn't that long from now--it is a great way to run for reelection, isn't it? To say: Yes, I shut down the government. Yes, I hurt the military. I hurt vulnerable children. I inconvenienced everyone, including the government workers, who diligently come here to the Capital--and across the country--to perform their important work on a daily basis. Yes, I basically made their lives worse. Oh, by the way, elect me in 2018. What a great message that is.  There are Members on that side of the aisle who are realizing, hey, this is going to hurt me personally. Forget the constituents. Forget the children. Forget the military. They are realizing, hey, this is going to make it harder for me to get reelected. Do you know what? I have now created an election issue on which I might lose. It might be the end of my political career.  I hate to think that this is the most important thing in people's calculation here. I hope that rather than their own personal politics, they would be more interested in the other people they are hurting and the futility of this situation they have created.  I hope; maybe I am naive. I don't think I am naive, but maybe I am. Maybe not enough Senate Democrats will reconsider what they have done on the 4-week CR and they will not vote for a 3-week CR, even though the majority leader has moved their way to provide them a face-saving way to get out of this box.  I don't care what it is--whether it is their own personal, political calculation, whether it is the realization that this is not worth the shutdown--because Republicans are willing to work with them to find a solution before the March 5 deadline for the DACA recipients. Whatever the rationale, I hope there are enough Democrats who will simply say to their leader: You know, you made a mistake. You miscalculated. This isn't about President President Trump didn't shut down the government. He didn't vote to filibuster this continuing resolution. It was Democratic Members of the Senate, and it was a mistake. Let's correct that mistake, and let's move on. Let's do the right thing for our constituents. Let's do the right thing for our constituents who wear the uniform of the U.military. Let's do the right thing for veterans. Let's do the right thing for Federal workers and the law enforcement agents who are simply being hurt needlessly and unnecessarily, but callously, by this shutdown.  They may have forgotten about the hundreds of thousands of Americans, including 200,000 Texans who could be furloughed if this shutdown continues. I haven't forgotten about them. That is why I voted to keep the government up and running.  Unfortunately, the American people lose out when their elected officials decide that their personal politics or their own political interests are more important than the people they have been sent here to represent. We talked about this all last week. We warned our colleagues on the other side about the effects of a shutdown and urged them not to vote against funding the government.  It wasn't just the Senate Our House colleagues did their duty on a bipartisan basis and sent us a 4-week continuing resolution.  In the meantime, our Democratic colleagues have heard from bipartisan groups of Governors, including seven Democratic Governors, who have said, in effect: Wait a minute. These children who depend on the Children's Health Insurance Program are collateral damage to your political fights in Washington, Why hurt them? They implored us to extend the Children's Health Insurance Program for 9 million children across the country who rely upon it.  The answer so far is: Forget about it. We don't care. Our Democratic colleagues continue this shutdown for no good reason. It really is a shame.  Here is the other thing that has been pointed out time and again, but I think it is worth repeating. There is nothing in this bill that Senate Democrats oppose. What they are saying is: Other things we want are not in the bill, so we are going to shut down the government.  In my experience in the Senate, it is bizarre to say: I am going to vote against a bill that I support. What is that all about? Do they want to fund the government? I think they do if they could figure a way out of this conundrum that is not particularly controversial.  Do they want to fund the military? I honestly believe our colleagues across the aisle want to support our military, although it is hard to tell when you see what they have done here. But our military has broad bipartisan support, generally.  Do they want to reauthorize CHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Program, for 6 years? That passed out of the Senate Finance Committee, on which I sit, with broad bipartisan support. It is very popular, not only with the Governors who have to run the program but also here in the  Why abandon all the things you support over an unrelated issue and one that we are in earnest willing to work with our Democratic colleagues to solve? Why decide to be derelict in one of your most basic duties as an elected Federal official in order to hold hostage Congress and the country, really, on an unrelated issue that we are working on, we have been working on, but now, as a result of their shutdown, we can't work on?  Let's open the government back up. Let's get back to work and do our job on each of these issues.  Of course, the so-called DACA issue is important. I have 124,000 DACA recipients who signed up in good faith with the Federal Government, even though President Obama overreached his authority, according to the courts, and now it is our responsibility to clean up the mess that was created by this end run around the Constitution and We welcome that part of our responsibility.  It is important to me personally, like my friend, the Senator from Illinois, who has been a champion for many years for the In other words, these are the same people who came here innocently with their parents who violated the law, but we don't hold children responsible for what their parents do. But sometimes they get caught up in the consequences, and that is what has happened here.  I have had a number of these current recipients of deferred action come visit me in my office. One young man is 22 years old. He told me that he is really worried about his future, and he wants us to try to provide him a predictable future because he wants to make the most of himself. He wants to keep going to school. He wants to contribute to this country that he was brought to by his parents. He knows no other country, really.  You would have to have a pretty hard heart not to be moved by the stories that so many of these young people tell. I don't believe anyone here wants to do them harm intentionally. But, indeed, the very people who our Democratic colleagues said they are shutting down the government for are the ones who are suffering and who are being hurt because we have stopped negotiations because of this government shutdown.  This is an issue that deserves its own separate, thoughtful consideration instead of being lumped into a manufactured tug of war over a noncontroversial funding measure. I know it sounds ridiculous when you say it out loud, because now we can't properly resume negotiations on DACA when we are forced to negotiate to reopen our own government.  What is really pretty amazing to watch is that the minority leader keeps trying to shift the blame to the There used to be a time when Congress would jealously guard its authority under the Constitution and tell the President, no matter if[[Page S399]]they were a Republican or a Democrat, that is a congressional prerogative. The Constitution provides that authority to the Senate and the House, not to the executive branch. That used to be the fights we would have with the executive branch. But now, after the Democratic leader has simply abdicated his responsibility and tries to blame the President for something he himself created, it has turned that whole idea on its head.  I, for one, am not willing to relinquish the authority given to the U.Senate under the Constitution, under the separation of powers--I am not willing to relinquish that to any I believe it would be wrong to just say: Whatever the President wants or says or negotiates, we are going to rubberstamp. That would be an abdication of my responsibility to the 28 million people I represent. I am not going to do that.  We come from a big, diverse country of more than 320 million people. The Acting President pro tempore proudly represents the people in the great State of Their interests and their concerns aren't necessarily the same as every other They have unique concerns based on their history and culture and location in the world that are different from some of the other 49 That is really the magic of the Senate, that each of us is here representing our constituents in our given States, and we have the responsibility of trying to build consensus and come up with solutions to problems. But I doubt the Acting President pro tempore came here just to be a rubberstamp for any Knowing him as I do, I am confident that is not the case. I am not here to do that either.  So to hear the Democratic leader call this a Trump shutdown when the President didn't vote to filibuster this bill, when this is a congressional responsibility, not an executive branch responsibility, and to somehow then expect all of us to fall in line, turns this whole idea of the separation of powers in our constitutional responsibility in the Senate on its head.  Well, as I have said before, our great country is a product, among other things, of two great inheritances: that we are indeed a nation of immigrants--all except a small fraction of the people who live in the United States now came from somewhere else at some point in their family history. My relatives emigrated from Ireland in the 19th century, I am told, following the potato famine. Others left their home country because of religious persecution. Others came because of their dire economic circumstances, and they simply wanted a better life. They wanted a piece of the American dream.  So we all understand that in some ways, the fact that we do hold out that promise of more opportunity, of the American dream for people who come from diverse places around the world--we literally have been the beneficiary of the hard work, the determination, the intelligence, and the resolve of those immigrants who have come here to make America a better place and to pursue their American dream in the meantime. But the part that some people seem to have forgotten--the second great pillar of what has made America great--is the fact that we believe in the rule of law. We believe in the We believe in the people being the ultimate word on what the laws are, that the very legitimacy of our laws is derived from the consent of the governed. It is not because of some great idea we have come up with here; it is because the American people have consented and given us the authority we need in order to pass those laws and to govern our great country.  So all I am hoping for that might come out of this mess we find ourselves in now is that somehow, some way, working together in a bipartisan way--which is the only way anything gets done around here--we can regain our lost legacy as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. That is what has made our country so great, in my opinion.  An aide to one of our Democratic colleagues was reported as saying: I am concerned we don't have an exit strategy. Well, I think the exit strategy is pretty straightforward. At 1 a.m. tonight, early tomorrow morning, they are going to have a chance to vote to reopen the government for 3 weeks. Again, governing by continuing resolution is a lousy way to govern. It is a miserable way to govern. It is irresponsible. But it is better than a shutdown.  So I hope our colleagues will take advantage of this opportunity, of the conciliatory gesture the majority leader has made to shorten the length of the continuing resolution that they filibustered and that resulted in the shutdown and that they will now vote for this 3-week continuing resolution, during which we can reopen negotiations on the DACA issue. It could be--there is no guarantee, but it could be that given 3 weeks more time, we can come up with a solution to all of those issues and more, including disaster relief for Puerto Rico, for Florida, for the Virgin Islands, for Texas, disaster relief for California and where the wildfires have devastated places out west. All of that is being held up, too, as a result of the unwillingness to deal with budget caps, spending caps, because of That is the other casualty here.  My hope is that given 3 weeks to continue our discussions, and learning from their mistakes, I hope we will vote to reopen the Federal Government and take that time to discuss the spending caps and how to move forward on All eyes are on us. The responsibility is ours. It is not the President's responsibility; it is our responsibility. And every Texan and every American who relies on the Federal Government in one way or another--and that would pretty much be all of us--expects us to do our job. So let's get to work. Let's reopen the government. Let's find a solution to DACA and the other challenges with which we are presented.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Kennedy).

They agreed to pass a continuing resolution to reopen the government until February 8.  I am glad they finally decided to fund the Children's Health Insurance Program on which 9 million vulnerable children rely as well as fund our military and essential government entities[[Page S480]]that could not operate during the shutdown. Now we have to work on other items that have been stalled and held hostage too.  The first is disaster aid, which has been held up for months. The House of Representatives passed an $81 billion disaster relief bill back in December, but so far that package has gone nowhere in the That is incredibly disappointing and exacerbates the hardships to the victims of Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Harvey, as well as the folks out West who suffered extreme wildfires, floods, and mudslides. They need to get access to that $81 billion of disaster relief funding the House passed last December, but that too has been held hostage in the U. It is especially disappointing in my home State of I just got off the phone talking with Governor Abbott, who is perplexed--the kindest word I can think of--as to why we would continue to delay disaster relief to the people who suffered as a result of Hurricane  I am sure Governor Scott in Florida feels the same way. I am sure Governor Brown out in California feels the same way. I am sure the Governors of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands feel the same way. What is wrong with Congress? Why can't they take up and pass an $81 billion disaster relief supplemental that the House sent the Senate in December?  Last August, Hurricane Harvey devastated 28,000 square miles on the Texas coast. It has been called the most extreme rain event in history, certainly in the history of the United Highways were flooded. Thousands of homes were gutted. Places like Port Arthur, Beaumont, and Houston have not returned to normal. Routines are disrupted, shops and businesses remain closed, and houses are being renovated or rebuilt. But because of the size and the scope of the devastation, it is hard to get building supplies and it is hard to get the workers to rebuild these damaged homes and businesses.  In Rockport, where I visited over Thanksgiving, Harvey made landfall with 150-mile-per-hour winds and a 13-foot storm surge. As of the end of December, 284 families were reported to still lack permanent housing. Some people are even living in tents.  Rockport Mayor C.Wax said that 70 percent of businesses in Rockport remain closed--70 percent. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, one-third of Rockport is so badly damaged that it will be impossible to rebuild. Think about that. Think if this hit your hometown. One-third of your hometown is so badly damaged by a natural disaster that it will not be rebuilt, and 70 percent of the businesses in your hometown are closed and haven't reopened. Think of how you would feel.  Over in Nueces County, meanwhile, which includes Corpus Christi and Port Aransas, officials have been frustrated because they haven't received the temporary housing assistance they need. Although FEMA--the Federal Emergency Management Agency--continues to marshal the full extent of its resources to help some people, for various reasons, many people are still living in motels and, as I said, even tents. This is completely unacceptable in the United States of America, especially while the House of Representatives has acted to produce a disaster relief bill, but it has been held hostage here in the This isn't a Democratic issue or a Republican issue; this is something we should be clamoring to solve--and not only clamoring, we should be acting to vote on that disaster relief today.  Stories like these are why we need to move additional funds for disaster relief without delay. It is not just Texas, as I said, it is Floridians, Puerto Ricans, and people who live in the Virgin Islands and the wildfire-ravaged parts of California as well.

1061,topic-id,2419,"Mr.President, I know the paperwork is being finalized, but I for one--and I guess I am not the only one; I am sure there is broad appreciation for the fact that our Democratic colleagues who voted to close the government have now changed their minds and now will vote on final passage, having just voted on cloture, to reopen the Federal This was a strategy that lacked an endgame and was never going to work.  The safety, health, and livelihoods of Americans across the country didn't deserve to be held hostage, and the American people have had enough of these kinds of games. I think, basically, the verdict of the American people is ``A pox on both your houses.''  I don't think anybody comes out of this looking very good. But surely, this calculated stunt that put funding for our government, military, and the Children's Health Insurance Program at risk, all because our colleagues wanted to accelerate consideration of the DACA issue--the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals--was a mistake by any measure.  They, of course, had planned this strategy for months. Many of them had signaled their intention to vote against any spending bills unless the DACA issue was resolved, despite the fact that a majority of Americans in recent polls said that avoiding a shutdown was more important to them than other priorities.  If we just think about it, trying to deal with the concerns--and they are legitimate; I am sympathetic with them--of the 690,000 DACA recipients versus 320 million Americans who were hurt by this shutdown, it just seems disproportionate and unnecessary.  For most of the last 3 days, negotiations led to nowhere. The majority leader in particular took the conciliatory gesture of--instead of pursuing the 4-week extension--saying: We will do it for 3 weeks. That is ultimately what our colleagues across the aisle voted on, but what did they have to show for that? To my mind, they got nothing to show for that.  Sure, they got a commitment from Senator McConnell, the majority leader, to take up the issue of immigration in He was going to do that anyway. We know the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program expires on March 5. So logic would tell us that, yes, we are going to have to take it up in But it just seemed so unnecessary and so harmful to try to shut down the government to force something that was going to happen anyway. So I said: That doesn't make much sense to me.  I am glad our colleagues decided to take this step to reopen the government while we resume our work to find a solution on this immigration issue. But we have a lot of other important issues.  First of all, the Children's Health Insurance Program will be reauthorized as part of this vote here shortly. But we have other issues.  We have to agree on spending caps for this fiscal year so that the Appropriations Committees can figure out, How much money can we commit to our national security? We have shortchanged our national security in recent years because of the Budget Control Act and sequestration, which creates automatic spending caps, absent some agreed-upon grand bargain. This has been a perennial problem, not just for Congress and the country, but it has particularly fallen hard on our military at a time when James Clapper, the former Director of National Intelligence, said that in his 50 years in the intelligence community, he had never seen a more diverse array of threats confronting our country and confronting the world. We can tick down the list, from North Korea, to Iran, to Russia to There is a threat of home-grown terrorism here in the United States because of domestically inspired Islamic extremists. The world is a dangerous place, and it is made safer only when America is strong and America leads, and we can't do that while underfunding our national security apparatus, our intelligence agencies, and the Department of So we need to take care of that.  We also need to deal with disaster relief. I come from a State that was hammered by Hurricane Harvey, the most significant rain event in many, many--perhaps even 1,000--years. More than 50 inches of rain inundated the city of Houston and that environment. Many people are still hurting. Many people are still not back in their homes. Their businesses were blown away. And while the House of Representatives has voted on an $81 billion disaster relief package, because of the holdup here--again, because our Democratic colleagues in the Senate think this DACA issue is more important than those victims of natural disasters, not to mention the wildfires out west--that has been put on ice as well.  There are a lot of important things that we need to get done, and I hope we will take advantage of the next few weeks here to get them done as we continue our discussions about DACA and what to do to provide some assistance to these 690,000 young people who were brought here as minor children by their parents and are in somewhat of a box.  Earlier today, I went to the White House with several of my colleagues to meet with President Trump to discuss the four areas he has laid out to address the March 5 deadline relating to We are working through those four issues as I speak, trying to find a permanent solution for the DACA recipients and making sure that border security and interior enforcement is beefed up so that we don't have a repetition of this situation in the future.  We also are looking to limit chain migration and perhaps even to use some of the additional visas left over to accelerate the movement of people who have been playing by the rules and have been waiting in line, some for 10 or 20 years, just to rejoin their families here in the United  Finally, the President instructed us to deal with the diversity lottery visa program. There are about 50,000 visas that are literally provided based on a lottery, not because the immigrant has any special skills or qualities that would help enhance our country and help them contribute to our country but merely because they happened to win the lottery. I think it makes sense to reform that and perhaps use some of those additional visas, again, to deal with the backlog of people who have been waiting in line, patiently trying to immigrate to the country in a legal fashion--we ought to reward them, not continue to punish them--but also, to try to do what we might to maybe reassign some of those visas to merit-based immigration, people who have graduated with skills that we need here in the United States, including the STEM fields--science, technology, engineering, math. I think that makes a lot of sense.  Obviously, I am not going to decide this by myself. We are going to have to build a coalition of Democrats and Republicans, and I think we can. I think we can demonstrate our natural American compassion when it comes to immigrants. As I have said before, we are a country that has been built by immigrants. But the part we seem to always forget in this conversation on immigration is that we are also a nation of laws. That is what people have lost confidence in--that the Federal Government is committed to securing the[[Page S437]]border and enforcing our laws. If we do that, I think the American people will continue to welcome people through a legal immigration system who want to come here to America for a better life, to contribute, and to pursue their dream.  Our meeting at the White House was a productive conversation. It was just one of many. I know Senator Schumer visited with the President, I believe last Friday, on the immigration question. Our colleagues, Senator Durbin and Senator Graham, have been working with Senator Flake, Senator Menendez--I think Senator Gardner is part of that, as well, and I am probably leaving somebody out. But they have a bipartisan proposal that they took to the White Unfortunately, the President said that it wasn't a proposal he could support, so back we go to the drawing boards. Nobody pretends that this solution is easy, but it is one that we need to address.  I believe the President remains engaged and committed to finding a solution for these young adults who were brought here, as I said, through no fault of their own.  I especially remain committed to the 124,000 DACA recipients in my home State of It is no surprise that Texas has a large immigrant population because of our proximity to the border. But we are not alone, and many of these 690,000 DACA recipients are spread throughout every State in the country.  I have a personal interest in making sure we come up with a bipartisan solution for these young adults who face such uncertainty, but it is important that any solution we agree on contains two things. First is a DACA solution for these young adults, many of whom are huge contributors to our communities; indeed, these are our neighbors, and they work alongside us in our community. They deserve a thoughtful and compassionate solution that I hope we deliver.  I understand the plight they find themselves in. I have had a chance, like all of the Members of the Senate and the House, to meet many of these young people, and many of them are extraordinarily impressive. They have excelled in school. They have a lot of promise. But, unfortunately, they carry this burden of a status that does not permit them to stay in the country absent legislative action. So it is a precarious position, I am sure, to live every day not quite sure of what the future will mean.  But any solution we come up with over the next several weeks must also protect the 320 million Americans who already live in the country, in addition to these DACA recipients. What I mean by that is I think there needs to be some natural symmetry here. To the extent that we provide compassionate relief to these young people, I think we need to correspondingly assure the American people that we are actually serious about border security and enforcing our laws.  My State has had to bear the burden of a lot of the cost of border security, including placing law enforcement personnel along the border, because the Federal Government has simply failed to do its job over these many years. I know leaders in my State will be glad to see the Federal Government finally step up and accept their responsibility.  I know the President has talked frequently about a wall. Some people talk about tactical infrastructure. As a matter of fact, the President referred to the 2006 Secure Fence Act and said: Well, basically, we are talking about the same thing. The Border Patrol usually refers to this as tactical infrastructure.  My tutor on matters affecting border security is the current sector chief of the Rio Grande Valley sector, Manny Padilla, who has had a lot of experience in Arizona, Texas, and He says that each and every place along the border, each of which is unique in its own way, requires a combination of three things. He said it requires infrastructure--call it defense, call it a wall, call it a barrier; whatever you call it, that's one piece of it. But the second is technological; it is technology. It is an aerostat balloon in the sky, it is ground sensors, it is radar, it is a UAV--an unmanned aerial vehicle--but it basically is tied up in a system that is complemented by boots on the ground, by the Border Patrol, which is an essential component. So when Manny Padilla says that border security at each place along the border involves infrastructure, technology, and people, what he is saying is that we should leave to the experts how to deploy each of these items where it makes the most sense.  In Big Bend, out in West Texas, I have flown over the cliffs there that are 3,200 feet tall, that look down into the Rio Grande You don't need to build a fence there. You don't need to build a wall there. But if you go to San Diego, CA, or to some of the corridors or to the hard-to-control places on the Texas-Mexico border, maybe what you would prefer to do is to have a technological solution. Or in an urban area, where it is easy to dart across the border into the United States and melt into the urban landscape, maybe it makes sense to have fencing and tactical infrastructures and walls, where appropriate.  Being able to put in place the right mix of infrastructure, personnel, and technology will enable us to begin to regain the public's confidence on this issue because if we address the plight of these young adults but do not address the cause of the problem, which is illegal immigration--which is how they got here, being brought here by their parents--we will be back here arguing the same issue a decade from now.  I stand ready to work, and I am glad our Democratic colleagues have joined us today in reopening the government so we can work on finding a solution to our border security and immigration challenges. We are all working, and have been for months, on a path forward on DACA, and we will continue to do so now that the government has reopened. We can roll up our sleeves, work with the White House, work with our colleagues in the House and the Senate, and come up with solutions to the four items the President has identified for us.  I welcome ideas from our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, in both Chambers, and certainly from the President himself. Work on this issue will require an effort by all of us. Now it is up to the House to do its job, after we pass this continuing resolution for 3 weeks, and move us past the shutdown. Let's reopen the government and all get back to work.

Mentors provide our young people with guidance and support at a time when they begin to make important decisions that will affect their lives forever.  Mentoring programs have demonstrated positive impacts on youth across the country. Young people who meet regularly with their mentors are 46 percent less likely to use illegal drugs. Young people who are at risk for dropping out of high school but who had mentors are 55 percent more likely to enroll in college and 78 percent more likely to begin volunteering regularly in their own communities.

For the 18 months I was his mentor, I hope I made a difference; but, clearly, I know that Phillip made a difference in my life. So, it is a two-way street. Mentoring is not just helping those young people in our communities, but, I will tell you, it is a rewarding experience.  Sadly, still, there are an estimated 9 million young people throughout the United States who do not have mentors or positive adult role models as a part of their lives outside of their home. That is why I join with many of my colleagues in cosponsoring the resolution to make January National Mentoring We need to raise awareness of the significant roles that mentors play in the lives of young people across the United States, and we need to promote the creation and expansion of quality mentoring programs.

Lieutenant Colonel Gomez--Al--has set a standard of excellence in Idaho leaving a lasting, positive impression in the lives of many. For nearly 20 years, he has been an invaluable asset to our offices. In 2000, the Idaho congressional delegation began to hold annual service academy days. Service academy days are an opportunity to provide information to Idaho's best and brightest young men and women who are interested in attending our Nation's service academies. Al has been instrumental in setting up service academy days from the beginning while juggling deployment and other commitments. He has assisted numerous Idaho students with obtaining an exceptional educational and service opportunities available at the U.Military Academy at West He is responsible for incorporating the principle method into the delegation's nomination process, which has made a significant difference in the number of Idaho appointees to West In fact, he is considered the ``secret weapon'' in our delegation responsible for the high success rate of Idaho students receiving appointments to West For Lieutenant Colonel Gomez, his remarkable work has always been about his love for West Point and our country.

44,topic-id,1758,"Mr.President, before I got involved in politics, I spent 28 years in the private sector--small businesses, medium-sized businesses, a Fortune 25 company. The Fortune 25 company was Proctor & I spent 14 years with that company, and one of our assignments took us to mainland  I remember when we were offered the assignment and we took the job. At that time, we had a little boy, David, our first child. He was about 18 months old. Our second child, Annie, was just born, a new baby, several weeks old. We moved to That was in January of 1992.  We were part of leading the team that pioneered the operations for Proctor & Gamble back in the early days of the expansion of the company. Today, that geography, in fact, I think is P&G's second largest geography as it relates to sales in the world.  I remember we spent some time with other American families from around the world. There were American families. There were families from virtually every continent. These expats living over there would spend time going to orphanages.  We would go to these orphanages, usually on a Saturday, and we would hold these babies. Sometimes they had disabilities. Some of these babies never received human touch except for when these families--oftentimes American families--would go and hold them. On a positive note, it built in a conscience at that orphanage. They knew the Americans were coming on Things got cleaned up, the babies were getting a little better fed, and that was a good thing, but we were fighting on behalf of those who had life and weren't being treated very well.  I want to tell a couple of stories about things that happened while we were over there in I was running a large organization. I had many Chinese employees who were working for me. I remember one day one of my key managers came and he said: Steve, I need to go to the police station this afternoon.  I said: Oh, my word. Is there something wrong? Do you need some help?  He said: No, not really. My wife is pregnant, and we did not have permission from the authorities to get pregnant.  I said: Well, what does that mean?  He said: Well, that might mean they would terminate the pregnancy, require it.  At that moment, I looked at that employee--one of my key managers--and I said: I will do all I need to do, all I can, to ensure that we protect that baby, assuming you want to keep that baby.  And he said: My wife and I do want to keep that baby.  I said: What does help look like? How can I help you?  He said: Well, can I get a case of shampoo?  Now, we were making some well-known brands, including Head & Shoulders shampoo, Vidal Sassoon, We were making Crest toothpaste then and We had these world-class brands.  So I gave him a case of shampoo, and he went downtown to see the authorities. That case of shampoo saved the life of that baby, and they now have a beautiful grown daughter.  Another day I was at work and my phone rang. My wife Cindy called me.  She said: Steve, you will not believe it, but we just had twin baby girls dropped off on our doorstep in our apartment in  I said: Twin baby girls? Really?  At that point, we had three children. We went over to China with two. We had two more, in fact, while we were living over there. At that time, we had three.  She said: They are just infants.  The story behind that is, there was a mother who lived in the countryside who had one baby, a little girl, and she got pregnant with twins. Because of the one-child policy, she was in trouble, and she fled to the countryside. In fact, she was hiding in a remote location, and her mother would come out to feed the mother and the babies to keep them alive.  To make a long story short, we battled for a couple of years because there was no paper trail for these two beautiful Chinese babies. There was an American family who worked for Proctor & Gamble--one of my associates who wanted to adopt those babies.  I can tell you, there was another happy ending this time to that story. They are now two beautiful young women who are living in the United States as U.citizens.  These stories demonstrate the importance of saving one life at a time.  I share these stories because today is the 45th anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision on Roe v. I know there is a lot going on at the moment. The Senate just voted to reopen the government. The House will follow shortly. The President will sign that bill. Common sense has prevailed. We have the government open again. In fact, we are reauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance Program for 6 years.  Today, in the midst of all of these important issues we are dealing with, we cannot--we must not--forget that each year in the United States, over 600,000 babies lose their fight for life due to abortion. No case of shampoo is able to save them. They never got the chance to be adopted. That is over 600,000 babies a year; 60 million since the Supreme Court's decision on Roe v. Wade in 1973, 45 years ago today.  I told a little bit about David when I started my remarks, our oldest son of our four children. David was born in the United States before we moved to I think, as a parent--and if you[[Page S443]]are a parent, you remember that with new babies, when you take them to get their shots, it is much harder on mom and dad than it is on the baby. The baby is screaming and crying from the pain they are feeling, and you as a parent want to take away that pain. It is part of the natural response of any mom or dad.  Tragically, in this Nation, there are over 13,000 babies aborted that are over 20 weeks old. You see, at 20 weeks, that baby can yawn. It can make faces. It can stretch. The science tells us babies at 20 weeks of age can feel pain. So think about the pain a parent feels when a newborn receives a vaccination, and imagine the pain a baby at 20 weeks and beyond feels if it is being aborted. In fact, when they do in utero surgery at 20 weeks and beyond, they administer anesthesia to that baby.  We must continue to fight to protect life at all stages. Certainly, where we can take steps--bipartisan steps--to protect life, we should. I think we might be able to agree that banning elective abortions for babies who are 20 weeks or older--that is 5 months, well past the halfway stage of gestation--we should do that.  At the center of this debate is a tiny child, and that baby can't speak for itself yet. Those babies we fought for in China--whether it was that baby who was saved by a case of shampoo or those twin baby girls who were dropped off on our doorstep--couldn't speak and fight for their lives. The babies in the womb, their cries aren't audible. We at least could hear the cries of the twin baby girls. That is why we must act on their behalf.  Studies have shown that the vast majority of Americans are in favor of prohibiting late-term abortions, of stopping elective abortions after 20 weeks. In fact, if you poll millennials, that number is even higher. Why is that? I am not sure I have the precise answer, but one possibility is technology. If you have a smartphone, take it out. I can't do that because we are prohibited on the floor of the Senate, so I can't demonstrate it here, but if you have a smartphone or your computer or your iPad, go to Google and just type in ``20 weeks.'' That is all. You don't have to type in ``baby.'' Just type in ``20 weeks'' and look at what pops up. What you will see are images of what a baby looks like at 20 weeks. I think technology is now convincing millennials that what goes on in the womb at 20 weeks is a life; it is not just a piece of flesh. That is why we need to pass the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection  By the way, just last week the Department of Health and Human Services announced a new Conscience and Religious Freedom Division within its Office of Civil The administration is committed--and I am grateful they are committed--to enforcing existing conscience laws. I don't believe anyone should be forced to participate in an activity like abortion that violates their conscience.  I am grateful for this administration's commitment to protecting life and the rights of conscience, and I stand ready to work with them and anyone here on either side of the aisle to advance the cause for life.  I have always believed that people will believe those things they discover for themselves. As a parent, you know that you can teach your children, and you can say things to your children, but ultimately it is a process of their discovering something for themselves before they really will believe something. I think that is what is going on right now with millennials and the issue of late-term abortions and the issues of life, because technology is showing all of us--with the incredible clarity of ultrasounds and getting visibility of what is going on inside and that amazing miracle of life--that, indeed, it is a life.  Since the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade, 60 million babies have lost their lives to abortion. We can honor their memories by acting to end this atrocity.  I very much look forward to seeing the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act come to the floor of the We may have disagreements about when life begins, but let's all agree that we should stop late-term abortions. At 20 weeks is when that little baby can feel pain. I think that is a reasonable place to draw the line to get bipartisan support going forward. Only seven countries in the world allow late-term abortions--seven countries. The United States is on the same list as North  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this most important legislation.

63,topic-id,1368,"Madam President, I am grateful for the comments the Senator from Louisiana just shared. He is a physician. I am not a physician. I am a chemical engineer, and I believe it is important, as the Senator from Louisiana believes, that we look at science when we have this debate about abortion.  Our Nation loses anywhere between 13,000 and 18,000 children a year to late-term abortion. The numbers of children aborted overall are well over 600,000. The focus on the debate today and on the vote coming up this evening is on late-term abortion.  I remember a few months ago having a discussion with a young man, a father of several children, about abortion. We were just two guys chatting, having a snack in the kitchen. He brought up a question--he didn't come from a pro-life perspective--and he asked my views.  He said: Let me ask you a question. At what point should an abortion be legal? We took it out to the very end of gestation. If the baby is literally ready to be delivered, should an abortion be allowed at that moment? He said: Of course not.  Well, let's back it up a day. What about if you are 8 months and 28 days, should abortion be allowed in that situation? Well, of course not. That is way too close to the actual date of giving birth.  So we kind of moved upstream toward conception. So where do you draw the line?  I believe that life begins at conception because that is that magical moment when a life begins, when unique DNA is created, but I realize it is a very contentious issue in our So one line we can draw is at 20 weeks, and I will talk about why I think 20 weeks is a place we can start to get bipartisan support to stop late-term abortions.  In fact, this young man I was chatting with teared up, and he said: Steve, you realize that when we were pregnant with one of our daughters--they have five children--at about 10 or 12 weeks they had a test run because it looked like there may be an abnormality in the baby and the doctor recommended an abortion.  He said: What is the alternative? We can wait a few more weeks, when we have a better idea of what is going on there with that little baby, but it puts the mother at perhaps a greater risk.  They decided to wait a few more weeks. A few weeks later when they came back with the test, the baby came back clear, and they now have a healthy, beautiful young girl who is 5 years old. With tears in his eyes, he said: I am so glad we chose not to abort; that we chose life.  At 20 weeks, babies have 10 fingers and 10 toes. They can suck their thumb. They can yawn. They can stretch. They can make faces. Science also shows these babies are capable of feeling pain.  I became a first-time dad 28 years ago. I still remember taking David to his first well-baby appointment, when Cindy and I would go to the pediatrician and get those well-baby checks. When they would give them shots--I think the hardest part as a parent is to see that nurse or doctor give a shot to your little one. Those cries of pain were excruciating for Cindy and for me. He doesn't remember it. We remember it. It may indeed hurt us more than it hurt him at the time, but he felt pain.  My heart breaks for those thousands of babies who are able to feel pain as they are losing their life to abortion. Our ears may be deaf to their cries physically, but we don't have to live in ignorance, not when research, not when the science, not when common sense shows that these unborn children can feel pain.  There is a reason unborn babies are given anesthesia with fetal surgery. That is why we must pass the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection It is unconscionable as a nation we are allowing unborn children as old as 20 weeks--5 months--well beyond halfway of the 9-month gestation period--that we allow them to be killed today in this country.  In fact, do a Google search for ``20 weeks.'' You don't have to type in ``baby.'' Just type in ``20 weeks.'' If you are watching this and have a smartphone, a computer, type in ``20 weeks'' in the Google search bar there and hit search or enter. Then, take a look at the pictures that come up that match the simple term ``20 weeks.'' This is one of the pictures you will see when you Google that.  I believe there is a principle that people believe what they discover for themselves. What is happening right now is--because of technology, because of the precision and the clarity of ultrasounds today, what we can see now in the womb is incredible. It is no wonder the attitudes of millennials--those ages 18 to 24--in the last 6 years are becoming increasingly more pro-life, in fact up 9 points, from 44 percent to 53 percent. I think part of the reason is in the hands of their smartphone. When you take a look at the images, how can you say that is not a baby? That is a 20-week baby. We are on a horrible list of just seven countries that allow elective abortions after 20 weeks. China and North Korea join the United States on that list.  Before I got involved in politics and public service, I worked in the private sector for 28 years. One of the companies I worked for was Proctor & While at Proctor & Gamble, I was asked to go to China to help launch operations there to produce and sell products, Americans brands, to the Chinese consumer.  I had a large operation. One day, one of my managers--a young man, Chinese, wonderful, very bright, very capable, one of our future stars. He and his wife were both P&G employees, both  He said: Steve, I need to go to the police station this afternoon. I said: Well, is there something wrong? He goes: Well, no. It is going to be Then he kind of looked away.  I said: But you are asking for time off of work to go to the police station. Is there something I can help you with or is there something wrong?  He said: Well, my wife and I did not have permission from the police to get pregnant--with the one-child policy then.  He said: We just discovered that she is pregnant.  I said: Well, do you want to keep the baby?  He said: Oh, we want to keep that baby. We are very excited about it. But we won't be allowed to keep that baby.  I said: What can I do?  At this moment, we were focused on saving that baby.  He said to me: What might help is a case of shampoo.  We were there producing brands like Pantene, Vidal Sassoon, Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent. I arranged to get a case of shampoo and gave it to him.  He came back the next day, with a smile on his face, and said: We got the problem resolved.  They became parents of a beautiful little girl who today is an amazing young woman.  As an American citizen, I believe in our founding principle that all men and[[Page S539]]women are endowed by their Creator--with a capital ``C''--with certain unalienable rights, and among those are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  As a person of faith, I believe--and those who are people of faith--we are called to help the most vulnerable in our society.

506,topic-id,249,"Mr.President, this week I have the honor of recognizing Sheridan School Superintendent Micheal Wetherbee for his commitment to students' success. Mike was recently honored with the 2017 Montana Association of Agricultural Educators' Administrator of the Year award, as well as the 2017 Montana Association of Career and Technical Education's Administrator of the Year award.  Mike came out of retirement to serve as superintendent when he saw there was a need in the community. When STEM and STEAM learning were just getting a foothold in education, Mike wanted to be sure the school would be on the frontlines. With buy-in from the community, Sheridan Schools are becoming well known for putting kids on a path to success through hands-on learning and experiences. In fact, high school students are now teaching fourth graders how to code. In Mike's own words, ``We've got it going on academically.''  When asked about the awards, Mike is much more interested in talking about what the school is doing to build a great FFA program and thriving business department. What excites him the most about these programs, which he has been recognized for, are the opportunities they provide students to leave Sheridan High School and become successful in other places. Mike, who grew up in Montana, understands what service to the community means, and he is doing it every day by building up the students in Sheridan schools.  Thanks, Mike, for your continued work to shape Montana kids into the bright leaders of Montana's future.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-30-pt1-PgS575-2.txt,2138,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2018.0,30.0,January

790,topic-id,2921,"Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar 293, 2152.  The PRESIDING The clerk will report the bill by title.  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:       A bill (2152) to amend title 18, United States Code, to      provide for assistance for victims of child pornography, and      for other purposes.  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill, which had been reported from the Committee on the Judiciary, with amendments, as follows:  (The parts of the bill intended to be stricken are shown in boldface brackets and the parts of the bill intended to be inserted are shown in italics.)       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT       This Act may be cited as the ``Amy, Vicky, and Andy Child      Pornography Victim Assistance Act of 2017''.     2.       Congress finds the following:       (1) The demand for child pornography harms children because      it drives production, which involves severe and often      irreparable child sexual abuse and exploitation.       (2) The harms caused by child pornography begin, but do not      end, with child sex abuse because child pornography is a      permanent record of that abuse and trafficking in those      images compounds the harm to the child.       (3) In Paroline v. United States (2014), the Supreme Court      recognized that ``every viewing of child pornography is a      repetition of the victim's abuse''.       (4) The American Professional Society on the Abuse of      Children has stated that for victims of child pornography,      ``the sexual abuse of the child, the memorialization of that      abuse which becomes child pornography, and its subsequent      distribution and viewing become psychologically intertwined      and each compound the harm suffered by the child-victim''.       (5) Victims suffer continuing and grievous harm as a result      of knowing that a large, indeterminate number of individuals      have viewed and will in the future view images of their      childhood sexual abuse. Harms of this sort are a major reason      that child pornography is outlawed.       (6) The unlawful collective conduct of every individual who      reproduces, distributes, or possesses the images of a      victim's childhood sexual abuse plays a part in sustaining      and aggravating the harms to that individual victim. Multiple      actors independently commit intentional crimes that combine      to produce an indivisible injury to a victim.       (7) It is the intent of Congress that victims of child      pornography be fully compensated for all the harms resulting      from every perpetrator who contributes to their anguish.[[Page S472]]     Such an aggregate causation standard reflects the nature of      child pornography and the unique ways that it actually harms      victims.     3. DETERMINING       (a) Determining Restitution.--Section 2259(b) of title 18,      United States Code, is amended--       (1) in paragraph (1)--       (A) by striking ``The order'' and inserting ``Except as      provided in paragraph (2), the order''; and       (B) by striking ``as determined by the court pursuant to      paragraph (2)'' after ``of the victim's losses'';       (2) by striking paragraph (3);       (3) by redesignating paragraph (2) as paragraph (3); and       (4) by inserting after paragraph (1) the following:       ``(2) Restitution for trafficking in child pornography.--If      the defendant was convicted for trafficking in child      pornography, the order of restitution under this section      shall direct the defendant to pay the victim (through the      appropriate court mechanism) an amount of restitution      determined by the court as follows:       ``(A) Determining the full amount of a victim's losses.--     The court shall determine the full amount of the victim's      losses that were incurred or are reasonably projected to be      incurred by the victim as a result of the trafficking in      child pornography.       ``(B) Determining a restitution amount.--After completing      the determination required under subparagraph (A), the court      shall enter an order of restitution against the defendant in      favor of the victim in an amount which is [not less than      $3000 and not greater than 1 percent of the full amount of      the victim's losses when the full amount of a victim's losses      are greater than $300,000.]  between $3,000 and 1 percent of      the full amount of the victim's losses.       ``(C) Termination of payment.--A victim's total aggregate      recovery pursuant to this section shall not exceed the full      amount of the victim's demonstrated losses. After the victim      has received restitution in the full amount of the victim's      losses as measured by the greatest amount of such losses      found in any case involving that victim that has resulted in      a final restitution order under this section, the liability      of each defendant who is or has been ordered to pay      restitution for such losses to that victim shall be      terminated. The court may direct the victim to provide      information concerning the amount of restitution the victim      has been paid in other cases for the same losses.''.

In the case'';       (4) by inserting after ``or any other person appointed as      suitable by the court,'' the following: ``may assume the      crime victim's rights under this section,''; and       (5) by inserting before paragraph (4), as so designated,      the following:       ``(1) Child pornography production.--For purposes of this      section and section 2259A, the term `child pornography      production' means conduct proscribed by [section 2251,      section 2251A] subsections (a) through (c) of section 2251,      section 2252A(g) [if at least one of the offenses listed in      this section is charged as part of a series of offenses] (in      cases in which the series of felony violations involves at      least 1 of the violations listed in this section), section      2260(a), or any offense under chapter 109A or chapter 117      that involved the production of child pornography, as defined      in section 2256.       ``(2) Full amount of the victim's losses.--For purposes of      this section, the term `full amount of the victim's losses'      includes any costs incurred, or reasonably projected to be      incurred in the future, by the victim, and in the case of a      trafficking in child pornography conviction, as a proximate      result of all trafficking in child pornography offenses      involving the same victim, including--       ``(A) medical services relating to physical, psychiatric,      or psychological care;       ``(B) physical and occupational therapy or rehabilitation;       ``(C) necessary transportation, temporary housing, and      child care expenses;       ``(D) lost income;       ``(E) attorneys' fees, as well as other costs incurred; and       ``(F) any other relevant losses incurred by the victim.       ``(3) Trafficking in child pornography.--For purposes of      this section and section 2259A, the term `trafficking in      child pornography' means conduct proscribed by section      2251(d), 2251A, 2252, 2252A, section 2252A(g) [if at least      one of the offenses listed in this section is charged as part      of a series of offenses] (in cases in which the series of      felony violations exclusively involves violations listed in      this section), or section 2260(b) [)].''.       (c) Clerical Amendment.--Section 1593(b)(3) of title 18,      United States Code, is amended by striking ``section      2259(b)(3)'' and inserting ``section 2259(c)(2)''.     4.

791,topic-id,2813,"Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported amendments be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.  The PRESIDING Without objection, it is so ordered.  The committee-reported amendments were agreed to.  The bill (2152), as amended, was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, was read the third time, and passed, as follows:                                2152       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT       This Act may be cited as the ``Amy, Vicky, and Andy Child      Pornography Victim Assistance Act of 2017''.     2.       Congress finds the following:       (1) The demand for child pornography harms children because      it drives production, which involves severe and often      irreparable child sexual abuse and exploitation.       (2) The harms caused by child pornography begin, but do not      end, with child sex abuse because child pornography is a      permanent record of that abuse and trafficking in those      images compounds the harm to the child.       (3) In Paroline v. United States (2014), the Supreme Court      recognized that ``every viewing of child pornography is a      repetition of the victim's abuse''.       (4) The American Professional Society on the Abuse of      Children has stated that for victims of child pornography,      ``the sexual abuse of the child, the memorialization of that      abuse which becomes child pornography, and its subsequent      distribution and viewing become psychologically intertwined      and each compound the harm suffered by the child-victim''.       (5) Victims suffer continuing and grievous harm as a result      of knowing that a large, indeterminate number of individuals      have viewed and will in the future view images of their      childhood sexual abuse. Harms of this sort are a major reason      that child pornography is outlawed.       (6) The unlawful collective conduct of every individual who      reproduces, distributes, or possesses the images of a      victim's childhood sexual abuse plays a part in sustaining      and aggravating the harms to that individual victim. Multiple      actors independently commit intentional crimes that combine      to produce an indivisible injury to a victim.       (7) It is the intent of Congress that victims of child      pornography be fully compensated for all the harms resulting      from every perpetrator who contributes to their anguish. Such      an aggregate causation standard reflects the nature of child      pornography and the unique ways that it actually harms      victims.     3. DETERMINING       (a) Determining Restitution.--Section 2259(b) of title 18,      United States Code, is amended--       (1) in paragraph (1)--       (A) by striking ``The order'' and inserting ``Except as      provided in paragraph (2), the order''; and       (B) by striking ``as determined by the court pursuant to      paragraph (2)'' after ``of the victim's losses'';       (2) by striking paragraph (3);       (3) by redesignating paragraph (2) as paragraph (3); and       (4) by inserting after paragraph (1) the following:       ``(2) Restitution for trafficking in child pornography.--If      the defendant was convicted for trafficking in child      pornography, the order of restitution under this section[[Page S474]]     shall direct the defendant to pay the victim (through the      appropriate court mechanism) an amount of restitution      determined by the court as follows:       ``(A) Determining the full amount of a victim's losses.--     The court shall determine the full amount of the victim's      losses that were incurred or are reasonably projected to be      incurred by the victim as a result of the trafficking in      child pornography.       ``(B) Determining a restitution amount.--After completing      the determination required under subparagraph (A), the court      shall enter an order of restitution against the defendant in      favor of the victim in an amount which is between $3,000 and      1 percent of the full amount of the victim's losses.       ``(C) Termination of payment.--A victim's total aggregate      recovery pursuant to this section shall not exceed the full      amount of the victim's demonstrated losses. After the victim      has received restitution in the full amount of the victim's      losses as measured by the greatest amount of such losses      found in any case involving that victim that has resulted in      a final restitution order under this section, the liability      of each defendant who is or has been ordered to pay      restitution for such losses to that victim shall be      terminated.

Mr.Speaker, America is a great nation, and tonight we continue to celebrate that fact. But we do know that great things don't just happen on their own. If we take a serious look through the pages of history, we will see the blood, the sweat, and the tears of many people. Some of those people came on cruise ships, and some came on slave ships. But regardless of the foundation on which our journey in America began, many were there helping to build what we now know as a great nation.  Mr.Speaker, the American worker is intertwined in the moral fabric of our great society. As America began to grow as an industrialized society, so did its workforce and the need to develop fair and equitable workplace standards.  I joined the Orlando Police Department in 1984, and on my first day of orientation, I joined the union. I joined a great department, and I wanted to do my part to keep it a great department. I proudly joined the union, and I clearly understood--and it appeared at that time that those in management also understood--that the union was working hard to ensure that employees, both sworn and civilian, worked in a safe work environment, were paid fair wages, and were fairly compensated in the event of death on the job.  I was an active member of the union, and when I moved to the management ranks, I met regularly with union leadership to ensure we continued to have a healthy work environment, fair wages, meaningful benefits, and safe working conditions. That has been and continues to be the work of American unions.  ",CREC-2018-01-29-pt1-PgH661-2.txt,2320,10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE YELLOW RIBBON REINTEGRATION PROGRAM,2018.0,29.0,January

627,topic-id,2465,"Mr.President, first of all, I wish to thank my colleague from I particularly liked your speech about DACA and the I have given a speech very similar to that a few times on the floor. Thank you. I do believe you. I believe you really care, and I am hoping we will both have a chance to demonstrate that very soon. So thank you for those kind words.  We think back about our memories as kids growing up. Today is Sunday, and I remember so many Sundays when I was a little boy. Sunday was our family day. Dad liked to get up early, and Mom liked to sleep in. So Dad would get up for 7:30 mass in East Louis, IL, and I would jump out of bed, too, because I knew that after mass, Dad and I would go out to some greasy spoon restaurant and get eggs and bacon. It was something I looked forward to. Then we would stop at a bakery and pick up a doughnut for We would get home in time to see her wake up, give her her doughnut and coffee, and then she would be off to 11 o'clock mass at Elizabeth's. Then we would anxiously await her return because the big event was in the afternoon.  The big event was Ann Durbin's fried chicken Sunday dinner. Without exception, that was the delicacy and banquet of my childhood, that Sunday afternoon fried chicken. She had her own special recipe, and she didn't like to share it. I know it included Lawry's seasoned salt and some garlic powder. But the secret to her recipe was bacon grease. She fried that chicken in bacon grease. I apologize to all the nutritionists in the world, but it was delicious, and I am still standing. I looked forward to it because we all gathered as a family. We set the table, and we would eat the fried chicken. We stuck around in the afternoon, and we were together.  That is what we need this Sunday in the U.We need to get our family together--Democrats, Republicans, and That is what is missing at this point, because when I listened to the speech by Senator Cornyn--and I do respect him--there are so many things we agree on. There are so many things we understand to be priorities.  I want to set the record straight. There were some words said about Senator Schumer's opening remarks. The reason Senator Schumer continues to refer to the ``Trump shutdown'' is because last Friday, Senator Schumer was invited by the President to come for lunch. This was before the critical vote on the continuing resolution and the funding of our government. This really was the first opportunity for Senator Schumer and the President,[[Page S400]]face-to-face, to try to reach an agreement.  The good news reported back to me by Senator Schumer afterward was that there was an understanding of what we were going to do on a myriad of issues, including the controversial issue of immigration and Dreamers and DACA, and what we would do about the wall. We knew what the President--some of us don't think the wall is such a great idea at all, but we know what the President thinks, and when you get down to a compromise to save the government and to move the Nation forward, you have to give, and Senator Schumer put the wall literally on that luncheon table. He was prepared to go further than any Democrat in leadership has ever gone. He told the President, and then he came back to report to us: I think we have an agreement. I think we are there.  Within 2 hours after that lunch, he got a call from the President, who said: It is over. No agreement. We are not going forward.  He was surprised and disappointed, and I was, too, because I thought we were going to avoid the mess we find ourselves in today. But it wasn't a big surprise because I had a similar experience with the President just the week before.  It was January 9 when I was invited, with 24 other Members of the House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans, to an amazing meeting. It was in the Cabinet Room of the White House, called by the We came together, and the President did something I have never seen before. He told the television cameras to stick around, and they sure did, for 55 minutes, as we debated the whole question of the Dream Act and  I think the reason for this debate is very obvious. We are facing a deadline created by President Trump when it comes to protecting at least 800,000 young people in the United These are young people who took advantage of President Obama's Executive order called They submitted themselves to a criminal background check, they filed the fee of about $500, they waited patiently, and about 800,000 ended up winning protection under  President Trump announced on September 5 of last year: I am ending this program. I am ending this protection officially on March 5.  In the meantime, we have seen thousands of these young people losing their protected status. They are literally beside themselves.  On September 5, the President made the announcement that March 5 was the termination date, and for 4\1/2\ months, Congress has done nothing, despite the President's plea to us--challenge to us--write a law. Show me that you can come together and write a law to solve this problem. We have done nothing. There has been not a single hearing in the committee that we serve on, the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is the committee of jurisdiction. I shouldn't say no hearings--I believe there was one hearing, but no bill, no markup, no vote, nothing on the calendar from our committee.  So a number of us came together--three Democratic Senators and three Republican Senators--and said: We have to do something about this. This has a deadline, and at the end of this deadline, lives will be in danger, the lives of these young people. So we wrote a bill. It wasn't easy. The President had challenged us to come up with a bill at his meeting on January 9. He literally said: If you pass a bill, I will sign it.  I will take the political heat, not the Republicans, not the I will take the heat.  We came back here after that meeting, the six of us gathered again, and said: We have to do it, and we have to do it now--and we did. We reached an agreement on a bill. Senator Lindsey Graham, myself, Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey, and Senator Bennet of Colorado, we all came together, and we agreed on it. It wasn't easy. There are parts of it I hate. I gave on some areas that hurt me personally, and so did they, but that is why we are sent here--to compromise and come up with solutions.  So we anxiously called the Two days after our meeting on January 11, I called him because he had invited me to, and darned if he didn't call me back in 10 minutes. I couldn't believe it. I said: Mr.President, we have a bipartisan agreement that hits all of the four elements you wanted us to hit, and Senator Graham is going to come down to the White House to explain it to you. He said: I don't want to slow-walk this. He said: Let's get this done.  Then I got a call: The President would like you to accompany Senator I am not going to go into details of what happened next when we got there. They have been widely reported. I am just not going to return to that whole experience, but it is fair to say the President rejected our bipartisan approach in its entirety. At this point, I was disappointed and a little bit--I was stunned because he had asked us to do just what we had done.  Here we have two examples, both with Senator Schumer and the President and the White House and my experience with the President and the White House on this contentious issue of DACA, where the President literally said: There is no agreement. We are walking away.  So when Senator Schumer comes to the floor and says the President bears at least some responsibility, if not the major responsibility, had we reached agreement those 2 days, had we stuck with it, had we come back and met, had we reached the final consensus, a bipartisan agreement, we wouldn't be in the mess we are in today. That is why Senator Schumer makes that reference.  I would like to go back to a couple other issues before I conclude; that is, let's make it clear. When it comes to respect and love for our military, it is not a partisan matter. Both parties do. Each of us has seen good Democratic soldiers and good Republican soldiers give their lives for this country. They weren't fighting for a political party; they were fighting for our flag. I believe both parties love this country and both parties respect our military, and we don't want to hurt them in any way.  Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri the other night offered a unanimous consent request to make sure there was no interruption in pay for the members of our military during this debate and this government shutdown. Unfortunately, Senator McConnell objected. I understand the political strategy, but let's use that as a clear illustration that both sides--both sides--should stand behind our military, regardless.  At the heart of this debate is a 4-week continuing resolution. If we were asking for a grade on our budget efforts this year, it certainly would not be a passing grade. We are one-third of the way into this fiscal year--over 100 days into this fiscal year--and we have yet to produce a budget. It is not easy. It wasn't easy when we Democrats were in control, and we failed, too, but the Republicans in control of the House and the Senate failed to produce a budget.  I am on the Appropriations We have spent more hours--particularly our staff has spent more hours--putting together a good bill for the defense of this country, getting ready to bring it to the floor, getting ready to vote for it, and sitting there and waiting now for 6 months or more. There is no excuse for these continuing resolutions.  The Department of Defense came out the other night and said: Stop doing this to us. You are hurting our national defense by not having a budget and just doing temporary spending measures after temporary measures.  The Secretary of Navy said he believes that continuing resolutions from Congress have cost the U.Navy $4 billion. Four billion taxpayer dollars have been wasted because we can't even agree on the defense of our country, for goodness' sake. So I wouldn't take any great pride in a 4-week continuing resolution. I noticed my colleague from Texas Senator Cornyn referred to them as lousy and miserable. Put me down for the same remarks. I couldn't agree more.  Why are we facing this moment of truth in the Senate today? Because there is a lot at stake. We need to roll up our sleeves and do what we were elected to do. We need to pass a budget for this country. We need to take care of this looming DACA deadline that President Trump created--the March 5[[Page S401]]deadline was his creation--6 weeks away. This notion that, well, we will not do it this week; maybe we will get around to it next week--if you have watched this empty Chamber as much as I have, you realize it takes a lot to get us to roll up our sleeves and get down to business, and that is what we need to do.  One of the Senators said this is about the Democrats saving face. It isn't. It is about much more. It is about saving the CHIP program, the health insurance program which was allowed to lapse for 4 months that provides health insurance for 9 million kids. It is also about saving the community healthcare clinics, which provide the lion's share of the benefits to the kids covered by CHIP programs. That is not included in the It has to be. We have to reauthorize it. I can't believe we are even debating it. It literally is the source of healthcare for millions of It is about dealing with the pension issue we have in the Midwest and beyond, one that we believe needs to be addressed forthrightly. It is about DACA, which I have talked about earlier. It is about healthcare insurance.  We are slow to come to realize that, unless we do something significantly, more Americans will lose health insurance and the premiums will go up. I want to give kudos to Senator Lamar Alexander, a Republican from Tennessee; Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from the State of Washington; Senator Collins, a Republican from Maine; and Senator Nelson, a Democrat from They have come up with a plan they want to include in this measure which can help to keep health insurance premiums affordable. On either side of the aisle, who doesn't want that?  Disaster relief. I can't wait to vote for disaster relief for Texas, Florida, California, Puerto Rico, and for the Virgin My State has received that kind of relief in the past, and I want to stand up and help other That is something that should be included in the CR, and it is not.  Finally, let's get this right for the Department of Let's give General Mattis, the Secretary of Defense, the resources he needs to spend money wisely in defense of this country, to make sure we never come in second in war. It is a long litany of things that are being postponed and postponed and postponed again. For goodness' sake, let's not postpone any further.  I will just close. I think it is time for an eastern coast chicken family dinner in the U.It is time for this family to come together after perhaps some fried chicken--which I will be happy to provide--and sit down and work this out. We can do it. We can do it together, and I hope we will soon.  This moment of truth is a moment of challenge--not just to the Democrats but to the Republicans, to the President, to all of us--to do what we were elected to do.  I yield the floor.

923,topic-id,2273,"Mr.President, we have 14 days, by our own established deadline, to do something about the Dreamers issue--about  Why do we find ourselves at this place? Because on September 5 of last year, President Trump, as well as Attorney General Sessions, announced the end of the DACA protection program as of March 5 this year. The 780,000 young people who were undocumented in the United States and who came here as children were given a chance by President Obama to stay legally, be able to work legally, and not fear deportation. For the most part, they are students and workers who are a vital part of the community, and they have done good things in their lives and promised to do even more.  This issue was created by the decision made by President Trump to put an end to this program. He made that decision. He also challenged He said: If we are going to end this Executive order, do something. Pass a law.

I have worked with five of my colleagues--three Democrats and three Republicans--to craft a bill that we believe addresses the issue in a fair way. Compromise was included in that bill--some that I didn't like at all, but that is the nature of a compromise and bipartisanship.  We presented this bill to our colleagues, and we also attended a meeting on January 9 with President Trump in which he addressed this issue. Here it was, 4 months after he issued the challenge to Congress, and he basically told us: It is time to get this done. He said to us--and this was televised, so you can check my remarks if there is any question about what I am saying. He said to us, basically: Send me a bill, and I will sign it. I will take the political heat on this issue.  Then the Republican leader on the House side, Kevin McCarthy said that it ought to include the following four elements: first, DACA and the Dreamers; second, border security; third, family reunification issues; and finally, the visa lottery system, the diversity system that we had established years ago.  That is when I sat down and said to my fellow Senators--Democrats and Republicans, our little gang: We have to get this done. The President has challenged us, and he said that he is prepared to move forward if we can come up with a response. So we did. We came to an agreement among ourselves--the six Senators who had been meeting.  We presented it to the President through Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a Republican, on January 11. He rejected it.  So as of today, we really don't have a bill before us, and we are starting anew with a conversation about what to do to meet the President's challenge but equally, if not more importantly, to say to the 780,000 young people and those who were eligible to apply: This is what your future will be.  We have had our ups and downs, and it was a rocky weekend just a few days ago relative to funding the government and whether we were going to take up this issue. I thought it ended on a positive note when Senator McConnell came to the floor and made an express promise to this Chamber--to Members on both sides of the aisle. I am going to try to characterize it, and I think this is accurate. Check the Record, if you don't think I say it quite right. But he said: If we have not reached an agreement on this issue by February 8, at that point, we will open a process on the floor of the Senate with what he characterized as a level playing field and an open amendment process. That, to me, is an opportunity, but I hope we can avoid that opportunity and reach an agreement, as he asked us to, by February 8. We have 14 days left. I would like to involve the House in this conversation so that we might reach a common agreement, but unfortunately, they are on recess this week. Those of us who were sitting and talking about it don't have a chance to get together with them. However, I am heartened by the fact that a number of my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle are going to join a number on the Democratic side of the aisle this afternoon and start what we hope will be a productive process to reach a bipartisan agreement and do it in a timely way, as suggested and challenged by Senator To achieve this goal, I think we understand we are going to have to be mindful of one another and mindful of the realities we face. There are a lot of issues relative to immigration. The list is pretty lengthy. There are important issues that should be considered.[[Page S479]]  It is unrealistic to think we are going to propose or even agree on a bipartisan and comprehensive immigration bill in 14 days. What we can do is address the President's challenge dealing with DACA and those DACA-eligible, so-called What we can do is address border security in a realistic and honest way.  I took a look this morning at some of the publications of the Department of Homeland Security to try to get an understanding of what our challenge is when it comes to the undocumented of the United Where do they come from? How do they come to this country and how do they stay in this country if they don't have legal authority to do so?  For example, the Department of Homeland Security tells us that each year 50 million--50 million--visitors come to the United States from visa waiver countries. Those who are visiting from those countries have not gone through an application process to visit the United They carry a passport from a country we have an understanding or agreement with that they can travel back and forth. Think about the European countries, for example, where we can travel extensively back and forth between there and the United  Out of those 50 million, about 1.5 percent end up staying longer than they are supposed to. We end up with hundreds and thousands of undocumented people here by visa overstays. Forty percent of all those who are in this country undocumented came here by visa overstays. There is no wall you can build on the border of Mexico and Canada that is going to solve that problem. This is a problem that really relies on technology, which we should be investing in and which we can invest in on a bipartisan basis.  So if your true goal is the reduction of the undocumented in America and trying to make sure there is legal status for as many as possible and you are looking at the incremental growth each year, you wouldn't look to the border first. You would look to the visa overstays first. Those are the ones who are slipping through the system, who should be policed and monitored with new technology.  We have talked about it for decades. It is time to do something about it but also to concede, as I said, that no wall is going to stop that problem--no wall is going to solve that problem.  When I take a look at the asylum issue, which I wouldn't say I am amused, but I would say I am interested--it is one that is always raised by the Department of Homeland Security; those who present themselves in the United States at the border or otherwise and suggest they have a credible fear in returning to their home country. It is interesting to look at the statistics because we find out that even though there may be this notion that they are primarily from Mexico, they are not. They are primarily from countries in the Northern Triangle of Central There is also a large contingent each year from  So if we are talking about the asylum issue and not addressing all of the countries who are the major suppliers of those seeking asylum in the United States, then we are not talking about it in honest terms or in its entirety as we should.  I might mention that China, along with 22 other countries, does not even have an agreement with the United States in terms of deportation, according to the report from the Department of Homeland There is a lot we can do there to make sure China and those countries comply with the United States when we say we are deporting someone from your country that we find to be a danger to us, and rather than incarcerate them here, you get to have them back. They are yours. They shouldn't be here in the first place. When we talk about dealing with the issues of the undocumented, the issues of security in this country, many of these are not going to be solved with a wall. They are going to be solved if we deal with technology and look in honest terms and count real numbers about those coming from different parts of the world.  I also want to address this issue about unaccompanied children coming to our border. I understand that challenge. The numbers have risen dramatically in prior years, and we have to take it seriously.  I followed some of those children from the border to a protective gathering they have in Chicago in a place called Heartland Alliance, and I went in to meet them. I was shocked when I went into the cafeteria to see that some of these children were as young as 6 years of age, 6 years old presenting themselves at a border of the United What circumstances could have led to that? It is possible it was a smuggler who either threatened or exploited the family and ended up with a child, pushed them across the border into the arms of one of our Border Patrol agents. That is possible. That is something we should do everything we can to stop. That is an exploitation of that child. That child is likely to be abused in the process of this immigration, and it is something we ought to do everything we can to discourage, but to simply turn away children at the border is a dangerous thing. What are we going to do with that 6-year-old from Honduras or El Salvador or Guatemala at the border when they establish, through a written note or whatever, that there is a credible fear for them returning to their country? Do we ignore it? Do we turn them back to their country regardless? We better be careful. Awful things can happen.  What do we do with the 12-year-old or 13-year-old girl who is a victim of rape and sexual assault in one of those countries, who was sent to the United States and our border because her parents believed she was about to be raped again or killed? Do we turn her back or send her back and ignore the reality?  I commend to my colleagues and others who follow this debate an article that was written in the New Yorker last week by Sarah It was entitled ``When Deportation Is A Death Sentence.'' She followed the terrible story of a young woman who was undocumented, who was stopped, and who said over and over again: If you send me back to Mexico, that husband of mine is going to kill me. There have been protective orders issued. He is a dangerous man. She was sent back anyway, and she was killed.  These are complex situations not easily answered with the common definition that anyone who presents themselves to the border with such credible fears is going to be turned away without any consideration about the merits of that claim. We have to be careful. Human lives hang in the balance. Our reputation as a caring and principled Nation hangs in the balance as well.  We need to do the right thing. Stop the exploitation when it occurs but also be mindful and sensitive to the fact that many people who do present themselves seeking asylum are truly leaving desperate circumstances and trying to find a safe place for themselves and their families.  So the conversation continues this afternoon, on a bipartisan basis, among the Senators in the U.Senate to meet the President's challenge, to accept that challenge, and to come up with a bipartisan measure.  I don't know the position of the President of the United States now. I couldn't express it after the experience we had a couple of weeks ago. I don't know where he stands. He has never issued anything by way of a suggestive piece of legislation. We haven't heard from him.  So we have to do our part. We have to meet our responsibility in the Senate, hope the House does the same, and at some point the White House would join us in solving this problem, which the President actually created on September 5 of last year.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

1048,topic-id,611,"Mr.President, thank you very much, and I thank the majority leader for this opportunity.  Let me thank my friend, my colleague, and our leader on the Democratic side for his passionate personal commitment to this issue involving the Dreamers and He has been by my side, and I have been inspired by his leadership from the start.  Let me thank my colleagues. So many of you cast a vote that was very hard and very difficult because you believed, as I did, that the issue of immigration and the issue of the Dreamers is the civil rights issue of our time. You stuck your necks out and said: I am willing to go on record, even though it is hard to explain back home, and I will never forget that.  The question now is how we move forward. What I have seen on the floor of the Senate in the last few days is something we have not seen for years--constructive, bipartisan conversations and dialogue on the floor, not just about this issue, which is obviously front and center, but about the future of this institution and what the Senate will be from this point forward. That, to me, has been encouraging because it says to me we do have an opportunity to work together.  My special thanks to Senator Susan Collins, my friend, and Senator Lisa Murkowski for joining with Jeff Flake and joining with Lindsey Graham and joining with Cory Gardner and others who have been working on this issue for so long to try to make a positive impact on this debate so we can move forward.  I cannot tell my colleagues how many have come up to me from the other side of the aisle who said: We are with you on this issue. We want to help get this done. Each of them has a little different take on what that means, but I do believe them, and I do believe we have this opportunity to move this together.  Now comes the real test as to whether we can get this done--whether we can be the Senate again, whether we can return to regular order on the floor and constructively have a debate. For some of you, it will be the first time you have ever seen it, but believe me, it is worth the price of admission, all it took for you to come to the U.So now we have to stand together.  My last word is this: We have gathered the largest bipartisan group of Senators to ever commit on moving forward on the Dream Act and immigration. We have a process.  I thank Senator McConnell for explicitly saying today it will be a level playing field. It will be open to both sides. We will move to the issue, as you characterized it this morning, of DACA and immigration. Thank you for doing that. I believe that then sets the stage for us to work together.  For the first time in 5 years, we will have debate on the floor of the Senate on the Dream Act and immigration. To all the Dreamers who are watching today, don't give up. I know that your lives are hanging in the balance on what we do here on Capitol Hill and with the White Three weeks from now, I hope to be joining you and celebrating the passage, with you and your families and your communities, of a measure which will strengthen America and give you an opportunity to be part of our future.

Mr.Booth was a man who dedicated his life to the simple idea of fairness--fairness for workers, fairness in all aspects of life.  Paul Booth was a leading adviser to nearly every union president over the last several years at the American Federation of State, County and Municipal He also worked hard to lift up dignity in all aspects of his life.  He was a student organizer and brought attention to the folly of the U.involvement in the Vietnam war, and he had been active in making Americans' lives better his entire life.  He understood the very simple idea that working people have dignity and that they must be treated to reflect that dignity by their government. He also understood that the linkage between hard work and prosperity should always be close and tight. He recognized that, in our country today, you can work very hard and still only make it. That is why he was one of the first people to work for a living wage policy in this country. He was fighting for a living wage before it was popular.  Paul Booth also happened to have a marvelous partner. Her name is Heather Booth, and everybody knows  But I just want to say, when people who make a life of service pass from this life, it is important that we recognize the tremendous debt we owe them.

869,topic-id,742,"Mr.Speaker and Members, it is important to understand the big picture here.  When the Supreme Court takes up Janus, yes, they are going to be talking about fair share. Is it legal, is it constitutional, for someone to benefit from being represented by a labor union that has to fight for them and then still not have to pay anything to help at all. That will be the question before the  But that is just a very small part of what is really going on. What is really going on, Mr.Speaker, is that we see the deconstruction of the American middle class. The question is: Will America be a land of opportunity; or will it be a land of stagnation where you can work as hard as you want to, but you are never going to be able to make enough to really make it?  What is going on here, Mr.Speaker, is that the conservative movement in our country is trying to break the link between hard work and prosperity as they rifle money and channel it to the very richest among us, and working people just have to hope for the best and work hard just to get back to work for whatever they can scrape together.  Because at the end of the day, labor unions have given workers a voice which has helped create the great American middle class. The lightbulb and the semiconductor are not the great inventions of They are great inventions, but the greatest invention of the United States of America is this big, giant middle class which you can work hard and get into.  This is what is under threat. This is what we are fighting to uphold tonight.  Now, Janus is a decision that takes place within the context of other decisions. Let us not forget Shelby County, a case which attacked our right to vote. Let's not forget Citizens United, a case which says corporations are people and they can spend as much money on elections as they choose. Let's not forget these tax cuts passed just about a few weeks ago which rifle money to the richest among us and undermine American workers.  We are in the middle of a battle over whether or not the United States will continue to be a place where hard work pays. That is what this fight is about. And that, Mr.Speaker, is what we invite everyone to understand the union difference. If you are Black, being in a union means you are going to make more money than other folks. If you are a woman, it will mean the same thing. If you are a veteran, it will mean the same thing. Unions have always done more for the people who are in them, and we want to get more people in unions, not fewer.  The attack that we see tonight in the form of this Janus v. AFSCME is an attack on that union advantage. But unions have helped everybody, Mr.If you look at wage stagnation in America, what you see since World War II, right up until the 1970s, is pay going up and up and up for working people until we see union density begin to break down, and it is at that point that we begin to see wages flatten out and stagnate.  Unions create not just good pay and good benefits for their workers, but they actually create benefits for all workers because unions create the wage floor and lift up all boats.  Mr.Speaker, let me say that this is African American History Month only a few days away beginning in We must remember people like Philip Randolph, who was not only a union leader, he was a civil rights leader. We can't forget about Nixon, who helped start the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which led to the beginning of the modern American civil rights movement. And let us not forget our beloved Martin Luther King, whose birthday we celebrated a few days ago, and who we will recognize the 50th anniversary of his assassination this year, died fighting for workers of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Workers, who is one of the litigants in this case, the Janus case.  So I want to say, if you care about income inequality, if you care about prosperity for working people, you have got to get on the side of fighting against this Janus decision.

48,topic-id,1204,"Mr.President, I rise to urge each of my colleagues to support the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection This critical legislation would prohibit a child from being aborted at 5 months of development.  For those we have watching today, I would like you to focus a little bit on these photos, and I will return to them in a moment.  Again, I am urging my colleagues to support the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection By any measure, at 5 months of development, an unborn child is a child. At 5 months, babies have grown nails on their fingers and on their toes; hair has just begun to grow on their heads; and an ultrasound can tell an expectant mother or father whether their baby is a boy or a girl. These babies can detect light, hear sounds, they can swallow, and even experience taste as their taste buds grow and develop. These unborn babies in all ways are babies.  There is also significant scientific evidence that at 5 months of development these babies can feel pain. By 5 months, babies begin to respond to painful stimulus with distinctive pain response behaviors that are exhibited by older babies. They will scrunch their eyes, they will clench their hands, they pull back their limbs in response to pain, just like any other child experiencing pain.  There is also a great deal of evidence that stress hormone levels rise substantially when babies at this age are exposed to pain. In 2015, a Cambridge University Press medical textbook acknowledged that a ``fetus . . . becomes capable of experiencing pain between 20 and 30 weeks of gestation.'' In fact, fetal surgeons routinely administer pain medications for babies after only 4 months of development. Doctors are giving babies pain medication after 4 months of development.  As modern medicine has recognized, these babies are humans capable of experiencing pain. Yet there is no Federal law protecting these vulnerable humans from abortions. As a result, every year in our country the lives of thousands of babies end painfully through abortion. This is unacceptable. The majority of men and women across the Nation agree with this premise. According to a recent Marist poll, 6 out of 10 Americans surveyed support a law prohibiting abortion after 5 months of pregnancy.  Additionally, multiple States, including my home State of Iowa, have passed legislation that would prohibit abortions after 5 months of development because these babies are babies. There is no way to deny the humanity of these children when you consider stories like that of Micah  Micah is from Newton, He is a very young friend of mine. He is 5 years old. Just a few weeks ago on the floor of the Senate I was able to share Micah's story. As you may recall, Micah was born at just 20 weeks postfertilization--the very point at which the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act would begin to protect these young lives. Today, Micah is a very happy, very energetic little 5-year-old. Now, I would like to go back to these pictures.  When I first met Micah, he was about 3 years old. He and his parents visited my office for the annual March for I had this poster made of these pictures, and they were in my office because I was going to speak on the Senate floor in support of March for Micah is pictured on the right side of the poster board. Micah, a happy, energetic little boy saw this poster board in my office, and he ran up to it--imagine, this beautiful 3-year-old boy--and he pointed not at the picture of himself as he was at 3 years old, but he pointed to this picture, and he said: I said: Yes, Micah, that is a baby.  This is Micah when he was born. Micah at 3 years old understood that this was a baby. He didn't understand that was him when he was born, but he understood that was a baby.  If you look at the picture, you will see Micah is grasping his mama and daddy's hands with five perfectly formed little fingers on each hand. It is a baby, folks. Micah knew that. While he might not have known that was him when he was born, he knew that was a baby--5 months of gestation.  Today, Micah is a happy, extraordinarily healthy young boy. I got to see him again this last year. Again, he was running around my office, just full of energy and life.  Yes, Micah, this is a baby. I agree.  Micah's story is not an isolated incident. Extraordinary stories of babies who are surviving after just 5 months of development can be found all around the world.  A little over a year ago, Dakota Harris was born in Ohio at 19 weeks of development--even younger than Last May, she left the hospital with her family as a healthy 7-pound baby.[[Page S529]]  In 2016, baby Aharon was born at 20 weeks of development, becoming the youngest premature baby to survive in After 5 months of care at a hospital in Tel Aviv, he was able to go home, again, as a healthy baby.  In 2010, Frieda Mangold, who was born in Germany at just under 20 weeks of development, became Europe's youngest premature baby to survive. After receiving intensive care, she too was able to go home with her family as a happy 7-pound baby.  Babies have been on record as surviving birth after just 5 months of development for three decades now--three decades. What greater evidence do you need that at 5 months of development, an unborn child in every way is a child?  Despite the clear evidence of the humanity of these children, the United States is one of only seven countries in the world to allow abortions after 5 months of development. That means that while an overwhelming majority of the world recognizes and protects the humanity of these vulnerable children, the United States keeps the company of countries like China and North They deny unborn children the most basic of protections. This is not who we are as a nation.  It is time we listen to the scientific evidence, the men and women across America, and a majority of the rest of the world. There should be no disagreement when it comes to protecting the life of an unborn child who can feel pain and, as the inspiring stories of Micah Pickering and others show, survive outside of the womb. It is up to us to ensure these children have the chance to grow up and lead the happy, healthy lives that God has granted them.  As a mother and a grandmother, I am urging my colleagues to support the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which recognizes these unborn babies as the children they are and provides them the same protection from pain and suffering that all of our children deserve.  For my dear little friend Micah, I would say: Yes, Micah, this is a baby, and we are glad to have you here.  God bless him.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

1044,topic-id,1252,"Mr.President, I rise today to urge Senate Democratic leadership to end their reckless government shutdown.  It is no secret that over the years I have made clear that I don't like funding our Federal Government from one shortsighted, bandaid bill to another. We must establish a path forward to responsibly fund our government for the long term. It is the responsible and right thing to do for our military, for future generations, for our veterans, and for the American people.  But rather than finding a long-term funding solution to ensure stability in our military, the Senate Democratic leadership has decided to shut down the government. What does that mean for our military? Well, for starters, critical defense projects have come to a halt. We could also see delays in maintenance of our critical aircraft, ships, and weapons systems at a time when our adversaries are becoming more aggressive and more advanced. Our servicemembers, who put their lives on the line every day for our country, don't know when they will receive a paycheck.  I have an adviser right now who is deployed to the Middle I received an email from him this morning. He said: It is really hard for all of us here knowing that our government is shut down. But every day it is the same for us here in We will do what we need to do.  God bless him for that.  Iowa National Guardsmen are deployed overseas right now. One of my former units, the 248th Aviation Support Battalion, is spread out through the Middle East, doing their mission while we struggle to find a way forward for them here in Washington,  Military schools have been canceled. I spoke to an Active-Duty Army officer this morning. She was scheduled for her precommand course this weekend, and her orders were canceled. She told me: I will not be able to go to that precommand course before I deploy. She will head overseas not having had a vital course to instruct her on leadership in the military. The likelihood of her picking up that course again in the future is near zero--near zero.  Additionally, having served as a battalion commander in the Iowa Army National Guard during our last government shutdown, I can tell you that these shutdowns have a significant impact on our National A shutdown prohibits our citizen soldiers from participating in drill and training exercises essential to our military readiness.  Our public affairs officer sent out this notice this morning from the Iowa National The headline:       IOWA NATIONAL GUARD FEELS EFFECTS OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT      SHUTDOWN       More than 1,000 full-time federal technicians furloughed  That is in Iowa alone. ``Approximately 400 personnel sent home from weekend training.'' That is just  And 110,000 National Guardsmen were affected after this last weekend because of the shutdown. Should these men and women be called to defend our Nation in the face of danger, it is critical that they are properly prepared, and a government shutdown does not allow this. During the time that the government shutdown goes on, we are not able to maintain our equipment; that hurts our readiness. Our personnel can't do their wellness and medical checks; that hurts our readiness. Our military members can't get to their schools for advancement in their careers; that hurts our readiness. And once those orders to schools have been canceled, you can't just pick up on Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday and say: OK, I am going to school now. There are only so many slots allocated, and if you miss that training period, you may be waiting months, perhaps even a year, in the National Guard to pick up those schools.  During a shutdown, our folks are furloughed. Depending on how long the government is shut down, our citizen soldiers might not receive enough training days to be adequately prepared for duty. This could also mean that their time serving throughout the year might not be included in their total years of service, potentially further jeopardizing their benefits and pay.  What a lot of folks here who haven't served in the military--the Reserves, Guard, or Active Duty--don't understand is that in the Reserves and Guard you have to meet so many points in a year for that to be considered a good retirement year. If you fall a few days short of that, the entire year does not count toward your retirement. The entire year does not count toward your retirement.  Despite their rhetoric otherwise, Senate Democrats are turning their backs on our men and women in uniform by putting our military's resources and readiness in jeopardy. It is inexcusable.  Additionally, the legislation the Senate voted on Friday night would have reauthorized the Children's Health Insurance Program for 6 years--6 years--providing approximately 80,000 Iowa children with access to important healthcare services, especially in the rural and underserved areas.  Unfortunately, Senate Democratic leadership is playing political games and has opposed our efforts to ensure this critical funding is in place for children in Iowa and across the country. Instead, the Senate Democratic leadership's shutdown hurts Iowa's low-income children, puts rural and underserved areas at a major disadvantage, and disrupts States' abilities to ensure sound financial planning for their healthcare programs.  Folks, the reality is, this shutdown happened because Democratic leadership didn't get everything they wanted in this funding bill. They didn't get everything they wanted. As a result, they decided to hold hostage our military, our military's readiness, our children's healthcare, and our government.  You see, the Senate Democrats who chose to play politics also set arbitrary--arbitrary--deadlines regarding Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, also known as I, too, want to ensure that Congress finds a solution for DACA recipients. We have many, many recipients in Many of my colleagues want to see resolution on this as well.  America is a nation of immigrants, and our diversity truly is our strength. It is incredibly important that we find a fix for DACA recipients, as they are so important to the fabric of our communities and to our future.  Many young, undocumented children were brought here truly through no fault of their own.

AFSCME, Council 31, and the importance of our unions.  Our unions give us much to celebrate in our neighborhoods nationwide.  As we know all too well, this case stands to destabilize collective bargaining rights within the public sector. This is clearly an attack on freedom and liberties of hardworking  We are in the business of doing no harm. That is what we should be.  All that this case aims to do is take away the rights of the ability of hardworking Americans to have a strong voice in their workplace. That is just not right.  Next month, the Supreme Court will hear the oral arguments in this case to determine whether fair share fees violate the First Amendment rights of workers.  When it comes to this case, a negative decision for our unions nationwide would take us in the wrong direction.  Across the country, more than half of African-American workers and nearly 60 percent of Latino workers are paid less than $15 per hour. Union jobs have historically been, and continue to be, a path to the middle class for people of color, who often face low-wage jobs.  African-American union members today earn 14.7 percent more and Latino workers earn 21.8 percent more than their nonunion counterparts. In some sections, the difference is even greater.

499,topic-id,666,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida; he has definitely been a leader on this issue.  I have got to tell you that I, too, am happy the Intelligence Committee has agreed to release the memo. When I was back home in Texas last week, it was the number one issue people were talking to me about.  I want to take a minute and step back and do a little bit of a history lesson.  The Fourth Amendment to our Constitution arose from some of the abusive practices that were going on in the The King of England would send his troops to rifle through people's effects without a warrant. Our Fourth Amendment said we are not going to let that happen in these new United States of We are going to require the government to get a warrant before they go through people's papers. We are protected from illegal searches.  I have been worried since the first day I got here in Congress, but in our effort to protect ourselves--and perhaps out of fear, some of it, perhaps, warranted--we are eroding those rights.  So, as this memo comes out, regardless of what is in it, we need to be looking at the process: how we went to a secret court to get permission to get this information, how that information was gathered, what that information was, who vetted it, how thoroughly it was vetted, how the judges reacted, and, eventually, what came out and determined whether we need to reform that process to protect Americans' rights.  Yes, we all have a right to know what is going on with our government. Yes, I am worried about career bureaucrats or elected officials abusing the power of the government to get information on their political enemies, like the King was doing back in the days of the Revolutionary This is our opportunity to make sure that doesn't happen in these United  Let's not lose sight of what the issue is here, and that is protecting the people not only from foreigners who look to do us harm, but also from an oppressive government that abuses its power to spy on American citizens.  I am glad this memo is going to come out. I urge President Trump to promptly release it and, in fact, go beyond that: look at some of the sources of the material in it, determine that we can reveal some of those sources without jeopardizing our ability to gather intelligence, and release the source materials so we know what people knew when they made the decision to pursue the material covered in this memo.  I think this is a great time for this country. I think this is our opportunity to remind ourselves that we do have a right to be safe and secure in our persons and papers from a government that may be trying to do more than protect us.  Maybe some of these folks in the government have shifted from what we need to protect America, such as, well, the best way to protect America is to protect ourselves and our jobs and our political agenda.  That is not what the job of our law enforcement and intelligence community is. It is to protect us from those who want to do us harm, especially foreigners. I want to give them the power to do that, the ability to do that, but I do not want to give them the ability to affect elections, to go after their political enemies, to spy on any one of us because they can.  Human nature is such that, if we give the government too much power, there are those who will abuse it. So we in Congress have got to keep our eye on the ball at all times and protect the constitutional rights that our forefathers and our Founding Fathers gave us and that our men and women in uniform fight for every day that they are in service to this country.                              {time}  2000  ",CREC-2018-01-29-pt1-PgH657-6.txt,2067,FEDERAL REGISTER PRINTING SAVINGS ACT OF 2017,2018.0,29.0,January

70,topic-id,972,"Mr.President, in the last few years, I have watched attempt after attempt to restrict a woman's right to choose. This legislation bans a woman's access to abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, regardless of the risk to her health, and it weakens the protections for women who are victims of rape and incest. It would also allow for criminal prosecution of doctors and nurses who provide healthcare to a woman in these most difficult circumstances.  For years we have seen politicians at the Federal and State levels push to limit a woman's access to reproductive healthcare. The goal is to completely eviscerate this right. From 2010 to 2016, States adopted 334 restrictions on women's access to comprehensive reproductive healthcare. These include laws that require mandatory waiting periods which have no medical basis, force doctors to give patients inaccurate medical information, and restrict access to contraceptives.  In just 1 year, the Trump administration has attempted to restrict women's access to birth control, attempted to defund Planned Parenthood, supported legislation to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and its protections for women's health, created new government offices to undermine women's healthcare, and nominated judges who openly oppose women's privacy rights under Roe v.  This bill is yet another attempt to harm women by criminalizing their healthcare, even threatening the doctors who care for them with years in prison.  Think of a pregnant woman who is planning for her family's future, and then something goes terribly wrong. She is experiencing a miscarriage. This happens to women every day. It is not just scary medically, it is extremely painful and emotional. Under this bill, a woman's health is put at risk, and her doctor could be threatened with criminal prosecution. If a woman's miscarriage hasn't completed, her health could rapidly deteriorate from fever and infection. If this bill passes and a woman goes to the hospital, no doctor could help her. Because under this legislation, there is no exception to protect a woman's health.  Only if a doctor can be certain that a woman is close to death could they legally intervene, and that I think is unconscionable.  I have heard from women in California who were thrilled to be pregnant, only to receive the devastating news that their babies had fatal anomalies and would not survive. Let me give you an example. Rosalie, from Northern California, wrote to me and stated:       Our baby's heart was severely deformed. He was missing      parts of his brain, and his lungs likely would not have      supported him breathing on his own, ever.       We found all of this out at 19.5 weeks. . . . If we were a      few days late under this bill, we would have been forced to      carry our baby to term only to have him suffer for a few      minutes, days, weeks, and then die.  Families dealing with situations like Rosalie's deserve compassion and support for this heart-wrenching situation. But instead, this legislation leaves them with no options.  Last Congress, at a Judiciary Committee hearing, we heard from Christy Zink, who learned late in her pregnancy that her baby was missing the central connecting structure of the two parts of his brain. She told us in public testimony:       At no point in this decision and the resulting medical care      would the sort of political interference under consideration      have helped me or my family.       What happened to me during pregnancy can happen to any      woman.  This bill is not only harmful to women like Rosalie and Christy, but it is unconstitutional, and it violates Roe v. Look at the challenges to two States that enacted 20-week bans--Arizona and Both were struck down at the circuit court level as unconstitutional.  Let me read that again. Two States, Arizona and Idaho, with this legislation--it was struck down at the circuit court level as unconstitutional. The Supreme Court refused to review Arizona's case. Idaho didn't appeal.  It is also important to point out that this bill weakens protections for women who have been victims of rape or incest. Rape victims would no longer be able to access healthcare unless they could show proof that they received medical treatment or counseling for the rape or reported the assault to law enforcement. I find this shocking.  Think of a young girl who is a victim of sex trafficking. She is beaten, imprisoned, and raped by multiple men each night. She gets pregnant. This law would require this rape victim to go to law enforcement or a government official to access medical care. These girls don't have control over their own bodies. They have no freedom. To deny medical care to rape and incest victims because they don't have the right paperwork or have not reported their assault to police is unworkable and, I believe, cruel.  It is deeply troubling that we are using valuable floor time for this dangerous bill. The current funding bill expires in 10 days, and we still don't have a legislative solution for That is what we should be taking up right now. Instead, Republicans have chosen to spend the Senate's time trying to turn back the clock, debating on legislation that would drive us back to pre-Roe v.  I remember those days. I know what it was like. We knew then and we still know today that banning abortion does not end it; it just means that women undergo unsafe procedures, and lives are lost.  It is 2018. Women are more than half the population of this country. We run Fortune 500 companies. We are leaders in government. We are the heads of households. The Constitution of the United States guarantees our right to privacy and our right to access to reproductive healthcare. I, for one, will not see these rights stripped away.  Thank you very much.

131,topic-id,1998,"Mr.President, nearly a year ago, I met with six gymnasts. All of these young women were world-class athletes. All of them had put their faith in USA And all of them were sexually abused by an adult who had earned their trust.  It was one of the most difficult meetings I have held as a Listening to their stories of abuse and how the system let them down left me with equal parts sadness and rage.  These young women weren't telling me their stories to get legislation passed, but that afternoon, I promised them I would do all I could to make sure no one else ever experienced the agony that they had.  I am proud that the Senate will come together and pass the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act in order to send it to the President's desk.  This bill is intended to protect young athletes who participate in amateur sports from the sexual abuse that these gymnasts had to suffer.  In the House, Representative Susan Brooks from Indiana and Representative Lois Frankel from Florida, who cochair the Women's Caucus, partnered with us on this bill. They have been strong champions in protecting young women from abuse.  This bill wouldn't have been possible without the courageous survivors who shared their stories.  Some of the same women who I spoke with in February came back to Washington in March to speak about the bill. It was a very powerful hearing that touched many of us.  One of those brave women was Jamie Dantzscher, who won a bronze medal in 2000.  Jamie told the Judiciary Committee in moving testimony that she fell in love with gymnastics at a very young age. Her parents had to beg her to leave the gym after practice because gymnastics brought her such joy.  While she competed with the national team led by USA Gymnastics, team doctor Larry Nassar was assigned to provide her with medical treatment.  As any young woman would, Jamie put her faith in Nassar, who was employed by USA Gymnastics, but her faith was turned on its head in horrifying ways. In Jamie's words: ``What I have only recently come to understand is that the medical treatment he performed for my back pain and other injuries was sexual assault. Nassar abused me at the USA National Training Center in He abused me in California and at meets all over the world. Many times the abuse took place in my own room, in my own bed. Worse, he abused me in my hotel room in Sydney at the Olympic Games.''  Jamie went on: ``When I first spoke out about my abuse at the hands of Nassar, I thought I was the only one. I was disbelieved and even criticized by some in the gymnastics community for bringing this disturbing issue to light.''  It is impossible to imagine the horror that Jamie felt, but what we do know is that Jamie wasn't the only victim.  Jessica Howard was a 15-year-old rhythmic gymnast when Nassar began abusing her. She testified that her first few years of training were ``pure bliss.'' Eventually, she was sent to Nassar for hip problems. Nassar told her she shouldn't wear underwear for her treatments.  Jessica was confused, but she was fearful to say anything to anyone. She believed she would be prevented from pursuing her dreams if she said anything. This is how so much of this abuse was conducted, under a shroud of fear that the athletes' dreams would be quashed.  Later in her life, Jessica served on USA Gymnastics' board of directors. In Jessica's words: ``As an adult, I spent years serving on the USA Gymnastics Board of Directors with a mission of protecting children in my sport from the psychological abuse that I endured. But the meetings seemed to revolve around two things: money and medals. When a sexual abuse case came up during my time on the board, the concern was about the reputation of the coach, not the accusation of the athlete. As I have attempted to come to terms with what happened to me as a teenager, it has become glaringly obvious that USA Gymnastics has not done nearly enough to protect athletes from any form of abuse.''  Jessica and others like her were silenced by a culture of complicity where those in power refused to promote a safe environment and survivors could report abuse. That is what the bill we will pass aims to change.  Finally, I would like to talk about another gymnast we heard from more recently. Aly Raisman, one of the most decorated Olympic gymnasts ever, revealed that she, too, was sexually abused by Larry Nassar, starting when she was 15 years old.  As Aly said, ``I didn't know anything differently. We were told he is the best doctor.''  As a result, Nassar used this trust to manipulate hundreds of victims so they couldn't fully understand that they were being abused.  When telling her story, Aly asked, ``Why are we looking at why didn't the girls speak up? Why not look at what about the culture? What did USA Gymnastics do, and Larry Nassar do, to manipulate these girls so much that they are so afraid to speak up? I am angry.''  I think we should all be angry by what we have heard from these brave young women. When I heard these stories, I found a common theme: The very institutions tasked with protecting these athletes allowed this egregious conduct to occur.  In my view, these governing bodies were, at best, complicit in the devastation wrought on these young children[[Page S590]]and their families. They did far too little to prevent abuse from happening in the first place, and when they saw signs of abuse, they did little to stop it.  In fact, USA Gymnastics, which oversees more than 3,000 gymnasiums nationwide, had bylaws that actually made it more difficult for survivors to report abuse.  For example, the only way for a member athlete to ``effectively'' make a complaint about a coach was through a signed, written complaint. Not only is this an ineffective way to prevent sexual abuse, it actually serves to protect the abusers by making it harder for child victims to come forward.  USA Gymnastics didn't even require that sexual abuse be reported to law enforcement when it was discovered. It was a disgusting abuse of power, to say the least.  After we introduced our legislation, USA Gymnastics hired former Federal prosecutor Deborah Daniels to conduct an independent review of USA Gymnastics' policies and procedures. Needless to say, they were found to be woefully ineffective and insufficient. After reviewing documents and interviewing nearly 160 individuals, Daniels recommended nearly 70 policy changes, including a recommendation that USA Gymnastics ``undergo a complete cultural change, permeating the entire organization and communicated to the field in all its actions.''  In one damning finding, Daniels stated, ``The overall impression received externally is that the athlete protection function is, at best, secondary to the primary focus: winning medals.'' That is completely unacceptable.  The legislation we will soon pass does three main things to help protect sex abuse victims and reform institutions like USA  First, the bill makes it mandatory for anyone affiliated with USA Gymnastics, or any other national governing body or amateur sports organization that crosses State lines, to immediately report sexual abuse to local and Federal law enforcement or social services agencies. This requirement would apply to USA Gymnastics and each of the other 47 national governing bodies that oversee a variety of Olympic sports, including USA Taekwondo, USA Speed Skating, USA Swimming, and USA It is absolutely imperative that a firm line be drawn for everyone working with national governing bodies and amateur sports organizations. Once there is suspicion of abuse, a report must be made as soon as possible to law enforcement. This bill mandates that.  Second, the bill strengthens the law that allows victims of sex abuse to file suits against those who abused them to commit crimes such as sex trafficking, sexual exploitation, and child pornography. It clarifies, for example, that victims of child sex crimes are entitled to statutory damages of $150,000, as well as punitive damages, due to the heinous nature of the crimes.  The bill also extends the statute of limitations so that victims can sue their abusers 10 years after they become aware of their abuse. This is important because, tragically, survivors often do not fully become aware of their abuse until later in life. The statute of limitations extension is part of legislation that Senator Cornyn and I have worked on over the past couple of years, called the Extending Justice for Sex Crime Victims  Third, the bill makes reforms to the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act, which establishes ``national governing bodies'' like USA When I first contacted USA Gymnastics about its poor handling of sexual abuse allegations, the group cited the Stevens Act as a shield, saying that it prevented them from doing more to protect athletes from sexual abuse. The bill we are passing is a direct response to that claim.  It requires the newly created U.Center for Safe Sport--championed by Commerce Committee Chairman John Thune and Ranking Member Bill Nelson--to establish strict policies and procedures for handling abuse allegations, as well as oversight procedures to make sure these policies are adhered to by every national governing body.  The reforms in the bill ensure that national governing bodies and amateur sports organizations will adopt five baseline policy prescriptions.  First, specific policies and procedures for mandatory reporting of sex abuse to law enforcement. Second, policies and procedures to keep track of coaches who leave one gym only to repeat the cycle of abuse at another gym. Third, policies to avoid circumstances where minors and adults are in one-on-one situations. Fourth, policies to facilitate reporting of sex abuse allegations to national governing bodies and other authorities. And fifth, stronger oversight and enforcement policies so that complaints are dealt with uniformly and with fairness and due process.  These new provisions give national governing bodies like USA Gymnastics no excuse not to prevent abuse or to report it when it occurs.  All over the country, survivors of sexual abuse are coming forward to tell their stories of abuse and exploitation. Multiple survivors from around the country have contacted my office and described with great courage their pain and anguish. Each of these stories represents an untold amount of pain and suffering that has generational ripple effects. It is absolutely devastating.  This is why I am so encouraged that my colleagues in this body will soon pass this important legislation to protect abuse victims.  I would also like to acknowledge the list of 270 organizations and individuals who have contributed to and supported this bill. Their names are listed on our website.  I would also like to recognize my staff who have worked on this bill, including Peter Hyun, Ashley Schapitl, Sarah Chang, Matthew Halek, Jennifer Duck, and Tom  I would also like to thank Peter Feldman and Ashok Pinto from Senator Thune's staff, Christian Fjeld and Ioana Gorecki from Senator Nelson's staff, Evelyn Fortier and Kyle McCollum from Senator Grassley's staff, Rob Hicks from Representative Susan Brooks' staff, Meg Barr from House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte's office, and Yana Mayayeva from Representative Lois Frankel's staff  Finally, I would like to recognize two individuals who recently passed away. Both were fierce advocates on behalf of survivors of abuse.  Barbara Blaine, who founded SNAP, the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, passed away in Utah, and Kristine Ward, the cofounder of National Survivor Advocates Coalition, passed away in Both of these extraordinary women spent much of their lives giving a powerful voice to those who have been sexually abused.  This bill attempts to do what both women so powerfully advocated for throughout their lives: speak for the voiceless and demand the change necessary to protect our children, our most precious resource.

621,topic-id,471,"Mr.President, I rise to introduce a resolution in observance of National Trafficking and Modern Slavery Prevention Month, to bring awareness to the terrible scourge of modern slavery and human trafficking around the world.  In 2016 alone, the National Human Trafficking Hotline received 26,727 calls to report incidents of human trafficking in the United From those calls, 7,793 victims were identified. These individuals were trafficked across various sectors, economies, and geographical regions under conditions of force, fraud, or coercion.  The United States must not turn a blind eye to this scourge. The State Department estimates that 14,500 to 17,500 people are trafficked into the U.each year. Amongst federally identified trafficking victims in 2016, the top three countries of origin include the United  Importantly, more than a quarter of the trafficking cases identified by the National Human Trafficking Hotline involved U.citizen victims. According to a recent study by Polaris, modern slavery and trafficking operates throughout a range of U.industries including our factories, our agricultural centers, as well as our hospitality and domestic work businesses.  We must all, as Americans, raise our awareness of this pernicious crime that often goes unnoticed and undetected in our communities.  Part of the reason it is undetected is that traffickers prey on vulnerable populations--like those in the juvenile justice system--and use numerous physical and psychological techniques to control their victims behind closed doors: isolating them from the public, exploiting language and cultural barriers, and threatening victims with violence.  These techniques are specifically designed to prevent victims from coming forward to authorities and they are extremely effective. This is why we must do better. We must do everything we can to raise public awareness so that we can all recognize the warning signs.  I have been heartened that in recent years, various private entities, such as hotels, the travel industry, and recently those in the convenience-store industry, have all come together to commit to training their employees to better detect human trafficking and modern slavery.  In addition to raising awareness, January is also a month to renew our commitment to enforce--and enact laws to help eradicate modern slavery and trafficking.  Back in 2000, Congress enacted the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, which marked a strong commitment to prosecute traffickers and better aid victims. This Congress, Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley and I authored the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2017, which was complemented by the Cornyn-Klobuchar Abolish Human Trafficking Act of 2017, to update our trafficking laws to better aid victims.  These bills passed the Senate in November, and the House should adopt these measures quickly so they can be signed into law.

69,topic-id,623,"Mr.President, over my time in public service, I have been committed to supporting commonsense, pro-life measures that offer empathy for women and for unborn children. Too often, women experience despair and pain and judgment from others during unplanned pregnancies. We should offer compassion for these expectant mothers, and they need to know we will continue to support them in the challenging years ahead. We should also be willing to protect the most innocent among us, the unborn, who can feel pain and have the chance at viability.  I rise to discuss the bill that the Senate will consider shortly--the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection  This is a reasonable bill that has the support of 47 This kind of legislation has passed in many States, including in my own. My State of Nebraska has a proud tradition of being pro-life. We were the first State in the country to pass a 20-week abortion ban. The bill before us today would enact the same policy at the Federal level, and doing so makes sense.  As a State senator, I was a strong supporter and cosponsor of that legislation. It passed in Nebraska because we focused on areas of agreement, and like the bill we are debating today, the legislation provided exceptions for rare and dangerous circumstances. This bill passed overwhelmingly in Nebraska by a vote of 44 to 5, and it had the support from pro-choice and pro-life senators from both parties--Republicans and  The enduring support for this kind of legislation across the country and the world is pretty easy to understand, in that it is a righteous cause that is based on science. It states that abortions during the sixth month of pregnancy should only be allowed in moments of extreme danger and with exceptions.[[Page S542]]  Basic embryology shows that the human nervous system is developed within the first 6 weeks of pregnancy. Our sensory receptors for pain are developed around the mouth as early as 10 weeks and are present in the skin and mucosal surfaces 20 weeks into gestation. The connections between the spinal cord and the thalamus--the part of the human body that deals with pain perception--is present at 20-weeks' gestation as well. None of this is debatable. It is a fact.  We also know babies have been born and have survived and thrived before the current 24-week limit. In March of 2017, the academic journal Pediatrics discussed a girl in Dallas who, in 2014, was born at 21-weeks' gestation. Today, she is a typical, happy 3-year-old who is living her life to the fullest and has a bright future ahead of her.  Over time, views on this divisive issue have evolved toward the side of pro-life policies because, as we gain more knowledge about pregnancy and gestation, we understand the humanity of the unborn. We recognize them as the people they are--and this movement is on the rise. Nearly two-thirds of Americans support legislation prohibiting abortion into the sixth month of pregnancy. This includes almost 80 percent of the millennial generation--those most likely to be affected by such restrictions. It is gaining momentum because it is a movement backed by science. It is a movement of truth, and it is a movement of love.  We have an opportunity to join together and support the basic truth that all life is sacred. We should protect the child in the womb, especially when he or she can feel pain. We can make a statement that every person is deserving of life and deserving of love.

And while we are proud of our heartland heritage, we are equally proud of the ships that have carried the name ``USS Omaha'' to the far corners of the globe.  Just two years after Nebraska became a State, the USS Omaha, a screw sloop, was launched in 1869, helping to grow our young Nation's navy.  The second USS Omaha, launched in 1923, served with distinction in World War II, capturing a German blockade runner a month before the war officially began.  And now this upcoming weekend, we welcome the newest USS Omaha, LCS-12, which carries the distinction of being among our Nation's newest Littoral Combat  She will enter the navy as an agile surface combatant, and one which I know will prove to be a capable tool in our Nation's naval arsenal.  Though Nebraska may be far from open water that has not stopped countless men and women from our State from answering the call to serve in the United States  Their service and sacrifice, both in times of war and peace, have helped ensure that the United States continues to enjoy freedom of navigation around the world.

26,topic-id,1277,"Mr.President, I thank the Senator from Let me just say that during a televised, bipartisan meeting recently at the White House, the President suggested that we might be more collegial around here, more efficient in Congress, if we would just bring back earmarks. The reaction from the lawmakers present was decidedly mixed. Some cheered that declaration, but most of us, I have to say, recoiled at the thought.  As someone who served in Congress during the gluttonous earmarking era, when pork was used regularly to buy and sell Congressmen's votes, I can tell you firsthand this is an idea that nobody ought to be laughing at or embracing. Amidst public corruption investigations and a constant stream of embarrassing headlines about sweetheart deals for family and friends, Congress was forced to place a moratorium on earmarks about 7 or 8 years ago.  Earmarking does not improve the legislative process. In fact, it compromises Members into ignoring unethical behavior and voting for bad bills that they would otherwise oppose. Remember, ObamaCare was approved with just a single vote being secured with an earmark--the one that was derided as the ``Cornhusker kickback.'' Likewise, when Senators receive earmarks, they are agreeing to support hundreds of other earmarks stuffed into an appropriations bill.  When people say the appropriations process would be a lot smoother, would work a lot better with earmarks, I would respond by saying that there was a period of about 10 years when earmarks really hit the high point, in 1994 or 1995 through 2006. I served in the House from 2001 to 2012, and during that time we had earmarks for part of the time and went without earmarks part of the time. And 2005, I think everybody recognizes, was the high point--or the low point, if you want to put it that way. There were a total of 16,000 earmarks spread across 12 appropriations bills and 1 authorization bill, worth about $30 billion.  One would think that if we had that much to grease the skids in Washington, we should have been able to pass all appropriations measures and move through the process. We would have a more collegial, compliant body. During that time, in 2005--I just checked--we passed only five appropriations bills in the House--only five. We ended up with an omnibus bill, and that was when Republicans controlled the House, the Senate, and the White  So this notion that we have to have earmarks, and if we just get back to earmarks then this place will run smoothly and we will get through the appropriations bills--with 16,000 earmarks, worth about $30 billion, only five appropriations bills were approved.  We all remember too well the indoor rain forest in Iowa, the teapot museum in North Carolina, and, of course, the bridge to nowhere in When a challenge was made to that infamous bridge and other pork projects, not-so-veiled threats were leveled at Senators and Members of Congress who dared question their colleagues' projects.  We simply cannot go back to that time.  I remember well during that time one particular episode when we were all in HC-5 of the House basement. It was during the appropriations season, and all of a sudden one Member ran into the room just breathless. He had the list--the list from the Appropriations Committee--as to who was getting the earmarks and who wasn't. It was largely a staff-driven process. But then everybody would--the thing was, we have to get these earmarks; we have to go announce them quickly in the House before the Senators take credit for them. That was the atmosphere at that time. That was not a high point. That is not something we want to return to.  I was looking at some of what I said in the House at that time and some of what I quoted when we were trying to get rid of them in 2009. At that time, The Hill newspaper had reported that a prominent lobbying firm was the subject of a Federal investigation into potentially corrupt political contributions. It had given $3.4 million in political contributions to no less than 284 Members of  There were lobbying shops that were set up for that purpose--simply to be at the intersection of earmarks and policy.  The Hill also reported on February 10, 2009, that this firm, which specialized in obtaining earmarks in the defense budget for a long list of clients was ``recently raided by the FBI.''  The New York Times noted that the same lobbyist for that firm ``set up shop at the busy intersection between political fundraising and taxpayer spending, directing tens of millions of dollars in contributions to lawmakers while steering hundreds of millions of dollars in earmark contracts back to his clients.''  This is a process that simply is too tough to police when it gets this way.  During my time in the House, over a series of a number of years, I went to the House floor literally hundreds of times to challenge individual earmarks in these spending projects. For those who think that you can go and challenge these earmarks and have somebody say ``Yes, all right, I didn't want to spend money on that teapot museum anyway; that is a bad idea,'' that rarely happened. In the hundreds of times I went to the floor to challenge earmark spending, there was only one vote that I won--only one in hundreds of times. That is because the process of logrolling takes over, where one Member will say: I will protect your earmark if you protect mine. It was more likely that I would get 30, 40, 50 votes, and if I was challenging a popular appropriator, I would get even fewer because nobody wanted to challenge them because their own earmarks would be threatened.  This is not a process that we want to go back to. This is not something that we should be proud of in our history. Several of our colleagues ended up in jail. One of them actually had an earmark bribe menu printed, in hand, on his congressional letterhead which read: If you want an earmark for this much, here is what it will cost you, under the table. He ended up doing time in prison. Not every Member did that, obviously, but it is a process that is too difficult to control.  Here is the worst part about earmarks generally. Some will say that it is just a fraction of spending; it is just a couple of percentage points off the Federal budget, which is true. But the problem is, once you get back into earmarking, the Appropriations Committee spends an inordinate amount of time--the majority of its time--focusing on that 1 or 2 percentage points of the funding and gives up its oversight responsibilities on the other 98 percent of the budget.  We simply don't do the oversight that we should be doing on the Federal agencies and how they spend this money. That is the worst part of earmarking--that we simply give up oversight. Yes, we pay a lot of attention to that 1 or 2 percent of funding, but we give up oversight on the rest, effectively.  So I hope we don't go there. That is why I am introducing bipartisan legislation, joined by my colleague from Utah, to permanently ban all congressional earmarking. Senators McCaskill, Toomey, McCain, Lee, Portman, Johnson, Rubio, Ernst, Fischer, and Sasse are all on as cosponsors. I hope that when this is brought to the floor, it passes, and we don't go back to this practice of earmarking.  I turn back to my colleague from Utah to hear what other thoughts he has on the subject.  ",CREC-2018-01-23-pt1-PgS447-2.txt,1633,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2018.0,23.0,January
28,topic-id,291,"Well, I thank the Senator from One of the things I fear most is that we are having a tough enough time controlling spending.  Coburn, who served in the House--I admired his time there. He went after earmarks and after a lot of these appropriations, and he did the same thing when he came to the Senate until the last day he was here. He had a saying. He said: ``Earmarks are the gateway drug to . . . spending addiction.''  What he meant by that is if you give an earmark in an appropriations bill, some people will say ``Well, it is just an earmark for a couple of million dollars for a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame''--that was actually one. The problem is, once you get your earmark there, you are obligated to support that entire bill, no matter how ballooned it becomes.  During the period, particularly in 2001 to 2006, boy, we bloated up a lot of appropriations bills. We were running basically at almost a surplus in 2001, and by the time we got to 2006, it was anything but, and nondefense discretionary spending and defense spending related to earmarks increased significantly. It just was not a good trend.  So what I fear most is that we have been able to have some control on nondefense discretionary spending, and the growth of that has been slower than other things, but once you start getting earmarks in these bills, then you will be obligated to support them no matter what. Then you support bloated appropriations bills just to protect your earmark. The process of logrolling takes effect--I protect yours if you protect mine.  That is one thing I fear.

988,topic-id,729,"Mr.President, as we continue the debate on the issue of immigration as it relates to providing a permanent solution to those young immigrants who benefited from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, the scope of this debate has expanded to include other issues.  Some of these issues are directly related to the DACA issue, including persistent concerns on our southern border, like improving barriers and border access roads, providing hiring and retention incentives for Customs and Border Protection personnel to ensure that all locations on the border remain secure. Other things being debated, like changes to legal immigration levels, truly need their own debate.  Some appear to have seized on this as an opportunity to push forth an agenda aimed at limiting the future flow of legal immigration. Before this idea gains any steam, we have to fully discuss and debate its potentially enormous impact on our economy. It is easy for some to see unemployed Americans and point to immigrants as a scapegoat. To suggest that every immigrant who passes through our borders represents a job being pried from the hands of an American citizen is farfetched, at best.  After taking the time to actually examine the facts, the shortsightedness of this thinking is exposed. For example, cleaving the number of new legal immigrants by almost 50 percent--which is what the White House proposal appears to envision over time--would initially reduce the overall rate of economic growth in the United States by an estimated 12.5 percent when compared to currently projected levels through 2045. This is because labor force growth is one of the most important factors tied to economic growth. More troubling, these changes in legal immigration would come just as the aging U.population increases our dependence on a growing workforce.  Some have suggested that legal immigrants represent some sort of drag on government resources. In fact, the National Academy of Sciences estimates that the average immigrant contributes, in net present value terms, $92,000 more in taxes than they receive in benefits over their lifetime.  We can only expect these numbers to increase as we move to a kind of merit or employment-based system. I should note that in the bipartisan approach in 2015, we did restrict the number of family-based visas. I think it was from a total of 75 percent of legal immigration, we moved it down to 50 percent from family-based visas. At that same time, what we did was reallocate those visas to merit-based or employment-based visas so we wouldn't have an overall drop in legal immigration.  To look into the future of what happens when the philosophy of limiting legal immigration takes hold, we need to look no further than the current economic struggles Japan is having. In a timely piece by Fred Hiatt in the Washington Post this last Sunday, he points out that Japan's population of 127 million is forecast to shrink by one-third over the next half century. The increase in lifespans coupled with a decrease in fertility is projected to lead to near-stagnant economic growth, reduced innovation, labor shortages, and huge pressure on entitlements and pensions in  These disastrous realities facing Japan are the direct result of that nation's historically low level of immigrants. As Hiatt astutely points out, ``You can be pro-growth. You can be anti-immigration. But honestly, you can't be both.''  Legal immigration policy is complicated, but it is important, and it is worth debating this reform on its own. There may be a strong appetite for merit-based immigration, but rather than drastically cutting legal and necessary immigration flows, we need to work together to provide a way for the best and brightest to make it to the United States, both for their benefit and ours.  Let's not be lured into thinking that legal immigration is some kind of simplistic zero-sum game that can be easily reformed without consequence. During the last administration, many of us rejected the new normal of low economic growth driven by overregulation and irrational tax policy. It would be a supreme irony if we were to fix those anti-growth fiscal and regulatory policies only to counteract them with immigration restrictions that affect our workforce.  Let's give this important and complex issue the time for discussion, analysis, and debate it deserves and not shoehorn it into a DACA fix.  I yield the floor.

878,topic-id,527,"Mr.Speaker, Janus v. AFSCME comes down to a binary choice: will the U.stand up for the fundamental right of workers to form a union and collectively bargain; or will the Supreme Court allow large corporations to continue their assault on hard-working  Unions are a vital part of our nation. Decades ago, Congress protected the right of workers to join together and bargain for better wages, regular work hours and improved safety conditions, giving workers a voice when negotiating with large corporations.  Despite their role in creating and maintaining America's working middle class, unions are under relentless attack.  It is no coincidence that a dramatic rise in income inequality coincides with a nation-wide campaign against unionization.  American workers have become more productive, yet wages have stagnated. Their hard work has created billions of dollars in profits, all while working longer hours for less pay and fewer benefits.  Endless attacks have been launched against workers' overtime pay, retirement savings, and health care.  The tax code was just tilted even more toward the wealthiest individuals and corporations.  Corporate profits were at all-time highs before the tax cut.  Unions ensure workers can fight for their fair share of the profits they help create.  On average, unionized workers earn $207 more per week than non-unionized workers. Unionized workers have greater access to paid holidays, paid sick leave, life insurance, medical, and retirement benefits.  Unionized workforces lead to less turnover for employers and more highly skilled workers. Children of union members are more likely to climb the ladder to the middle class. States with higher union density have better workplace laws.  The foundation of U.labor law has held firm for nearly 70 years. American standards are what we strive to hold other countries to when negotiating trade deals, yet these standards are constantly under attack.  The Supreme Court will soon hear oral arguments in Janus v. AFSCME, a case that could fundamentally end collective bargaining.  The question of ``fair share'' was settled by the Supreme Court years ago. Unions are required by law to represent and negotiate on behalf of all public sector employees, regardless of whether or not a worker decides to formally join the union.  Fair share fees support that requirement and ensure no worker is required to join the union and no one is forced to pay any fees that go toward politics or candidates they disagree agree with. But all employees benefit from union negotiations. It is only fair that all employees contribute.  This is already the law. Janus is just another in a long line of attacks on unions and workers.  Since Republicans took control of the House in 2011, they have convened more than 30 hearings and markups to undermine workers' rights in the Education and the Workforce Committee alone.  Rather than attacking workers' rights, we should focus on raising wages and improving working conditions for all We should work to ensure paid family, sick and medical leave, improve access to child care, and ensure access to quality, affordable health care for all  It's time for my colleagues to turn their words into actions. It's time to support unions and the American worker. The real middle class.  ",CREC-2018-01-29-pt1-PgH661-2.txt,1895,DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE FBI STEPS DOWN,2018.0,29.0,January
998,topic-id,226,"Madam Speaker, too often when we think about human trafficking as a tragedy, we think about it as something that goes on in someone else's country, in some other place other than our home.  Most people are surprised to find out that thousands of men, women, and children right here in the United States are enslaved by human trafficking every year. In my home State of Hawaii, an estimated 1,500 to 2,500 victims are impacted each year with girls as young as 10 and 11 years old recruited and kidnapped from malls, beaches, and schools.  So as we work to confront and stop perpetrators of human trafficking, we also need to change the way that we treat survivors of this heinous crime. Because even after the horrors that these individuals go through of rape, physical abuse, kidnapping, and so much more, these survivors are too often charged as criminals themselves, thrown in jail, and shackled with a criminal record that follows them wherever they go.

502,topic-id,726,"Mr.Speaker, I will not take that full allotment of time. I will say, though, that it is worth repeating the great work that Chairman Bob Goodlatte has done in the Judiciary Committee; the excellent work that Trey Gowdy has done, the chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee; and the excellent work that Chairman Devin Nunes has done. Each of these committees has jurisdiction over a different component part of the information that is laid out before the American people that has given rise to so many concerns about bias, departure from standard practices, familial relationships, and the potential political corrosion of institutions that we have to rely on for an effective democracy.  I also want to thank the thousands of people who work in the FBI and the Department of Justice who are patriots, who go to work every day to protect us from threats at home and abroad, who really do do a great job in defense of this country. It is not their work that we question; in fact, it is their work we hope to empower.  When you have circumstances where folks at the head shed or the leading bureaucrats can rip investigations away from field offices, can alter the contents of information that is shared with the American people, it undermines the work that true law enforcement members are doing. We want to highlight and honor that work while, at the same time, exercising our oversight function to go after the bad conduct and, where we find it systemic, institute reforms so that it does not happen again.  The FBI and the Department of Justice should never be a political weapon used to go after adversaries. This is an issue where we ought to have more bipartisan agreement, Mr.While I am grateful that the Republicans on the Intelligence Committee this evening were able to carry the day in the fight for transparency, I am disappointed that these issues led to party-line votes.  The reality is that all Americans--Republican, Democrat, Independent, Libertarian, or members of the Whig Party--have an interest in ensuring that we have systems in place that protect our constitutional rights and liberties. We all have a stake in the action to ensure that, no matter which party wins or loses an election, the political apparatus of intelligence won't be used to go after enemies or people we disagree with.  I believe this was an opportunity missed, but it won't be the last one. I believe that the President is going to declassify this information within the 5-day window allowed to him. When he does, all Americans will see why Republicans have been concerned with the information we have learned. Then the opportunity will arise to work together, to take these facts, to take what we know, and to liberate ourselves from the partisanship of this town and to try to make things better so that, in the future, you don't have a circumstance where one investigation is called a headquarter special and taken away from the Washington field office, as the Hillary Clinton email scandal was.  We certainly don't want cases where people's family members--familial relationships, spousal relationships--influence the outcomes of decisions; and we also don't want systems in place that allow leaks to the media within the apparatus of intelligence to cloud[[Page H661]]our mind, to cloud our judgment, to cloud the facts, or to cloud the review of our courts.  So, again, while I am proud of the work of the people who have spent a year investigating these matters, while I am confident in the findings of this report, I still remain disappointed that we don't have more unity to ensure that these types of abuses never happen again.  Mr.Speaker, tomorrow, the President of the United States will walk down the center aisle. He will address this floor. There might be a few more folks than there are here this evening. I hope that the first thing he does is hand to the Speaker of the House his consent and his agreement to allow transparency to rein, to declassify this memo, to put it before the American people, and then let's have a great debate about its consequences and about the opportunity that it presents to make things better so that these things never happen again.

985,topic-id,699,"Mr.President, I rise to speak about a horrible tragedy that occurred in Adams County, CO, on January 24, just last week. Adams County sheriff's deputy Heath Gumm was pursuing a suspect when he was shot and killed in the line of duty.  Heath was 31 years old and is survived by his wife and other loving family members. He had served with the Adams County Sheriff's Office since 2012, which was not a surprise to those who knew him best, because of his upbringing.  He grew up in a family of first responders. His father is a retired West Metro Fire Protection District engineer. So his teachers and classmates who knew Heath as a student at Mullen High School, in Denver, were not shocked to learn that he had decided to become a law enforcement officer.  As reported by the Denver Post, Heath's ninth grade English teacher, Sean Keefe, said:       By all accounts, he lived his life as a grown man as he did      as a kid. He was a good guy. That didn't change. That only      got more accentuated as he grew up. He lifted his friends. He      made his friends the best version of themselves, and they did      that to him as well.  Heath's cousin remembers him as the ``kind of man you wanted out there protecting our streets. He was kind, fair, funny and friendly to everyone.''  Keefe went on to remember Heath as ``someone people gravitated towards, and he was someone who people could count on.''  It is these qualities that made Heath such an incredible sheriff's deputy.  At a press conference last Thursday, Adams County sheriff Michael McIntosh read parts of a letter he had received from a stranded motorist whom Heath had recently helped when he was out on patrol.  The resident wrote: ``Heath made the interaction enjoyable and easy to get through instead of acting like I was in trouble or a nuisance.''  Heath showed what it means to be a law enforcement officer who selflessly serves and protects a community. He went to work each and every day--ready to walk that thin blue line.  When we lose an officer in Colorado, I come to this Chamber to honor his sacrifice and recite the words of LTC Dave Grossman, who wrote that American law enforcement is the loyal and brave sheepdog who is always standing watch for the wolf that lurks in the dark.  Unfortunately, many in this Chamber have heard me read that quote far too often in the last weeks.  Across Colorado and across the country, we owe so much to Heath and law enforcement officers for their service. Instead of fleeing to safety, they run toward danger to save lives. They provide hope and safety to our families in the worst of times.  I thank Heath for answering the call. He protected his community. I, along with Coloradans across the State, are forever grateful. We will never forget his sacrifice, and we will always honor his memory.  We also lost a sheriff's deputy on New Year's Eve in Colorado, just a few weeks before. In a tribute to him, I read something that former State Representative Joe Rice had written during his service in the I think it is appropriate to share it now because, each and every day they wake up, I know the thoughts of many in law enforcement are reflected in the words of Representative Joe Rice:       In a few hours, it will be Christmas in I      spent 3 Christmas Days in Only on one of them did I      have to go out on Christmas Day, itself. I found myself      praying that I didn't want to die this day and ruin every      future Christmas for my family. I realize that most of the      other soldiers I was with were quietly or openly saying the      same thing.

I just thank God we had the opportunity to find out before it was too late and to do something about it.  Today's news has been that, as The Wall Street Journal article by Aruna Viswanatha and Del Quentin Wilber today reported: FBI deputy chief steps down after Trump criticism.  The article points out: ``Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe left his post on Monday after his bosses urged him to step aside, said people familiar with the matter, following weeks of criticism from President Donald Trump and other Republicans.''  I guess I would be one of those other  ``Mr.McCabe will take leftover vacation time until he is technically eligible to retire from the Federal Bureau of Investigation in March, the people said.  ``Mr.McCabe has faced a steady string of attacks over an alleged conflict of interest stemming from his wife's previous run for Virginia State Senate as a Democrat before he became deputy director. He has denied any conflict.  ``But Mr.Trump and other Republicans have cited it as part of a broader assertion of bias on the part of the FBI, Justice Department, and special counsel's office as they investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign and any links between the Trump campaign and Moscow in that effort. Mr.Trump has specifically called for Mr.McCabe's ouster.  ``Democrats say these assertions are an attempt to distract from the investigations and discredit them.  ``FBI Director Chris Wray, addressing Mr.McCabe's departure in an email to employees, said Mr.Wray `will not be swayed by political or other pressure' in making decisions, according to a person familiar with the message.''  That is quite interesting coming this long after evidence was slapping people in the face, figuratively speaking. It appears that evidence that is overly compelling also may not actually sway Chris Wray into taking actions as the Director of the FBI that a reasonable and prudent Director of the FBI would have taken under the same or similar circumstances.  ``Mr.Wray thanked Mr.McCabe for his service, adding''--I guess that includes the politicalization, the weaponizing, of the FBI in which Mr.McCabe was involved--``that Mr.McCabe said he would take leave immediately following a conversation between the two, the person said.

You are where America will be. It is just a matter of time until we get there.  To my colleagues on the other side, I appreciate your passion, but I think you are on the wrong side of history.[[Page S543]]  What we are trying to do here today is to proceed to a bill. It is called a motion to proceed. But I think what we are trying to do is proceed to a better We are one of seven nations on the entire planet to allow abortion on demand after 20 weeks; that is, the fifth month of pregnancy.  What do we know about unborn children at that stage of development? We know that for a doctor to operate on that unborn child, they provide anesthesia because it hurts the child, and no doctor wants to hurt the child in an effort to save the child's life. Listen to what I said. Medical practice dictates that if you are going to operate on a 20-week-old, unborn child, you provide anesthesia because science tells us that the baby can feel pain.  Can you only imagine the pain it will feel from abortion? There is a reason that there are only seven countries in the world that allow this. The question for America is, Do we want to stay in this club or do we want to get out? I want out.  Twenty States have a version of this bill, and more are taking it up as I speak. When informed of what we are trying to do, the majority of pro-choice people support this. Abortion is a divisive issue, and it is an emotional issue, but in the fifth month of pregnancy, I think most Americans are going to side with what we are trying to do--stopping abortion on demand in the fifth month.  Does it make us a better nation? I would say it does not.  So we are trying to proceed to make sure that America will be a better place and that we become part of the mainstream of the world when it comes to protecting unborn children after the fifth month of pregnancy.  If you look at a medical encyclopedia and read about the birthing process, parents are encouraged in the fifth month to sing to a child because the child will begin to associate your voice with you. Read it. There is literature of all kinds stating what you should do in the fifth month to enhance the relationship between you and your unborn child.  We do allow exceptions to save the life of the mother. It is a terrible situation when we have to pick between the mother and child, and there is an exception for that situation. The result of rape or incest if the child was a minor--when it comes to a pregnancy caused by a rape, we require that the law enforcement authorities be notified of the rape before the abortion, not at the time it occurred, and I think most Americans would want people to come forward and report rape.  It is a difficult situation, but we have commonsense exceptions, and this is a commonsense bill designed to change America in a commonsense way. It is a motion to proceed to put us in better standing as a nation in the world at large, I believe. It is also a motion to withdraw--withdraw from the club of seven nations that allows abortion on demand at a time when doctors can save the baby's life, but to do so they have to provide anesthesia because that baby can feel so much pain.  Savannah Duke is a young lady in South She is 17 years old. She goes to high school in Spartanburg, She does all the things that a 17-year-old would do. She is an incredibly gifted young lady. At 20 weeks, it was discovered that she was missing a leg, and the doctors feared she would have severe birth defects. Her parents, Wendy and Scott, when deciding what to do, could see the baby move, and they decided not to opt for an abortion. She is in high school today.  There is Micah from Iowa, as you probably heard from Senator Ernst, who has been a stalwart on this issue. He was born at 20 weeks and is alive today to tell about it.  This is not about medical viability. Roe v. Wade says that there is a compelling State interest to protect the unborn at medical viability. I would argue that the difference between medical viability in 1973 and 2018 is enormous. What we are trying to do is provide a new theory to protect the unborn, and it goes something like this: Can a legislative body prohibit an abortion on demand at a time when science tells us that the baby feels excruciating pain, at a time when science tells us that parents should sing to their child, at a time when science tells us that a baby has well-connected tissues and can feel pain and, on occasion, can also survive? My answer is yes; it is OK for Congress and State legislators to pass laws saying that in the fifth month, we are going to disallow abortion on demand. There will be exceptions, but they will be rare. There are 10,000 cases every year that are protected by this law.  So what are we trying to do? We are trying to proceed forward to a better day in We are trying to get out of a club where there are only six other members. We are trying to reconcile the law with science.  To my friends on the other side who talk about science a lot, count me in. Science is very important. We should listen to our scientists. When it comes to climate change, I do. I am convinced that climate change is real.  You should listen to what doctors tell you about the unborn child in the fifth month. You should listen to what medical science is able to do to save the child's life. You should listen to the stories of people who actually make it at 20 weeks. You should understand that excruciating pain is felt by an unborn child in the fifth month, and America does not want to be in the club of seven countries that allow abortion on demand.  I don't know where the vote will turn out. It is probably going to be short of 60, but to those who believe in this issue, we will be back for another day. We are never going to give up until we get America in a better place. The better place, I think, would be having a country that recognizes that, in the fifth month of pregnancy, the law will be there for the child, because science is on the child's side, and we will reconcile our laws to science.  We know what science says about a baby in the fifth month. We know what the law says: They can be aborted on demand. I think there is a disconnect, not only between science and law but between what is right and where we are today. I just don't see how this makes us a better nation, to continue this practice of allowing babies to be aborted on demand in the fifth month of pregnancy when we know they feel a lot of pain. I just don't see how that makes us a better nation. We will get there, Mr.President, with your help and the help of others.  A majority of the American people are on our side when they understand what we are trying to do. There are 20 States who have some version of this, and it is just a matter of time until most States will.  As to this debate, I don't think it is a waste of time. I want to do two things. I want to get out of the club of seven nations that allow abortion on demand of babies that feel excruciating pain when they are operated on to save their lives, and I can work on behalf of the Dreamers, too. I can do two things at once. I can talk about getting America in a better spot when it comes to babies during the fifth month of pregnancy and finding a better life for I think it is kind of odd that somehow you can't do one without the other.  I want all of these Dream Act kids--young adults now--to stay in the country they know. They have no other place to go. On average, they were brought here at the age of 6 and, if you told them to go home, it wouldn't be some foreign country. It would be the home they were raised in and the life they know. So it makes perfect sense to me that we should be trying to find a solution to secure our border and fix a broken immigration system and deal compassionately with millions of young people who, through no fault of their own, have no place else to go but  It also makes sense to me that we can talk about this issue at the same time and that we as a nation will rise to the occasion and withdraw from a club where there are only six other nations on the planet that allow a baby to be aborted in the fifth month of pregnancy at a time when that child can feel excruciating pain and young parents are encouraged to sing to the child. If science urges you to sing to the child, I want the law to stop an abortion unless there is a darn good reason. Our time will come, for the Dreamers as well as the baby. Our time will come.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

304,topic-id,445,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, once again, I stand before you today to ask for your support to pass the fiscal year 2018 Defense Appropriations bill. It is past time that this essential, must-pass funding bill for our military be enacted into law. Congress must act responsibly and do its job to quickly get these dollars out the door and where they are needed as soon as possible.  The legislation before you provides $659 billion for defense, more than $60 billion above last year's levels. When combined with the almost $5 billion already enacted into law in December, this bill matches the top-line funding level in the final National Defense Authorization Act enacted into law.  All Federal dollars are not the same. We need to provide and prioritize national security after years of neglect and an increasingly dangerous international situation.  Nor can we continue to hold our troops hostage as leverage for unrelated issues. We are almost 4 months into fiscal year 2018, and our troops still don't have their funding. It is time that the Congress fulfill its responsibility to fund our troops at the levels needed.  It is time to lift the budget caps and enact a full-year Defense Appropriations Act so that our military can begin to rebuild. This bill does that by lifting the budget caps on defense and fully funding the Department at the top line already approved by the Congress in the National Defense Authorization  It takes care of our troops by providing additional manpower and fully funding a 2.4 percent pay raise, and it provides additional funding for key readiness programs and robustly funds maintenance of equipment and facilities.  The bill includes specific investments in several areas, such as air superiority, $4.3 billion above request; shipbuilding, $1.6 billion above request; research and development, $10 billion above 2017; defense health, an additional $644 million for medical research; and grants forces fully equipped.  The bill also provides additional resources in a National Defense Restoration Fund in the amount of $28.6 billion to allow Secretary Mattis to begin investing in the new defense strategy now instead of waiting a full year.                              {time}  1400  This bill gives our military leaders the sufficient, sustainable, and stable funding they have told us, over and over again, that they need.

66,topic-id,746,"Madam President, I rise today to strongly support an important nomination and also to tell you my position on the legislation before the U.Senate right now, the one Senator Sasse has just spoken eloquently about.  First, I strongly support the nomination of Minnesota's Supreme Court Justice David Stras to serve as a circuit judge on the U.Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Second, I strongly support the passage of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection I will briefly address both of these issues.  Over the next couple of days, the Senate will vote on whether to invoke cloture and then confirm the nomination of Justice David Stras to serve on the Eighth Justice Stras is eminently qualified and exceptionally bright. He has received praise and support from the legal profession and across the political spectrum.  Justice Stras is the grandson of a Holocaust survivor. He graduated 1 in his class from Kansas School of Law in 1999. He served as a law clerk to two Federal circuit judges and to a Justice on the U.Supreme Justice Stras has served on the Minnesota Supreme Court since his appointment in 2010. In 2012, he ran for a full 6-year term. He handedly defeated his opponent, winning 56 percent of the vote.  Justice Stras has received wide bipartisan support from the Minnesota legal community. He has taught law for many years at the University of He also teaches law at the University of Iowa, which is in my home Many of the faculty, including even liberal professors, such as Professor Shelly Kurtz, strongly endorse Justice Stras's nomination. His time in the private sector was spent at two highly regarded law firms.  During his service on the Minnesota Supreme Court, Justice Stras has participated in over 750 cases. As my colleague Senator Klobuchar noted, Justice Stras's judicial record demonstrates that he is impartial and apolitical in his writings. Justice Stras has sided with the Minnesota Supreme Court majority 94 percent of the time. Justice Stras has dissented one-third of the time with then-Justice Alan Page, who was the first African-American justice in Minnesota and has a record of being very liberal. Former Justice Page strongly endorses Justice Stras's nomination to the Eighth Circuit, and four former justices from all political stripes also endorsed Justice Stras's nomination. This shows me that Justice Stras will not be a rubberstamp for any political ideology. I am convinced Justice Stras will rule fairly and impartially, finding and applying the law as written, not legislating from the bench.  Justice Stras is a very accomplished and impressive nominee. He has a long judicial record of impartiality. I strongly support his nomination, and I urge all of my colleagues to do the same.  Madam President, I also come to the floor to urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection This commonsense bill recognizes that the government has an interest in protecting our children from the excruciating pain they are capable of experiencing during late-term abortions. This is a bill many Americans, including a majority of women, broadly support, and it is time we get this bill passed.  As the Judiciary Committee chairman, I convened a hearing on this bill in 2016. Three witnesses, including a[[Page S541]]Northwestern professor of pediatrics, a woman who survived a botched abortion as a baby, and a former abortion provider, offered compelling evidence in support of this very important legislation.  There is also the history of an Iowa boy, Micah Pickering, who is living proof that we need to do more to protect unborn babies at this stage of development. Micah and his parents visited me in Washington last They told me that when Micah was born at 20 weeks postfertilization, he received intensive care, including medication to minimize his pain and discomfort. Babies like Micah, born in the fifth month of pregnancy, are capable of feeling such pain. That is why it has now become routine procedure to give premature infants anesthesia for fetal surgeries.  How could anyone think these unborn babies would not experience the same excruciating pain from abortions when premature babies like Micah, from Iowa, are being born at the same stage of development and are surviving late term?  Once again, I call upon my colleagues to support the passage of this bill, entitled the ``Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act,'' and to embrace at the same time the sanctity of an innocent human life.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2018-01-29-pt1-PgS527-6.txt,457,AUTHORIZING PRODUCTION OF RECORDS,2018.0,29.0,January
132,topic-id,450,"Mr.President, I want to take a moment to discuss the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse This legislation, which Senator Feinstein sponsored and I cosponsored, would promote mandatory reporting of suspected abuse of young athletes and give survivors new tools to hold perpetrators accountable.  As Senate Judiciary chairman, I last year convened a hearing on this legislation, which helped build momentum for its committee approval and passage. I am proud to have helped shepherd this bill through our committee and the Senate, and I am delighted that we are about to send this bill to the President for his signature.  Our congressional hearing illustrated just how bad the problem of sexual abuse in youth sports has become, how long it went on, how many athletes were affected, and, in some cases, how slow the response was from those charged with ensuring these young athletes' safety. To say that I was alarmed by what we learned at that March 28 hearing would be a huge understatement.  Abuse that occurs by someone in a position of trust, in what should be a safe environment, such as youth athletics programs, is simply outrageous. Sadly, however, sports officials adopted policies that may have allowed predators to victimize children long after they had good reason to suspect sexual abuse.  Recently, we have heard reports that gymnastics officials took as long as 5 weeks to report suspected abuse to the We have also heard allegations that gymnasts were pressured to remain silent after they brought the[[Page S591]]abuse to gymnastics officials' attention. It is imperative that we uncover whatever systemic failures that allowed a predator to singlehandedly target hundreds of girls and young women for so long.  Sexual abuse is a heinous crime, so we must continue to seek justice for these victims. We also need to understand why allegations of sexual abuse so often remain hidden, instead of being immediately reported to law enforcement. The average perpetrator strikes multiple times before being caught, which is why it is so important that these crimes be promptly reported and investigated. I intend to continue to do oversight in this area and champion policies to protect the innocent from sexual abuse.  I thank each of the athletes who came forward to report abuse. Their courage helped make passage of this bill possible.  Mr.I move to concur in the House amendment, and I know of no further debate on the motion.  The PRESIDING Is there further debate?  If not, the question is on agreeing to the motion to concur.  The motion was agreed to.  Mr.I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.

933,topic-id,2009,"Madam President, I come to the floor today to talk about the Judiciary Committee, which I chair, about our important oversight work, the investigative work, and to kind of concentrate on the past year.  There are a lot of issues that need more sunlight and more scrutiny. One of my key concerns is the loss of faith in the ability of the Justice Department and the FBI to do their jobs free of partisan political bias.  The American people are rightfully skeptical because of how the Department and the FBI have handled the following subjects: on one hand, Hillary Clinton, and on the second hand, Donald Trump and his associates. Hiding from tough questions about these controversial cases is no way to reassure the public. If the Department is afraid of independent oversight, that just reinforces people's suspicion and skepticism. The only real way to reassure people is to let the sunshine in and let the chips fall where they may. In each of these cases, the government should obviously find out what happened and hold people accountable if there was any wrongdoing, but it also has to play by the rules and be held accountable for its actions as well. We need to shine the light of day on all of it.  As part of our investigation, we have requested documents and other information from the Department of Justice and the Much of that information is classified. The Department has provided very limited access to those classified materials. It has limited the Judiciary Committee's review to the chair, this Senator; the ranking member of the full committee, and that would be Senator Feinstein; and the Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism, and that would be Senator Graham and Senator The government has also tried to severely limit the number of appropriately cleared staff who can review documents and even take notes.  We have reviewed some information related to whether the FBI used a so-called Trump dossier and the extent of its relationship with its author, Christopher As we know now, Mr.Steele was hired by Fusion GPS to research Mr.Trump's alleged ties to His work was funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. Now, remember, it took a subpoena and a court battle with the House Intelligence Committee to force that fact out into the open. Lawyers for the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign officials denied it to the press for months. In other words, they lied. The founder of Fusion GPS denied that his firm was ``Democratically linked.'' That, too, was untrue.  When the news finally broke, New York Times reporters actually complained that people who knew better had flat-out lied to them about who funded Mr.Steele's dossier. But back before the 2016 election, it is unclear who knew that Steele was gathering dirt on Trump for the Democratic National Committee and for the Clinton campaign. Many of his sources for claims about the Trump campaign are Russian Government officials. So Steele, who was working for Fusion GPS, who in turn was working for the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign, was also working with the So who was actually colluding with Russians? It is becoming more clear.  Mr.Steele shared his at least partially Russian-based allegations far and wide. He shared them with the He shared them with the media. According to public reports, he shared them with high-ranking officials in the Justice Department and the State  In the course of our review, Senator Graham of South Carolina and I came across some information that just does not add up. We saw Mr.Steele swearing one thing in a public libel suit against him in London, England, and then we saw contradictory things in documents that I am not going to talk about in an open setting here. I know everybody understands that. From everything we have learned so far, Senator Graham and I believe these discrepancies are significant. So we sent a referral of Christopher Steele to the Justice Department and the FBI for potential violations of 18 U.S.1001.  I guess people are going to say whatever they want to say about this whole matter no matter what the facts are, but it doesn't contribute anything meaningful to the public debate to ignore those facts or to speculate wrongly about Senator Graham's motivations, or mine.  First, despite all the hubbub, this is not all that unusual. Anyone can ask for a criminal investigation. I have done it in the past when I have come across potential crimes in the course of my oversight work, and I have done so publicly. This situation is no different.  Second, as the special counsel has reminded us all recently, lying to Federal officials is a crime. It doesn't matter who is doing the lying, politics should have nothing to do with it.  I have said repeatedly that I support Mr.Mueller's work and I respect his role. I still do. Nothing has changed. I think it ought to be said again in case anyone missed it. The special counsel[[Page S487]]should be free to complete his work and to follow the facts wherever they lead, but that doesn't mean that I can ignore what looks like false statements. If an individual sees what might be evidence of a crime, he or she should report that to law enforcement so it can be fully investigated. That is exactly what Senator Graham and I did. That does not mean that we have made up our minds about what happened. It is possible that Mr.Steele told the truth and the other, contradictory statements that we saw were wrong. But, just as any court would do, we start by assuming that government documents are true until we see evidence to the contrary. If those documents are not true and there are serious discrepancies that are no fault of Mr.Steele's, then we have another problem--an arguably more serious problem.  Of course, even aside from these inconsistencies, the public reports about the way the FBI may have used the dossier should give everyone in this Chamber pause. Director Comey testified in 2017 that the dossier was ``salacious and unverified.'' If it was unverified in 2017, then it had to be unverified in 2016 as well. So it was a collection of unverified opposition research funded by a political opponent in an election year. Would it be proper for the Obama administration--or, for that matter, any administration--to use something like that to authorize further investigation that intrudes on the privacy of people associated with its political opponents? That should bother civil libertarians of any political stripe.  Now, I wish I could speak more openly about the basis of our referral and other concerns, but right now that information is largely classified. That information is controlled by the Justice As I said, the Department has permitted only the chair and ranking member of the full Judiciary Committee, the chair and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism of the Judiciary Committee, and a limited number of their cleared staff to see the underlying documents. I have been pushing for the Department to provide the same access to other Judiciary Committee members and their appropriately cleared staffs, but the Department refuses to provide that access or even to brief the other members on the underlying information.  Fortunately, the Department has agreed that it has no business objecting to our members reviewing our own work, so I have encouraged our committee members and their appropriately cleared staff to do just that--review that work. Look at the memo that Senator Graham and I sent to the Deputy Attorney General and the FBI Members can then make up their own minds about what Senator Graham and I have concluded.  I have also encouraged them to review the committee's transcripts and other unclassified materials that have been available to them and their staffs for a long period of time now--many months.  Finally, I have encouraged them to let me know if they believe that any of that information should be made public. I believe in transparency. We may agree that certain information should be released at the appropriate time, with care to preserve classified information and the integrity of any investigation. I have already been pushing the Department to review the classified referral memorandum to confirm the memo's classification markings so that we can release the unclassified portions as soon as possible. But now the Department has deferred to the FBI, and the FBI is falsely claiming that three of our unclassified paragraphs--each contains the same, single classified fact. Now, that really surprised me because these particular paragraphs are based on nongovernment sources and do not claim to repeat or confirm any information from any government document.  Even if these portions of our referral did reference the allegedly classified fact at issue, it is hard to understand why that fact should be classified.  First, the Deputy Attorney General has discussed the fact at issue with me more than once in an unsecure space and on an unsecure phone line. That ought to tell us something.  Second, the FBI is not acting as if this information would harm national security if released. The FBI never notified the entities copied on the memo's transmittal--for example, including the inspector general and the Intelligence Committees--to ensure that fact was protected as classified. If the FBI really believed this fact was classified, then the FBI and the Department should take better care to act consistent with that belief.  Unfortunately, I suspect something else is really going on. It sure looks like a bureaucratic game of hide the ball rather than a genuine concern about national security.  I am pressing this issue with Director Wray, and I hope we can provide this information to the public as soon as possible. In fact, just this morning, I took a long period of time to handwrite a letter to Christopher Wray, the Director of the FBI, to let him know these very concerns. It has been scanned to him, and I hope people make sure he gets it because I am not sure he always gets my letters, handwritten or typed.  I also believe that the Department should carefully review the entire memorandum and begin an orderly process to declassify as much of that information as possible.  The Intelligence Committee in the House of Representatives recently voted to allow all House Members to review a short memo summarizing what it has learned. Senators are not allowed to see what the House Members know. However, House Members who have seen it have been calling for a vote to release that memo.  Here in the Senate, the Senate Judiciary Committee has access to the same information that the House Intelligence Committee saw before drafting its summary memo. Our committee does not have the same authority to release classified information that the House committee has. We have to rely on the agency to review and potentially declassify our memo.  Based on what I know, I agree that as much of this information should be made public as soon as possible through the appropriate process--and I don't just mean the summary memos. The government should release the underlying documents referenced in those memos after deleting any national security information that needs to be protected.  But most of this story can be told, and the part that can be told should be told. The American people deserve the truth. Stale, recycled media spin from journalists and pundits who do not have all the facts is not enough. The country is filled with frenzy and speculation, but the people are very hungry for facts. However, I cannot release this information on my own, and neither should anyone else. Classified information is controlled by the executive branch. We should work together to achieve the greater transparency while still protecting legitimately sensitive national security information.  Madam President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

432,topic-id,670,"Mr.Speaker, as Members of Congress, we have an explicit constitutional responsibility to provide for the common defense. Yet some of my colleagues would rather use our military as a bargaining chip for political reasons.  For 3 days, our military was held hostage while the government shut down for an unrelated immigration issue. For 3 days, military families across the globe faced fear and uncertainty over whether they would be paid on time. Unfortunately, this is not the last time or the first time our military has been used as a political pawn. Year after year, defense spending is held hostage, causing our readiness to reach a dangerously low level.  In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee, Secretary Mattis stated: ``No enemy in the field has done more to harm the readiness of our military than sequestration.''  We are facing a host of threats from every direction; threats that jeopardize our safety, our freedom, and our way of life. North Korea is aggressively pursuing a nuclear arsenal that can target the United States and our allies. China's land reclamation has sparked international clashes. Russian opportunistic aggression is threatening our allies and could trigger a NATO alliance response. Violent extremists are threatening global stability as their evil idealogy poisons minds and induces followers to kill innocent people. Iran continues to invoke instability by sponsoring terrorism around the globe.  We expect our military to be able to respond to each of these threats, yet years of budget cuts and continuing resolutions have degrade our military's capabilities and destroyed morale.  Here are the stunning and sobering facts:  Less than half of the Navy's aircraft can fly due to maintenance and spare parts delays.  Of the 58 Army combat brigade teams that our Nation depends on to deploy overseas to defend our freedoms, only five could be called upon to fight tonight.[[Page H686]]  Last year, two Navy destroyers were involved in collisions that tragically claimed the lives of 17 sailors. These ships will undergo repairs for years to come.  I saw this personally in September when I toured the USS Fitzgerald in a naval base in I stood in the room where seven sailors died when their ship collided with a commercial freighter, tearing a hole in the side of the ship and flooding their room where they were sleeping with water in less than 2 minutes, giving them too little time to escape. It was heart-wrenching to see, and it remains heartbreaking to think about the pain these families will endure for years to come.  Perhaps saddest of all is that these accidents were not due to an enemy attack. They were due to training lapses and poor leadership which was exacerbated by high demand for service, combined with a lack of funding for needed ships and a lack of training because of defense cuts.  Last year alone, 80 U.servicemembers were killed in readiness-related accidents, nearly four times the number that were killed in hostilities.  Our men and women in uniform deserve better. We owe it to them to provide them with all that they need as they stand ready to actively fight a resurgent Russia, an emergent China, an unstable North Korea, an unpredictable Iran, and widespread violent extremism.  We cannot expect our sons and daughters to volunteer for military service and thereby volunteer to be placed in harm's way without proper equipment and adequate training.  Mr.Speaker, we must end this deadly cycle of continuing resolutions. We must end sequestration and provide for the common defense. We must approve a long-term budget that provides desperately needed increases in funding for the military.  American military superiority is not a God-given right or a law of nature. It has been earned on the backs of a motivated volunteer force. It is our duty to ensure that force is well-equipped and well-trained. The current normal is unacceptable and irresponsible.  Mr.Speaker, I call on my colleagues to end this travesty and to stand with our military as they stand for freedom for us every day.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-30-pt1-PgH685-3.txt,2032,THE VITAL ROLE OF MENTORS,2018.0,30.0,January
614,topic-id,560,"Mr.President, I rise today to oppose dangerous legislation that would endanger the health of women by limiting their constitutional right to access a safe and legal abortion. We must recognize the capacity of every woman in our Nation to make her own healthcare decisions, control her own destiny, and ensure that all women have the full independence to do so.  Unfortunately, throughout the last year, the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress have repeatedly tried to roll back access to care and undermine the health of women. We have seen bill after bill targeting women's healthcare by restricting access to abortion, increasing the costs of maternity care, and allowing insurers to treat giving birth as a preexisting condition.  The Trump administration issued interim final rules, allowing employers to deny women access to the birth control coverage they need. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have confirmed Trump administration officials and judges to the bench who are vehemently opposed to a woman's right to make her own reproductive health decisions. Republicans have been relentless in their attempts to defund Planned Parenthood, which is an essential source of care for women in New Hampshire and provides key services like birth control and cancer screenings.  Here we are, once again, with Republican leadership bringing a bill to the floor that attempts to marginalize women and take away their rights to make their own decisions. This bill[[Page S547]]would ban abortions after 20 weeks--an extremely rare procedure that is often the result of complex and difficult medical circumstances. The bill lacks adequate exceptions for survivors of rape or incest, and it gets in the way of a woman and the judgment of her doctor, threatening to jail physicians for providing patients the care they need.  In fact, a group of medical and public health organizations have written to Congress, saying: This bill places healthcare providers in an untenable situation. When they are facing a complex, urgent medical situation they must think about an unjust law instead of about how to protect the health and safety of their patients.  This bill is a direct challenge to the precedent set in Roe We are at a moment in our country when women are speaking out and fighting for basic dignity and respect at home, in the workplace, and in their daily lives. They also deserve that respect with regard to the most deeply personal health decisions they can make.  Passing this legislation would send a message to women across the country that politicians in Washington do not believe that women have the capacity to make their own healthcare decisions--as if women don't understand or are unable to grapple with the physical, emotional, economic, and spiritual issues that are involved in deciding when or if to have a family or how to handle critical health challenges.  Rather than marginalizing women, we should be doing everything we can to include them in the bipartisan work we need to do on priorities to move our Nation forward. Divisive and partisan bills like this one undermine women and undermine our strength as a country. I was proud to join many of my colleagues in voting against this bill, and I am glad that it has failed in the Senate today.  I thank the Presiding  I yield the floor.

288,topic-id,2086,"Mr.President, I rise with my good friend from Tennessee to discuss some truly landmark legislation we are introducing today that is long overdue. It is called the Music Modernization Act, and it will reshape the music licensing landscape to bring it into the 21st century.  As a songwriter myself, I have a deep interest in music issues and in ensuring we have a music licensing system that works. Unfortunately, our music licensing laws have not kept pace with technological change. We have an outdated, antiquated system that is designed for the era of CDs and cassette tapes rather than the era of digital streamlining and audio on demand.  Most of us rarely think about the complex laws that govern who can listen to what music when and who gets paid when we purchase an MP3 or listen to an interactive stream. We pay our money to iTunes or the streaming service without thinking about how that money then gets distributed to dozens or even hundreds of actors across the music industry. You have songwriters and publishers and recording artists and record labels. You have agents and broadcasters and streaming services and performing rights organizations. You have multiple copyrights across multiple individuals for the same song. It is a dense, interconnected web of licenses, rights, and legal obligations that all need and should be carefully calibrated, but our current regime is not well calibrated--far from it.  To begin with, the process of ensuring that songwriters are paid when the songs they have written are downloaded or played on the internet is a complete mess. The problem lies in matching sound recordings to the underlying musical work; that is, to the song performed in the sound recording. When a person downloads or streams a song, there are actually two sets of copyright holders whose interests come into play.  The first is the recording artist who owns a copyright in the sound recording; that is, in the recorded version of the song. Often, the recording artist will have assigned his or her copyright to a record label.  The other relevant copyright holder is the songwriter--the person who actually wrote the music and, in virtually every case, the lyrics that the recording artist performed. The songwriter owns a copyright in the song itself, in the actual words and music. Often, the songwriter will have assigned his or her copyright to a music publisher.  When a sound recording is reproduced, whether by download, interactive stream, or fixing the song on a CD or other physical object, the recording artist and songwriter or their respective assignees will both receive royalties. The recording artist receives a royalty for the sound recording itself, and the songwriter receives a royalty for the underlying song. These are called mechanical royalties because, historically, the reproduction of sound recordings was done through mechanical means. Think of a vinyl record and its grooves.  There is also a second type of royalty that comes into play when a song is performed publicly, such as on the radio, at a concert, or over a digital transmission service like This type of royalty is called, sensibly enough, a public performance royalty. Just like with mechanical royalties, it is paid to both the recording artist and the songwriter or their assignees.  As I said earlier, the problem lies in matching the sound recording to the underlying musical work; that is, in determining who should get paid when an individual downloads a song or listens to an interactive stream.  Figuring out the recording artist is pretty easy. When digital music services play music, they play sound recordings. They play a song recorded by Taylor Swift or Jay-Z or Garth Brooks or they offer the sound recording for download. In either case, determining who recorded the song is straightforward. Figuring out who the songwriter is, however, can be much more complicated.  A recording artist may play 10 different songs by 10 different songwriters on a single album or 10 separate writers may have contributed to a single song, with each being entitled to a cut. Unlike with recording artists, it is usually not apparent from the sound recording itself who the songwriter is.  Of course, the recording artist--or the record label, if the recording artist has assigned his or her rights to a record label--may know who the songwriter is, but not always, and it is simply not feasible for digital music providers to independently track down[[Page S502]]every individual songwriter for the millions of songs they offer over their services.  The problem of unmatched works--that is, works for which the sound recording has not been matched to the underlying songwriter--creates significant difficulties for both digital music providers and songwriters.  Start with digital music providers. By law, these services are required to pay mechanical royalties to songwriters for interactive streams and digital downloads. But if they don't know who the relevant songwriter or publisher is, they can't pay the royalty. This exposes digital music providers to significant liability if a songwriter or publisher later appears and asserts their rights. At the same time, songwriters get short shrift because they don't get paid when they are supposed to be. Streaming services play their songs and digital platforms offer their songs for download without paying the required royalties. As you can see, this is a complicated system. It is a bad situation all around.  That is where the legislation Senator Alexander and I are introducing today comes into play. Our bill, the Music Modernization Act, creates a blanket mechanical license for digital music providers. This license, which will be administered by a mechanical licensing collective, will enable digital music providers to obtain a single mechanical license for the music they play rather than having to individually seek out songwriters and publishers. Services that obtain the license will receive liability protection.  Songwriters and publishers, in turn, will benefit from increased royalty payments. Among the mechanical licensing collective's duties will be establishing and maintaining a public database that identifies musical works and their owners. This will help reduce the number of unmatched works.  In addition, the Music Modernization Act provides that royalties for unmatched works will be distributed after a holding period of 3 years to known copyright holders on a market-share basis. This means that rather than going unpaid, royalties for unmatched works will go to existing copyright holders according to how active each copyright holder is in the marketplace.  Our bill also contains a critical update to the rate standard for mechanical royalties for songwriters. Current law requires the Copyright Royalty Board to consider a variety of statutory factors in setting mechanical royalties. These factors, however, do not accurately reflect market demand, with the result that songwriters are paid a below-market rate. Our bill revises this standard to instruct the Board to establish rates that reflect what a willing buyer and willing seller would agree to in the marketplace.  Lastly, the bill makes two changes related to public performance royalties for songwriters. As I explained earlier, this type of royalty comes into play when a song is performed publicly, such as on the radio, at a concert, or over a digital transmission service like  Public performance royalties for songwriters and publishers are administered through performing rights organizations, or PROs, the best known of which are ASCAP and ASCAP and BMI offer blanket licenses to radio stations, restaurants, digital transmission services, and others that allow licensees to play all songs in the PRO's catalogue. These blanket licenses are governed by 1940s-era consent decrees that require all rates under the licenses to be set or approved by a Federal judge in the Southern District of New  The Music Modernization Act makes two changes relevant to these consent decrees. First, it says that any judge in the Southern District of New York may hear a rate-setting case involving ASCAP's or BMI's license fees, not just the particular judge who oversees the consent decree.  Second, the bill revises current law to allow judges in these rate-setting proceedings to consider evidence of public performance royalties paid for sound recordings in setting public performance royalties for songwriters. The purpose of this provision is to better align public performance royalties for sound recordings with public performance royalties for the underlying musical work and to ensure that songwriters are properly rewarded when a song they write becomes a hit.  As I mentioned earlier, music licensing is an incredibly complicated subject. I have endeavored today to explain the Music Modernization Act in a straightforward way that individuals not steeped in this subject can understand. The key points are as follows. First, the bill will have to solve the problem of unmatched works so that digital music providers are protected from liability and songwriters receive the royalties they are due. Second, the bill will better align royalties for songwriters with royalties for recording artists and with market demand. It will also bring much needed transparency to our music licensing system by creating a public database that identifies musical works and their owners.  I am pleased to report that our bill has broad support across the music industry, which is a tremendous thing. One of the things that makes this legislation such a breakthrough is that we have been able to get the songwriting side of the industry--the songwriters and their representatives in all these matters in the publishing and PRO community--on board with the recording and distribution side of the industry--the record labels and digital music providers. Indeed, I don't think I have ever seen a music bill that has had such broad support across the industry. All sides have a stake in this, and they have come together in support of a commonsense, consensus bill that addresses challenges throughout the music industry.  I should also note that introduction is just the start of the process. Bills change as they move through markup and floor consideration, and there are some outstanding issues in the latter part of the bill that remain to be resolved with broadcasters. I am committed to working through these issues as the bill moves forward so that we have the broadest consensus possible.  I said at the outset that I am a songwriter myself. I have a deep and abiding interest in these issues. These matters are personal to me. They are also an important part of my legacy. I am relatively unknown, and I don't expect to make a lot of money out of the music industry, but I am deeply interested in this, in making sure that those who do create these wonderful musical subjects will be treated more fairly than they are today.  I have fought long and hard for strong copyright protections my entire time in the I have passed a number of landmark copyright bills, from the Copyright Term Extension Act to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to the Family Movie  The Music Modernization Act is another in that long line of landmark legislation. In fact, I view it as the capstone of my work on copyright. I say that because I want my colleagues to know how important this bill is, not just to me but to my friends, and I want my friends in the industry to know how important this bill is to me as well. I have less than a year left in this body, and one thing that I am dead set on is enacting this bill into law before I leave.  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting and sponsoring this bill. The music we create in our country is an important part of our culture and of the message we carry to the rest of the world. Let's do everything we can to ensure we have a music licensing system that is fair, that rewards creativity, and that creates the right incentives to write, perform, and sell music. That is exactly what the Music Modernization Act will do.  I have a partner in this business of trying to get this bill through, the great Senator from the State of Tennessee, Lamar Alexander, who himself is a very accomplished musician. He is a great piano player, and he is a great friend, and he understands these issues as much as if not more than anyone else I know in the Congress of the United I just feel very indebted to him and blessed to have him as one of the people who will be working with me on this matter.

425,topic-id,535,"Now, Mr.President, turning to another subject, I would like to speak for a few minutes on Sam Brownback's recent confirmation as Ambassador at Large for International Religious I've known Governor Brownback for many years, and I am confident he will serve our Nation well in advancing and defending religious freedom across the world.  Throughout my Senate service, it has been my privilege to defend religious freedom. In 1990, for example, I served as one of the principal authors of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or RFRA, a crucially important piece of legislation that prohibits the government from substantially burdening a person's exercise of religion unless doing so is necessary to further a compelling government interest.  The bill passed the Senate 97 to 3 and passed the House without recorded opposition. This remarkable, broad support demonstrated that religious liberty is a rare issue that unites Americans of all stripes.  That unity of purpose extends to our commitment to protect this fundamental right abroad. In 1948, the Unites States was one of the original signers of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which proclaims that every person has the right to freedom of religion.  Fifty years later, Congress unanimously passed the International Religious Freedom I was proud to support this act, which declares religious freedom to be a universal human right, a pillar of our Nation, and a fundamental freedom. The law established the U.Commission on International Religious Freedom and created the position of Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom, the position to which Governor Brownback was just confirmed.  As evidenced by his work here in the Senate, Governor Brownback truly understands the need for leaders who will stand up for religious liberty and ensure that all people--no matter where they live--are able to worship how, where, or what they may.  During his 14 years in this body, Governor Brownback was involved in a wide range of issues related to religious freedom. Governor Brownback knows firsthand how crucial the Commission is in keeping our Nation and world leaders informed about the status of religious freedom throughout the world.  It seems unfathomable in this day and age, but thousands and even hundreds of thousands of our brothers and sisters throughout the world are being imprisoned, tortured, and even executed for their personal convictions. In recent remarks, Secretary of State Tillerson discussed the prevalence of religious persecution and intolerance. He noted that almost 80 percent of the global population lives with restrictions on their freedom of religion.[[Page S518]]  As a nation, we must act to protect this most fundamental, inalienable right for all people.  At his recent confirmation hearing, Governor Brownback pledged to ``stand for liberty and stand with the persecuted [and] to promote respect for religious freedom by all governments and peoples.'' I believe he will fulfill this pledge, and I thank him for his willingness to serve our country as Ambassador at Large for International Religious  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

714,topic-id,1426,"Mr.President, ensuring that America's kids have access to quality medical care is among my top priorities in the That is why, long ago, I reached across the aisle to create the revolutionary Children's Health Insurance Program, or  I am proud to call CHIP my own. Teddy Kennedy and I faced an uphill battle to get this bill passed, but we were willing to take the heat because we knew it was the right thing to do--he came on board shortly after I filed this bill--and I have never regretted it.  For more than 20 years, CHIP has served as a literal lifeline for millions of children whose families could not have otherwise afforded health insurance. Without exaggeration, this groundbreaking program has saved thousands of young lives, and it has long stood as a symbol of what our two parties can accomplish when we look beyond the horizon of our differences to find common ground.  Sadly, in today's Washington, the bipartisan spirit that breathed life into CHIP has been all but snuffed out. As a case in point, the Democrats are now holding this healthcare program hostage to their own radical agenda, using it as a bargaining chip in a dangerous political game.  After months of hard work and good faith negotiation, the progressives[[Page S427]]have, effectively, walked away from a once-in-a-generation deal to extend CHIP for 6 years--the longest extension in the program's history and something I would like to do. Unless Republicans cave to their unreasonable demands, the Federal Government will remain shut down for--who knows how long?  Rather than holding CHIP for ransom, I implore my friends on the left to work with us not only to reauthorize this beloved program but also to approve a Federal funding package so that we can get the government back up and running.  Contrary to what the Senator from Ohio asserted just a few moments ago, the Republicans have been working diligently this whole past year to get CHIP across the finish line. We did not let CHIP funding lapse but worked continually to make sure that there were sufficient funds for the program even after the fiscal year.  Under no circumstances was I ever going to let CHIP expire without taking care of it. That is why Senator Wyden and I engaged in a bipartisan process, following regular order, back in the summer. We came to an agreement together. We reported a CHIP bill out of committee on a voice vote, with plenty of time to pass it through both Since that time, I have worked with leaders to ensure that the program has been sufficiently funded in the short term until we could bring up and pass our long-term extension.  Mr.President, the idea that we would have let funding lapse is absurd, and the Senator from Ohio knows it. Moreover, the accusation that Republicans have ignored CHIP is false on its face. Give me a break. Our work is on the record, and anyone who tells you otherwise is either severely misinformed or playing political games--something that is not unusual around here, especially now.  Speaking of political games, Democrats are now saying that both CHIP and DACA are a package deal, and there is no fixing one without the other. Sounds like real support, doesn't it? But that simply isn't true. We are imposing imaginary deadlines on ourselves that will leave everyone worse off, both CHIP recipients and Dreamers alike. The truth is, we can secure CHIP funding tonight, ensuring that the 9 million kids who depend on this critical program will wake up tomorrow with the promise of continued medical care. Resolving the CHIP crisis now will then give us the breathing room we need to find a lasting solution on the DACA issue.  Let's not pretend that right now is the do-or-die moment on immigration reform. We have until March to resolve the issue, and we are going to need all of that time to make sure this gets done right.  Quite frankly, I have had enough of the Democrats' arbitrary deadlines, and I am offended by those who say that lawmakers who want to spend more time to resolve the DACA issue don't care about Dreamers and their families. I have stuck my neck out on immigration issues year after year, and I have more to show for it than most. So the idea that I don't care because I would rather do this right than simply do it now is ridiculous.  As anyone who has served more than a single term in this body can tell you, immigration is an incredibly complex issue filled with pitfalls and surprises at every turn. An issue of this sensitivity needs to be negotiated in good faith, not in the middle of a government shutdown with a gun to our heads.  On the subject of immigration reform, I am bewildered by my Democratic colleagues who insist on poisoning the well with an unnecessary government shutdown. There is no reason for my colleagues to pit their righteous crusade on immigration against their righteous crusade for This is simply a matter of priorities.  As it turns out, the American people agree with me. In fact, a CNN poll released on Friday showed that a majority of Americans feel that funding the government is more important than finding an immediate solution to the DACA We were extremely close to doing exactly what the American people wanted. Bipartisan majorities in both the House and Senate supported a noncontroversial bill to keep the government funded. But Democrats filibustered this bill, voting instead to shut down the government and block funding for They own this mess. Now we need to work together to clean it up. We won't make any progress by continuing to invent imaginary deadlines.  Now is not the time for political brinksmanship but for responsible governance. Millions are depending on us to do the right thing--and we cannot let them down. So let's get this done, and let's get it done right.  I suggest the absence of a quorum  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  Mr.Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING Without objection, it is so ordered  Mr.Mr.President, I wanted to give all of our colleagues an update on where we are. I want to start by particularly thanking Senator Graham, Senator Flake, Senator Collins, and many others who have been working across the aisle to help resolve the impasse we find ourselves in.  When the Democratic filibuster of the government funding bill comes to an end, the serious, bipartisan negotiations that have been going on for months now to resolve our unfinished business--military spending, disaster relief, healthcare, immigration, and border security--will continue.  It would be my intention to resolve these issues as quickly as possible so that we can move on to other business that is important to our country.  However, should these issues not be resolved by the time the funding bill before us expires on February 8, 2018, assuming that the government remains open, it would be my intention to proceed to legislation that would address DACA, border security, and related issues.  It is also my intention to take up legislation regarding increased defense spending, disaster relief, and other important matters.  Importantly, when I proceed to the immigration debate, it will have an amendment process that is fair to all sides. I would hope there would be cooperation on these matters in advance of yet another funding deadline.  There is a bipartisan, bicameral group that will continue its negotiations and I look forward to the completion of their work. It would be my strong preference for the Senate to consider a bipartisan, bicameral proposal that can be signed into law. But the first step in any of this is reopening the government and preventing any further delay.  The shutdown should stop today. We will soon have a vote that will allow us to do exactly that.  Let's step back from the brink. Let's stop victimizing the American people and get back to work on their behalf.  Mr.President, in that regard, I ask unanimous consent that, notwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate vote at 10 p.m. tonight on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to concur with amendment; further, that if cloture is invoked, all postcloture time be considered expired and the Senate immediately vote on the motion to concur with further amendment with no intervening action or debate.

930,topic-id,1106,"Mr.President, earlier this week, the Senate voted to pass a continuing resolution to reopen the government. This came after weeks of acrimony and no shortage of hostility here on the Senate floor and elsewhere. While most of the recent debate has been focused on the future of immigration policy, another vitally important priority--and a bipartisan priority, no less--was also addressed this week.  I am talking, of course, about the 6-year extension of the Children's Health Insurance Program, which was included in the funding bill. It is a shame, really, that this bipartisan accomplishment has, in some respects, been overlooked while more attention has been given to partisan squabbling over other divisive issues.  Since its inception, CHIP has been a bipartisan program. In 1997, Senator Kennedy and I came together to create CHIP in order to provide health insurance to vulnerable children. It was a Republican-controlled Congress working with a Democratic President that brought this program into existence.  The year before, that same Republican Congress and Democratic President worked together to produce another landmark welfare reform bill that sought to replace a culture of dependency with an emphasis on work. S-CHIP became a necessity for those families making the transition.  Prior to the introduction of the original CHIP bill, I came across a number of families with parents who worked but still could not afford private coverage for their children. Yet they made too much to qualify for Senator Kennedy and I designed our bill to fill this gap and meet those needs.  Today, the CHIP program provides health insurance for about 9 million needy children every year. While the program isn't perfectly designed--though few programs are--it is widely considered to be one of the most efficient and cost-effective healthcare programs. For that reason, Members from both parties have been supportive of the program since the day it was signed into law.  Last year, with an extension deadline approaching, Senator Wyden, the ranking member of the Finance Committee, and I went to work on drafting another bipartisan CHIP bill, one that would make needed improvements to the program and extend it for an additional 5 years. We were successful. We introduced our bill in September and, shortly thereafter, the Finance Committee marked it up and reported it by voice vote.  We have been working to pass our bill since last September, and, thankfully, that time came earlier this week. When we voted to pass the CR, we also voted to successfully extend CHIP for 6 years. That is the longest CHIP extension in the history of this program.  Other than that extra year of funding, the bill we passed was identical to the one Senator Wyden and I introduced last year. I know we have colleagues already talking about adding additional years, and I know a number of stakeholders would like to see that as well. I am definitely open to having a conversation with my colleagues on how we might move forward to support an additional 4 years of funding for  In my view, if we can work together to pass a bill adding 4 years to the 6 already in place, that would be simply fantastic, but for this moment, let us not overlook the success we have achieved this week. A 6-year CHIP extension gives security and certainty to millions of American families and allows States to plan their budgets for several years into the future. That is a big deal. Let us keep that in mind as we look for ways to do more.  I would like to thank Senator Wyden, my partner on the Finance Committee, for his efforts in developing this legislation. I would like to thank other members of the Senate Finance Committee who supported us all the way. Thank you to our distinguished majority leader and his team, as well as the leaders in the House who worked alongside us. I also thank the stakeholders across the country--the Governors, care providers, and of course the families who depend on CHIP for making their voices heard throughout this endeavor. I look forward to working with all of you going forward so we can make sure we do right by the children who benefit from  Now, Mr.President, I would like to turn to a related issue in the healthcare space. The Senate will soon vote on President Trump's nominee for Secretary of Health and Human I can think of very few others--and I have only been here 42 years--but I can think of very few others as qualified to take the helm of this very large ship than Mr.Alex  As Secretary of Health and Human Services, Mr.Azar would be responsible for trillions of dollars in spending, liabilities, and contracts that make up the backbone of our healthcare system.  What is more, Health and Human Services is still in the process of off-ramping many of the poor decisions made throughout the 8 years of the Obama administration. Unfortunately, many of those policies, regulations, procedures, and practices remain in place, continuing to undermine the sustainability of programs like Medicare and Medicaid, and artificially propping up the so-called Affordable Care  The good news is, Mr.Azar brings with him nearly two decades of experience in the healthcare system, working in both the private and public sectors. Mr.Azar spent several years as a senior official at Health and Human Services, holding key positions overseeing Medicare Part D and Medicare He also led Health and Human Service's responses to the anthrax victims shortly after 9/11, the SARS and monkeypox crises, Hurricane Katrina, and many others.  Clearly, Mr.Azar has seen both the good and the bad at Health and Human Services and knows how to manage them. I don't think there is anyone here, even on the other side of the aisle, who would contest that. In fact, in the past, Mr.Azar has actually been confirmed twice. With experience both on the company side and the government side of healthcare, he is now only more experienced and knowledgeable.  I think the broad exercise will serve him well, particularly at this critical time when the Health and Human Services Secretary will need to be intensely focused on the opioid epidemic and other major problems facing our country. No doubt all of these are reasons why we reported Mr.Azar out of the Finance Committee with a bipartisan vote. If we set aside the partisan and the preconceived notions some have about certain industries, Mr.Azar would likely get a near-unanimous vote.  I hope at least some of our Democratic colleagues will vote to confirm him. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in doing so.  I yield the floor.

966,topic-id,2955,"Mr.President, I rise today to discuss the pressing need to reform our high-skilled immigration system. This is an issue I've championed for a number of years and one that becomes only more urgent with each passing season.  It is also an issue that I believe ties in directly with the recent discussions we have been having about merit-based immigration. As I said on the floor last week, high-skilled immigration is merit-based immigration. It is immigration targeted at the best, the brightest, and the most highly educated. It is immigration targeted at individuals who have the skills employers need. If we want to have a discussion about individuals who will add value to our economy, who will bring critical skills to the table, and who will help keep our country competitive, high-skilled immigration is what we should be talking about.  For years, we have had a system for bringing high-skilled workers from other countries to the United States to fill jobs for which there is a shortage of American labor. This system does not replace American jobs. Rather, it supplements our workforce with talent from other countries in industries where there are simply not enough qualified American workers to meet demand.  But the system is badly out of date. To begin with, it caps the number of high-skilled worker visas--also called H-1B visas--that employers can obtain each year at a number that is far below demand. This year, just like last year and the year before, USCIS reached the annual cap on H-1B visas within the first week that visa petitions could be submitted. In fact, during that single week, USCIS received over twice as many visa petitions as there were available visas.[[Page S522]]  Our laws also lack a straightforward path for companies to hire American-educated students from other countries on a permanent basis after graduation. We educate some of the world's best and brightest here in America and then send them back home because they can't get permanent work in the United That makes no sense. In fact, it is just plain stupid.  There is also a significant backlog for skilled professionals and advanced degree holders who want to come to the United States on green cards. These are the very individuals we should be encouraging to come to our country--individuals who have the technical skills our science and technology companies need and who will earn good salaries and contribute meaningfully to our economy--and yet we respire them to wait years and years to obtain a green card. Again, you want to talk about merit-based immigration? These are the folks we should be welcoming to our country with enthusiasm. Instead, we throw up barrier after barrier until many simply give up.  At the same time, a handful of companies have found ways to game the H-1B system to displace American employees with lower paid foreign workers. We have all seen the news stories: American workers told they are being replaced with foreign personnel and that if they want to receive a severance package or a positive employer reference, they better train their replacements. These stories disgust me as they should disgust all Under no circumstances should an employer be able to use a program that was designed to mitigate workforce shortages to put hardworking Americans out of a job. That was never the intent of the H-1B program, and it must not be allowed to continue.  There are also other problems with the H-1B program that we need to fix. Too often, large employers crowd out small businesses by submitting far more visa petitions than they actually need. This practice can lead to wasted visas and puts small employers at a significant disadvantage in the H-1B lottery.  Another problem concerns H-1B workers who wish to transition to green card status. Because of the significant backlog in employment-based green cards, high-skilled workers who wish to come to the United States on a permanent basis often start out on H-1B visas, and because of quirks in our immigration laws, these workers must stay with their original sponsoring employers until green cards become available, which may take 10 years or longer. During this time, the employee may be forced to accept below-market wages or suboptimal working conditions just to stay in the green card queue. If the employee were to take a higher paying, or better, job at another company, the employee would lose his or her place in the green card line. This creates a power imbalance between H-1B workers and employers that leads to a whole host of issues.  So there are a number of problems we need to address with our high-skilled immigration system.  That's why today I am introducing my Immigration Innovation Act, or I-Squared, to bring our high-skilled immigration system into the 21st century. This critical legislation contains reforms that will end abuse, provide a clearer path for individuals educated in the United States to stay in the United States, and enable employers more easily to hire the talent they need.  I would like to thank my good friend from Arizona, Senator Flake, for cosponsoring I-Senator Flake and I have worked together for a long time on this issue, and I am grateful for his leadership.  Many of my colleagues are familiar will I-I have introduced previous versions in the last two The version I am introducing today, however, has a number of important changes. In many ways, it is a different bill. Allow me to highlight some of the changes.  Like previous versions, my updated I-Squared bill raises the annual H-1B cap to better meet market demand. In fact, it ties the cap to market demand so that the cap increases and decreases as demand increases and decreases. It also enables H-1B workers to change jobs without losing their H-1B status and allows foreign students attending American universities to declare an intent to stay in the United States following graduation so they can more easily secure full-time employment. Lastly, the bill authorizes the recapture of unused green cards from previous years and eliminates per-country green card caps, which unfairly discriminate against individuals from countries with larger numbers of applicants.  Here is what is new to I-Squared this  First, and most importantly, the bill creates an express prohibition on hiring an H-1B worker with the purpose and intent to replace an American worker. That was never the intent of the H-1B program and must not be allowed to happen.  Second, the bill creates an express prohibition on conditioning an employee's pay or severance on training an H-1B replacement.  Third, the bill raises the level-1 wage employers must pay to prevent employers from using H-1B workers to undercut labor costs.  Fourth, the bill updates the 1998 law that exempts H-1B employers from certain recruitment and non-displacement requirements if the employer pays its H-1B employees a high enough salary. Specifically, the bill raises the salary threshold to match inflation and eliminates the exemption altogether for particularly heavy users of H-1 Fifth, the bill imposes penalties on employers who file more H-1B petitions than they need to prevent large, cash-rich employers from freezing out small businesses. All of these provisions will work to tamp down on the abuses we have seen in the H-1B system.  My updated I-Squared bill will also end the problem of H-1B workers who are on the path to a green card from being locked into their current jobs by enabling such workers to change jobs earlier in the process without losing their places in the green card line, and it creates a new, streamlined green card process for high-skilled workers who wish to come to the United States on a permanent basis to obtain conditional residency without having to use the cumbersome H-1B system.  Many of the problems with our current H-1B program stem from the fact that workers seeking temporary employment and workers seeking long-term employment are funneled into the same system. My updated I-Squared bill will help separate these two employment streams in ways that will benefit both employers and employees.  Finally, my updated I-Squared bill will provide nearly $1 billion in new funding for STEM education and worker training programs without raising a single cent in taxes. It does this by increasing fees for H-1B petitions and green cards and directing the new funding to State block grants for STEM training.  In many ways, this last piece is the most important provision of I-The STEM disciplines--science, technology, engineering, and math--are going to be critical to our country's success in the coming decades. Increased funding for STEM education and worker training programs will help ensure that we have the workforce we need to succeed in the global economy. It will help produce more graduates with the computer science and engineering skills high-tech employers require. It will enable workers displaced by globalization and the changing economy to acquire new, in-demand skills so they can restart their careers, and if we're successful, increased STEM funding may even reduce the demand for H-1B and other skilled visas in the first place because it will better align our workforce with employer needs.  I-Squared is supported by a broad coalition of tech commies, trade associations, and other job creators. I ask unanimous consent at this time to be printed in the Record a number of letters in support of the bill, including letters from the Information Technology Industry Council and the Semiconductor Industry Other key stakeholders who will be issuing statements of support include Microsoft, Facebook, the Internet Association, and the Software  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:[[Page S523]]                                                          ITI,                                 Washington, DC, January 22, 2018.     Re Immigration Innovation Act of 2018.     Orrin Hatch,     U.Senate,     Washington,       Dear Senator Hatch: On behalf of the 60 members of the      Information Technology Industry Council (ITI), I write to      express our strong support for your legislation, the      Immigration Innovation (I-Squared) Act of 2018. ITI is the      voice of the high-tech community, advocating for policies      that advance U.leadership in technology and innovation,      open access to new and emerging markets, protect and enhance      consumer choice, and encourage domestic and global      competition. Our membership includes companies from all      verticals of the technology sector, including semiconductor,      network equipment, software, digital services, hardware,      mobile device, and internet companies.       We have long advocated for changes to our immigration      system that allow employers to attract and retain the world's      best and highly-educated employees so that we can continue to      innovate and compete in a global marketplace. Our members are      committed to growing the U.economy and creating jobs for--     and protecting--American workers. In fact, in the tech      sector, we are producing jobs faster than we can fill them.      In 2016, there were approximately 3.3 million science,      technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) job openings      posted online. By contrast, in that same year, U.     universities graduated 568,000 students with STEM degrees. To      meet this job demand, it is vital we not only provide STEM      education and training to more American students and workers,      but that we also ensure U.S.-based employers can recruit the      top talent from American universities and from abroad.       The United States is in dire need of a renewed skilled      immigration system and the economic benefits of such reforms      could not be clearer. For example, over 230,000 additional      computer-related jobs would have been created for American      workers if not for the 2007 and 2008 H-1B visa petition      denials. Furthermore, more than half of the startup companies      valued at over $1 billion in the United States were founded      by at least one immigrant, many of whom initially came here      on H-1B visas. On average, each of these companies now      employs 760 Yet, our broken immigration system      continues to stymie such talent and future innovation.       ITI welcomes the introduction of the I-Squared Act of 2018.      This critical legislation would upgrade our immigration      system for the 21st century economy in several ways. First,      it will reset the number of H-1B visas and allow their      availability to adjust to meet market demands. Second, it      reforms the green card system in ways that will reduce the      current backlog, and enable the most exceptional and highly-     skilled foreign-born individuals to innovate, start new      companies, and advance their professional development and      success in the United Third, the legislation reflects      our industry's commitment to protect American workers, as      well as our support for domestic STEM education and training      programs.       The I-Squared Act is much-need legislation that will enable      skilled workers who wish to work in the United States to      propel American innovation, engender growth in our economy,      and help create jobs here at home. We commend you for your      diligence on this important issue and urge both the House and      Senate to support this important legislation.           Sincerely,                                                 Dean Garfield,     President and                                  ____                                                     Semiconductor                                         Industry Association,                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 2018.     Orrin Hatch,     Washington,       Dear Senator Hatch: On behalf the Semiconductor Industry      Association (SIA), I am writing to express our strong support      for the Immigration Innovation Act of 2018 (``I-Squared      Act'').       High-skilled immigration reform is a critical priority for      the U.semiconductor industry. In order to compete      globally, SIA member companies require the talent of the best      and brightest scientists and engineers in the world. U.     colleges and universities attract the best students to      America to obtain advanced degrees in science, technology,      engineering and mathematics (STEM). Many of these students      significantly contribute to the U.innovation ecosystem      through federally and privately funded research during their      graduate training. Upon graduation, these highly educated      STEM graduates very often want to work in the U.S., but are      too often compelled to return to their home countries where      they compete with U.companies. This has the impact of      reducing the competitiveness of U.companies and      restricting growth of our economy.       The I-Squared Act would strengthen the U.economy and      promote innovation by making important improvements to the H-     1B and the green card programs. These necessary reforms will      help spur innovation and create thousands of high paying      manufacturing and research jobs here in       SIA appreciates your leadership on the I-Squared Act, and      we look forward to working with you to ensure its prompt      enactment into law.

CFGI and SHRM Applaud Immigration Innovation Act of 2018    The I-Squared bill is the right solution for employers and the                                workforce       Alexandria, Va.--The Council for Global Immigration (CFGI)      and the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) applaud      today's introduction of the Immigration Innovation Act of      2018 (I-Squared). The bill includes provisions to modernize      the high-skilled employment-based immigration system in a way      that would work for all who have a stake in immigration,      including employers and the workforce.       The legislation, introduced by Orrin Hatch (R-Utah)      and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), would establish a voluntary      trusted employer program, among other provisions. Consistent      with a CFGI proposal, a trusted employer program would make      the system more efficient for employers and the government.       ``This legislation would ensure that employers acting in      good faith have access to the top global talent they need to      compete, while providing additional resources to train and      educate U.workers in high-demand STEM fields,'' said Lynn      Shotwell, executive director of ``It would also reform      the H-1B program with enhanced protections for U.workers,      an important change that CFGI supports.       ``We endorse the bill's provision that would keep today's      green card system in place, but provide a more direct path to      a green card when there are no able, willing or qualified      U.workers available,'' Shotwell continued. ``This option      would make it easier for professionals to accept employment      with new employers, a key change we support. We will include      this legislation in Congress as part of our advocacy efforts      to advance fair, innovative and competitive immigration      reforms.''       The members of CFGI and SHRM are working to create a 21st      century workplace that empowers employers and the workforce      to compete and win in an increasingly competitive global      economy. Building an immigration system that is fair,      innovative and competitive is a critical component to      realizing this goal.       ``We applaud Senators Hatch and Flake for their commitment      to invest in the future of the U.workforce and modernize      our nation's outdated employment-based immigration system in      a way that works for the workforce,'' said Mike Aitken,      SHRM's vice president of government affairs.       ``This legislation addresses many of the serious challenges      facing employers navigating the current maze of immigration      laws and regulations, including eliminating green card      backlogs and modernizing the H-1B visa system,'' Aitken      added. ``These reforms are a critical component to building      and supporting a 21st century workplace in which employers      and the workforce can thrive.''       CFGI and SHRM are eager to work on the bill as it moves      forward.                                  ____    SIIA Says I-Squared Act Is Critical for U.Economy and Global                             Competitiveness                            [25, 2018]       Washington D.C.--The Software & Information Industry      Association (SIIA) today welcomed the introduction of the      ``Immigration Innovation (I-Squared) Act of 2018,'' by      Senators Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Jeff Flake (R-AZ).       SIIA Senior Vice President for Public Policy, Mark      MacCarthy, issued the following statement:       ``The U.IT industry--and the American economy more      broadly--has long benefited from the contributions of highly-     educated workers, regardless of where they were born. The I-     Squared Act will make critical reforms to the U.     immigration laws to help U.companies attract and retain      the best and most innovative employees from around the world.       ``This bill will greatly enable continued U.innovation,      job creation, and economic expansion, while preventing abuses      of the H-1B program that could harm U.workers. The      legislation also promotes the American education system by      funding state grants to promote STEM education and training      in the U.      ``SIIA thanks Senators Hatch and Flake for co-sponsoring      the I-Squared Act, and we look forward to working with them      and other congressional leaders to enact this critical      legislation.''

967,topic-id,365,"Mr.President, there is a lot of debate about immigration right now. We all know that we need to do something about I know that as well as anyone. I have been working on a solution for the Dreamer population for a very long time, and we are going to find a solution. We also need to do something about border security and interior enforcement so we don't end up back in the same place 20 years from now.  But we can walk and chew gum at the same time, and I think talking about merit-based immigration is a good thing. It is an important principle.[[Page S524]]  As we do so, we need to remember that we already have merit-based programs built into our existing immigration laws. The problem is those programs aren't working the way they are supposed to. They are not properly aligned with employer needs, and in their current set-up, there is too much room for waste and abuse.  My I-Squared bill will fix both of those problems. It will help ensure we have the talent in our country that we need to succeed. It will also help equip the next generation of Americans to meet the demands of our increasingly tech-driven economy.  I-Squared will also help put an end to the troubling abuses we have seen in the H-1B program and ensure that the program is used as it was intended--to supplement, not replace, American labor.  I repeat what I said at the outset: High-skilled immigration is merit-based immigration. It is immigration targeted at the best, the brightest, and the most highly educated.  As we debate how to improve our immigration system, let us keep in mind that we already have merit-based programs in our existing laws. Thinking outside the box is important, but it is also important not to overlook what is right here in front of us.  My I-Squared bill will help ensure that we have a high-skilled immigration system that works, that meets employer needs, that keeps America competitive, and that prepares the next generation of Americans to succeed.

56,topic-id,1593,"Madam President, I would like to thank my friend Senator Murray for organizing this block of time for us--you have just heard from Senator Warren--and for all the work Senator Murray has done to fight for women all across the country.  Today's debate is the latest battle in the continuing assault on a women's constitutionally protected right to an abortion. As decided by the Supreme Court in Roe and reaffirmed in Casey, the right to an abortion is rooted fundamentally in a women's right to privacy, but the Supreme Court's recognition of this constitutionally protected right has not prevented continuous efforts to limit that right.  I ask my Republican colleagues who are on a mission to limit a woman's constitutional right to choose: What is more private than a person's right to her own body--not just to control her body but to literally own her body? What could be more private than that? That is what is at stake as we debate the bill before us today.  My home State of Hawaii was the first State in the country to legalize abortion, and it continues to be at the forefront of protecting, expanding, and preserving this constitutional right. But for every law we fought to pass, we have had to fight just as hard to beat back a wide range of anti-choice legislation.  Republican-controlled State legislatures have enacted hundreds of limitations on choice. These efforts have not abated in the States or even in Courts have deemed many of these laws unconstitutional. That is why Donald Trump and the entire conservative movement have prioritized selecting, appointing, and confirming judges who are ideologically sympathetic to their views on choice.  The Trump administration is also eroding this right through Executive action. In one prominent example last year, a senior official at the Department of Health and Human Services went to court to impose his own ideological views to prevent a young woman in his care from obtaining an abortion after forcing her to undergo anti-abortion counseling. Fortunately, the DC Circuit Court stopped this official from forcing this young woman to be pregnant against her will.  The Republican Congress is complicit as well. Over the past 7 years of Republican control, the House and Senate voted to defund Planned Parenthood more than 20 times.  I understand that this is an emotionally charged issue and that each of us has strongly held and sincere positions, but it really shouldn't be too much to ask for my colleagues to stay out of my private life and the private lives of women all across the country. That is called respecting each other's views. Why should we institutionally force other people who do not share your views to basically have to live with your version of the choices that we all ought to be able to make in our lives?  The bill we are debating today would jeopardize the health and safety of women by establishing a nationwide ban on abortion care after 20 weeks. This bill is arbitrary, and it is not meaningfully different from the Arizona law deemed unconstitutional by the Ninth Circuit in 2014, a case that the Supreme Court let stand.  This bill fails to account for the reasons why a woman might seek an abortion after 20 weeks, and it restricts the ability of women to make the best decisions for themselves and their families.  This bill includes no exception allowing for abortion in the case where the pregnancy is a risk to the woman's health. Instead, a doctor would only be able to provide care after establishing that a woman would die--would die--or suffer life-threatening injuries without an abortion. How cruel can this bill be that the only exception is when a woman is about to die before she can get the care she needs?  To make matters worse, this bill places additional burdens on women who survive the horrors of sexual assault. Under this bill, a sexual assault survivor must provide written proof she had obtained counseling or medical treatment to receive an abortion. However, a woman's own OB/GYN could not provide this counseling if he or she provides abortion services or, even worse, has a practice that provides them.  Adult women who are able to qualify under these outrageous conditions would still have to wait 48 hours before they could receive abortion care.  If the survivor is a minor, the law establishes an additional burden to prove she reported the crime to the authorities. According to the Department of Justice, only 35 percent of women who are raped and sexually assaulted report the crime to the police.  Victims of incest who are over 18 would also not be specifically permitted an exception under this bill.  This legislation would even threaten doctors with fines and/or imprisonment for providing abortion services to women who do not meet the bill's narrow exceptions after 20 weeks.  But the outrage doesn't end there. This bill does not contain an exception for cases where a woman's fetus is not developing properly and has no chance at living after birth. Many of the women in these circumstances desperately wanted the pregnancies they are choosing to terminate.

It was very unlikely that our baby      would survive delivery, and if he did, he would ultimately      need a heart transplant.       In the days that followed, after the poking and prodding,      after the meetings with pediatric cardiologists,      cardiothoracic surgeons and geneticists, my husband and I      decided to terminate our pregnancy. I was 22 weeks pregnant      when they wheeled me into the operating room, two weeks shy      of viability in the state of       For us, the decision was about compassion for our unborn      baby, who would face overwhelming and horribly painful      obstacles. Compassion for our 2-year-old son, who would      contend with hours upon hours in a hospital, missing out on      invaluable time spent with his parents, and the death of a      very real sibling. It was about compassion for our marriage.      Perhaps most important, it was about our belief that      parenthood sometimes means we sacrifice our own dreams so our      children don't have to suffer.       As the day of my termination approached and I felt my      baby's kicks and wiggles, I simultaneously wanted to crawl      out of my skin and suspend us together in time. I wanted him      to know how important he was to me, that the well of my grief      and love for him would stretch deeper and deeper into the      vastness of our family's small yet limitless life. He may      have moved inside me for only five months, but he had touched      and shaped me in ways I could never have imagined.       To Donald Trump and politicians like him, a late-term      abortion is the stuff of '80s slasher films. ``You can take      the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother,''      Mr.Trump said during Wednesday night's debate, a description      void of consideration for women, medical professionals or the      truth. Such politicians would have you believe that women      like me shouldn't get to make the choice I made. That our      baby, despite his tiny misshapen heart and nonexistent aorta,      should have a chance ``to live,'' even though that life might      have lasted mere minutes. Even though that life would have      been excruciatingly painful. These politicians are ignorant      of the sacrifices and blessings that come with carrying a      pregnancy (let alone a nonviable pregnancy). They do not      understand that a majority of women who have late-term      abortions are terminating desperately wanted pregnancies.       I am fortunate to live in a state that allows abortions      after 20 weeks. At least 13 states restrict such procedures;      15 more have moved to defund Planned Parenthood, where many      low-income women go for reproductive care.       Many women have made the kind of difficult decision I had      to make. When it happens to you, they come out of the      woodwork. Friends, neighbors, colleagues. A friend of my      mother-in-law said to me early on, ``You will always carry      this loss, but someday, it won't define you.''       As the two-year anniversary of my abortion approaches, I      can say without a shadow of a doubt that we made the right      decision for our family--and that our government has      absolutely no place in the anguish which accompanies a late-     term abortion, except to ensure that women and their families      have the right to make their choice safely and privately.[[Page S535]]       Saying goodbye to our boy was the single most difficult and      profound experience of my life, and the truth is, it has come      to define me.

57,topic-id,722,"Meredith was 21 weeks pregnant when she learned that her second baby boy was missing half of his heart. It had stopped growing properly at around 5 weeks, but it wasn't detectable until her 20-week anatomy scan. Meredith's decision to terminate her pregnancy was an agonizing one, but as she weighed her options, she reflected on the meaning of compassion, and she said:       For us, the decision was about compassion for our unborn      baby, who would face overwhelming and horribly painful      obstacles. Compassion for our 2-year-old son, who would      contend with hours upon hours in a hospital, missing out on      invaluable time spent with his parents, and the death of a      very real sibling. It was about compassion for our marriage.      Perhaps most important, it was about our belief that      parenthood sometimes means we sacrifice our own dreams so our      children don't have to suffer.  Meredith asserted--and I agree--that our government has no place in the anguish that accompanied her decision to have an abortion.  Meredith closed her essay with a very poignant reflection on her own experience 2 years later. She wrote:       Saying goodbye to our boy was the single most difficult and      profound experience of my life, and the truth is, it has come      to define me. Today I am a better mother because of him. I am      a better wife, daughter and friend. He made me more      compassionate and more patient. He taught me to love with      reckless abandon, despite the knowledge that I could lose it      all.  Meredith and her husband named him Lev, the Hebrew word for ``heart.''  Meredith was fortunate in that she lived in a State that permitted abortions past 20 weeks. Thirteen States have established a 20-week abortion ban, and the women living in those States have suffered as a result. Think about all the Merediths in those 13 States and many others.  Recently, I heard from Ghazaleh Moayedi, an OB/GYN who has practiced medicine in Texas, which has a 20-week abortion ban, and in Hawaii, a State that has strong protections for women seeking to exercise their constitutional right to an abortion. Her experience clarifies why it is so urgent that we defeat this bill.  Moayedi shared a story of a young woman in her town who sought medical treatment at a medical provider after her water broke at 22 weeks. This was in Although she desperately wanted her pregnancy, her fetus was not viable outside the womb. Because of the Texas law, this patient's doctors were unable to counsel her on all medically appropriate options, such as immediate delivery. As she became increasingly ill, the patient requested an abortion to prevent her condition from getting worse. The doctors on her case refused. After spending 2 weeks in a hospital intensive care unit, this woman was transferred to Moayedi's care, where she ultimately had to have both her hands and feet amputated due to severe infection. She also lost her baby.  Moayedi recently moved from Texas to Hawaii, where she now provides lifesaving abortion care to women at all stages of pregnancy.  Recently, Moayedi had a patient with a desired pregnancy who was flown in from a neighbor island for management of her pre-viable labor. Despite the expert, specialist care she received, the patient's water broke at 22 weeks. At that point, there was nothing Moayedi could do to prevent labor. Because abortion is legal after 20 weeks in Hawaii, Moayedi was able to provide lifesaving abortion care for her patient and prevent her from developing a massive infection.  Moayedi put it plainly in her note: ``Restrictions on abortion care endanger the lives of my patients.''  ``Restrictions on abortion care endanger the lives of my patients.'' And that is exactly what this bill will do. It will endanger the lives of millions of women in this country who do not--who do not--make the decision to have an abortion after 20 weeks lightly. As my colleague from Massachusetts said, most abortions take place before 20 weeks.  We are passing a cruel, unconscionable, and indeed unconstitutional law. Why are we doing that? Why these continuing attacks on a woman's health, her economic well-being, and her ability to control her own body?  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this unconscionable bill.

667,topic-id,1372,"Mr.President, when Donald Trump was a private citizen during the last government shutdown, he said:       Problems start from the top, and they have to get solved      from the top, and the President's the leader, and he's got to      get everybody in a room, and he's got to lead.  That is what Donald Trump said when he was Citizen He is now the Now that he is the President, he has those shoes to wear. He refuses to step into them and step up. The only person who actually said that maybe we need a good shutdown is President Although I have to say that, recently, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney also said it was ``cool'' to shut down the government--unbelievable. It is definitely not cool. This attitude may explain why the President keeps shooting down bipartisan efforts to prevent a shutdown.  Republicans control the House and the I don't know why we have to keep reminding Republicans that they control the House and the There is no reason for the majority leader and the Speaker to enable this Trump shutdown to continue. There is no reason to wait on the President to tell them to do whatever or to tell them what he believes, because Donald Trump is a changeling. He is incapable of being consistent. I witnessed this 2 weeks ago when I went to the White House with a bipartisan group of Members of Congress to find a path forward to protect the During the meeting, in front of all of us and on national TV for over 50 minutes, Donald Trump promised to sign whatever bipartisan compromise that Congress came up with. He said he would take the heat. We had barely driven back to the Capitol before he went back on that promise. This pattern repeated on Friday, when the Democratic leader discussed a broad, bipartisan compromise with the President to keep the government open, and after appearing to agree on a framework, the President, shortly thereafter, said no.  Once again, this is Donald Trump's shutdown. It is important to understand who is responsible for this shutdown. He himself said it is the President who is supposed to be bringing everybody together. But, frankly, it is more important to end the shutdown. It is time for Congress to lead.  Congress is a separate branch of government, and we should start acting like it. We can come to a broad, bipartisan agreement on nearly every part of a deal to end this shutdown. We can reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program, which provides health insurance to 9 million children all across the country. We can fund community health centers, which provide healthcare for hundreds of millions of people in our communities. We can protect the We can fully[[Page S411]]fund the Department of Defense and provide funding parity for critical domestic programs. Congress shouldn't wait around for the President to make up his mind. Let's do our jobs.  I support passing a very short-term funding bill, somewhere in between 1 and 3 days, which we have proposed, to sustain the urgency in getting this done in as short a time as possible. So a multiweek extension of government funding that allows the President, the majority leader, and the Speaker to kick the can down the road and pit one group against another is not the way to go.  The Republicans continue to pit the Children's Health Insurance Program against Dreamers, and they pit funding for troops against Dreamers, pitting one group after another on and on. Are the Republicans saying that we can only take care of one group or the other? Do we cut off the right arm or the left arm? We have seen this ``pitting one group against another'' strategy at work all week.  Authorization for the Children's Health Insurance Program expired on September 30, months ago, but the majority leader waited until now to put it up for a vote because he hoped to use it as leverage to divide Democrats and leave Dreamers out in the cold, pitting one group against another. Just as a reminder, guess who spent months and months trying to take away healthcare from millions of Americans and more months to provide the richest 1 percent of people and corporations in our country with huge tax cuts, all behind closed doors? The Republicans--that is who. We could have and should have funded the Children's Health Insurance Program months ago. We could have come to a compromise on Dreamers months ago.  The majority leader has come to the floor repeatedly to argue that there is no urgency to protect the Dreamers or the DACA participants, that we have months to find a solution. Doesn't he know that more than 16,000 people have lost their DACA protections since Donald Trump cruelly and cynically ended the program in September, and every single day, 122 DACA recipients lose their status. These young lives are on hold. They are scared, and they are afraid of being kicked out of the only country they know and love, and that is the United States of  Over the past few days, we have heard the President and the majority leader continuously disrespecting these inspiring young people by referring to them as illegals. That is how you take away an individual's humanity, by categorizing them as one group or another--as illegals. I have met many of these DACA recipients. They are not illegals. They are legally protected under the DACA Program to be in the United They want to make a contribution to the only country they know,  It is Dreamers like Leonardo, from Oregon, who came to my office in late December, shared his immigrant story and why he is fighting to be able to stay in the United Leonardo came to our country with his siblings and his mom, who was fleeing an abusive marriage. Growing up, Leonardo hardly saw his mom, who took public transportation to work the night shift and slept most of the day. He told me that, as he has gotten older and as he has had to work so hard to make ends meet, he truly appreciates the sacrifices his mom made to ensure that he had food and clothes. Like many young high school students, Leonardo dreamed of going to college. Because he was ineligible for financial aid as an undocumented student, he saw athletics as a path to pursue his dreams. Leonardo got a scholarship offer from a small school, but at precisely the moment he thought his dreams came true, he learned the school was unable to fulfill its promise because Leonardo was undocumented. Put yourself in his shoes. His heart was broken. Leonardo's life changed when he was able to sign up for He enrolled in community college to study chemistry and hopes to become a pharmacist one day. Leonardo told me that DACA didn't just allow him to access a better quality of life. He said it changed how he values himself as an individual and as a person, that he was more than his status--that he was a human being, not an illegal. When I asked him why he came all this way to share his story, he said:       What we're doing here really encompasses what it means to      be an The idea that we have to fight for justice.      That we have to fight for dignity. That equality surpasses      any status. That our humanity surpasses any status.  Thank you, I agree.  This is a pivotal moment for Are we going to continue to bend to the whims of a unpredictable, mercurial, and unreliable President, or will we come together on a bipartisan basis, behave like the separate branch of government that we are, and reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program, fund community health centers, protect Dreamers, and provide parity for defense and domestic programs in a long-term budget deal?  I respect my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. What I don't respect is holding up this process, knowing full well that we can come up with a bipartisan way in 3 or 2 days, or even 1 day to end this shutdown.  I yield the floor.

We are here because the Republican majority in the House and the Senate and the President of the United States have not funded the government.

346,topic-id,244,"Mr.Speaker, we are in the second day of this Trump shutdown because Republicans won't take yes for an answer.  Senator Schumer went to the White House and had a deal with President Trump until the Freedom Caucus vetoed it and forced the President to go back on his word again.  Senator Schumer offered President Trump his border wall. Republicans said no.  Senate Democrats offered short-term continuing resolutions to keep the government open. Republicans said no.

Mr.Speaker, as I said this morning, the reason why the government shut down is because the Republican majority has failed to fund the government. They have the majority of the House, the majority of the Senate, and the Presidency of the United  And with all due respect to my friend, the majority leader, five previous shutdowns were purposefully perpetrated by my Republican friends; the last for 16 days.  The continuing resolution on the floor today reflects that failure. It does not, 9 months after we should have been done, establish the level of spending for this fiscal year. It is 9 months late.  As a result, another continuing resolution may be inevitable. And in this resolution, we will extend the harmful effects of another CR to both defense and nondefense agencies for another 17 days.  That means that Congress will be more than 4 whole months into the fiscal year without a budget agreement. This is dangerous, Mr.Speaker, both to our military and to our civilian agencies, each of which require budget certainty.  Before February 8, Republicans must work with Democrats to resolve the issues at hand. This means working together to lift the budget caps in accordance with the principle of parity, which Speaker Ryan agreed to over the past 4 years and should continue to today and in the future.  It also means working in a bipartisan, bicameral way to address the status of DREAMers, now that President Trump created a crisis with his ending of the DACA program. Congress should act responsibly to allow these young people to stay, as more than 80 percent of Americans believe should be done.

826,topic-id,651,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information.  Today, both Chambers have passed the CR that takes us to February 8. That leaves 17 calendar days. I was going to say it did 6\1/2\ legislative days, but the gentleman has now given up probably half a day, as I understand it, which is Wednesday of the retreat. So, essentially, Mr.Speaker, we have 6 days between now and February 8 in which we will be in session. That makes it incumbent upon us that we come together, cooperate with one another, compromise, and send legislation from here to the Senate that the Senate can agree to.  I want to say, I did not know the gentleman was going to mention that, but I want to see the Defense Department fully funded. But I also want to see fully funded departments that take care of the health of our people, the education of our children, domestic law enforcement, and relations between ourselves and the rest of the world in the State Department, and so many other agencies of government that are in the nondefense part of the budget.  Mr.Speaker, I would tell my friend that I would hope we would come to an agreement very, very shortly on the overall spending levels so that we can pass both defense and nondefense priority issues. And I would say to my friend, all we are asking for in that context, as the gentleman knows, is what we have done over the last 4 years as a result of agreements between Speaker Ryan and Senator Murray, so I would hope that we can proceed on that.  Secondly, and there is so much to bring up, but the second thing I want to mention is, clearly, one of the issues that we have been so concerned about has been how we are going to treat the DREAMers in our country. As the gentleman knows my view, based upon polls that I have read, 85 percent of Americans essentially agree that we ought not send those young people, for the most part, out of the country away from their home to places they do not know, particularly when they are making such a positive contribution to our country.  Now, while I said there were some 5\1/2\ days left between now and the 8th, there are 10\1/2\ days--actually, I guess, now, 9\1/2\ days in which to deal with the issue of the  The gentleman and I, Senator Cornyn, and Senator Durbin have been working. I look forward to working on that, and I hope that we work on it every calendar day that we have available--we won't be in session, but we will work on that--so we can, in fact, come to an agreement so that those young people who the American people think ought to stay here and continue to be productive citizens, contributing individuals to our country, would be allowed to stay here, given a path to citizenship. I would hope that we could work toward that end.  I yield to my friend.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I can't agree with him more. This body has passed all 12 appropriation bills. We do need a budget agreement. And we make progress; once we get that budget agreement, I firmly believe we can fund the rest of this year and[[Page H622]]next year going forward in what we actually need to get our jobs done.  The gentleman is correct, we have met numerous times. I thought they have been very productive meetings dealing with We have narrowed the scope to four areas.  I am excited to have the government back open. It also means we can be back at the table to solve this problem. I know we have a short time period. We have got a week left after the CR that we just passed, but I believe, working together, we can get this done.  ",CREC-2018-01-22-pt1-PgH621-2.txt,566,ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT,2018.0,22.0,January
827,topic-id,174,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information.  I am hopeful that we can agree on the underlying issue which led to the necessity for a CR and the temporary closing of government. That is the underlying agreement on what budget numbers will be, what our caps will be, how much discretionary funding we will have to spend both on defense and nondefense. That is at the core. When you fail to do that, you fail to pass appropriation bills, and you, therefore, have to repair to CRs, which everybody on this floor agrees is bad fiscal policy and should not be the way we do business.

796,topic-id,904,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado for organizing this Special Order hour conversation.  You asked the right question: What are they hiding and what are they afraid of?  It is a bit of a rhetorical question, because when you think about that chart you have displayed there, when you think about the indictments and the plea deals and all of the other information that we are beginning to glean, it is pretty obvious what they are afraid of and what they are hiding.  This investigation is getting pretty darn close to the personal and political and financial ties between this Presidency and those around him and Russia, and it is a lot of information that they don't want the world to know about. That is why we are seeing all of these distractions, all of these elaborate and increasingly desperate attempts to change the subject and create diversions.  Frankly, today, I am very worried that--not so much that this is coming from our President, because we have seen him throughout his career engage in character assassination, burning down the house tactics, and all manner of ruthlessness, but I am disturbed that many of our colleagues in this body have taken up those same tactics and that same cause. That is dangerous.  One of the great things about this country, I believe, is that it is about the rule of law. Our Founders actively debated this question about whether we would be a country of laws and institutions or a country of men.  Would we have some people above the law or would we all be subject to the law?  They answered it loud and clear. We were going to be a country of law and institutions. At every critical test in our history, we have reaffirmed that essential great aspect of what it is to be the United States of That is what Watergate was all about, as we are beginning to remember.  Yet, today, it seems that that proposition is being retested all over again. To my dismay, some of our colleagues are hoping for a different answer as we retest that proposition this time. That is very troubling.  I am not in the habit of quoting FOX News very often, and certainly not their news hosts, but one of their hosts, Shepard Smith, said something that really struck a cord in the last few days. Here is what he said about the so-called Nunes memo: ``A memo can be a weapon of partisan mass distraction.''  That is exactly what this is: a desperate attempt to protect President Trump from investigation and accountability.  I think we need to recap a few facts that brought us to this point.  Back in November 2016, when the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee was appointed to President-elect Trump's transition team, he, like our President, started sowing doubts about whether Russia had interfered with the 2016 election, incorrectly claiming that there was some kind of disagreement between our intelligence agencies on the subject.  In fact, there was no disagreement. All of the American intelligence community agreed that, as they had looked into this, they determined that Russian operatives had worked to undermine the integrity of our election. That conclusion has been reinforced and reaffirmed by everything we have learned since then.  The chairman told Politico shortly before President Trump's inauguration that the House should not investigate contacts between Russia and the Trump camp, even though his Senate intelligence counterparts had already committed to following the facts wherever they may lead. So he had already made up his mind.                              {time}  2145  The chairman described the Trump-Russia connections as a dead trail. He said there is nothing there. And, of course, we know President Trump has said he has nothing to do with Russia, totally contradicted by everything we have learned since.  All of this, of course, is going to come as a surprise if there is nothing there to the President's campaign chair, who is under indictment; to members of his family, who have been hauled before the special prosecutor to answer to secret meetings and other dealings that they have had with Russia; and to others in this administration who had repeated contacts with  And, of course, no one can forget the intelligence chairman's trip to the White House last year, where he staged an impromptu news conference, claiming that he had briefed the White House about a source who could explain how Trump campaign officials were caught up in foreign intelligence intercepts. His unnamed sources that he rushed to brief the White House about, well, it turned out they were White House officials.  This was a completely choreographed stunt. They had planted the misleading information with the chairman in the first place, obviously desperate to give some cover to the President who had tweeted out about wiretapping, conspiracies, and on it goes.  Mr.Speaker, my colleague, Ed Perlmutter, is asking all of the right questions. This investigation is beginning to answer those questions in very, very important ways. We need to make sure that it runs its course. It is important to finding out the truth. The American people deserve to know the truth.  It is also important to reaffirming that incredibly important aspect of what makes this country great, and that is that we are a nation of laws and institutions. We have to reaffirm that, unfortunately, over and over again from time to time.  ",CREC-2018-01-29-pt1-PgH672.txt,2101,CHILD PROTECTION IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2017,2018.0,29.0,January
799,topic-id,287,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  We are being taken back to the lessons of Watergate tonight. The system worked in the 1970s. The checks and balances that our Founders put in place took effect. The public stepped up. The media stepped up. People of conscience in important positions within the government stood their ground and did the right thing.  But I think it would be foolish for us not to take the threats of this moment in our history very, very seriously because there are some things at play this time around that weren't there in the 1970s. You did not have rightwing media organs out there actively trying to undermine public trust in our government. You did not have a complicit United States Congress that, instead of doing oversight, seems to be spending more of its effort running cover for the administration, trying to hide the facts, trying to block investigations, playing tribal politics at its worst, instead of fulfilling our institutional role in a critical constitutional test like this.  I think it is a very, very serious moment in our history, and I am glad that the gentleman is convening discussions like this on the floor. We have to make sure that, in this investigation, the professional law enforcement personnel who do this for a living are allowed to do their job so that we can all learn the truth, whatever that may be.

33,topic-id,6203,"Mr.President, I am going to talk about something different than anyone else has talked about here, and there is a very good reason for it.  First of all, to try to establish some credibility here, I have had occasion to spend quite a bit of time working on issues in In fact, I have had occasion over the last 23 years to make 156 African country visits. That is a lot of African country visits. We have friends there. I personally have friends there, intimate friends. We have worked on a lot of the military concerns they have, but this is an area where we have very close friends. So I am going to be singling out one close friend--but not to the detriment of the rest of them because we have many close friends, certainly as many as 32 country Presidents and Prime Ministers to whom we have been very close. But there is a reason for singling out one particular individual, who is Paul Kagame, President of Rwanda--two reasons. First, he is going to be coming in as the Chairman or President of the African Union in the next few months. He has already been elected. Second, he survived the Rwanda genocide, which arguably could be the greatest genocide of all time. On January 28, he will become the President or Chairman of the African This is really nothing short of a miracle. Rwanda is a miracle, and we have Paul Kagame and the people of Rwanda to thank for it.  In 1994, one of the most atrocious genocides ever perpetrated occurred in this small East African country. In a period of about 100 days, nearly 1 million Rwandans were slaughtered. As is always the case, the seeds of genocide were planted many decades before, but when it finally started in April of 1994, many thousands of Hutus used machetes and clubs to slaughter Those are two tribes people are very familiar with. In most cases, it was neighbors killing neighbors, even some family members.  The horror was unimaginable. Fathers and mothers were forced to watch their children being hacked to death. One man was forced to beat his wife to death in order to spare their seven children from being tortured to death.  Many Rwandans were lucky to survive and remember watching their parents and siblings being murdered. One individual whose name is Immaculee wrote a book, ``Left to Tell,'' which gives you an idea of what happened, the fact that there were people in her own community trying to kill her. They killed 70 percent--70 percent--of the entire tribe at that time.  The world just watched as this slaughter took place. They did nothing. The United Nations had peacekeepers stationed in Rwanda, and they were ordered to withdraw and leave all the genocide to take place.  The President of the United States was Bill He did nothing. The world just stood by and watched. The horror was stopped only because of one man. That one man was Paul In October 1990, Paul Kagame led a group of young Rwandan refugees from Uganda whose parents had fled the country's mass violence three decades before.  You have to keep in mind that the President of Uganda is President President Museveni and President Paul Kagame, both, came from the bush. They were good friends. He went there to try to save Rwandans at that time because he saw the genocide coming.  What is even more amazing about Rwanda is their leader and what happened after that. Rwanda had two very different paths it could have taken. They could have taken revenge. Paul Kagame could have taken the strength he had--the new power that he had--and he could have gone after the other tribe that was there, the Hutus, and he could have started another genocide of his own. That could have happened. The other thing he could have done was the path of forgiveness and reconciliation. This is the path of hard work, where the Tutsis who survived the genocide would have to learn how to forgive and live alongside the same Hutus who killed their family members. This is the path of rebuilding a nation from the ground up so that together they could have a common future.  We now know which path Rwanda chose. President Kagame led them down the path of reconciliation. There are a lot of people who helped to make this happen. One of the individuals, who I happen to be personally fond of, who is deceased now, was Chuck Do you remember him? He spent time in prison. He started a fellowship and was very actively involved in the reconciliation process. In many cases, the Hutus who committed genocide against the Tutsi families would seek forgiveness from that family and then achieve reconciliation by building a home together for the Tutsi survivors who lived through this. It may seem like a small gesture, but it allowed the healing and forgiveness process to work. Together, the Hutus and the Tutsis are rebuilding their nation as Rwandans working together.  I had one experience that I watched after this happened. My wife called this to my attention. In Rwanda, they build a certain kind of basket that is different from that in any other country. After the reconciliation, there they were--the Hutu and the Tutsi young women--making these baskets. Then, Paul Kagame worked out a deal with several department store marketing areas in the United Macy's was one of them. They started selling the baskets. It was a great boon for them. But, anyway, Paul Kagame should be credited for this amazing transformation of the nation to a thriving, successful country. This is paying great dividends.  I was in Rwanda most recently in I have been there eight times. Each time I go, I am surprised by what I see. Let me mention five things that are unique to First, there is not a piece of litter anywhere in There is nothing. You can't find any litter. In fact, the last Saturday of every month, they have a program where everybody joins together and they pick up every bit of trash and everything else. That doesn't sound like very much, but you notice the difference when you are there.  The second thing that is different about them is their infrastructure. Rwanda is known as the Land of a Thousand They don't have any level areas in Not long ago, I remember going for an hour and a half, between the hill area and the mountain area, on a road that was perfectly paved. That is one thing you would expect to see in the United There are no potholes--nothing. It was a highway that you would expect to find anywhere except in They are known for this.  Third, the people are hard workers. I mentioned that there aren't any flat areas there. Every square foot in Rwanda is used to grow something, from the bottom of the peaks. Everything is there. They are hard workers. They grow tea, coffee, potatoes, and other crops. They are all being cultivated across the entire country, and it is all hilly country. There is no place else where that is actually taking place. It is hard work. You do it mostly by hand. They are able to feed themselves and export more valuable crops abroad.  Fourth, it is safe. You wouldn't expect a country that has gone through the most devastating genocide--maybe in history--to be a safe place to walk around. Yet it is. You can walk there at nighttime. It is safer than Washington,  The fifth thing that is unusual about this is that the economy is booming. Everywhere you look in Rwanda, construction is happening. In just the last few years, they built new hotels and a convention center, and they are now working on a new airport to facilitate all the growth and tourism that is coming there.  These are my observations, but President Kagame's leadership is not just resulting in visible changes. Numbers back up what I have seen. Since he became President in 2000, Rwanda has experienced a GDP growth of 8 percent.  This is interesting because we are, through our tax bill, going to be increasing our GDP in this country. There is a formula that no one disagrees with, and that is that for each 1 percent increase in growth in the GDP, that develops into $1 trillion over a period of 10 years of increased revenue. That is some of the revenue we are going to be using as a result of that.  This is not the United This is in It is an 8-percent GDP[[Page S455]]growth. It is geared toward the poor people. That is why the population has lifted people out of poverty.  Rwanda has dramatically improved its ease of doing business. The World Bank recently ranked Rwanda 1 for doing business in East Africa, 2 for doing business in Sub-Saharan Africa, and 41 in the world. That is remarkable when you consider that just a matter of 8 years before, they were ranked 150th in the world for doing business. Now they are 41. Today you can start a business and get all the necessary permits to operate in just a few days.  Rwanda has become a model for gender empowerment. Maybe this is going a little further than a lot of the people in this country are comfortable with, but Rwanda's constitution requires that 30 percent of decision-making positions be awarded to women. Today, it is now 60 percent. So 60 percent of Rwanda's parliamentarians and 40 percent of its Cabinets are filled by women, including my good friend the Foreign Minister, Louise Mushikiwabo, and also the Ambassador that many of us know here because she is in the United States, Ambassador Mathilde  Rwanda has facilitated the development of a technology that no one would expect in Rwanda enjoys a nationwide fiberoptic infrastructure that will ensure that 95 percent of its citizens have access to high-speed 4G internet. Furthermore, it is integrating drone technology into its healthcare system to ensure that vital supplies, like blood, can reach patients all over the country.  Rwanda has transformed its healthcare system. Life expectancy is now 64.5 years. In 2000, it was 49 years. That has all taken place in the last few years. Child mortality rates are down more than two-thirds. Maternal mortality is down 80 percent. In 2000, there was only 1 doctor for every 66,000 people. Today there is 1 doctor for every 10,000 people. Between those years, since the genocide has taken place, the malaria-related deaths plummeted by 85 percent.  When you ask how these things were possible, the World Health Organization's country director said--and this is a quote, not a quote by me or someone in this country or by the President:       The main ingredient is visionary leadership. It's about      having a target, saying we want to be there in the future and      understanding obstacles in the way.  That visionary leader is Paul Kagame, and he gets results.  That is the World Health  Rwanda has established a highly capable and professional military. President Kagame actually studied in Fort Leavenworth in Kansas as part of the IMET Program in early 1990s. The IMET Program is a program where we train people from different countries to be leaders, and, of course, they develop an allegiance to our country. It is very successful. That is how this guy got started. He started in the IMET His military background is very professional. As President, he has required the same of his forces. In the Rwanda Defence Forces, all military orders and instructions are issued through a chain of command. Rwanda's plan is to have a small, well-equipped army of 20,000 soldiers and a reserve component of 100,000. Their defense strategy is to sustain a combat-ready force capable of rapidly deploying to meet varying contingencies both at home and abroad still.  They are delivering. Rwanda is the fifth largest contributor to the U.peacekeeping operations in the world. They currently have close to 5,000 troops deployed in different missions, widely acknowledged as some of the best performing and most trusted peacekeepers in the world.  Rwanda is also a major participant in the Eastern Africa Standby That is a battalion of 850 troops and a police contingency of 140 officers who are on standby for contingencies in East The countries that have gone together are Tanzania, Uganda, Burundi, Kenya, and These are the kinds of things that are exactly in line with what we should be helping them with and participating in and doing ourselves in the United States in terms of policy goals for We set up a way to help Africans help Africans, to train and assist regional partners so they will be capable of handling security threats before they become global crises. With the emergence of their peacekeeping mission, the regional cooperation--what we hope would happen--is happening. Paul Kagame is the reason Rwanda is leading the way. Rwanda is a clear example of what a strong, strategic partner should look like to the United  It is not just me saying this. Rwanda is recognized around the world for its professional force. In fact, Rwanda's Defense Minister was among the few leaders who spoke at the United Nations Peacekeeping Defence Ministerial in November in Because of these amazing accomplishments, President Kagame is widely viewed as one of the most influential heads of state in the continent of Many leaders and observers praise him and his record. Benedict Oramah, President of the African Export-Import Bank, said:       [Rwanda] is a country that was all but written off some two      decades ago. But just like the phoenix that died and arose      from its ashes, it emerges to become the shiniest star on the      continent. The shiniest in terms of governance, in terms of      the can-do spirit, doing those things that nobody ever      thought was possible.  Again, that is the African Export-Import Bank talking about Paul  The head of the World Health Organization's Africa department said:       I want to recognize [Rwanda's] remarkable leadership--its      creativity, tenacity and resolve--which have delivered      significant progress in advancing health and development for      the benefit of all your people. Your achievements in such a      short space of time are truly remarkable.  That is the World Health He is talking about Rwanda, and he is talking specifically about the  Some of you may remember former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, who came in after the person who was considered one of the great terrorists of all time, at that time, Sani He came in to reform the leadership in His statement was: ``Rwanda has made difficult trade-offs, but as an African leader, I tell you that I would make the same trade-offs.''  Yet his influence is recognized more clearly not by what people have said about him but by what his peers have asked him to do.  In July of 2016, Kagame was selected by his peers to lead the effort to reform the African Union to make it more effective. He did not take this opportunity to raise his own profile, as most people would do; rather, he used it to build consensus and cast a vision for a future Africa that is no longer reliant on aid from the outside world. This is very significant because when you talk to people in the street about Africa and the things we do with Africa, the first thing they say is that Africa is always having to be supported by us, that we are pouring money into Africa and they are not able to do things on their own.  This was the first time he had made this statement--that Africa should no longer be reliant on aid from outside nations. Within months, he developed a reform package that was focused on four categories. This is significant.  The first one is that the African Union has to be focused on key priorities with a continental scope as opposed to a regional. This is something that has been happening for a long time, but they are moving from regional to starting to look after their entire continent. He wants the AU to focus on fewer but bigger issues that affect everyone on the continent.  The second thing is that the AU must be connected with its citizens. Paul Kagame envisions doing this by establishing women and youth quotas, which I just mentioned a minute ago, across the institutions and by identifying appropriate ways and means to ensure that the private sector, Parliament, civil society, and citizens are participating in the process. He also wants to make the Africa passport available to all citizens so as to allow the free flow of people among the nation-states.  The third thing is that the business of the AU must be managed effectively and efficiently with accountability, called the ``Rwanda way.''  The fourth thing is to charge the member-states with providing all of the necessary funding to operate the African Union without having assistance from outside donors.  Have you ever heard that before from anybody, let alone Africa? Yet that is what he said. He envisions doing this[[Page S456]]by each African country's imposing a 0.2-percent tariff on eligible imports. While not all observers agree, I admire this vision for each seeking its way to ungrip itself from the assistance of other nations to fund its governmental activities. That was his plan.  What cemented his status as an influential power broker in Africa was that at the AU's next meeting, which was January of 2017, his peers at the AU--the African Union--affirmed the recommendations and charged him with actually implementing them. Once again, African leaders unanimously decided to trust They chose him as the best leader to put reforms into action. So far, a number of the proposals have already been implemented.  About half of the nation-states have already implemented the most difficult part, which is passing upon themselves a 0.2-percent import tariff and forwarding the proceeds to the African They were paying for all of these things that were happening--that were proposed by Kagame--in the African They actually have what we call real skin in the game. More and more nations are getting on board, and Rwanda is leading the way.  To further cement his standing and influence, in July of 2017, Kagame was selected by his peers to chair the African Union in 2018, and here it is in 2018. So it is going to be happening. With genocide, Rwanda has a dark history, but because they chose the path of forgiveness and reconciliation instead of revenge, President Kagame has had and has used his national platform to be a nation of friendship and reconciliation between nations--nations that normally don't like each other, nations that normally are fighting against each other. Let's take a look at what he has actually done.  First, he and the State of Israel have had a similar past as both having victims of genocide. We all know that. Many African nations--about half of them--are Muslim-majority countries.  President Kagame has used his influence in the region to facilitate Israel's desire to reengage in Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel referred to Rwanda as the indispensable bridge on which Israel marched to return to In just the last 2 years, Prime Minister Netanyahu has been welcomed in several of the African capitals. I was with Prime Minister Netanyahu, and I can tell you that he was one who was so impressed with the work that has been done by Paul Kagame that he is able to invest himself in that continent of Africa, which he was never able to do before.  At the United Nations, Rwanda has put itself at risk of widespread criticism in order to stand up for what is right. In 2014, Rwanda rotated onto the U.Security While there, Rwanda abstained from an anti-Israel resolution so typical of the United It is always against When he did this, Rwanda blocked it from moving forward and prevented the United States from having to veto it. In this Chamber, we remember that. I remember the fact that we didn't want to be in a position to veto it, but what they were doing was totally unfair. We had one guy who was courageous enough to do it; he was Paul Kagame from  More recently, Rwanda has been one of the few nations not to vote against the United States or condemn our decision to move our Israeli Embassy from Tel Aviv to  Rwanda is willing to take a stand for what is right. It keeps its word. It does not shake with fear at the possibility of intimidation.  Kagame has also brought about the restoration of broken relationships with In 2016, he led the push to invite Morocco back into the African This is an issue that a lot of people are concerned with. All the way back to the Bush administration, our Secretary of State at that time, Jim Baker, was trying his best to undo the damage that was done by Morocco to Western Three decades ago, Western Sahara was taken from its homeland and put out in the middle of nowhere in the desert. I have been there several times. I wonder how a person can live out there.  The problem was that Morocco was very rich, and Western Sahara was very poor. I testified before a House committee not too long ago, and I commented that Morocco has hired the most expensive lobbyists who are in Obviously, he gets his way on things that other people don't.  Anyway, one of the problems was, because of the advantage that it has had, it has not been willing to come to the table. One of the reasons is that Morocco has been the only country to be considered an African country that is not part of the African So what did Paul Kagame do? He brought them into the African He was able to convince both the African Union and Morocco to allow Morocco to join so that they could get together and get something done. Hopefully, he is on the road to trying to end three decades of trauma that has taken place out in the desert.  Has this effort soured our relations with Kagame? In fact, the impact has been just the opposite. Earlier this month, former German President Horst Kohler, the U.envoy for resolving the Western Sahara-Morocco dispute, traveled to Kigali to appeal for Kagame's help to resolve the situation. The U.recognizes Kagame's bringing Morocco into the African Union as an important step in resolving the problem of the Western  It is not just in Morocco that Kagame has made a difference. Let's look at others.  South Sudan is another problem. The Sudan and South Sudan were the same country. South Sudan had been trying to gain its independence. It finally did gain its independence, and we thought everything would be fine when that happened. Unfortunately, that started a civil war in South This is something that has been going on now for 3 years, and Paul Kagame is neck deep in helping resolve that conflict as well. Rwanda has peacekeeping troops in both countries, and the Sudanese and the South Sudanese forces do not target but they protect So we have two countries that are warring against each other, and we have Rwanda going in to try to resolve it. They both welcome Rwanda, and they trust Rwanda's military because they trust  It is tempting to think that Rwanda is a small country in the middle of nowhere that does not have a lot of influence, but that would be a mistake. Because of the results Kagame has been able to secure for his people and because of the personal relationships he has developed, Rwanda is among one of the most influential countries in Africa, considering the fact that when Kagame was inaugurated to his third term, no fewer than 22 heads of state from across Africa attended the festivities. That has never been done before--22 countries participating in the inauguration of a They came for Paul The leaders of African nations that normally fight with each other were actually seen embracing one another live on That just doesn't happen for no reason; that happens because they all trust and admire Paul  With all of this, it is no wonder that African leaders are increasingly looking to Rwanda and Kagame for a vision of how to move forward into the future. According to one reporter, the ``Rwanda model'' is becoming a hallmark phrase in  Simon Allison writes: ``In Africa's . . . corridors of power--in the boardrooms of its banks, in closed-door Cabinet meetings, in donor discussions and interminable governance conferences--it is repeated like a mantra: `The Rwanda model. The Rwanda model. The Rwanda model.' ''  Kagame is advancing a vision of African leadership that is no longer reliant on the aid of outsiders--a total reversal. He wants to move his country and the whole continent away from dependence on foreign aid to bustling free market economies that enable the people to take care of themselves. In fact, he recently complained to his fellow peers at an African security summit meeting that they have relied too much on the international community to deal with their problems.  This is a quote from him: ``A major pillar of institutional reform of the AU is a more focused and assertive Africa'' that is focused on solving its own problems. He said, ``We must take responsibility for ourselves, which doesn't exclude partners but they add to our efforts.'' He has clearly done that. That is the main thing in all the reforms we have talked about, is to get Africa out of that dependency mode, and he is actually doing it.[[Page S457]]  Last March, while speaking in London at the Wall Street Journal's Investing in Africa Conference, Kagame said, ``I want to see Africa get its act together'' so it is not reliant on Western intervention in its affairs. It is the same thing over and over again. He sees a future Africa that is more autonomous and capable of taking care of itself and taking care of its problems. It is kind of a vision that his peers are gathering around.  We shouldn't misunderstand. Kagame is not saying that Africa should have no involvement with the United States or the West--far from it. What he wants is to have a peer-to-peer relationship instead of a donor-based relationship. He wants legitimate business relations between customers and suppliers, to join together African businesses and other international companies, including those in the United  In Kagame's vision for a new Africa, African nations will have cooperation on security and on terrorism and on trade agreements with their friends, partners, and allies. He wants to end the days of reliance upon foreign governments to solve their problems. See, there it is again.  Many leaders in Africa have desired this kind of a change, but few have had the position, the influence, or the clarity of focus to articulate with the kind of passion that is persuasive. It is only had by Paul There are far fewer who have this kind of record of improving the lives of their own people in the way he has.  This is exactly the kind of partnership that the United States should have with our friends and allies in Africa--should have but that we don't have at the present time. For too long, the United States has had the wrong policy toward Africa and African nations, and most Americans still think there is only 1 country on the continent of Africa rather than 54 independent states that make it up.  U.policy toward Africa should be different. U.policy should be a partnership that focuses on helping Africans help Africans with three key components: security, trade, and diplomacy.  The security goals of the United States in Africa should be focused on training and equipping key partners to be capable of addressing regional and continental terrorist threats that could ultimately affect the United States and to be capable of addressing regional security threats that develop in regions so that the U.military does not have to engage, so that it can do it instead of needing our involvement.  This is AFRICOM's goal. AFRICOM is something that is fairly new. We once were a part of three different commands--the Central Command, the Pacific Command, and the European Now we have AFRICOM as its own command, which was designed for that express purpose. We are increasingly meeting these goals and objectives.  The second thing is that our trade focus in Africa should be on developing free trade agreements with African nations so that they have a reciprocal, peer relationship with our African trading partners. Fortunately, this is already the statutory policy of the United States, but it is not working that way. In 2015, a 10-year extension of the African Growth and Opportunity Act was signed into law. This is an appropriate policy for the near term, but long term it is not because we need to have the same kind of access to African nations as we provide to them. In this law, it explicitly states that the policy of the United States is to pursue free-trade agreements with African nations, but it doesn't back it up with anything.  In my travels to Africa, I have seen many countries are ready for free-trade agreements, but the bureaucracies over here in the United States don't agree. They don't think they are ready. So I introduced the African Free Trade Initiative Act, which does two things.  First, it requires a U.Trade Representative to articulate what African countries need to do to get ready for trade agreements with the United It is one thing for people over here or people who are desiring trade and not desiring trade to say: Well, Africa is not ready. What we are doing with this legislation is saying: We need to know from our Trade Representative what they need to do so they could be a part--they can get skin in their own game.  Second, it requires the U.Trade Representative to coordinate with the Millennium Challenge Corporation and USAID so their aid dollars are focused on projects that will help prepare them for free-trade agreements with us. Now these provisions have passed and are signed into law so we are making that headway.  The bureaucracies have all the tools they need, but they aren't willing to use them because they don't take Africa seriously, they don't view them as peers, and they look down on them because they are small, but this is a shame because the economies in Africa are growing faster than any other region in the world.  Then there is diplomacy. Our diplomatic focus in Africa should be focused on building relationships and alignments with countries we can trust, that share our values and help us influence the rest of the continent and the world to be favorable to the United For too long, we have ridden on a high horse through We have been quick to chide them for mistakes they have made, and we have been slow or completely negligent in recognizing their accomplishments.  Take Rwanda as an example. I have already articulated the miracle they have experienced, but when the people of Rwanda decided to amend their Constitution to allow President Kagame to run for an additional term, the Obama administration condemned them. They publicly shamed Kagame for the country's actions and doubled down when he ran for reelection. That administration did not have a category for the democratic process that was different from ours. They just didn't have the category for a new nation needing help, and so they were not helpful to them. That administration also failed to recognize the amazing progress Rwanda has made to improve their country and the health and education of their people, nor did they recognize the superb security assistance Rwanda provides in the region, and our relationship with Rwanda was negatively impacted by the Obama administration. We have become known as a condescending and unreliable partner in If we do not catch up and change our approach, our friends will find new partners, and we will be left alone.  It is no secret how engaged China is on the continent. I think we all know that. Every time you travel through Africa, they say: Well, the United States tells you what you need, but we build what you need. Now, they don't do it with African labor and all that, but they have a reason for doing this. They understand how important Africa is going to be in the coming decades so they are treating African nations accordingly, as peers, as we should be doing.  China has surpassed the United States as Africa's largest trading partner. We have been their largest trading partner for many years, but now that has changed and China has taken over. China funded the construction of the African Union's headquarters in Their aid dollars go toward projects that are actually needed, and the projects happen much faster than compared to ours. The United States is falling behind and at great risk.  Between now and 2030, the economies of African nations are expected to grow by an average of 5 percent a year, meaning the total size of their economies will nearly double in that time. By 2025, the continent will have a combined GDP of over $2.5 trillion and $1.4 trillion of that--that is more than half of that--will be consumer spending.  Increasingly, Africa's growing middle class will continue to become highly attractive in the business world. By 2034, Africa is expected to have the world's largest working age population of 1.1 billion people, which could lead to a low-cost labor economic boom similar to what was experienced in East Asia after World War Our National Security Council has noted that these demographic and economic shifts will have enormous political consequences and that Africa's role in rural politics will dramatically change because of them.  Implementing this policy will benefit our people, give us greater security, give us a stronger economy, and it will add to our influence in the world in the long run. These things we need to do, and we are not doing them now. So I[[Page S458]]am encouraging our administration to do it. We need to get these things. To implement this policy effectively, we must cultivate critical relations of influence with our like-minded friends in In the Middle East, we have In Europe, we have Great In Africa, we have Rwanda and Paul  So it is time to catch up. President Paul Kagame will soon be sworn in as the Chairman of the African In him, we have a visionary leader who has accomplished great things for his country. He has also established himself as a highly influential figure among African heads of State because he has set a bold vision for the future of Africa that is autonomous, self-sufficient, and open for business. This vision is 100 percent complimentary to what the U.policy should be in  In recognizing this, it is my hope the Trump administration will embrace him and Rwanda as the American friends they are. We need to bring Rwanda close so we can work cooperatively with them to accomplish our shared goal. Rwanda and America are like-minded friends, and we should treat them accordingly.  Let me conclude with a personal story that expands a little bit on this. I had an experience in 2000. In 2000, I was called by a friend in Rwanda, and his name is Charles He called up and he said--there is a program I have been involved in and others have been involved in, where we encourage them to have like we have in the U.We have weekly Prayer Breakfasts every Wednesday, and we encourage them to do the same thing. He called me up, and he said: We would like to have our first National Prayer Breakfast in Will you come over and speak? So I did.  Well, 14 years later--this is quite a coincidence--in 2014, we were on another trip and planned to land in Burundi before going to Ethiopia, but then, for security reasons, we weren't able to land in Burundi so we stopped in Rwanda instead. Without any warning--now, keep in mind, Rwanda didn't know we were going to be there. We didn't know we were going to be there. There was no warning whatsoever, but when we got there, as a coincidence, the next day they were having their 14th annual Prayer They assumed, since I was their speaker at their first Prayer Breakfast 14 years before, I was there to give a speech, and so I did. I say this because Paul Kagame, 14 years before that happened and every year since then and then every year since this took place, was then leading both Prayer So in addition to all of the virtues of Paul Kagame that I have been talking about--perhaps too long--he is a strong man of faith, and it doesn't get any better than that.

Mr.Speaker, this Trump shutdown is no way to govern. Republicans had plenty of time to pass CHIP reauthorization, but instead, they want to use it for hostage taking. They have the will to act on the GOP tax scam to benefit corporations and the wealthiest, but not on pensions for working families.  And they certainly had no interest in a solution for DREAMers, an issue that 87 percent of the American people agree on, and Republicans right here would vote with Democrats to pass a solution to.  There are two bipartisan bills in the House to protect DREAMers and one in the Senate, but this isn't about real solutions. Republicans just want to continue to use immigrants as a scapegoat and end legal immigration as we know it.  Mr.Speaker, as an immigrant myself, I am tired of being called the worst of the worst.

Since the early 1970s, the productivity of the American worker has increased in excess of 285 percent; but during that same period of time, wages have increased by less than 10 percent.

635,topic-id,1897,"Mr.President, I appreciate the deference of my colleague from I also echo the comments about friendship with our junior Senator from This is a matter that is of deep importance to Virginia, and I rise to talk about why we are here on a Sunday in January, the second day of the shutdown of the Federal When I conclude my speech, I will seek unanimous consent for the reopening of the government for 3 days as we find a path forward.  We are in shutdown mode because the Republican majority did not prioritize completing a budget during the first year of the Trump administration. As the party in control of the White House, the Senate, and the House, they have a calendar set forth in law that we are supposed to follow. The President is supposed to present a budget to Congress in He didn't. The Houses are supposed to pass budgets in their committees in the spring. They didn't. The authorizing committees are supposed to write bills. Many of them did, but because they didn't have budget numbers to write them to, they were sort of of marginal effect. The appropriations committees are supposed to have funding bills ready and passed to start the fiscal year on October 1. The President was supposed to present a budget, and he didn't. The budget committees, controlled by Republicans, are supposed to pass a budget, and they didn't. The appropriations committees are supposed to have bills that are ready to be in effect on October 1, the fiscal year, and they didn't. Now, that is not unique to this particular Congress, but it explains why we are here.  Why was there a decision to violate the statutory calendar and not, frankly, even get to a serious consideration of the budget until January, the fourth month of the fiscal year? Well, it is because the majority decided that the priority of the budget was a low priority. Instead of working on the budget and appropriations bills, what the majority wanted to work on for the first 9 months of the year was the ineffective and ultimately failed effort to repeal the Affordable Care That took us into late September, essentially a week before the start of the fiscal year. The repeal of the Affordable Care Act was more important, was a higher priority than getting a budget done to fund governmental services.  When that effort was done, did the majority then race to do a budget and do appropriations? They then took the next 3 months--now into the new fiscal year with no budget--to do tax cuts and eventually before December were able to pass a tax cut bill.  Finally, the majority turned to this issue of the budget and the urgency of the budget in January, the fourth month of the fiscal year, and they are using a gimmick--again, that both parties have used, a continuing resolution--to evade the responsibility of actually doing a budget.  Republicans, when they were focusing on other things and they didn't want to focus on the budget--because it was about tax cuts and repealing the Affordable Care Act--said: We can't do it by October 1; give us until December 8. Then they said: Give us until December 22. Then they said: Give us until January 19. The Democratic minority reluctantly agreed, but it was the Republicans who said: We want to push this budget back, back, back, back, back.  Nearly 2 weeks ago, there was a very important meeting that, frankly, has not occurred in my time in the It was a request by our Secretary of Defense, Secretary James Mattis, to come and speak to the caucus lunches. I have been here since January of 2013; that has not happened before. He came--I believe it was on the 8th of January, a Tuesday--to speak to both the Democratic and Republican caucuses. I know what he told us, and because I know the honor of Secretary Mattis, I am sure he said the same thing to the He said: Don't give me another continuing resolution. He told us, as he has repeatedly testified and as others have testified, that continuing resolutions are destroying the military, they are destroying our readiness, and they are destroying our capacity to meet the threats of today. He said: Don't continue this continuing resolution mania. Give me a full-year budget. Give me a full-year budget.  So when the Republican majority proposed yet another continuing resolution until February 19, with no commitment about actually finding a budget deal, many of us--both Democrats and Republicans--said that we would no longer support the continuing resolution gimmick and that we wanted to move expeditiously toward a full budget deal.[[Page S407]]  I think this is very important because, again, this is President Trump's Secretary of Defense saying: Do not give me a continuing resolution; let's find a full budget deal.  As my colleague Senator McCain said in a written statement the other night: A shutdown is bad and a continuing resolution is bad. We need to move forward to find a full budget deal.  It was interesting that even as we were here on Thursday night and the House was passing a continuing resolution to put it on the table here, the Department of Defense--the Pentagon's chief spokesperson was tweeting out: Don't do another continuing resolution. This is wasteful. It is hurting the military. Work toward a full budget deal.  That is the position of the Department of Defense in the Trump administration, that this CR is actually a bad thing.  That is why we are here--because we didn't heed the advice of the Secretary of Defense; we delayed consideration of the budget until well into the fiscal year.  And we are here for another reason. We are here because President Trump announced in September that he is terminating legal protections for hundreds of thousands of It was interesting that the other night, the majority leader repeatedly called these Dreamers illegal immigrants. They are not illegal. They are here protected by a Presidential Executive order that has been upheld in courts. They are legal. President Trump is threatening to take away their legal status and make them illegal. But when the majority leader stands here and calls Dreamers illegal immigrants, it really shows you the contempt with which he holds these young people. To call people who have a legal protection illegal immigrants, as he has done and as the President has done, is deeply offensive.  The President's threat to end their legal status on March 5 creates a huge hardship for them and is a matter of real urgency. When the House passed the continuing resolution Thursday night, we asked the majority for a vote. We said: Let's vote right now to defeat the continuing resolution because the votes aren't here; even Republicans will vote against it. The Pentagon was tweeting out, basically telling us the CR was unacceptable. We asked for that vote Thursday night so we would have the full day of Friday to find a compromise and keep the government open, but the majority wouldn't let us vote Thursday night. They wouldn't let us vote and then use Friday as a full day to find a compromise to keep the government open. Instead, they postponed the vote until 10 o'clock Friday, thinking that would pressure people, but it failed, as we knew that it would.  When my Democratic colleagues stood on the floor twice and asked for the short-term ability to keep the government open to keep negotiating, the majority objected. So the government closed down as the majority objected to those short-term agreements.  Why did the majority object to keeping us open over the weekend while we debated? That is a question for them to answer, but I have a surmise. My surmise is that they are OK with the shutdown.  I am only aware of two people who think shutdown is good. In Virginia, we don't think it is good. Our military doesn't think it is good. Our Federal employees don't think it is good. Those receiving Social Security disability checks don't think it is good. Virginians don't think it is a good thing. But I can find two people who think shutdown is a good thing.  President Trump, in a tweet on May 2, 2017, basically said: Our country needs a good shutdown in September to fix this mess. Well, he didn't get exactly what he wanted. He didn't get a shutdown in But can you imagine the mindset of somebody basically saying that a shutdown is a good thing? This President--it is President Trump who uniquely says--and he is the only person I know who has said it--that a shutdown is a good thing. He actually tweeted out something similar yesterday. He said: On my 1-year anniversary, the shutdown has given me a ``nice anniversary present.'' That is what he tweeted out yesterday. So we have President Trump on the record saying that a shutdown is a good thing and that it is a nice present.  I have found one other person who has said a shutdown is a good thing. I think it was on Friday, actually, that the Republican Director of the Office of Management and Budget was on a radio show hosted by Sean Hannity, and this is a direct quote from Mick Mulvaney, Director of the Office of Management and Budget: ``In fact, I found out for the first time last night that the person who technically shuts the government down is me, which is kind of cool.''  ``The person who technically shuts the government down is me, which is kind of cool.''  The reason we on this side are referring to this as the Trump shutdown is because it is only President Trump who has said the shutdown is good. It is only his Office of Management and Budget Director who says it is cool to shut down the government. And when we offered to our Republican colleagues to avert the shutdown Friday night, they objected to it. They objected to it. So here we are.  We need to follow the advice of the Secretary of Defense and reopen government and commit to finding not another continuing resolution but a full budget deal--a full budget deal that deals with all of our priorities, whether it be emergency relief in Texas or CHIP reauthorization or education or defense financing. That is what Secretary Mattis has asked us to do, and that is what we need to do. We must also deal with the emergency created by President Trump with his threat to take legal children and deprive them of their legal status on March 5.  For that reason, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar 36, which is H.1301; that the Schumer amendment that would provide for a continuing resolution to fund the government through Tuesday, January 23, 2018, which is at the desk, be the only amendment in order to the bill; that there be 1 hour of debate equally divided between the two leaders; that the amendment be considered and agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.

The program ensures the readiness of Reserve Component members, their families, and communities before, during, and after deployment.  National Guard and Reserve servicemembers are the backbone of our Nation's military, comprising nearly half of our total force. We have relied on them to support combat missions abroad, and we will continue to rely on them. Nearly 1 million guardsmen and reservists have deployed since September 11, 2001, with nearly 35,000 currently mobilized.  Not only do National Guard and Reserve servicemembers support combat operations, security, and humanitarian missions around the world, they also ensure our safety when unforeseen disasters and emergencies occur. Just this past year, Reserve Component members have responded to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, providing relief and emergency services to hundreds of thousands of Through their compassion, professionalism, and courage, they protect our way of life, not just abroad, but also here at home.  In establishing the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program, Congress recognized that National Guard and Reserve servicemembers face challenges throughout the deployment cycle that are uniquely different than those confronting their Active-Duty counterparts. Most notably, Reserve Component members often live far from military installations and other members of their units, decreasing their opportunities for support during each stage of deployment.  The Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program bridges this gap by connecting National Guard and Reserve servicemembers and their families with resources where they live and provides a support network to aide their unique challenges. Through the program, Reserve Component members and their families gain access to relevant information and resources, including family and marriage counseling, financial planning and education, small business planning, legal benefits, healthcare information, employment training opportunities, and veterans benefits education.  I had the distinct pleasure of working with Congressman John Kline and Senators Norm Coleman, Saxby Chambliss, and Johnny Isakson in introducing the legislation that created the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program in 2008. I am pleased to say the Minnesota National Guard's program, Beyond the Yellow Ribbon, sought to improve how Minnesota's servicemembers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan experienced reintegration and became the model for the national program we are recognizing today.  Since its launch, the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program's pre, during, and postdeployment events have supported more than 1.5 million servicemembers and their families. These 10 years have demonstrated the necessity of the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program's mission in maintaining the readiness of National Guard and Reserve servicemembers, their families, and their communities.  I am sure the entire Senate will join with me in congratulating the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program on the successes that have brought it to its 10th anniversary and supporting its continued success moving forward.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-25-pt1-PgS518-5.txt,1826,CHILD PROTECTION IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2017,2018.0,25.0,January

616,topic-id,916,"Mr.President, there are a lot of important things the Senate is taking up right now. Obviously, there is the issue of immigration, the budget, and disaster relief. There are a lot of pertinent issues that need to be resolved. One of those things that was in the middle of the conversation came up today. It is part of a conversation that, quite frankly, doesn't come up often in this body, but this seemed like a reasonable piece to be able to come up. It came up to the Senate to open debate on it, and it failed to get the 60 votes to support the beginning of what should be an easy conversation on a hard issue--this issue about children and life.  In 1973, when Roe v. Wade passed, the Supreme Court at that time determined that for children that were viable--and that is the definition they left out there--there is a governmental interest in being able to engage with those children. Well, viability in 1973 was very different than what it is now, decades later. In 1973 viable was a much older child. Now that we know a lot more, a lot more children survive. Children who are born at 22 weeks of gestation have between a 50-percent to 60-percent chance of survival now. That was not true in 1973.  The rest of the world has caught up with this technology, and their governments have acknowledged of this issue that a child who has 10 fingers and 10 toes and a beating heart--they suck their thumb in the womb, they yawn, they stretch, they move--is a child.  I understand there is wide argument about a child that is at 8 weeks of gestation, whom I believe is a child, but others look at it and say: It doesn't look like a child yet. But a child at 20, 22, 24 weeks of gestation even looks like a child when you look at the child in the ultrasound. It is hard to disagree, especially when children are born at that age prematurely and they survive, and many of us know kids that were born at 22 weeks. The bill that came up today on the Senate floor, which had bipartisan support and had a majority of support but not 60 Senators' support to be able to discuss this, was a very simple, straightforward bill. It asked just one question: Will we as Americans continue to allow elective abortions when the child is viable?  The Supreme Court said in 1973 that the government has a right to be able to step in and protect a viable child. There is no question that they are at that age of viability. There is no question, at that age of 20 weeks, that science shows us they experience pain in the womb, and that if surgery happens for a child in utero like that, that child is actually given anesthetic to be[[Page S548]]able to calm their pain during that surgery because they have a developed nervous system and because they have a beating heart. This body refused to even take up the issue and debate it.  There is no question that I am very passionate about the issue of life and about children, and that we should as a culture protect children. But this one confuses me--for this body, more than any other issue. There are only seven nations in the world that allow elective abortions after 20 weeks. There are only four nations in the world that allow elective abortions after 24 weeks. We are in that elite club. We are in the elite club with three other nations that allow elective abortions that late--Vietnam, North Korea, and China--the worst human rights violators in the world. There sits the United States in that very elite club.  Why are we there? Because we can't even discuss the possibility that a child is a child, and anyone who has ever seen an ultrasound at 24 weeks cannot deny that is a child, and if that child was delivered prematurely, they would survive and grow and develop into a person. The only difference between that child at 20 weeks and an adult now is time.  This issue will continue to come up, and it should because we as a culture should promote a culture of life and of honoring people--people at their most vulnerable moment. There is no more vulnerable a moment than that for that child. We have to get out of this club of elective abortions and the only group that allows it--North Korea, China, and When will we wake up to the fact that the entire rest of the world--all of Europe, all of Africa, all of Central America, all of South America, every one of those countries--sees that plain? A child is a child, and we need to be able to guard its life.  So I am sad that today in a bipartisan vote with more than 50 votes to be able to get into it and pass it, we didn't have enough people even to want to discuss it and to be able to bring up the bill. We will bring it up again for the sake of those children and their futures. We will bring it up again, and we will keep bringing up the facts of the argument, not the emotion but the facts of the argument, and we will win people over.  With that, I yield the floor.

631,topic-id,1439,"Mr.President, I see the distinguished Senator from Alaska on the floor. I will not be long, as I noted to him. I am speaking in my capacity as the Democratic manager of the legislation before us.  I think--like most of us and most people in the country--we are frustrated by what is happening, because I have only heard one person say they want a government shutdown, and he got exactly what he wanted. It was President Trump who said the country could ``use a good shutdown.'' President Trump said a shutdown would be ``good'' for him politically. It was President Trump who tweeted yesterday that the shutdown was a ``nice present'' to himself.  Well, the United States of America is not designed to give presents to the We expect Presidents to do what is best for the country, not for themselves.  The best for the country would be not to have a shutdown. People are suffering under the Trump shutdown. For him to call it a ``nice present'' to himself escapes reality.  In fact, as he rubbed shoulders with the superwealthy at his father's fundraiser last night, the President's son said a shutdown is ``a good thing for us politically.'' It is hard to make up this kind of detachment from our country.  I want to make one thing very clear to President Trump, there is no such thing as a good government shutdown. It is not a good thing that today medical research is ground to a halt. It is not a good thing that families in Vermont or New Hampshire who are trying to help their loved ones overcome opioid addiction cannot access the resources they need. It is not a good thing that readiness training exercises for our military were canceled this weekend.  The President apparently is thinking of himself and playing the politics of fear and obstruction. In fact, he was actually prepared for it. One would think he was hoping for it. Yesterday morning, the first day of the Trump shutdown, the President's campaign posted a video that was nothing short of racist fearmongering. Propaganda meant to scare the American people has no place in our democracy.  Instead of playing the politics of fear, the President should be leading and working with us to reach a bipartisan deal and a path forward. That could be done if the President really wanted to lead instead of talking about what is a good political present for himself. I think he knows this.  In 2013, when talking about the government shutdown at that time, he said the President has ``got to get everybody in the room and he's got to lead,'' but so far the President and Republican leadership continue to lock Democrats out of the negotiations. When they do that, they exclude the voices of half the American people.  This morning, the President even said the Senate should change its rules to permanently exclude the input of the minority party. Well, I have been here many times in the majority and many times in the minority. I can't think of Republicans or Democrats who want to take that chance because someday the shoe is always on the other foot.  That is why I was so proud to be asked by Senator Bob Dole--one of the great leaders of this Senate, a Republican leader--to speak on his behalf at the Gold Medal presentation this past week. He knew both sides have to work together.  I have long said the Senate can be the conscience of the It can be the conscience of the Nation precisely because it forces bipartisan compromise. It forces the inclusion of views from across the political spectrum, because its Members--and I include the Republican leader, the majority leader today--have a deep respect for this institution. They are not going to take a sledgehammer to the  It is the majority's responsibility to produce a bill to send to the They didn't get 60 votes because they had not negotiated with Republican leadership presented the Senate with a bill that was produced behind closed doors, with no involvement from the Democrats, and, I suspect, no involvement from many of their own party. They allowed no amendments. That is a recipe for failure, and that failure and the President's inability to keep his word put us here.  The Republican Party controls the House, the Senate, and the White House, and it is their job to govern and to lead. It is their job to reach out to us and come up with a compromise. In my 43 years here, I have been in so many of these compromises with people across the political spectrum, where no one gets everything they want, but the country was far better off.  The President promised to treat DACA recipients with ``great heart.'' Instead, he is holding our Nation's Dreamers hostage to a rightwing, anti-[[Page S404]]immigration agenda. He rejected a bipartisan deal--actually, the bipartisan DACA deal with Senators Graham and Durbin and others from both parties--specifically drafted to meet what the President said were his demands.  In the wake of his heartless decision to end DACA, nearly 122 Dreamers lose status every day--122 yesterday, 122 today, 122 more tomorrow. The Trump administration has acknowledged to Congress that implementing any Dream legislation will take up to 6 months, during which tens of thousands more Dreamers could lose their status, like the young who is excelling in medical school. In an interview, he said he worries about a knock on the door, and he may have to leave. The irony is, there are a whole lot of other countries that would like to have him, even though he is in an area where we have a shortage of doctors.  We know on March 5, hundreds of thousands of DACA recipients will lose their status because of President Trump's actions. Republicans argue there is no urgency to provide protections to It couldn't be further from the truth. Since President Trump decided to revoke their protective status, these hundreds of thousands of Dreamers have had to live with fear and anxiety every day. No urgency? I tell you right now, if this were part of my family, I would feel the urgency, not every hour but every minute, every second.  We are here because we had 113 days to do this. The can got kicked down the road on the basic responsibility of Congress to fund the Federal Republican leadership failed to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program and failed to advance legislation to protect the  For 113 days, Democrats supported three continuing resolutions. I voted for a critical one of those, but we had the promise from the Republicans that they needed a little more time to reach a bipartisan deal. The time they said they needed is long gone. We voted for a continuing resolution in September to provide for time. We voted for a second continuing resolution in early December to provide more time. We voted for a third continuing resolution in late December to keep the talks going. How will it be different if we vote for another 4 weeks?  We have all the pieces to reach a bipartisan path forward. All we have to do is say yes. Let's do our job. We want to raise budget caps set in place by the Budget Control We want to stop the devastating consequences of sequestration on both defense and nondefense legislation. We want to take care of the bipartisan Children's Health Insurance We want to extend community health centers, and we actually have a bipartisan agreement to protect the Let's not kick the can down the road.  If we pass another continuing resolution without a bipartisan agreement, we only drive further into the fiscal year without doing our jobs, and the American public, Republicans and Democrats alike, will know that.  Even if we did reach an agreement at the end of the next continuing resolution, we would still need another month to write the appropriations bills, which could bring us halfway into the fiscal year. As vice chairman of the Appropriations Committee, we are ready to start moving on those bills the second we have an agreement because we can't govern by continuing resolution. Our military cannot function under a continuing resolution and under the burden of sequestration.  We Democrats have been ready, willing, and asking to negotiate bipartisan deals since We need to reach a deal on a long-term path forward. We need to have the courage to reach that deal now.  I see my friend from Alaska on the floor  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2018-01-21-pt1-PgS397-3.txt,1383,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2018.0,21.0,January
989,topic-id,1676,"Mr.President, I cannot help but note that the fiscal year began October 1 last year. Four months have passed. That is 122 days since the start of the fiscal year, and we still don't have a budget deal to allow us to finish the fiscal year 2018 appropriations bills. That is 122 days, and the Congress has not done their job.  Recently, President Trump has taken to He has accused Democrats of holding up funding for our troops. Well, the idea that Democrats are holding up defense spending doesn't pass the laugh test. I mean, last July--7 months ago--I called for bipartisan budget negotiations, something we have always done in the past. As the vice chairman of Appropriations, I put forward a proposal that would increase defense spending by $54 billion and would increase nondefense spending by an equal amount of $54 billion. Basically, what we did when Senator Murray and then-Congressman Ryan worked out the budget agreement. We did that years ago based on parity. The proposal was responsible, it was reasonable, and it was based on parity. It was something we have done for years. It would have fully funded President Trump's budget request for our military, but it would also have provided much needed relief from the damaging effects of sequestration that we have seen on both sides of the ledger, defense and nondefense.  But instead of trying to reach a bipartisan budget deal to allow us to finish our spending bills on time, the Republican leadership, which controls the agenda, had other priorities. They spent the last 7 months trying to repeal healthcare for millions of Americans and rolling back important consumer protections. They cut environmental and workplace protections, protections for women in the workplace, and they passed budget-busting tax cuts that primarily benefit big corporations and the wealthiest As a result of doing that, the funding for our troops, as well as for key domestic priorities, has been left to limp along under four continuing resolutions.  Yesterday, the Trump administration--and I wonder if they have actually looked at the President's budget--accused Democrats of holding defense spending hostage over arbitrary demands for lower priority domestic programs.  I am curious. What are the domestic programs the Trump administration considers a lower priority? Do they consider the services for our veterans that are lacking around this country--do they think helping our veterans is a lower priority? What about the funding to combat the opioid epidemic? Every single State represented by every single Senator here, Republican and Democrat alike, in every corner of our country, has been hurt by the opioid epidemic. Is the Trump administration saying that is a lower priority? How about investments in education for our Nation's children? Is that a lower priority? Is disaster relief for our communities that have been devastated by hurricanes--there are so many--a lower priority? What about replacing our crumbling bridges all across the country before people start dying in record numbers? Is that a lower priority?  The President puts before us a false choice, and it makes me wonder if he is actually seeing the budget his administration proposes. There is no reason we[[Page S565]]can't fight for and fund both our military and other domestic programs. It is not an either/or choice. It has never been an either/or choice, whether we have had a Democratic or Republican administration.  One thing we do know is that operating under four continuing resolutions is no way to govern. I think it is time to get serious about reaching a deal.  Later today, the House is going to pass another Defense appropriations bill that will exceed the budget caps by $73 billion, and they don't even know where it will be spent. But if you don't have a budget deal to raise the caps, this would be a false promise to our military because that funding level would trigger a sequester. It would force a 13-percent across-the-board cut on defense programs. It is not a serious bill; it is a messaging bill.  There are those who are going to tout it on the floor of the House, saying: Look what we are doing to raise it. Will they at least take a moment to say that it actually cuts our defense programs 13 percent across the board? I asked the Secretary of Defense what he thinks about that. He says it would be a disaster.  What we are doing is we have been substituting sound bites for substance. I think we are past the time for that kind of messaging.  The budget and the appropriations process are where we set our priorities as a nation and where we put those priorities into action. That has been our policy here in the Senate under Democratic and under Republican leadership for decades. Instead of doing this basic job, Congress and the President have put the Federal budget on perpetual autopilot, so it never gets done. It comes up, we talk about it, and it doesn't get done. It comes up again, we talk about it, and it doesn't get done. The can has been kicked down the road over and over again.  It makes me think of ``Groundhog Day.'' We are coming up on Groundhog Well, it is ``Groundhog Day,'' plus a sequel, plus another sequel, plus another sequel and yet another sequel. Well, that may have been a funny movie, but this is real life for over 300 million Americans, and 100 Americans are entrusted to make their lives better.  Kicking the can down the road and playing ``Groundhog Day'' is corrosive and damaging to our Nation and to the American people in countless ways.  Certainly, my experience with a Republican administration and a Democratic administration, many times in the majority in this body and many times in the minority in this body--one thing I have learned, and many of my Republican colleagues tell me the same thing, is that you can't govern by continuing resolution. It is easy. It means you don't have to do your work. But neither the military nor our country can properly function under sequestration. They can't function if we don't do our jobs.  This week, we are taking another recess after this afternoon. I wish we would just stay here and get these bills passed. I am willing to. Vermont is a very nice place to be this time of year--great skiing, lovely place. I have kids and grandkids there, but I will stay here if it means we can get the appropriations bills passed, get us off this corrosive, wasteful continuation of a continuing resolution and sequestration.  The continuing resolution expires on February 8. That is 9 days from today. It is up to the Republican leadership in both Chambers to get serious about striking a bipartisan budget deal. I believe there is something we can do. Talking with both Republican and Democratic Senators, I think we could have a budget deal that would get 60 votes in the We could raise the caps. We could take care of defense but also take care of a lot of priorities we hear about when we walk down Main Street in the towns and cities we represent. These aren't people who have a partisan attitude; they just want to see the government work.  The States that have suffered from hurricanes and flooding want to see us help them as a nation. If their community is devastated by opioids, they want to see us do something about it. They would like to see the Federal Government do something about stopping the millions of opioids flooding into this country illegally from They are not coming across the wall; they are coming from China through the mail, through the post offices we all have in our communities.  Let's start to look at the real threats to You don't do it by sound bites; you do it by substance and hard work. There are many Senators on both sides of the aisle who are willing to do that hard work. We have unbelievably talented staff from both Republicans and Democrats who have been working very hard to get us there. Let's start doing that. Let's stop looking for the sound bite. Let's start looking for the substance. I am ready to. I have talked with key Members of both parties about this. It can be done.  I felt honored the other day when Senator Robert Dole, one the titans of this body--a Republican, a conservative Republican--asked me to be one of the two Senators to speak when he received the Congressional Gold We had a chance to chat first about how we used to do it. Without sounding like the old-timer talking about the good old days, what we would do is the Republicans and Democrats--key Members of both parties--would sit down and we would work something out because we could take each other's word for it. We set aside political posturing, and we did what was best for the country.  Senator Dole joined with Senator Moynihan--a conservative Republican and a liberal Democrat--and they saved Social Senator Dole joined with Senator George McGovern--again, a conservative Republican and a liberal As a result, millions of children were fed, others were fed, hungry people were fed in this country and in other countries. What a great humanitarian gesture. Both Senator Dole and Senator McGovern fought in World War Both had a distinguished military career. Senator Dole was severely injured. Senator McGovern volunteered to fly many, many missions beyond the number he was required to, even though so many planes in those missions were being shot down. But they came back and said: We did that. Now what are we doing for the people we fought to save?  We should listen to people like that. We should listen to them. We would be a better Senate, we would be a better country if we did.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

We fondly remember meals at their home and how they cared for us and our children as I was first running for  Tim loved Vermont and was committed to making a difference, both in Brattleboro and statewide. He set an example for the importance of public service, serving in positions as humble as town moderator, to those as important as speaker of the Vermont State He served as a Democrat in the Vermont House of Representatives from 1969 to 1981. Throughout his career, Tim embodied bipartisanship above all else, reaching across the aisle to put Vermonters first. In what surely sounds like a fairytale in this hyperpartisan era, when Tim served as speaker of the house, Republicans controlled the chamber.  The only thing that Tim loved more than our State was his family. Marcelle and I have them in our hearts, and our prayers go out to Martha, Kerry, Kate, and I called Martha to tell her how I will miss him, but that I will look, every day, at the walking stick Tim brought me from  I ask unanimous consent that Bob Audette's article in the Brattleboro Reformer be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:[[Page S499]]               [From the Brattleboro Reformer, 17, 2018]             Vermont Mourns the Death of ``A Gentle Soul''                            (By Bob Audette)       Brattleboro, VT.--By all accounts, Timothy O'Connor      was kind, fair, amicable, no-nonsense, intelligent and witty.

Perhaps the most succinct description came from O'Connor      himself in a 2010 interview with the Reformer, describing his      three-term tenure as Speaker of the House in Montpelier: ``It      was a job where you were like the traffic cop at the downtown      Main Street circle, trying to get five lanes of cars to move      and go with some order, trying to get people to basically      compromise on certain positions in order to get legislation      passed.''       That interview was conducted after the House of      Representatives presented a resolution honoring O'     ``It is a way to honor Tim's work in the past and to thank      him for his continued work in our community, where he is      valued for his expertise, sharp wit and humor,'' said former      legislator Sarah Edwards at the time the resolution was      sponsored.                       a role model and a mentor       O'Connor, who was born in Brattleboro on 13, 1936,      served as a Democrat in the Vermont House of Representatives      from 1969 to 1981. He was chairman of the House Judiciary      Committee from 1973 to 1975 and served as Speaker of the      House from 1975 to 1981. In 1980, he launched an unsuccessful      bid for the governor's office.       Before his career as a politician, O'Connor graduated from      Michael High School in Brattleboro in 1954 and then the      College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, After he      graduated from Georgetown University Law Center in      Washington, D.C., in 1961, he attended President John      Kennedy's inauguration. He married Martha Elizabeth Hannum of      Putney on July 8, 1961, and in 2017 they celebrated their      56th wedding anniversary.       He began his legal career in the law offices of Edward      John, at the age of 25. O'Connor practiced law until his 2011      retirement, though he served as Town Meeting Moderator      through 2012.       ``He's been a role model and mentor for all of us, and the      profession is going to be less for his leaving,'' Theodore      Kramer, of Kramer Law Offices in Brattleboro, told the      Reformer in 2011. ``Timmy really is one of a kind. He's an      exceptional attorney and just a spectacular, quality guy,      very reliable and professional.''       ``Tim was like a father to me and very much like my own      father,'' Brattleboro attorney Jeffrey Morse told the      Reformer on Morse learned from O'Connor when      starting his own law career. ``We have lost a truly great      man.''                    impeccable loyalty and integrity       ``We need more Timmy O'Connors today more than ever,'' said      Peter Shumlin, who served as governor of Vermont for three      terms. ``He couldn't care less who you were, what the color      of your skin was, your religious beliefs or your sexual      orientation. All he cared about was the quality of your      character. And you could trust him to stand behind you once      you became friends.''       Shumlin noted that when O'Connor was elected Speaker of the      House, the Legislature was dominated by If that      wasn't remarkable enough, O'Connor served three terms as      ``What made Timmy such an unshakable friend and fine      servant to Vermont was that everybody knew his loyalty and      integrity were impeccable,'' said ``Because of that,      Republicans, Democrats, Independents and everybody else      trusted him with their own future.''       ``Tim pulled off an impossible upset getting elected      Speaker in a minority house,'' former legislator Michael      Obuchowski told the Reformer in 2010. ``He had the ability to      convince people, and how he convinced them was with his Irish      kindness and fairness.''       ``In his years leading the Vermont House, his unrivaled      ability to build consensus and find common ground earned him      genuine respect and support from all sides of the aisle,''      stated current Speaker of the Vermont House of      Representatives, Mitzi Johnson, in an email to the media.       ``Just getting elected Speaker is an amazing feat, but to      be elected by both parties, as a member of the minority      party, and for more than one session, is unheard of,'' said      Mike Mrowicki, who represents Putney, Dummerston and      Westminster in the Vermont ``He was an amazing public      servant and a coalition builder.''       But, noted Mrowicki, O'Connor's interest in people went      beyond consensus building. ``Tim was always eager to hear how      you were doing and wanted to know if he could help in any      way.''                        a listener, not a talker       U.Peter Welch told the Reformer that O'Connor and      John Carnahan were the first two people he met when he moved      to Vermont in 1974 to pursue a legal career. Being elected      the Speaker of the House while a member of the minority party      was a result of O'Connor's personality, his decency and his      civility, said ``He embodied an ethic in Vermont that      you work together with people of opposing parties to get      things done.''       Welch said that during his career in politics he has tried      to emulate O'Connor and Bob Gannett, who represented      Brattleboro and Windham County in the Vermont State House for      more than 25 years.       ``They inspired me to focus on the issues, find common      ground, not to get personal and be open and generous with      your colleagues,'' said ``It was effortless with      He is truly one of the giants of Vermont politics.''       What also made him unique among politicians, said Welch,      was that O'Connor was a listener and not a talker. ``Unless      you got him on the topic of Ireland, and then you couldn't      get him to shut up.''       ``Tim had such a great sense of humor, especially when it      involved the Irish,'' said U.Patrick ``I will      miss him but I'll look, every day, at the walking stick he      brought me from Ireland.''                            a proud Irishman       O'Connor was a member of what Fran Lynggaard Hansen      described in her book, ``Brattleboro: Historically      Speaking,'' as the Irish on Elliot       According to Hansen's retelling, O'Connor's grandparents,      Timothy Patrick O'Connor and his wife, Hannah Daly O'Connor,      came independently from County Kerry in They met in      Norwich, Conn., later moving to Bellows Falls where relatives      found them jobs in a local paper mill. Eventually, the couple      moved to Putney, where they raised two boys and two girls.

The weight of his life      will be felt in Brattleboro for a very long time.''                   A MAN IN SERVICE TO HIS COMMUNITY       ``Tim O'Connor understood, and in many ways embodied, what      it meant to serve his community and his state,'' said U.     Bernie ``Moreover, in this era of increasing      political divisiveness, Tim serves as a model for bringing      people together.''       As Town Meeting Moderator for Brattleboro for more than two      decades, his reputation for his enthusiastic use of his gavel      to rein in the meanderings of Town Meeting Representatives      frustrated some people, but always brought a chuckle to many      more.       ``There were many memorable Town Meetings that Tim      moderated,'' wrote Fred Noyes, who recorded a number of      Representative Town Meetings for ``I would sometimes      say that he was the grandpa of our town.''       ``I've seen my share of Town Meeting moderators over the      years, in Brattleboro and beyond,'' wrote Mary White, of      ``Tim was the best, by far.''       ``Tim O'Connor was a kind, caring, funny, wise, and      generous person who gave decades of tireless public service      to Brattleboro and all of Vermont,'' said Brattleboro Town      Manager Peter ``We will miss him terribly, but will      always be grateful for who he was and how he lived.''       Becca Balint, the current president of the Vermont Senate,      said O'Connor was very supportive of her in pursuing a career      in politics. ``I greatly respected his advice and perspective      on working in the Legislature, and I'm so grateful that he      saw and nurtured my leadership qualities. Tim O'Connor is      known in the State House as a man who cherished and modeled      civility and collegiality. He brought his heart to his work,      and in doing so he positively impacted so many legislators      and constituents.''       ``Speaker O'Connor had the reputation of a true public      servant--a reputation he earned through his unique ability to      achieve consensus and compromise,'' said Phil      ``His years of leadership have made a lasting mark, and his      positive impact on Vermont will not soon be forgotten.''                             FOREVER LOYAL       Shumlin said when he volunteered to work for Tom Salmon's      campaign for governor in the early 1970s, ``Timmy took me      under his wing, he tutored me, taught me, cared for me and      kept me out of trouble. I was forever loyal to him after      that.''       If more politicians were like O'Connor, said Shumlin, ``We      wouldn't be in the mess we are in now.''       During a recent visit to O'Connor, Shumlin said his mentor      was incredulous over the adversarial atmosphere in      Washington, D.      ``He said, `I never thought I would live to see the day      when division and name-calling would come from the President      of the United States of It's just so discouraging.'      ''       Such a comment from O'Connor was very rare, said      ``Tim was a person who rarely spoke ill of anybody. He had a      heart of gold and would fight for folks without a voice.      That, combined with his impeccable integrity, made him one of      the great leaders of our time.''[[Page S500]]       Jim Douglas, who preceded Shumlin as governor, agreed.       ``At a time when rancor has permeated our political process      and collegiality seems to have disappeared from the public      square, Tim O'Connor stands as a glorious example of what a      public servant should be,'' said ``We need more like      him today.''       Douglas, a Republican who served as House Majority Leader,      also recalled his time working with O'Connor, whom he      described as ``a tremendous leader.''       Like others who served with O'Connor, Douglas said he was      fair and impartial and that he cared about each legislator,      regardless of party affiliation, and displayed a genuine      nonpartisanship that earned the respect of all of his      colleagues.       ``I had the temerity to challenge his re-election as      Speaker in 1979,'' said Douglas, who would later serve three      terms as Vermont's governor. ``He defeated me handily, but      there were no hard feelings: he promptly re-appointed me to      chair a committee.''       James Valente, of Costello, Valente & Gentry in      Brattleboro, said everyone should try ``to be a little more      like Tim in our daily lives. He could teach without      lecturing, argue without fighting, and make you laugh without      teasing,''       A funeral Mass is scheduled for Saturday at 1 p.m. at      Michael Catholic Church in Brattleboro, with arrangements      organized by Atamaniuk Funeral       The family requests no flowers.

25,topic-id,1008,"Mr.President, if you have been following the circus in this town long enough, you probably remember earmarks, the infamous special interest spending provision that party leaders used to sprinkle over unpopular legislation, sort of like heavily subsidized sugar.  Even if you aren't familiar with this concept, you may be familiar with specific wasteful earmarks, such as the infamous $223 billion ``bridge to nowhere'' in Alaska or the $3.4 million turtle tunnel in Florida, which was precisely what it sounds like, a 13-foot-long underground tunnel that was intended not for people, not for automobiles, not for train traffic but for turtles, or the so-called ``monuments to me,'' buildings that politicians named after themselves.  Earmarks were everything Americans couldn't stand about Washington, They enabled corruption, and they facilitated waste. They wreaked of entitlement. They were the swamp, and then they went away for 7 wonderful years and counting. They went away because Republicans banned them after the 2010 election cycle, when the tea party wave rolled through Washington, lifted by an anti-cronyism message. Now some politicians in the House of Representatives are trying to bring earmarks back. Now, I have heard some bad ideas in my time in the Senate, but this one takes the cake.  Just like in a horror movie, the swamp thing is coming back to life--or at least it is trying to--even after we hit it in the face with a shovel.  Earmark fans never left Washington, of course. They have just been lying low, waiting for memories of their waste and abuse to somehow fade from our public consciousness, from our awareness, and our discussions about  Now, 7 years later, these politicians and their special interest pals think they have found a nifty argument to rehabilitate pork-barrel spending. They point to the dysfunction in Congress and say earmarks would somehow make all of that better. It is a little bit like saying: There is a fire over here, let's pour some gasoline on it and see what happens.  Sure, these offenders admit earmarks are frequently unseemly. They have to acknowledge that. There is no getting around that point, but they claim earmarks are a kind of industrial lubricant for the sausage-making factory that is  According to them, bringing earmarks back will get the machine churning out sausage again, just like before. Like many terrible political arguments, this one has some acknowledgeable, superficial appeal.  Congress is, indeed, dysfunctional, and earmarks probably would make it easier for some people in Congress, some party leaders and others, to buy votes for their bills, but why should we believe our problems would be solved if we just hand more power over to the already powerful few in Congress, if we make it easier for them to pass unpopular bills like ObamaCare or massive amnesty?  It was the elites from both parties who reduced Congress to its present lowly state. The public despises Congress, and it certainly is not because we killed earmarks. It is because the public distrusts the elites who rule them and the awful unrepresentative laws they passed with the help of earmarks, no less, prior to the 2010 election cycle, when the American people said: Enough is enough when it comes to earmarks.  Now, the fight over earmarks is really a fight over two very different, competing visions of how Congress should govern. The Washington establishment likes the current system, where just a few lawmakers negotiate and write bills behind closed doors.  This system, itself, works great for the swamp. If you like the swamp, then you probably love earmarks. It keeps cash flowing through certain offices and their alumni's lobbying shops on K There are tough decisions made in secret without any accountability or fidelity to the public, to the people we represent.  This corrupt system excludes all but a handful of well-positioned Representatives and So it effectively disenfranchises hundreds of millions of Americans whose representatives have little say over what actually passes into law. Bringing back earmarks would only make that situation worse.  An alternative system would be one of transparency, of decentralization, of legislative accountability. Representatives and Senators would write legislation collaboratively in the open for all to see, forcing popular compromises and, yes, from time to time, taking tough votes.  The reason Congress doesn't work like this right now is because the establishment is afraid of what the public might see and how they might vote in response to what they see. Governing out in the open would require Members to do the hard work of learning about issues before forming coherent positions.  The present broken system is much easier, at least in this critical respect: It lets a small handful of lawmakers do all the thinking and the scheming, and it rewards docile lawmakers with the occasional earmark to tout to their constituents back home, to tout to them as if to ask: Aren't I wonderful?  Earmarks would make life better for politicians, in other words, but it would make life worse for the country, much worse. That we are even considering such a bargain; that it is even being discussed as a serious matter in the House of Representatives is an insult to logic and is exactly why Congress is held in such widespread public disdain.  Eventually, I believe, Congress will reform itself. As the old adage goes: ``If something cannot go on forever, it won't,'' but it will take a lot of painful decisions before we get to that point.[[Page S451]]We will have to struggle hard to extricate ourselves from the mess.  Bringing back earmarks would represent a step backward in this struggle--back to cronyism, back to waste, and, yes, back to the swamp. This is something we cannot allow. This is something that cuts against our very interests as Americans and as Members of an institution that has called itself the world's greatest deliberative legislative body.  So I would ask my friend from Arizona, Senator Flake, for his thoughts on the matter and what he thinks about the wisdom, or lack thereof, in bringing back this horrible tradition.

27,topic-id,418,"Mr.President, I am grateful for the work that has been done by the Senator from Arizona on this topic.  One of the first times I remember seeing the Senator from Arizona on TV, many years before I was elected to the Senate, was while he was serving in the House of I saw him interviewed on national television, talking about this issue--talking about the corruption that inevitably flows[[Page S452]]from a system that allows for favors like these to be handed out. I remember the immense respect I had for this man whom I did not yet know and wouldn't come to know for another decade or so, but who was willing to call out something that he believed was contrary to public policy, contrary to any system that would result in a good consequence, a good outcome for the American people.  I also appreciate the comment he made a moment ago about a familiar refrain by defenders of earmarks. Senator Flake mentioned that over time people would point out that earmarks were, even during their heyday, maybe representing a couple of percentage points of total Federal spending. Well, that may be true, if you want to put it that way, in those terms, as they inevitably did at the time, quite persistently. But it overlooks a few things. It is a much larger percentage, of course, of discretionary spending, and of domestic nondefense discretionary spending could even be a larger percentage. But more to the point, something that is only 2 percent doesn't necessarily mean that it is having a favorable impact and that it is not having an impact that is itself very significant.  When you look at a mile-long train, the engine car might represent only about 2 percent of the total length of the train, but it is what is driving the train. It is what is determining where the train goes, and if that train is going in a wrong direction, that can be very bad. So I have always found unpersuasive the initially persuasive argument that this is just a tiny segment of Federal spending.  At the end of the day, earmarks represent everything that we are uncomfortable with about Moving back to them would represent a departure from a very favorable reform that we had in this body 7 years ago.  So I would ask Senator Flake, who has served in Congress longer than I have and who has seen this, to tell us what he fears most about bringing back earmarks.

29,topic-id,169,"Mr.President, Senator Coburn said this is the ``gateway drug'' for big government. That is such an appropriate analogy. It reminds me of a news clip that I saw a couple of years before I ran for the U.Senate, when there was coverage of a very large spending bill that came up short--and those on the news commented at the time: Well, it is well understood in Washington that what is now going to have to happen is they are going to have to add probably tens of billions of dollars to this bill, which they will do, and they will end up getting it passed by adding these ``sweeteners'' as they call them--earmarks, essentially--in order to get people to vote for them for the same reason that Senator Flake just mentioned.  The dangers of bringing back earmarks are numerous, and it is my strong view that we should not do that. We should avoid this like the plague.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.

321,topic-id,443,"Mr.Speaker, let me thank the gentleman for yielding me time and for his tremendous leadership as our ranking member on the Defense Subcommittee of the Appropriations  Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition once again to this bill. I think the House has taken it up now for a third time this year.  Let me just start by saying I grew up in a military family. I am a military brat. My dad fought in World War II and in the Korean He was stationed, among his posts, at Fort Bliss,  And I want to say that supporting our troops, making sure that they have everything they need, is extremely important. And opposing this budget, for me, of course, does not reflect my support for our troops.  But I just have to tell you, this bill appropriates the $664 billion in defense spending for this already out-of-control Pentagon budget. It also includes more than $75 billion for wars that Congress has never debated or voted on. And what is worse, this bill includes $1.2 billion in overseas contingency operations to increase troop levels in Afghanistan by 3,500 troops. This is really outrageous, and this fund should really be eliminated.  Now, the Pentagon has failed to achieve the requirement to audit itself by 2017, and we know that billions of dollars have been found in waste, fraud, and abuse. That is unacceptable.  Instead of writing blank checks--which is what I think this bill does, another blank check to the Pentagon--Congress needs to live up to its constitutional obligation to complete an audit, first of all, to determine how to make sure we have a rational defense budget that protects our national security and supports our troops, not to provide excess contracts that lead to waste, fraud, and abuse. We also need to debate matters of war and peace.  So we need to pass my amendment, which I tried to do, quite frankly, last year in this very bill, that would sunset the 2001 AUMF, and it would give us 8 months--not immediately, but 8 months--to debate and vote on a new one before it would be enacted. It took 3 days to enact the last one. That is what the debate was. I am asking for 8 months.  This important amendment would provide Congress plenty of time to do our job and finally have a debate on matters of war and peace. However, even though my amendment passed the Appropriations Committee in a bipartisan fashion, Republicans unilaterally decided to strip this amendment from the bill, really, I have to say, in the dead of night.

So I asked for my amendment to be debated and voted on on the House floor, and again Republican leadership refused--really a shame. Our brave troops deserve us to come together and do this so that they know that their country has their back.  I voted against the 2001 authorization because I believe it opened the door for any President to wage endless war without a congressional debate or vote. Quite frankly, unfortunately, history has borne that out.  According to the Congressional Research Service report, the 2001 AUMF has been used more than 37 times in 14 countries to justify military action. This report examines only unclassified incidents, and it was conducted 3 years ago. So how many other operations have been conducted without the knowledge of Congress or the American people? These authorizations have also been used to justify perpetual wars that are thousands of miles away.  I will conclude by saying that now any President--any President--can unilaterally wage war under this outdated authorization forever, really, until it is repealed. Now we have an administration bent on increasing our presence in Afghanistan and never leaving Syria, both wars that the American public know nothing about.

613,topic-id,1070,"Mr.President, the United States is just one of seven countries in the entire world that currently allow elective abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, and we are not in good company on that list. Of the other six countries that allow elective abortions at that very late stage of the child's development, half of those countries have authoritarian governments--communist governments with horrible records when it comes to human rights.  Yes, our abortion laws are as extreme and inhumane as the abortion laws in Vietnam, China, and North It pains me--and it should pain all Americans--that the United States lags so very far behind the rest of the world in protecting the unborn, protecting human beings, simply because they have yet to take their first breath.  Twenty weeks is the fifth month of pregnancy. Think about what that means. At that stage, the unborn child is about 10 inches long from head to toe. He or she is roughly the size of a banana. A baby at this stage sleeps and wakes in the womb. She sucks her thumb, makes faces, and, in some cases, might even see light filtering in through the womb.  By 20 weeks, if not before, science suggests that the baby can also feel pain. Each year in this country, more than 10,000 abortions occur after this point in the baby's development. Today, we have a chance to stop this grave injustice.  Moments ago, this body voted on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, a bill that would prohibit abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy. This is a commonsense restriction that is supported by a majority of More than 6 in 10 Americans support a ban on abortion after 20 weeks, according to a Marist poll conducted earlier this month. Not only that, but a majority of Democrats--56 percent--said they would support an abortion ban at 20 weeks. Yes, this bill does, in fact, have widespread support, and it would bring America back into the mainstream of nations.  More importantly, this bill is just. It is humane. It is the right thing to do. It is the natural outcome of any question asked with a degree of moral probity: Is this right?  The reason we signed up for this job is to fight for what is right. And it is wrong--self-evidently wrong--that our country allows 5-month-old unborn babies to be killed. We, in this body, have a moral duty to protect those vulnerable human beings, but I have no illusions that this will be easy.  We have to overcome the misinformation of the abortion industry. This is a powerful special interest group that wants to keep abortion legal right up to the moment of birth. The abortion industry is attacking this bill by denying that there is any evidence that unborn babies can feel pain at 20 weeks. The linchpin of its argument is a 2005 study that claimed unborn babies could not feel pain until the 30th week of pregnancy. What the abortion industry never mentions, of course, is that this study was written by individuals with significant and, I would add, undisclosed ties to the abortion industry itself.  As reported by the Philadelphia Inquirer, the study's lead author, who was not a doctor but a medical student, previously worked for Another of the study's authors actually performed abortions as the medical director of an abortion clinic.  How convenient that the abortion industry's denial of fetal pain rests on a study by its own employees. If I recall, the tobacco industry tried something similar when they denied that cigarettes cause cancer. As always, the antidote to misinformation is more information, and the antidote to bad science is good science.  I have three studies that address the topic of fetal pain specifically. They were all published after the abortion industry's favorite study--the one they prefer to acknowledge to the exclusion of all others. Unlike that study--the one they prefer to the exclusion of all others--none of these studies are compromised by a conflict of interest.  This one is by the International Association for the Study of It concludes: ``The available scientific evidence makes it possible, even probable, that fetal pain perception occurs well before late gestation.'' The study pinpoints fetal pain to the ``second trimester'' of pregnancy, ``well before the third trimester.''  Here is another study by the American Association of Pharmaceutical It concludes that ``the basis for pain perception appear[s] at about 20 to 22 weeks from conception.''  Finally, here is a 2012 study published in the Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal This paper states that there is evidence that unborn children can feel pain beginning at 20 weeks. The authors note that at this stage, unborn children have pain receptors in their skin, recoil in response to sharp objects like needles, and release stress hormones when they are harmed.  They conclude: ``We should suppose that the fetus can feel pain. . . . When the development of the fetus is equal to that of a premature baby.''  I could go on, but I think that is enough for now. The takeaway is this. The science at a minimum suggests that unborn children can feel pain around 20 weeks. It can feel the abortionists' instruments as they do their grisly work.  These children feel until they cannot. That possibility alone--the mere possibility--should be chilling to us, and that possibility alone should have us rushing to ban abortion at 20 weeks. I implore my colleagues who didn't vote for this to reconsider and, the next time they have an opportunity to support it, to vote yes on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection  A vote for this bill is a vote to protect some of the most vulnerable members of the human family. And yes, we are talking about members of the human family. The life form we are talking about is not a puppy; it is not some other form of animal. This is a human being we are talking about. This is something that instinctively calls out for us. We think about the needs of the most vulnerable among us, and we should be eager to protect them.  Together, we can move our country's laws away from those of North Korea and China and toward our most fundamental belief that all human beings are created equal and that they have an unalienable right to life.

867,topic-id,563,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for yielding and for that gracious introduction, but, more importantly, for his magnificent leadership and for constantly looking out for working men and women throughout the country. I also thank him very much for bringing us together this evening to discuss the Supreme Court case, Janus v.  Mr.Speaker, as we remember the man and the movement which transformed the soul of America, we must never forget that Martin Luther[[Page H663]]King, Jr., fought for economic justice and workers' rights.  A few months before King's assassination, two young African-American workers were crushed to death by a faulty truck in The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees--AFSCME--union members went on strike, and King was right there with them, leading and lending his support.  In a speech to the sanitation workers on strike, King explained why he was there. He said: ``Now our struggle is for genuine equality, which means economic equality. For we know that it isn't enough to integrate lunch counters. What does it profit a man to be able to eat at an integrated lunch counter if he doesn't earn enough money to buy a hamburger . . . ?''  Now, 50 years after King's tragic assassination after standing up for economic justice and fighting to end poverty, the Supreme Court is taking up a case that would gut union rights.  Make no mistake, the Supreme Court case, Janus v. AFSCME, is a political scheme to further endanger the rights of working people. This case is yet another attempt by billionaires and corporations to stop working people from joining unions altogether. This case will gut the very protections that are the fabric of our society, and that is our unions.  More than 16 million people are represented by a union, from teachers, firefighters, and nurses, to postal workers, and many more. Unions help improve lives. They increase wages. They lift families out of poverty. They fight for safe working conditions and well-deserved benefits.  Unions are especially critical to communities of color. For too long, African Americans have been locked out of wage increases because of discriminatory practices. But for African Americans who do join unions, they earn 15 percent more than their nonunion counterparts. African-American women, in particular, earn an average of $22 an hour compared to $17 an hour in a nonunion job, and those wages make a huge difference for families.  Plain and simple, unions provide a path to the American Dream and the middle class for working people.  Unfortunately, as union membership has decreased because of attacks on working people, income inequality has risen. From 1973 to 2007, as more States started forcing working people off of unions, income inequality rose by one-third. That is shameful.  So, Mr.Speaker, the Janus case before the Supreme Court now threatens the economic security of families all across the country. This case will go against what the American public wants. More than three in five Americans know the importance of labor unions, yet here we are having to defend their very existence. This is outrageous.  So we must ensure that working people, people of color, everyone, continue to have the right to join a union. It is the right thing for our economy. It is the right thing for our communities.

I look forward, however, to working together for the remainder of this year on our shared goal: bipartisan and responsible full-year funding for all discretionary investments.  Today, we are considering the FY 2018 Defense Appropriations bill for the third time, a time-wasting consequence of an agreement between the Speaker and rightwing Republicans--the third time. Last week, Republican leadership kicked the can down the road and passed yet another continuing resolution delaying investments in our military, education, infrastructure, biomedical research, and so much more.  Yet again, the bill before us removes Congresswoman Barbara Lee's amendment to debate a new Authorization for Use of Military Force which received bipartisan support in the Appropriations Committee markup. This undemocratic maneuver, which the majority has repeated once again, is outrageous.  In addition to the many procedural inequities, the majority's effort to increase defense spending is a mirage because the bill would turn off sequestration for defense in FY18, allowing Republicans to violate the spirit of our budget laws and increase defense spending while ignoring other investments that grow our economy, create jobs, and further provide for our security.  This is hardly about fiscal responsibility. If it were, the majority would eliminate the seven slush funds in this bill that equals $28.6 billion for a department that would receive far more than it requested.  Four months into the fiscal year, the Federal Government is irresponsibly operating on the fourth continuing resolution.

674,topic-id,3039,"Mr.President, here we are on a Sunday evening with the government technically already shut down, a year basically after President Trump said: What we need is ``a good shutdown.'' I didn't say that. My colleagues in the Democratic caucus didn't say that. President Trump said that: What we need is ``a good shutdown.''  So a year later, I would just simply say that Republicans, who control the House of Representatives and the Senate, listened to President Trump and they gave him a shutdown because of their unwillingness to compromise. Now, there is no such thing as a good shutdown. I think we universally recognize that.  I know that my colleague who just spoke before me suggested that it is not the President who appropriates. That is true. He is very right, but what is true is that it is the President who has to sign something. While he doesn't tell you what he is for, it is very difficult to figure out what you are going to send him that he will sign. That is why I have heard the majority leader in some interviews say: Well, when we know what President Trump is for, speaking about one topic, then we will figure out what we can send him.  That is part of the problem. The President is intimately involved in this process, and to suggest that he isn't goes against even his own views.  How many short-term extensions--that is what we are talking about here. People at home may hear ``continuing resolution.'' That is basically a short-term extension of what Republicans ask for before they sit down and do the homework that is necessary--the hard work, the tough decisions. This is government on life support, lurching from one short-term continuation of money to another short-term continuation of money, to another short-term continuation of money.  When I hear my colleagues speak, I guess they miss the fact that not one, not two, not three, but four Republican Senators also voted not to continue the short-term funding resolutions because they understand that we need to get the hard work of the Nation done. Four Republican Senators joined with the Democrats to say enough is enough.  It is a bipartisan view that enough is enough. Let's remember how we got here. If you understand how we got here, then maybe you can figure out how we move forward. Funding for the Federal Government lapsed at the end of last By October 1, we should have had this in place. But instead of performing their basic responsibility to govern, my Republican colleagues spent the fall of 2017 gorging on tax cuts for the wealthy. That is right. The Republican majority in both Houses of Congress spent October, November, and December on a joyride of pure ecstasy, showering giant corporations with trillion-dollar tax cuts, lowering rates for wealthy CEOs, and saddling working families with permanent tax increases.  Now Republicans are finally coming down off their high and realizing they forgot to do the hard work of governing, of having the appropriations for the government on a long-term basis. But governing requires making tough decisions. It requires long-term planning. It requires making compromises in service of the greater good. But instead of charting a real course forward, for our military, for our veterans, for our health centers, for our disaster-stricken communities--I believe, when we say ``This is the United States of America,'' that I vote for funding for States and communities far outside of New Jersey because we are all in this together. Yet that hasn't been done. Yes, for Dreamers as well.  What they keep asking for is a short-term extension after a short-term extension. Any school district, any city, any agency or business in America would run itself into ruin if it effectively tried 2-, 3-, or 4-week increments.  This is not the first continuing resolution to keep the government open. It is not the second one. I voted for the first two because I said: Well, you know, let's give them some time.  It is not the third one. We are looking at the fourth one. They have the gall to accuse Democrats--who don't control the House, don't control the Senate, don't control the White House--of shutting down the government. I have been in Congress a long time now, and only in Washington, when one party has control of both Chambers and the President of the United States and they fail to do their jobs, can you suggest that it is the minority party that is responsible. It boggles the imagination.  Yes, there is a 60-vote requirement here. But if you know you don't have the 60 votes, including the four Republican Senators who voted with many of us who want to have a full funding of the government, then you come and you negotiate so that we can get to a point where we can have that full funding. But, no, you just want to stick on the floor whatever you want and jam it, and then say: You either vote for this or you are going to be responsible for closing down the government.  That is not democracy. The last time I checked, this is not Cuba; it is the United States of The American people aren't stupid. They know it is no coincidence that the Federal Government has shut down after they spent a year watching in horror as this undisciplined, dysfunctional White House tarnishes the image of the United States globally. They know, as Harry Truman once said, that the buck stops with the  They know that the buck stops with President Trump today. As a matter of fact, it was President Trump, as a private citizen, when he was commenting about the last time the government had this challenge, who said that it was President Obama who was responsible, that he was the leader and should have brought everyone into the Oval Office, sat them down, and worked it out. Well, where is he? He has been hiding. He certainly hasn't called everyone in to work it out.  Now, in the face of this entirely predictable situation, the majority is presenting us with another short-term sham of kicking the ball down the road, so they can kick the can even further down the road and refuse to make a real commitment to America's military, America's health centers, America's disaster-stricken communities, America's children, and, yes, America's  I can't believe that they would accuse Democrats of playing politics with healthcare for 9 million children, when back in September--September of last year--the Senate Finance Committee passed unanimously my bipartisan bill, with Chairman Hatch and Ranking Member Brown, to fully fund the Children's Health Insurance Program for 5 years. There are those of us who wanted a much longer extension. There are clear studies which say that if we reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program for a decade, we could save tens of millions of dollars in doing so. But we went for the 5 years.  The Children's Health Insurance Program--that is exactly what CHIP is all about. It is ``Children's Health Insurance Program,'' which doesn't stand for a bargaining chip. But that is exactly what Republicans have used it for, ever since its funding lapsed last We could have had CHIP passed last But, no, they were too busy doing tax cuts--no budget, no appropriations, no children's health insurance.  Do my colleagues in the majority realize how transparent they have made their motives? They didn't want to give the Children's Health Insurance Program an up-or-down vote on the floor because they wanted to save it as a bargaining chip to get Democratic votes for another short-term sham.  Keep in mind, this short-term continuing resolution neglects other major[[Page S419]]priorities, like disaster relief for Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas, and I keep hearing Leader McConnell talk about reopening the government to serve all Americans, but this short-term CR doesn't do squat for the 3\1/2\ million American citizens living in Puerto Rico who are crying out for help. None of us would have accepted what they are in the midst of. Many still are without lights, still without electricity months after.  Nor does this short-term sham provide any long-term certainty for the Pentagon--for the Nation's defense--which needs to be able to commit to contracts and purchase the equipment our men and women in uniform depend on to protect this country from those who would do us harm. Our military leaders agree, we cannot protect the Nation on a week-to-week or month-to-month basis. It is insane.  Let's reopen the government right now with a short-term continuing resolution that keeps everyone here in Washington--the President, the leadership, both parties of both Houses, and Members to get the job done--so we can actually do our jobs and hash out a plan to keep our Armed Forces fully funded and prepare for today's challenges.  In fact, it was Dana White, the spokesperson for the U.Department of Defense, who recently called these short-term CRs ``wasteful and destructive.'' She went on to say: ``We need a fully-funded FY18 budget or face ramifications on our military.'' That is the chief spokesperson for the Secretary of  I think it is worth pointing out that I voted against the ridiculous sequestration that Republicans forced upon President Obama in 2011, after threatening to default on the full faith and credit of the United States, which has us in this predicament. The predicament that I constantly hear about our defense budget being under this sword, this limitation, was created by something Republicans pushed--to sequester funds from going beyond a certain cap. I voted against that because I knew that arbitrary caps on government spending and military readiness would not do justice to this country or the priorities of the American people. Yet some of my Republican colleagues are demanding a repeal of sequestration only for our defense agencies.  I am all in for a strong national defense but not at the expense of what makes this Nation worthy of fighting for and dying for--like the lifesaving research underway at the National Institutes of Health, which is seeking groundbreaking discoveries to cure the diseases that many of our families face, the Alzheimer's that took my mother's life, the Parkinson's of my neighbor, the challenges of cancer that so many of our families have, the protection provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the education funding we provide to public schools throughout the country, the beautiful national parks that are the envy of the world and the national treasure of the United Congress has a responsibility to make smart investments in our people and our communities, like funding for our community health centers that so many hard-working people across the country depend on for access to care.  I know that some of my far-right Republican colleagues are offended by the mere concept of publicly funded community centers. They don't see the critical value of these health centers offered to our communities. These are places where doctors and health providers serve every patient who walks through the door, regardless of whether they have private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, or no coverage at all--all takers, providing quality healthcare. That doesn't change the reality that our communities depend on these health centers, and, therefore, they depend on us to provide the funding. That is not in this  I would also like to remind my Republican colleagues and President Trump to own up to the rotten reality that they are all talk and no action on the opioid crisis that has claimed the lives of thousands of Americans in recent years. They want to gut Medicaid, and they have even--some, not all--but some have even gone so far as to blame Medicaid--blame Medicaid--for the opioid crisis, as if that makes any sense.  I invite my Republican colleagues to come home to New Jersey with me and meet some of the Americans who credit Medicaid with getting their lives back on track and addiction-free. Again, whether we are talking about community health centers or the opioid crisis or the pensions of our workers--people who have worked a lifetime, worked really hard, and through no actions of their own, find their pensions in jeopardy after having worked a lifetime--this doesn't do anything to help them in that regard. That is one of the reasons we want a full funding of the government, to meet that challenge, as well.  Instead of dealing with the challenges that face Americans in their lives every day, whether they are wondering about the state of their pensions while trying to pay for their kids' soaring tuition bills, struggling to make ends meet with staggering paychecks that have barely budged in decades, helping ailing parents who need long-term care, caring for their young children when their employers provide no family leave--I can go on and on, but the bottom line is, none of these challenges get any attention from my Republican colleagues here in the House and the Senate, in terms of this budget.  They spent the first half of 2017--last year--in a relentless effort to strip millions of Americans of their healthcare coverage. It was relentless. Then, when the American people spoke out and beat back Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, they gave up, and they set their sights on corporate tax cuts. They let funding for the Federal Government lapse in September and decided not to do anything about it. They had bigger fish to fry in their borrowing trillions from China and padding the pockets of a bunch of corporate fat cats. That is where they spent their time and energy--tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent.  Guess what President Trump's strategy is to distract the American people from his party's failure to govern. It is by fanning the flames of fear and bigotry.  I was incredibly disappointed to see the ad released by the President's reelection campaign yesterday that accused the Democrats of sympathizing with violent criminals, but I cannot say I am surprised. The fact is, whenever President Trump's own failures of leadership reflect negatively on him, he responds in the same way--with more racism, more xenophobia, more White nationalism.  I am not here to politicize the grief victims of violent crimes and their families have endured. We shouldn't let ourselves fall into the same traps of fear and division he seeks to set. Instead of that, we should be having an honest and bipartisan conversation about how we protect the 800,000 Dreamers who are lawfully living across this  Let's remember who created this crisis. It was President Trump who shut down DACA for no reason other than for political retribution. It is up to Congress to fix the problem, but Republicans didn't let us fix it in October or November or December of last year. Now it is nearly February, and DACA ends on March 4. When I hear Leader McConnell say there is no rush, no urgency--that it doesn't expire until March 4--tell that to the 16,000 young people who have lost their status already. Tell that to the 122 Dreamers who lose their status each and every day. Tell that to the thousands of American children who are now living with the fear that their parents will be taken away. That is right. Nearly 25 percent of DACA recipients have started families of their own.  Is this the party of family values that refuses to take action to keep families together? That is what I thought was their core element--keeping families together.  We presented the President with a real bipartisan compromise that protected the 800,000 Dreamers from deportation, embraced the call for more merit-based immigration, and gave billions of dollars to the President's border security priorities. They are hard choices. I didn't like some of them, but I agreed to them. It was what the President asked for.  Yet how can we strike a deal with someone who will not take yes for an answer, who continues to betray his own instincts in order to satisfy the most far-right elements of his party?[[Page S420]]  How are we supposed to believe the Republicans who say they want to do right by America's Dreamers when, with every chance they have to do something about it, they don't?  Likewise, how are we supposed to believe they are going to start treating their responsibility to govern seriously when they cannot keep the government's lights on for more than a couple of weeks at a time?  The Republicans keep asking for short-term extensions when they have had months to chart a real course forward for our domestic and defense spending priorities. The majority has spent all of its time trying to strip healthcare away, then saddling our grandchildren with debt and padding the pockets of the rich and powerful.  Make no mistake, the Democrats are willing to work across the aisle. I have on many occasions--on foreign policy; on the children's health insurance, which is legislation that passed the Finance Committee and had seven Republicans on it; and on many other things, including immigration. I was part of the Gang of 8--four Republicans, four I was part of the Gang of 6--three Republicans, three We are ready to help our colleagues in the Republican majority finally answer the hard questions and come up with solutions that fully fund the U. What we don't want is yet another month in which the Congress perpetuates the mindless sequestration caps that hamper our military readiness and our long-term success. We don't want yet another month in which we fail to deliver relief to our communities that are struggling with addiction amidst the opioid crisis. We don't want another month of kicking the can down the road on disaster relief that Americans in California, in Florida, in Texas, and Puerto Rico deserve so desperately. We don't want another month without long-term commitments to our men and women in uniform, our veterans, our health centers, our workers, our children.  Simply put, we don't want the Trump shutdown. Let's reopen the government with a short CR that keeps everyone at the negotiating table in Washington working on a long-term bill that reflects the priorities of the American people.

722,topic-id,600,"Mr.President, I come to the floor to express my concerns over the nomination of Sam Brownback to serve as Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom at the State I do not take my vote against a former colleague's nomination lightly nor do I question Governor Brownback's devotion to his own faith. Indeed, as a person of faith myself, I admire it.  I firmly believe, however, that anyone seeking to represent the United States of America must actively champion the rights of all people to worship freely and without fear. The right to religious freedom is enshrined in our Constitution, and it is a value that we must champion at home and abroad.  Having devoted my life to serving the people of New Jersey--a State enriched by incredible diversity--I believe religious freedom is part of what makes America exceptional. Even in the 21st century, we live in a world where governments and nonstate actors still use religion as a tool of oppression. They cloak their authoritarianism in the guise of divine inspiration, using their faith to justify the persecution of anyone they choose.  The U.Ambassador for International Religious Freedom must commit to defending the rights of all religious minorities around the world--Christians and Muslims, Jews and Sikhs, Hindus and Baha'i. Unfortunately, Governor Brownback's career has been defined by a lack of tolerance for those who do not share his own beliefs. I fear he will focus solely on protecting Christian minorities, while we must acknowledge publicly that people of all faiths are persecuted and demand equal representation.  Additionally, his own personal record on important issues gives me concerns. Consider his troublesome record on protecting the rights of LGBTQ individuals. I was deeply disturbed that when pressed during his confirmation hearing, Governor Brownback could not even bring himself to muster a resounding ``no''--that it is never acceptable for a government to imprison or execute an individual based on their sexual orientation. Condemning such horrific human rights abuses should never be a heavy lift for anyone who seeks to represent our Nation on the global stage.  I cannot in good faith support the confirmation of someone as Ambassador at Large for Religious Freedom who does not believe that all individuals are created equally in God's image.  During his hearing, Governor Brownback also declined to say whether political leaders should be able to use religion to deny women access to healthcare and deprive them of their basic human rights. His silence spoke volumes.  At a time when the Trump administration continues to expand the scope of the global gag rule to the effect of preventing healthcare workers from doing their jobs and providing lifesaving care, we need a leader who recognizes that women's rights are human rights and who knows that the oppression of women by religious zealots is a hallmark of despotism.  During his time as Governor and here in the Senate, Mr.Brownback often used religion to push policies that undermine the rights of women to access healthcare, control their own bodies, and determine their own destinies.  As much as I know the people of Kansas wish to see Governor Brownback sent abroad and out of their State, I cannot support his confirmation today. In these uncertain times, in a world rife with challenges, our Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom must be a champion for people of all faiths and a warrior for the human dignity of all of God's children.

928,topic-id,964,"Mr.President, I come to the floor to voice my concerns about the nomination of Alex Azar to lead the U.Department of Health and Human  The American people deserve a Secretary of Health and Human Services who actually believes in the agency's work and mission, which is to help America's families, children, and seniors lead healthier and more productive lives.  Nothing in Mr.Azar's record gives me any reason to believe he will do anything other than advance the Trump administration's mission to take healthcare coverage away from millions of Americans and leave everyone else with higher costs.  Instead of working to help more families get the care they need, I fear he will devote most of his time to imposing a harmful, rightwing ideology on patients, on women, and on families.  Mr.Azar will continue the Trump administration's reckless assault on the reproductive rights of women; he will support the far right's relentless war on science- and evidence-based health policy; and he will put the needs of powerful special interests ahead of patients and families.  It is hard to believe the Trump administration has only been in office a year because already it has broken so many of the promises the American people were fed on the campaign trail. During his campaign, President Trump promised he would replace the Affordable Care Act with something truly great, something way better, but under President Trump's watch, things have only gotten worse. Premiums are up, deductibles are up, and for the first time since 2012, the number of Americans with healthcare coverage has gone down.  Now, this is no accident. It is the result of the Trump administration's relentless assault on the Affordable Care That is right. Thanks to this administration's deliberate efforts to sow chaos in our health insurance markets, and subsidies that reduce sky-high deductibles, and give consumers less time to shop for insurance, 3.5 million fewer Americans have coverage compared to 1 year ago. In my State, the number of New Jerseyans enrolled in the marketplace dropped by 5 percent.  Mr.Azar says the Affordable Care Act is ``circling [down] the drain,'' when the reality is, Republicans have done their best to drown it. The Trump administration has no plan to help the growing number of Americans without coverage, and Mr.Azar has offered no solutions to protect their health and financial security. In fact, he believes the paltry tax credits Republicans propose in their Affordable Care Act alternative to buy insurance are too generous--too generous. If I said that to any one of my constituents, they would laugh in my face.  Nothing in Mr.Azar's record gives me any confidence that he will change course. That is because, like former Secretary Tom Price, Mr.Azar lives in an alternative universe, where health insurers will suddenly put the well-being of patients ahead of their stock prices; that if we just scrap the Affordable Care Act, the free market will magically begin covering the sick, caring for families, and protecting our seniors.[[Page S484]]  Well, we know that is patently false. We already tried letting health insurance companies run the show, and it didn't work because, in America, healthcare doesn't ever go on sale. If it did, people would be banging down doors like Best Buy on black Friday to schedule their heart surgeries and cancer treatments.  Mr.Azar seems to forget that we need commonsense protections to ensure Americans with preexisting conditions have access to coverage; that before the Affordable Care Act, health insurance companies routinely denied coverage for cancer survivors and people with chronic challenges like MS; that children with preexisting conditions like asthma or heart murmurs were blacklisted by insurers for life; that thousands of people were bankrupted by medical bills each and every year, and women were charged higher premiums for the same exact insurance policies as men.  Mr.Azar seems to forget that before programs like Medicare and Medicaid, seniors who worked hard their entire lives languished without care and lived in abject poverty. Do we really want to see seniors backsliding into poverty in 2018?  Now, I know Mr.Azar is a very wealthy man--it almost seems to be a prerequisite in order to serve in the Trump Cabinet--but I encourage him to try to imagine what it is like to work a low-wage job that doesn't provide healthcare benefits and what it is like for parents in New Jersey to go to work every day knowing they are one illness or injury away from ruining their family's financial future.  These men and women are among the 11 million Americans who depend on the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion, including well over half a million in New Jersey alone. Yet Mr.Azar believes he has a mandate to turn programs like Medicare into vouchers that shortchange seniors. He supports turning Medicaid into a block program, which is a way of ultimately dramatically cutting the program and a fancy way of saying States should be allowed to block millions of people from getting the care they need--no matter how much money they make, what ZIP Code they come from, or what healthcare challenges they face.  The American people deserve a Secretary of Health and Human Services who is prepared not only to defend these stalwart programs but is committed to building on their success. After a year of higher costs, less coverage, and empty promises by the Trump administration, the American people want Congress to turn the page. We have the chance to do that by rejecting Mr.Azar's nomination.  It is time we demanded the administration nominate a leader who is truly devoted to helping all Americans get the care they need no matter how much money they make, what Zip Codes they come from, or what healthcare challenges they face.

937,topic-id,3630,"Mr.President, on August 25, a minority group of Rohingya militants proceeded to attack a number of Burmese police outposts in northern Rakhine State, and they inflicted injuries and killed about 12 members of the country's security forces in the process. These attacks certainly must be condemned, but they have triggered a response by the Burmese Government and military that is beyond horrific--attacks by the Burmese Government and military that have inflicted a massive humanitarian crisis in that nation.  The Burmese military, aided by mobs of local vigilantes, carried out the violence against the Rohingya people in a systematic way. These are people who have been in Burma for generations, but they have been stripped of their citizenship under Burmese law. In the attacks that followed, Doctors Without Borders estimates that well over 6,000 men, women, and children were murdered in just the first month of this ongoing assault, and that included hundreds of children--an estimated 700 children ages 5 and under.  The survivors have shared countless stories of women being raped, men murdered, children murdered in the most inhumane ways imaginable. Human Rights Watch has reported that the Burmese military and the associated vigilantes have burned 354 villages to the ground. The response of the Rohingya has been to flee the country, desperately fleeing as fast as they could the systematic violence inflicted upon them--systematic rape, systematic shooting, the murder of children. The result is that 650,000 people have fled to the adjoining country of Bangladesh, where they are now establishing refugee camps.  These camps are a big improvement from being attacked, shot, murdered, and raped inside Burma, but the camps themselves are just a jumble of split bamboo frames with plastic draped over the tops of them. You can see here in this photo that the ground has been cleared away and people have shoveled out relatively flat sections of the hillside, split bamboo into little pieces, tied them together with threads, and draped plastic over the top of them.  I wonder what will happen when the monsoons come or a severe windstorm comes. I don't think these shelters are going to hold up.  The overcrowded conditions and poor sanitation in these camps put them directly at risk for diseases like diphtheria and cholera, and these camps--full of displaced, disenfranchised, angry young men--are also recruiting grounds for violent extremist groups like This is, in the words of the United Nations, the fastest growing refugee emergency in the world. It is unacceptable, and America needs to pay attention and respond.  The flow of refugees has continued, even until now. The numbers have dropped. There aren't that many Rohingya left inside of The Governments of Burma and Bangladesh are discussing a repatriation strategy on how these individuals may be able to return to Burma, and they have a framework for a plan. Burma says that they will welcome them and let them go home. They have even said that they can return to where their villages were burned and have assistance in rebuilding their homes and community structures.  In the first step, they say that they will house them in reception camps, and they also say that they may put them into model villages. These words ``reception camps'' and ``model villages'' are words for encampments that are based on what is already in much of Rakhine, central Rakhine State, which are long-term camps that are essentially prison camps--prison camps for the  If this is not going to unfold in this manner, the world has to be engaged. Right now, of course, the Rohingya who have fled this horrific violence are[[Page S490]]not anxious to return immediately because they don't believe the government will protect them. If you had been subjected to a horrific rampage of slaughter and violence, why would you immediately go back to that unless the circumstances were dramatically modified? Can they depend upon the Burmese Government to protect them when they haven't protected them since August? Can they depend upon the Burmese military to protect them when the Burmese military perpetrated these crimes?  Repatriation is important. The ability to go back to the villages and rebuild them is important, and time is of the essence for it to happen in a way that is really going to work. The international community is going to have to be involved.  Let's understand that this assault, which went from August even until now, is not a one-time occurrence. It is the latest in a long line of atrocious assaults on the Rohingya people. In 1978, Burma's military launched Operation King Dragon, causing more than 200,000 Rohingya to flee to There were similar campaigns of assault in 1992 and in 2012 and in 2015 and in 2016, none as horrific as what was witnessed just a few months ago, in August of 2017, but terrible assaults nonetheless.  Time and again, the Rohingya people have been subjected to abuse, persecution, and violence, and recognize this isn't just a tactic that the Burmese Government and Burmese military have used against the They have used it against other minorities--this systematic strategy of burning the village, shooting people as they flee, and raping the mothers and daughters. We have seen this with assaults on ethnic minorities in the Shan and Kachin States, where people have faced very similar persecution. In fact, in those States, over 100,000 people have been displaced by the military since 2011. So the United States and the world must not only stand up and say that this ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya is wrong, but also say that this strategy being used by the Burmese military against minorities is absolutely unacceptable under any code of moral conduct, under any religious vision, under any civilized understanding of the treatment of citizens.  Much of what took place over the last few decades was out of sight of the world because Burma was closed off to the world. But then Burma went through a diplomatic awakening, the budding of democratic institutions, and they have been more open to the world, so now we can see very vividly what is going on. They are not hidden, and there is no excuse for the world to turn away and not engage.  Neither the Burmese Government nor the military is ready for international cooperation. They have left the international community out of the process of trying to address these issues. They have rejected the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees--no international monitoring allowed and freedom of the press curtailed.  The Rohingya people are right to be wary of how they will be repatriated without significant international involvement, without strongly developed measures for their safety, without a changed attitude by the government.  That is why, yesterday in the Senate, I introduced a resolution calling for international pressure and oversight to be brought to bear on the repatriation process. It calls upon the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to play a central role in ensuring that any repatriation of the Rohingya people is safe, voluntary, and dignified.  The concern for the treatment of the Rohingya is bipartisan. I appreciate the 14 Senators who have already cosponsored my resolution. Particular thanks go to Senator John McCain and to Senator Todd Young not only for supporting this resolution but also for being advocates for the Rohingya people and for global human rights.  I was profoundly shocked when the Burmese military started these massive assaults back in I knew it was important for our government to pay attention, for the people of the United States to pay attention, and for Members of this Senate to pay attention and to weigh in and try to create pressure to end the persecution and create a different path for the future.  In the month that followed, there was a lot of international outcry about how wrong this was, and First State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, who is Burma's head of state, responded with a speech to the world through the United She invited the world ``to go with us into the troubled areas. . . . See for yourself what is happening and think for yourself: what can we do to remove these problems?''  I applauded that attitude and that invitation to the world to be engaged and be involved and see what was happening. Senator Durbin and I, along with three Members of the House--Congresswoman Betty McCollum from Minnesota, Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky from Illinois, and Congressman David Cicilline from Rhode Island--came together and accepted her invitation. We accepted her offer, and we planned a trip for November to go see the troubled areas in Burma, just as Aung San Suu Kyi had suggested.  We intended to go to the afflicted areas. We intended to see for ourselves what was happening. We intended to talk to those left behind to get as full a story as possible. And we intended, as she indicated, to think of what we can do to reverse the situation.  The Burmese Government worked with us to plan this trip. It involved a tremendous amount of logistics on how we could get to northern Rakhine But at the very last moment, just as we were getting ready to leave Washington, DC, the government reversed course. The Government of Burma said: We invited you, but now we will block you from visiting these afflicted areas.  Clearly, the Burmese Government and military had a lot to hide. Their invitation to the world from the Nobel laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi, turned out not to be sincere. She did not stand behind her invitation. She did not ensure that the world could come and see what was going on.  We were not allowed to visit the villages that had been burned. We were not allowed to visit camps from the previous repatriation of individuals, called internally displaced persons camps, or IDP camps.  We were allowed to fly into the capital of Rakhine State, In the capital of Sittwe, there was something there that I didn't expect at all. In the capital, there is a section of the city that is referred to as the Muslim quarter, the Muslim neighborhood. It is called Aung We were told we could go visit the Muslim quarter, Aung Mingalar, and so we did. This is a street in Aung At the end of the street, you have a police station, and you have a fence. In fact, every route out of this neighborhood is blocked by police.  The people who live there are not currently trapped by high walls and extensive barbed wire, but it is illegal for them to leave this neighborhood--think of the early stages of the Warsaw ghetto in I had no idea this existed, and it is an indication of the situation the Rohingya live in, not just in this quarter, but there are 120,000 of them in camps that have been set up where they are not allowed to operate as a normal individual, in a normal economy, in a normal village. This neighborhood is functionally sealed off from the rest of the city. They cannot leave and go a short distance away to open their shops, so they have no means to support themselves. They are trapped in a neighborhood cage with the barriers, police station, and consequences if they leave without permission.  If they have a medical emergency, then what they have to do is get permission to leave to travel to an IDP camp--internally displaced persons camp--see a doctor at the IDP camp, get a referral to the hospital, return back to their neighborhood, and then go to the hospital that is just 5 minutes away. So it is a trip of many hours in order to go to the healthcare facility that is just minutes away. Can you imagine what that is like in a health emergency? Why? It is just a direct affliction on these Muslim residents in this Buddhist nation.  They are dependent to survive on relatives who have found a path to other countries who can send money back to them so they can purchase goods, and they are also dependent upon the government. The government provides teachers for the higher high school-level classrooms, and those teachers disappeared after the August assaults and haven't returned. The children of this neighborhood are not allowed to go to the universities. So this may not[[Page S491]]look so horrific unless you know the facts; that it is a zone that is essentially a prison inside the capital city for the Muslim residents.  In order to learn more, our delegation traveled to Bangladesh to the refugee camps. We went to a camp called Balukhali, and that visit brought home the breadth and horror of the human rights crisis that these men, women, and children have endured. Speak to any member of the delegation, and they will tell you that articles and reports written about what has happened are not the same as hearing firsthand and face-to-face the stories of the atrocities the Rohingya refugees have suffered. At Balukhali, Senator Durbin and I went into a temporary classroom with tarp over the top where women had gathered to learn about sanitation and disease prevention, and I asked the interpreter who was with us: Would you ask these women if they have stories they would like to share? I wasn't sure these Muslim women, covered in traditional Muslim clothing, would be willing to share a story with an outsider, but they immediately responded. One woman jumped up, and she pulled the cloth off her arm to show the scars from the burns she had as her village hut came down around her as she tried to escape. Then other women jumped up to tell other stories--of a child being killed in front of her, of a husband being slaughtered, of the trials and tribulations of trying to escape the assault from the military. Every person in that room had tragic and horrifying stories to share--entire villages burned to the ground, entire villages fleeing for the border, being shot at by solders as they tried to cross the border into They themselves did not share stories about the rapes, but they shared those stories with the doctors and others who shared the stories with us.  As you walk around the camp, you see a lot of young kids, a lot of children. Some are helping out with their families. Some are orphans. Some are kicking balls around. I watched one young man run with a little sheet of plastic that he had put split bamboo on to create a little tiny kite, and they could get that thing about 10 feet in the air. He had a smile on his face, and you could almost envision these were regular children growing up like others around the world.  Then I went and visited with a group of the children who were doing drawings, and when you saw their drawings, you realized what they had been through. Here I am talking to a young boy who is showing me his drawing of a helicopter and a military vehicle coming into the village. Here is one of the drawings that was held up. You see the helicopter shooting at the village and the drawing of the machineguns. The village house is under assault. Here is another child's drawings, and again there are helicopters. You see the houses built on stilts. Here is a military man on the ground shooting at them as they are playing. These children have been through horrific, horrific trauma. Their families have been fractured, they may not have a mother or father, and somehow they are going forward in life.  I would like to say that the situation has improved since our trip, but the situation is still extremely bad. Take a look at this map from Human Rights These red dots are villages that have been burned--all of these, these two lines of villages. At last count, 354 villages burned, and it wasn't just in August and September but the burning continued. The Human Rights Watch said in October and November, another 40 villages were burned. In fact, one was burning on November 25 right after our delegation returned to the United States of  Is it any wonder the Burmese Government didn't want us going in to see any of these sites firsthand? We are not the only ones who were denied access. All of the U.organizations, including a factfinding mission and an investigator named Yanghee Lee, were stopped from visiting these afflicted areas. International aid groups like the Red Cross were denied access.  A mass grave containing the bodies of a group of Muslims was uncovered in Rakhine State's Inn Din village just north of Sittwe, the capital where we were. In a rather shocking first, the Burmese military actually accepted responsibility for the deaths, claiming that soldiers and villagers reacted to provocation from terrorists and that those who were involved would be punished. Do you think they are really going to be punished? I will tell you who gets punished. It is reporters, and these are the two reporters who reported it. Where are they? They are in prison--Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, two reporters for Shouldn't the United States and the international community demand that they be set free and demand those who perpetrated these crimes against humanity be the ones in prison? These two young men have been charged with violating the country's Official Secrets Act and are facing 14 years in prison for ``illegally'' acquiring information and sharing it with foreign media. It sounds to me like these two reporters were doing exactly what Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel laureate, said: Come and see.  There is a continuing cycle of violence and radicalization. Burma justifies their actions as a response to attacks by ARSA, but let's recognize a very small group of attacks occurred, and then the response was hundreds of thousands of people had their villages burned to the ground and were driven out of the country.  Well, there is going to be perpetuation of a cycle of violence unless the mindset of the Government of Burma changes dramatically. Right now, we need to be engaged in the possibility of repatriation because it is urgent that these refugees get a chance to return to their villages and rebuild them, but it will not happen unless we insist on deep involvement by the United  Reflecting on the Rwandan genocide 4 years afterward, President Clinton said:       We owe to those who died and to those who survived who      loved them, our every effort to increase our vigilance and      strengthen our stand against those who would commit such      atrocities in the future here or elsewhere.       Indeed, we owe it to all the peoples of the world who are      at risk because each bloodletting hastens the next as the      value of human life is degraded and violence becomes      tolerated, the unimaginable becomes more conceivable.  For the thousands of Rohingya slaughtered and the hundreds of thousands more who survived and fled, the unimaginable has become all too conceivable. Five months after these atrocities began, 5 months tomorrow, in fact, the world has not heard from our President about this horrific ethnic cleansing.  I encourage President Trump to weigh in on this, to speak with moral clarity, to condemn the Burmese Government for executing this horrific case of ethnic cleansing, to praise and support Bangladesh for opening its doors, to call on the world to provide Bangladesh with international resources to help address the plight of the refugees, to demand the safe and internationally monitored opportunity for the Rohingya refugees to return to their villages, rebuild their homes, and rebuild their lives.  We in the Senate must not be silenced. Thank you, again, to my 14 colleagues who have already signed on to this resolution. Our repatriation resolution calls on Nobel laureate and head of state Aung San Suu Kyi and Burma's other civilian leaders and military leaders to recognize that longstanding prejudices haunt Burma and commit to implementing all the recommendations of Kofi Annan's Advisory Commission on Rakhine State, which seeks to end the discrimination against the Rohingya and reduce the tension with other minorities.  The Burmese Government could begin doing so immediately by lifting restrictions on the IDP camps and the Aung Mingalar, while planning to shut down the IDP camps entirely and restoring the opportunity for full participation in society.  We call upon Burma to work with Bangladesh and the U.High Commissioner for Refugees to ensure the voluntary and safe repatriation of refugees. Safety must be assured for these refugees. There must be no forcible repatriation. It must be voluntary, it must be safe, and it must be monitored by an international organization. We can make sure they get assistance in returning to rebuild their homes and their lives.  We must call on Burma and Aung San Suu Kyi to embrace transparency, to grant humanitarian aid groups access, to release the two journalists in prison for doing their jobs. Finally, we[[Page S492]]must call on the international community to invest in the future of the Rohingya people. Everyone has a part to play in the economic development of the Rakhine State--the poorest state in Burma--for the benefit of all.  In closing, anyone who looks at the events that have occurred since last August can plainly see the massive scale of human catastrophe. Let it not continue. The world that cried out ``never again'' so passionately decades ago, that rallied against the war crimes of Kosovo, that condemned the Rwandan genocide has an obligation to stand up once again--this time in Burma--for the universal right of every human to live in peace, free from fear and free from persecution.

65,topic-id,686,"Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to join so many of my colleagues to speak in support of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection I thank Senator Graham for his continued leadership on this issue. I supported this bill when Senator Graham introduced it last Congress, and I am pleased Leader McConnell has brought this to a vote.  Regulating abortion after 20 weeks of conception--when a child can feel pain--is a prudent measure that reflects the basic decency of our humanity and brings us in line with most of the Western world.  Science demonstrates that human life begins at conception, and our understanding of neonatal development is increasing by the day.  As a member of the Labor-HHS subcommittee on Appropriations, I have championed funding for the National Institute of At the NIH, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development has advanced our knowledge of pregnancy and development in the womb. Under this institute, the Neonatal Research Network has pioneered research that has led to techniques that save the lives of children in their earliest stages, when these children are at their most vulnerable.  Such research tells us children who are 20 weeks old--those this bill will protect--experience what a newborn will: reacting to noise, sucking their thumbs, and, as this bill's title indicates, feeling pain. The research has led to advancements in medical care for premature babies, and 23 percent of those delivered 20 weeks after fertilization can now survive long term outside of the womb. This percentage will surely increase as advances in neonatal care continue.  Despite what we know, the United States is one of only seven countries in the world, among nations such as China and Vietnam, that permits elective abortion after 20 weeks. As a result, the Congressional Budget Office estimates more than 10,000 babies are aborted each year after 20 weeks of conception.  What we can't lose sight of as a society is that, when we are talking about abortion, we are talking about the end of the most defenseless of human lives. This is true at all stages of pregnancy, regardless of whether it is early in the pregnancy or in the late stages, when children are more developed and more capable of surviving outside of the womb.  So often we turn to scientific evidence and research to support the need for new policies. In this case, the research shows that these children have a chance to survive, a chance to grow. They can feel; they can move. We cannot ignore these reactions and feelings, which are indicative of human life and with them comes the need for legal protections--protections we would not hesitate to provide for those living outside the womb.  Indeed, we have laws that treat animals more humanely than unborn children. This vote gives the Senate an opportunity to send a message showing who we are as leaders and as a society as a whole, one that protects the weak and the voiceless, instead of one that permits their destruction.  One in five children who are born at this 20-week stage are capable of surviving with suitable care. Rather than be discarded, they are to be given every opportunity to fight for the life that we protect for them. It is what we instinctively do as parents and as human beings.  We recoil when we hear of children who are harmed in any manner; yet the ability to terminate an unborn child's life when it is viable outside of the womb is something that is not only tolerated, but passionately defended. If there was anything else claiming the lives of 10,000 children each year, all 100 of us in the Senate would be standing up demanding action to address the matter.  The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act is a sensible measure that protects the lives of women and children in accord with judicial rulings. It has been passed by the House of Representatives, it has the support of a majority of Americans--men and women alike--and I call on my colleagues to support passage of this life-affirming legislation.

In the coming days, Mary Kay Thatcher will be retiring from the American Farm Bureau, where she is widely recognized as one of the most knowledgeable experts on farm policy, conservation, crop insurance, ag data, and so many other issues that affect farmers and ranchers and rural Mary Kay represents the best of Washington, She is smart, passionate, and authentic. Again, we often need help from those who have expertise to help us make the right decisions, and she is absolutely one of those people.  A great thing about Mary Kay Thatcher is that she hasn't forgotten her rural roots. It is evidenced by her clear convictions and steadfast support for American farmers and ranchers. Too many people come to the beltway and they forget why they are here--but not Mary Throughout her career of more than 30 years, she has never lost sight of what ought to be the mission of each of ours--to use our positions, our talents, and our abilities to help others. For Mary Kay Thatcher, her career has been all about helping America's farmers and ranchers, standing up for the food and fiber producers of our Let me tell you that she is one of the best at it.  Not only is Mary Kay one of the most articulate ag lobbyists I know, she is one of the most articulate people I know. Her ability to break down an issue and make it understandable for everyone--for Senators and our staffs, including those who don't have ag backgrounds--makes her one of the most effective advocates for agriculture. There are fewer and fewer people in the U.Senate and Congress who understand agriculture or who come from farming backgrounds, and that ability to connect with them is so important.  I have always appreciated the advice and counsel that Mary Kay has provided me when working on the farm bill or other pieces of ag legislation. I have also always noticed and appreciated how much time she has spent in educating staff, including those in my office. I believe a big part of Mary Kay's legacy will be the generations of young people who will be better prepared to continue the fight for American agriculture because Mary Kay has taken the time and made the effort to mentor and to teach them.  Her passion for agriculture comes naturally. She grew up on an Iowa farm and continues to own and manage that farm today, and that helps guide her work here in the Nation's She has worked at the American Farm Bureau for over 30 years, but in ag circles, it is not necessarily the number of years that people talk about but the number of farm bills. They refer to how many farm bills a person has survived. By my count, Mary Kay has been part of writing at least seven farm bills in addition to many other key pieces of ag legislation.  I know I am adding my voice to lots of others who will talk about how great of a person she is and what an advocate she is, but I do want to add my accolades because they are so well-deserved.  I thank Mary Kay Thatcher for all of her work on behalf of American agriculture, including the Kansas Farm Bureau and its members, and on behalf of all of agriculture in our Her efforts have benefited Kansas and improved our country. She will be missed at the American Farm Bureau, but I know she will find other ways to advocate for agriculture.

278,topic-id,799,"Mr.President, I wish to pay tribute to my friend, Shawn Earlier this month, Shawn was stolen from this world at the tender age of 40, after being diagnosed with colon cancer in early What Shawn Brimley accomplished in 40 years was simply breathtaking, and the story of the life he lived, brimming with passion for his family, his friends, his vocation, and his country, is one that this U.Senate should hear.  Shawn was eulogized correctly as one of the leading American national security intellectuals, but he didn't start off as an He was born outside of Toronto, Canada, and served for 5 years in the Canadian Army before attending Queen's University in After college, he traveled to Tokyo to teach English, and there met the love of his life, Marjorie They relocated to Washington, where Shawn quickly became one of the founding members of the Center for New American Security, CNAS, a defense and foreign policy think tank that gave rise to many of the top security staffers of the Obama administration.  At CNAS, and then during two stints in the Obama administration, first as a special adviser at the Pentagon and then as director of strategic planning at the National Security Council, Shawn helped develop the Pentagon's ``third-offset strategy,'' which foresaw a future military conflict with Russia or China that would heavily depend on technology and robotics. Shawn's out-of-the-box focus on the future of military conflicts pushed our national security leadership to innovate and adapt. America is safer for his contributions. Shawn's enthusiasm for this work was driven by a sense that America could be a true force for good and order in the world. His boss at the White House, Derek Chollet, said: ``Maybe because he was an immigrant, he really believed in the power of American leadership and America's unique role in the world. There was that idealism about him.''  Both in the Obama administration and at CNAS, Shawn was renowned for his mentorship of younger national security professionals. The day after his passing, staffers who had worked under Shawn remarked on social media how Shawn often went out of his way to befriend and guide newer entrants to the field. So many young national security professionals in Washington attended his funeral, a testament to the reach of his influence and generosity during his short 20 years in the field.  But as his wife remarked during her beautiful eulogy, Shawn knew that ``work was work.'' Home, for Shawn, was his center of gravity. This is the setting in which I came to know Shawn over the past few years. Our home in Washington is just a few blocks from the Brimleys in northwest Our children are schoolmates, and I got to see up close over the past several years how utterly devoted Shawn was to his family and friends. My son regularly reports that his oldest daughter is the nicest, most generous student in his class. His sons are spirited, precocious, and kind-hearted. They were, and are, their father's children.  His generosity extended to his friends. Every weekend, I return to Connecticut, and one night, when I was away, the basement of our Washington house flooded. My wife sent out a text to our neighbors asking for advice, and literally, within minutes, Shawn was knocking on our door. Having dealt with a similar problem at their house, Shawn, constantly the oversharer, was eager to dispense all the knowledge he had gained regarding flood remediation. After an exhaustive consultation, he went home and looked up every part and device he recommended my wife buy and sent her a comprehensive email with the links to the websites where she could get the best deal. I imagine most of Shawn's other friends have similar stories. To his coworkers, his family, and his friends, Shawn was a superman.  In preparing for his 40th birthday, Shawn decided to get in shape. He became a fanatical crossfit enthusiast and, upon his diagnosis, was in arguably the best condition of his life. It is[[Page S440]]part of the reason why his death is so unfathomable. A young man who had done everything right--built an amazing family, gave so much to his country, kept himself physically strong--was stolen from us, in an instant. It gives us all cause to take stock of our own lives, knowing that our time on this Earth can be so cruelly fleeting.  What I know about Shawn Brimley is that he lived 80 years of life in half the time. He didn't want to leave this Earth, but as he told his friends in an email sent just days before he passed, he wouldn't have changed a single thing about his life if he could. That is a standard by which we would all be wise to measure ourselves.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-22-pt1-PgS439-4.txt,1837,CLOTURE MOTION,2018.0,22.0,January

677,topic-id,420,"Mr.President, there are a lot of Americans who don't understand what is happening right now. Republicans asked for control of the U.Senate, they asked for control of the House of Representatives, and they asked for control of the White They got all three. They promised that by doing so, they would be able to more effectively manage the affairs of state, and that is clearly not happening right now. There is a fundamental inability to govern, as we are now shut down for the second day.  Tomorrow is an important day because many of the functions that the people expect from the Federal Government will not be there on Monday morning, despite the fact that we have made some progress--first, on Friday night on this floor, and subsequent to that, in private discussions today--in order to reach an agreement that Republicans and Democrats can support.  So I am here with several of my colleagues to make some fairly simple requests of the U.It seems that if we were really adults, if we were really going to operate like grownups and we were going to be truly responsible stewards of the Federal Government, then we should be able to keep the government open for a very short period of time while we negotiate a way out of this.  As many folks know, we on the Democratic side, as well as some of our Republican colleagues, don't think it is wise to do another month-long continuing resolution, but why don't we just agree to keep the government open tomorrow? Why don't we all just get together and say that on Monday, people will be able to access the Federal Government, and we can hopefully get to an agreement on a budget that is permanent, that is long term, and that gives certainty to everybody who receives something from or gives something to the Federal Government, by the end of the day tomorrow? I think we can do that.  I am going to make a few more remarks, but before I do, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar 36, H.1301; that the amendment at the desk that would provide for a continuing resolution to fund the government through Monday, January 22, 2018, be considered and agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.

680,topic-id,196,"Mr.President, let me make a few remarks. I am sorry that the Senator decided to object to this unanimous consent request which would simply keep the government open and operating for 24 hours so we can try to come to an agreement.  Let me address the central point the Senator just made because I have heard it repeated by many Members of the Republican leadership and other Members of the Republican Senate conference.  This idea that there is no controversy because Democrats agree to everything that is in the underlying continuing resolution is not true. It is not true. We have now passed three different continuing resolutions to just kick the can forward time and time again.  As we were considering this continuing resolution on Friday night, the Department of Defense made an unprecedented decision to contradict the views of the Commander in Chief by stating that they didn't want another continuing resolution because without real, long-term certainty for Department of Defense funding, we, the Members of the U.Congress, are putting our national security at risk.  So the Democrats do not agree with everything in the underlying continuing resolution because we don't think that it is----  ",CREC-2018-01-21-pt1-PgS397-3.txt,1837,FEDERAL REGISTER PRINTING SAVINGS ACT OF 2017,2018.0,21.0,January
681,topic-id,430,"We don't believe that it is right for this government to continue to kick the can down the road.  I will just say personally that there are other things in that continuing resolution that I object to as well. It is not just a straightforward continuing resolution. It includes the repeal of revenue that comes into the Federal Government to pay for the Affordable Care So it is not a straightforward continuing resolution. There are other parts of that bill. One of them is a further attempt by the Republican majority to gut the Affordable Care Act and the money that is used to pay for it. There are other provisions in that bill--intelligence provisions, counterterrorism provisions--that many Members of the Senate have objections to as well. So it is simply not true to say that there is unanimous agreement about all of the provisions of the continuing resolution.[[Page S422]]  Further, this idea that no negotiation happens between the Republicans and Democrats and that Democrats are expected to vote for a large, expensive piece of legislation with no input makes no sense either. I understand you have to get 60 votes in order to pass it, but how the Senate works is that in order to get to 60 votes, there has to be a discussion between Republicans and If I walked into a restaurant and the waiter brought me a meal that I didn't order and then told me that I had an obligation to pay for it, I might raise some objections because that is not how restaurants work. That is also not how the Senate works. The Republicans can't unilaterally write a piece of legislation and tell Democrats that they have to support it, especially when there are provisions in it that many of us do not support.  I am sorry that we can't come to a simple agreement to keep this government open on Monday so that we have the time and the space to put the pieces of a long-term agreement together, which I think is easier than many people think, while our constituents still have access to the services of this government.  I am sorry that we can't agree to this unanimous consent request. I hope we continue to work through the night and all through tomorrow to make sure we have a long-term budget agreement that makes sure that kids get their healthcare, that the community health centers stay open, and that the military gets the funding they need.

708,topic-id,636,"Mr.President, I appreciate the Senator from North Carolina offering apologies on behalf of other Members of this body, so let me return the favor.  Let me offer an apology on behalf of the Republican majority for the governance disaster that has occurred in the U.Congress over the last year.  Why are we here today? We are here today because last year Republicans spent all of their time and energy trying to steal health insurance from 30 million Americans, trying to rescind protections for people with preexisting conditions. They spent the first half of the year trying to take insurance away from 30 million people. They were not successful because the American people rose up and told this Congress that was a terrible idea.  They spent the second half of the year trying to push through--successfully this time--a massive tax cut for the wealthy; 80 percent of that tax cut going to the richest 1 percent of Americans, equally as unpopular as the healthcare repeal. That one was successful.  Meanwhile, during 2017, three disasters hit the United States--in Texas,[[Page S426]]Florida, and Puerto Rico--and the Republican Congress forgot to pass the assistance package that is normally automatic after a disaster hits. Meanwhile, Republicans let the Children's Health Insurance Program expire, and millions of frightened parents got notifications that their toddlers' healthcare would cease to exist. Meanwhile, health centers in this country, which provide some of the most important care to the indigent, had their funding expire and all of a sudden had to make budget plans for 2018 with half as much money as they thought they were going to get. Meanwhile, Republicans didn't pass a budget, forgot to pass a single appropriations bill, and CRs after CRs were required.  I am sorry, on behalf of my Republican friends, that they didn't do their job in 2017. I am sorry that the American people gave control of the House and the Senate and Presidency to the Republican Party and they didn't pass a budget. They didn't pass disaster assistance. They didn't reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance They didn't provide assistance to health centers.  We are trying to be the adults here and say that it is time to do our job. It is time to get assistance to these disaster areas. It is time to pass children's healthcare reauthorization for the long term and get the money the health centers need to keep their doors open. The Department of Defense needs a budget, not just for 4 months but for a full year.  We are not asking for much. We are just asking for Congress to do its job. At some point, somebody has to be the grownup. Somebody has to be the adult. We are saying: Let's keep the government open for 1 day, 3 days, as long as it takes for us to do our job. But to pass another monthlong continuing resolution with no hope in sight for the Department of Defense, which needs its money, the disaster areas, the kids, the health centers--that is not what we got elected to do.  This has been a governance disaster over the last year. This place has not been doing its job. We ought to start right now. I love the suggestion of staying all night. The Senator from North Carolina is right--we are not going to get an agreement on all of these complicated issues this evening, but, boy, we can try. Had we made the decision to at least keep the government open and operating for 1 day or 3 days, the pain at least would not be felt by the Americans who depend on these services, because of the governance disaster that has been visited upon this place over the past year.

936,topic-id,1289,"Mr.President, I come to the floor to express my opposition to the nomination of Alex Azar to be the next Secretary of the Department of Health and Human  Let me admit to the Chamber that this, for me, was certainly not as easy a call as was the first vote on the nomination for this position when Congressman Price was up for the job. I want to talk about the reasons for my vote in opposition, but I first want to begin by giving the nominee some credit for, I think, a very important series of exchanges that he had before the committee.  One of the biggest potential disasters that would have been visited upon this country by 4 years of Secretary Price would have been the reversal of 8 years of transformation in the way that we pay for healthcare through Medicare, primarily.  In 2011, Medicare made almost no payments to providers through what we call alternative payment models. I know this sounds a little weedy, but this is really the way that we drive down healthcare costs in this country, and it is something that Republicans and Democrats should be focused on together.  Alternative payment models generally refer to a switch in the way that we pay for healthcare--a move away from reimbursing providers based on how much medicine they practice to a reimbursement system that rewards providers for the outcomes that they achieve--in fact, rewarding hospitals and doctors and clinicians when they keep their patients out of the doctor's office or out of the emergency room or out of the hospital. This is the exact opposite of what the existing system does, which rewards hospital systems and doctors the more that their patients show up in the emergency rooms and the doctors' offices and in the hospitals.  In the House of Representatives, Tom Price was the leader of the opposition to what we call value-based payment and was the chief defender of fee-for-service payment. While the Obama administration had made remarkable progress--it had set a goal of moving 30 percent of all Medicare payments over to outcome-based payments, which they achieved by the end of 2016--Secretary Price was in the process of moving all of that backward.  The reason I say that my vote here against Mr.Azar was not a slam dunk--it is not a slam dunk--is that I give him credit for his testimony on this question of alternative payments. In answer to a question posed by Senator Whitehouse, he said that one of the greatest legacies of Secretary Burwell's tenure was in the launching of so many of the alternative payment models that we have out there.  I would like to keep driving that forward for all of us who care so deeply about reducing costs in our healthcare system, about integration and coordination, and in our just thinking about ways to deliver better for our patients and beneficiaries. There are so many opportunities for bipartisanship here because we share so many of the same goals on this.[[Page S489]]  I applaud Mr.Azar for his seriousness about working with Democrats and Republicans to try to shift our payment system over to something that makes more sense, for his openness about how important the Obama-era reforms were, and for his decision, if he gets this job, to reverse some of the sabotaging of those alternative payment models that Secretary Price began.  Unfortunately, my enthusiasm for Mr.Azar's statements on alternative payment models through Medicare are outweighed by his inability to convince the HELP Committee or the Finance Committee that he is going to be a responsible steward of the Affordable Care This is from where much of my worry comes, in part because Connecticut is a State that has efficiently, ably, and responsibly implemented the Affordable Care We have hundreds of thousands of people in our State who now have insurance because of the expansion of Medicaid and because of the successful offering of plans to the uninsured through Connecticut's exchange.  It was perplexing to those of us on the HELP Committee that Mr.Azar seemed to defend the administration's decisions to sabotage and undermine the Affordable Care He even went so far as to try to spin those changes as to be a strengthening of the law, which simply does not pass the straight face test. I get it. During a confirmation hearing, it is very hard for a nominee who may serve in the Cabinet to be critical of the Commander in Chief, the person who has chosen him for the job. Yet it is obvious for everybody to see what is happening by the canceling of payments to insurance companies that helped compensate them for the most expensive patients, by eliminating all of the funding for the marketing and advertising of the exchanges, by shortening the enrollment period in half, by constantly going on social media and telling all prospective enrollees of ObamaCare that the ACA is dead even though it is not dead--even though, as we found out, just as many people signed up this year as signed up last year despite the campaign to undermine it.  We all know that this is an obvious campaign of sabotage--that President Trump is trying to kill the Affordable Care Act administratively because he can't convince the American public to press Congress to do away with it. The Affordable Care Act has the support of the American public today, and that is the reason Congress could not repeal it.  It was very troubling to me that Mr.Azar didn't acknowledge this campaign of sabotage, which leads me to believe he is going to fulfill instructions from the administration, from the White House, to continue it. He went so far during the questioning with me to suggest that shortening the enrollment period actually would help consumers with something that the insurance companies were asking for. That is not true. The insurance companies were not asking for that in That does not help consumers, certainly, when you are also withdrawing all of the money for marketing and advertising that would have been used to tell people that the enrollment period was being shortened.  At the same time that I am going to vote no on this nomination because I am deeply worried that as Secretary Mr.Azar is going to continue this campaign of ACA sabotage, I do look forward to working with him in a bipartisan way on payment reform--if he will allow it with those of us who will vote against his nomination.  As much time as we spend in the Senate talking about coverage, frankly, the more important, long-term reform is in the changing of how we pay for healthcare because if we fundamentally change the way we pay for healthcare and start rewarding good outcomes rather than just rewarding more medicine being practiced, then we will save enough money to insure everybody in this country through a means that both the Republicans and Democrats can support.  I am going to vote no. I encourage my colleagues who care about the effective administration of the Affordable Care Act to vote no. Remember, it is a remarkable success story that 20 million people have insurance. People know the strength of the Affordable Care That is why they pressed Congress not to repeal it. Despite the undermining campaign, just as many people signed up this year as last year, which is, frankly, extraordinary. I would hope that those people here who believe in the Affordable Care Act, as the American people do, will oppose this nomination. At the same time, I hope that there are significant ways, if he is confirmed, that we can work together with Secretary  I yield the floor.

54,topic-id,830,"Mr.President, today in communities across our country, young people are asking whether they will be able to stay in the only country they have ever called home. Struggling patients and veterans are wondering whether their local community health center will be able to stay open and provide the care that they can't otherwise afford. Workers and business owners are wondering--again--whether the government will even be open in a week or two.  Instead of addressing the serious and pressing challenges that people are facing, Republican leaders today are debating whether to trust women to make their own healthcare choices. That is right. While this country is waiting for us to come together and solve problems, Republicans are wasting precious time with a politically motivated, partisan bill that is engineered to drive us apart and hurt women.  I have come here today to oppose, in the strongest terms, the extreme, ideological abortion ban that Republican leaders have brought to the floor today. It goes against the Constitution, against medical experts, and against the rights of women across the country. However, I don't merely oppose this partisan bill. I oppose the very fact Republicans are once again bringing this bill--which they know is a nonstarter--to the floor.  I oppose the very idea that in the 21st century, we are going to waste time on a question that has already been answered and shouldn't even be up for debate. I oppose the fact that we are still voting on whether women and doctors are best equipped to make healthcare decisions--or politicians here in Washington, We are still voting on whether we should criminalize doctors for making sound medical decisions. We are still voting on whether we should turn back the clock and put women's lives at risk.  Roe v. Wade was decided 45 years ago. We celebrated the anniversary of that historic decision last week. I would like to think that after almost half a century, we could move on from debating this settled issue. Yet here we are.  In 2015, the Republican leaders stated quite flatly that a vote to defund Planned Parenthood would be an exercise in futility because there was no way it was going to pass. The same is true of this extreme, harmful legislation. Yet here we are.  Bringing this bill to the floor is an exercise in futility, and passing it would be an exercise in cruelty. Just look at the story from a Washington State mother, Judy A few years ago, she wrote an op-ed in the New York Times, and she courageously shared a story that is every expecting woman's worst nightmare. Judy shared her experience of learning that one of the twins she was carrying had a lung condition. One lung chamber had not formed at all, and the other was only 20 percent complete. She wrote:       My world stopped. I loved being pregnant with twins. . . .      The thought of losing one child was unbearable.  She went on to say:       The MRI at Seattle Children's Hospital confirmed our fears:      the organs were pushed up into our boy's chest and not      developing properly. We were in the 22nd week.  I am grateful her doctors were able to give her sound medical advice. I am grateful that she and her husband were able to make the decision they felt was best for their own family. And I am so grateful to Judy for sharing her story, which represents the incredibly painful decision she and so many other women have faced.  My colleagues might recognize that story. I have shared it before, just as Republicans have introduced this deeply harmful legislation before. I hope this time the Republicans listen. I hope they will stop trying to pretend they are in any way qualified to interfere with decisions that a woman has the[[Page S533]]constitutional right to make on her own. I hope they will stop trying to criminalize a doctor's ability to provide sound medical advice and protect the lives of patients. I hope they will stop wasting our time with bills that are so out of date, extremely out of touch, and obviously unconstitutional.  But if Republicans will not stop this exercise in futility and their attacks on women's rights, they should know that I will not stop standing up and making clear exactly why they are wrong. They should know I am going to keep fighting for Judy and so many other women and their families, and I will keep urging them to work with Democrats on the serious challenges that face our Nation--none of which, by the way, have to do with trusting women or controlling their healthcare choices.  I do want to thank the many Democrats who will be joining me here on the floor to stand up for women and deliver this same message to our Republican colleagues. Again, I hope they listen because Democrats would like to get to work.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.

665,topic-id,1240,"Mr.President, it was just 1 year ago that President Trump was sworn into office, promising the American people he would break through the gridlock to get results for workers and families; that he would work with Democrats and Republicans; that he would be this great dealmaker--``the best,'' he said.  This past year has proven quite the opposite, and nothing has made that clearer than what we have seen these past few days. This has been a year of chaos and dysfunction, of bullying and attacks, of hatred and division and controversy and crises. That is just what we have been seeing on the President's Twitter feed before breakfast.  On the heels of so much utter dysfunction and disarray coming from this Republican government, it is fitting, even while deeply disappointing, that President Trump's first year has ended with him pushing our country into a completely unnecessary government shutdown. There is no reason--absolutely no reason at all--why we should be in this position. Democrats have spent months--months--trying to get the President and Republican leaders to work with us. We have spent months pushing Republicans to work with us to pass a long-term extension of the Children's Health Insurance Program that gives millions of kids access to care. We have spent months pushing Republicans to work with us to pass funding for community health center programs so many of our patients and families depend on. We have spent months pushing Republicans to work with us to pass disaster relief for our families and communities who have been hit so hard. We have spent months pushing[[Page S410]]Republicans to work with us to support our veterans and to combat opioid and substance abuse. We have spent months pushing Republicans to work with us to increase investments in education and healthcare and other domestic and defense priorities.  We have spent months, and really years, pushing Republicans to work with us to protect the hundreds of thousands of Dreamers across our country--young men and women who have known no home but America, who have spent their entire lives reciting our Pledge of Allegiance, who think of our great country as their great country, who now, through no fault of their own, are facing a prospect of being torn from their homes, from their families and their friends, and deported to a country many of them can't even remember.  Months and months have been spent trying to get Republicans to work with us. Months and months we have been urging Republicans to join us at the table. Months and months we have been trying to solve problems with solutions that had bipartisan support. Democrats and Republicans were on the same page on all of these issues. For months and months, President Trump and the Republican leaders have refused. They have sat in their partisan corner. They have ignored the Democrats and Republicans who wanted results. They have pushed us to the precipice and then right into this completely unnecessary shutdown.  I know this has been discussed on the Senate floor at length today, but it bears repeating. This shutdown is a choice made by Republicans--the party that controls the Senate, the House, and the White It is a choice made through their inaction, months and months of refusing to work with us, and it is a choice made through their actions trying to jam through a partisan bill at the last minute they knew couldn't pass, blocking our last-minute efforts to keep the government open for a few days while we negotiate an actual deal, moving the goalpost in the last-minute negotiations between President Trump and the Democratic leader from New York, and now spending their time trying to point fingers and place blame instead of facing up to their responsibilities as the governing party.  I know President Trump said this year that our country ``needs a good shutdown.'' I hope he remembers what he said in 2013 because back then President Trump said:       Problems start from the top and they have to get solved      from the top--and the President's the leader. And he's got to      get everybody in a room and he's got to lead.  He went on to say:       When they talk about the government shutdown, they're going      to be talking about the President of the United States, who      the President was at that time.  And that in a government shutdown, ``I really think the pressure is on the President.''  I don't say this often, but President Trump was absolutely right in 2013 about the Trump shutdown of 2018. President Trump is not the only one in the White House, but it is Republicans who run the Senate and they run the House, all of them. The onus is on them to get this done, and they have a Democratic Party that is ready to work with them to get this done right.  Before I close, I do want to make one final point, very much connected. This weekend is not just 1 year since President Trump's inauguration; it is also the anniversary of the women's march, when millions and millions of people across the country stood up to make it clear, wearing those bright pink hats, that they weren't going to just sit by and watch. I was at that incredible women's march in DC a year ago, and I remember thinking to myself, this is what a democracy looks like--people getting involved, getting engaged, speaking up, speaking out, fighting back, and standing strong. For those women and men at the marches this weekend and for the millions and millions more who are looking at what is happening in our country and feel so strongly that this just isn't right, Democrats agree, and we have your back.  I am going to keep fighting as hard as I can. I am going to keep making it clear, I stand ready to work with anyone from any party who is willing to stand with me to restore respect and get results. I believe there are enough Members on both sides of the aisle who are more focused on reaching out hands than pointing fingers, and we can get this done. We can reopen our government. We can address the many challenges facing the people we represent, and we can get back to doing the work the people we represent sent us here to do.  Before I close, I do want to mention one thing. A number of my colleagues have been working hard to make sure our military and their families are protected no matter what. We have a bill--the Pay Our Military Act--that would do exactly that. My friend, the Senator from Missouri, has been working so hard to get this done. I know my friend the junior Senator from Illinois has as well. So many of us believe this is the right thing to do right now, at a time when there is uncertainty. Unfortunately, the Republican leader has blocked our efforts so far. I just want to say I am really hopeful he reverses course and allows us to get this done. It is the right thing to do, and it is the least we can do for the men and women who sign up to serve our country and protect all of us.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

927,topic-id,990,"Mr.President, almost a year ago, as Republicans were jamming through the confirmation of Tom Price as Secretary of Health and Human Services, I rose to object to his nomination. I voiced my very deep concerns about whether Secretary Price would be committed to protecting healthcare for our families, committed to putting evidence and sound policy over partisanship and ideology, and whether he would be committed to addressing the many ethical questions about his investments Republicans allowed to go unanswered. Well, he was not.  Today, Secretary Price is infamous for two signature accomplishments: first of all, undermining healthcare access for millions of people; and, second, resigning in scandal and disgrace.  In the wake of Secretary Price's resignation, President Trump had another opportunity to get this right. I believe families in Washington State deserve a Health and Human Services Secretary who will finally put patients ahead of politics.  Unfortunately, after meeting with Alex Azar, hearing his testimony, and carefully reviewing his record and his qualifications, I do not believe Mr.Azar is an acceptable choice to lead the Department, and I will be voting against his confirmation.[[Page S483]]  From President Trump's first day in office, he has been focused on undermining healthcare coverage by putting up barriers to obtaining care, shortening our enrollment period, expanding loopholes for corporations, and making every effort to throw the entire system into chaos. After a year of President Trump's healthcare sabotage, there were over 3 million more people uninsured in our country. We need a voice to stand up and defend the healthcare our families rely on.  I am alarmed by Mr.Azar's statements, including cheerleading healthcare repeal efforts, predicting that the Affordable Care Act was ``circling the drain,'' even though enrollment stayed strong across the country this year, and detailing specific steps to, as he said, hasten the demise of patients' and families' healthcare.  While President Trump continues to call the opioid crisis a public health emergency, he has yet to treat it like one. So far, his administration has proposed cutting the budget for the Office of National Drug Control Policy by 95 percent. It is focused on gutting Medicaid, which provides critically needed substance use disorder treatment, and they have failed to provide any new funding or resources to support the communities that are fighting this crisis.  Local leaders in my home State of Washington and across the country need a voice at the Department of Health and Human Services committed to bringing more resources, not fewer, to address the opioid epidemic. I am alarmed by Mr.Azar's refusal to support more funding for communities that are hard hit by the opioid epidemic.  President Trump's Department has also shown a concerning pattern of undermining evidence-based policies in favor of ideology. When it comes to undermining evidence, political appointees at Health and Human Services have asked their career staff not to use the terms ``evidence-based'' and ``science-based'' because they view them as ``essentially meaningless.''  When it comes to favoring ideology, not only has the Department taken steps to restrict access to care for women and transgender patients, leaders have also sought to effectively ban words like ``transgender'' and ``diversity'' and ``vulnerable'' among their Department employees--ban the words, and they have not just cut important words, they have gutted valuable, evidence-based programs like the Teen Pregnancy Prevention  This program has provided useful insight on what works to address high teen pregnancy rates. It has been recognized by the bipartisan Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking for its rigorous approach to evaluation. Yet President Trump's administration chose to unilaterally shorten that program's grants.  We need a voice there who will reject such damaging ideology decisions and to champion evidence and science and sound policymaking. I do not believe Mr.Azar is that champion--quite the opposite, in fact.  I am alarmed Mr.Azar believes a woman's employer should be able to decide, based on ideology, whether or not her birth control should be covered. I am alarmed by his extreme and out-of-touch views on Roe v. Wade, as shown by his support for legislation and political candidates who would undermine the constitutional rights enshrined in this important decision, and his use of ideological rhetoric in discussing the rights guaranteed to women by that landmark case.  Unfortunately, Mr.Azar is the latest in a string of ideologically driven healthcare appointees from President We cannot tolerate one more nominee overseeing a woman's healthcare programs who is more focused on undermining them than on advancing them.  Finally, I am alarmed by his track record at the pharmaceutical company Eli As a nominee, Mr.Azar has said we need to fight to lower drug prices, but during his time as president of Lilly, that company tripled the price of insulin, and Mr.Azar personally approved significant price increases for dozens of the company's drugs.  As a nominee, Mr.Azar may try to assure us that he will fight for patients and protect the health of our communities, but after looking at his record, after reading his past statements, and after discussing these issues with him, I am alarmed he might not stand up for women and families, I am alarmed he might not stand up to the pharmaceutical industry, and I am alarmed he might not stand up to President Trump's agenda, driven by sabotage and ideology.  After months of Republicans putting politics ahead of funding healthcare for children, and as Republicans continue to put politics ahead of funding for community health centers like those in rural Washington State and those across the country that help to serve underserved communities, and as they continue to ignore other primary care programs that bring medical professionals to populations in need like teaching health centers in Spokane, we have to have strong leadership at the Department of Health and Human Services that will demand that we put public health first, not partisanship.

935,topic-id,1056,"Mr.President, I wish to talk about Alex Azar's nomination as Secretary of Health and Human I wish to explain how I am going to vote no by virtue of what I asked him in his hearing in front of the Finance  Needless to say, programs such as Medicaid, Medicare, the Federal marketplace for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, and the Children's Health Insurance Program are all healthcare programs that are absolutely essential not only to my State of Florida but to all Since we have a higher percentage of the population who are senior citizens, obviously, Medicare is an extremely important one to that segment of our population, who depend on Medicare for their healthcare.  When you look at the Affordable Care Act, which brought healthcare through health insurance to millions and millions of Americans who had not had it before, my State of Florida signed up more people than any other Some 1.7 million Floridians signed up[[Page S488]]for coverage through healthcare.gov. That was despite the Trump Administration's efforts this past year to undermine the health law by doing such things as not allowing people to get out and give the counseling. So it was on a much lower scale than what had been done before.  My worry is, looking out for the people of Florida, that Mr.Azar will continue to support the administration's efforts to destroy the law and all of the good things it has done, where it has now provided health insurance for so many people--so many people that never had health insurance before. The 1.7 million Floridians who signed up again for health insurance through healthcare.gov is a good example.  One of the statements that Mr.Azar has made--and people in the Trump Administration have been trying to undermine the ACA--is that, in effect, there is no way to fix the law.  Let's turn to Medicaid and CHIP, or the Children's Health Insurance Mr.Azar, I am told, supports changing the structure of the Medicaid Program into a block grant. Ever since the Medicaid law was passed, it sets up, according to whether or not a State has a poor citizenry, a formula that shares money from the Federal Government, and the State matches a certain percentage. In Florida, that is anywhere from 55 percent to 60 percent Federal to approximately 45 percent to 40 percent from the State of For other States, like Mississippi--with a poor, rural population that needs healthcare but can't afford healthcare--their Medicaid formula is much more paid for by the Federal Government with a lower match from the  If you put Medicaid into a block grant, that means the State is only going to get so much money, regardless of whether the population swells. If the needs are greater, that money is it. It is not flexible with the eligibility of people because of their income status. I simply don't think that is right. It is these kinds of issues that concern me greatly about Mr. Look at As I mentioned, we have a higher percentage of the population that is made up of senior citizens. In Florida, that translates to 4 million senior citizens who depend on They are over 65 years of age, and they are eligible for That is the way they access their healthcare.  When I asked Mr.Azar about his perspective on changes to the Medicare Program, his answer was deficient. This is what I asked: Do you support raising the Medicare eligibility age?  In other words, a senior would not be eligible for Medicare--healthcare--at age 65; the age requirement would be increased. He did not give me an answer.  I asked: Do you support turning Medicare into a voucher program?  According to CBO estimates, privatizing Medicare would increase premiums by 30 percent, so I wanted to find out whether, as Secretary of HHS, he would want to turn Medicare into a voucher program. He dodged that question.  I tried a third time with another question to give him a chance to give a straight answer on the record in the Finance I asked him whether he supports allowing Medicare providers to enter into private contracts with patients instead of the set benefit that a senior knows he is eligible for under the law to get those Medicare benefits.  The practice of entering into private contracts between doctors and other Medicare providers is prohibited under Medicare because it would place seniors on the hook for the difference between what an insurer would pay--an insurance company--and what the doctor or the other provider would charge. That would result in a higher out-of-pocket cost for the senior citizen.  Remember, the question was, do you support allowing Medicare providers to enter into private contracts with patients?  This is what he said: ``The mission of HHS is to enhance and protect the health and the well-being of all Americans, through programs that touch every single American in some way, every single day. As Secretary, my job would be to lead HHS in its work toward its mission.''  That is not what I asked. I asked specifically whether he wanted to privatize the Medicare benefits and the mechanism by which those benefits would be delivered. That does not give me assurance on behalf of our senior citizens in To the contrary, if you were to talk to a group of our senior citizens and say that you want changes to Medicare, I can tell you what that would do. That would put a ripple of chills down the spines of senior citizens, for them to think their Medicare would be taken away from them.  Thus, Mr.Azar is a gentleman who is delightful and obviously skilled in the pharmaceutical drug industry. Yet, when we got right down to how he was going to run the HHS as Secretary, I was not assured that our seniors were going to be protected in their healthcare or that poor people were going to be protected in their Medicaid or that the 20-some million people--including the almost 2 million in Florida--who now have healthcare on the private insurance exchange, offered through the Affordable Care Act, were not going to be undermined.  There is just no way that I think this is the appropriate person to be the Secretary of Health and Human Services; therefore, I will vote no.

986,topic-id,1397,"Mr.President, I am absolutely shocked that FEMA has announced that on Wednesday it will stop distributing food and water to Puerto Cutting this aid to the people of Puerto Rico, while still almost a third of them do not have electricity, is unconscionable and a travesty.  I urge the administration to reverse this disastrous decision immediately and to continue providing the people of Puerto Rico with the help they need as they are trying to recover from two disastrous hurricanes.  This Senator has been speaking on the floor over and over of their desperate needs, but here I am again to remind our colleagues that Puerto Ricans are American citizens, that they are just like the people of any State, including those in the States of Kentucky, Texas, Wyoming, and in so many of the other States where needs might be forgotten. They are our fellow countrymen, and they deserve the same care and protection that we would provide any other citizen in his time of need. They have supplied some of the greatest warriors of our U.military in World War I, World War II, Korea, and on up to the present.  If the people of any other State were being neglected like the people of Puerto Rico have been in the wake of this storm, there would be an absolute outrage in this The people of Puerto Rico need help, but they are not the only ones. Millions of people were affected by the storms that hit last year in my State of Florida, in the State of Texas, in, of course, the U.Virgin Islands, and in Puerto Rico, and many were affected by the wildfires in  Right now, many of them are desperately waiting for the Senate to act on a disaster supplemental package to help them recover. We are trying to pass it, and it keeps getting shuffled off into the future. We are trying to add to the supplemental--the necessary disaster aid that is needed in agriculture, particularly for the citrus industry in Florida--the financial assistance that is needed in Puerto I hope our colleagues in the Senate will understand the urgency of this matter. We cannot keep pushing this off into the future. The need to act is now.  In addition, people in Florida are struggling. We should not neglect what is happening on the mainland. It is true in It is true in It is true in It is true on the islands. The storm destroyed homes and damaged apartments all around Florida, but we haven't seen any real attempt to address the housing needs of the hurricane victims in the State--by the way, including those coming to Florida from Puerto  Florida received about $600 million out of the $7.4 billion, which was made available in the CDBG-DR, in the September supplemental. What percentage is that of $7.4 billion? It is much less than 10 percent. It defies comprehension. Florida was one of the places that[[Page S561]]was the hardest hit last year. Hurricane Irma virtually covered up the entire peninsula of It wreaked havoc all across the Add to that the aftereffects of Hurricane Maria, with thousands fleeing Puerto Rico and going to Florida, and we have a real housing crisis on our hands. The $600 million, which is to help those who have been left bare by two of the most devastating storms to hit the country in decades, is a drop in the bucket. We should be able to get people the help they need in the time they need it. It is required now--not a year later, not 6 months later, but now.  Schools in Florida have been stretched thin in their having enrolled nearly 12,000 students who have evacuated Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Every child has a right to a quality education, but the school systems cannot do it on their own, not after a natural disaster. Dealing with such a large influx of students in a short period requires extra resources.  The House has passed a package that includes $2.9 billion for education funding. We desperately need it. The schools and students need this aid now. We cannot keep kicking the can down the road. Their educations cannot wait. You cannot keep relying on teachers to go out and get the extra supplies for them.  I mentioned our citrus growers. The industry has already been devastated by a bacteria called greening. When it gets into the phloem sap of the tree, it kills the tree in 5 years. We are not going to have a citrus industry if we can't find the cure for that. With the extra care of the groves, they have been able to nurture back crops. So here are all of these crops of oranges and grapefruit on the trees, and along comes In some groves, not only have 100 percent of the crops been blown off the trees, but the trees have been uprooted. That is why we desperately need the money--to clean up and replant.  The farmers in Florida suffered at least $2.5 billion in losses when Hurricane Irma tore through the State, and that included a lot of our citrus. Citrus alone experienced $760 million in losses. That is on top of the difficulties that they were having already with the bacteria.  The USDA is estimating that Florida growers will only harvest 46 million boxes this season. Get this: 10 years ago, there were 203 million boxes of citrus harvested. A decade before that, there were 244 million boxes of oranges harvested. For months our farmers have been told to wait their turn. Some of them are going bankrupt. They have waited long enough. They need the help now. We just have to act on this disaster bill.  Additionally, it has been over 100 days since Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Over 30 percent of the island remains without power, and parts of the island still lack running water. Some people have running water still, but they cannot drink it. They have to boil it.  When I was there in the little mountain town of Utuado, the source of water about 2 weeks after the hurricane--with the roads cut off, the only source of outside help was by helicopter, and the running water that they had was from a pipe that was coming out of the mountain, the mountain water draining down. I don't want to mince words here. We have a full-blown humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico right now. My colleague, Marco Rubio from Florida, has been there also, and he is here to testify to the same thing.  As a result, recent estimates suggest that over 300,000 Puerto Ricans may have moved to Some are fortunate enough to move in with relatives, but others are living in motels that line the I-4 corridor. Some are living out of their cars. This is absolutely heartbreaking. How can we fail fellow American citizens like this? Yet, given the current situation, the administration thinks that now, today, is the appropriate time to cut off food and water for the people of Puerto  There is no common sense here. FEMA needs to continue to provide food and water to the island until, at the very least, all of the island has access to potable water and electricity. They are suffering, and while the administration is trying to abandon the responsibility of the United States to Puerto Rico, the House aid package shortchanges recovery efforts on the island. We must enhance it in the Senate package.  For instance, it fails to address the current Medicaid crisis that is just a month away. If nothing is done, Puerto Rico's Medicaid Program is going to run out of money. Congress must act; otherwise, over 1 million U.citizens will be denied healthcare coverage when they need it the most.  It has been over a month since the House passed the disaster bill. We haven't seen any action. The longer we wait, the more people suffer. It is clear the government is not working the way it should. We need to turn the corner, and it needs to start with this disaster bill being bumped up in the Senate and then quickly passed.  I beg our colleagues, and Senator Marco Rubio joins me: Let's take up this bill. Let's fix the deficiencies, and let's pass it immediately.  I yield the floor.

Without an extension of funding for community health centers, the future of 142 centers in my State would be in jeopardy. These centers are where more than 200,000 New Jersey kids receive care when they get sick. You can't stand up for children's health when you are refusing to fund community health centers.

417,topic-id,951,"Here we are, Mr.Speaker, another day to take a deep breath. As you know, our responsibility is to pass a budget that meets the needs of the American people. Since September 30, which was the end of the fiscal year, we have not done that.  Today, we are gathered to do our fifth continuing resolution. You know all the statements that have been made by Secretary Mattis and others about how destructive that is to our national security. I want to make a few points.  First of all, I want to say that a dark cloud is lying over the Capitol, and that is the Trump GOP tax scam. Under that legislation, nearly $2 trillion will be added to the national debt. That is bad enough in itself, but it also has cast a shadow over the ability of this House to honor its responsibilities to the American people.  We take an oath of office to protect and defend the American people and our We know that is our first responsibility, and we stand ready to join in funding our military to do that. So for the Republicans to say that we are shutting down the government because we didn't want--we weren't shutting down the government. You shut down the government.  But let's put that aside for now as we go forward.  One, let us stipulate to the fact that we will all agree that we need to support our troops in the manner that the mission that is established calls for.  Two, the other part of that debate is about the domestic agenda. The domestic agenda includes opioids and veterans, issues like that, that are part of our national security, homeland security, Veterans' Affairs, State Department, and antiterrorism activities at the Justice Department--the list goes on--of things that are part of the security function that are on the domestic side.  Our colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle have been reluctant to support domestic agendas. That is just the way it is, and I think that is one of the reasons the Speaker has increased the defense spending so that he can get their votes even though they didn't want to vote for the domestic spending.  But if we are going to honor the commitment, not the dollar figure that is in the authorization of the Department of Defense bill, and honor the budget agreement, we will be adding $300 billion to the deficit maintaining parity.                              {time}  1245  I just want our Republican colleagues to know that when they are voting for a CR that takes us to the next step, that next step, if it honors the commitments that have been made, it will be $300 billion over and above the $2 trillion.  I just say that because I have heard you say: Well, we have a big deficit, so we have to look at Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and all of those initiatives. If we are not going to honor that, and we are not going to honor other commitments because of this tax scam and this Trump shutdown, then we have a problem going forward.  So, yes, we are here about values. It is not about one set of children versus another. It is about our values. The Republicans have put forth what they did with CHIP--which the Senate has never shown much of an interest in--and all of a sudden, CHIP was their chit. CHIP was their chit. They put that on the table, and they said: America is a country of ``Sophie's Choice.'' You either choose the DREAMers, or you choose the CHIP kids.  We all support all of that. America can take care of all of its children--their safety, their health, and their well-being.  The dark cloud of the tax bill is a real problem as we go forward in the decisions we have to make to meet the needs of the American people.  As Mr.Hoyer said, this is a budget debate. The DREAMers part of it is a part that has come into it, but if there never was a DREAMer on the face of the Earth--thank God, there are DREAMers--but if there never were, we still have this challenge: the lack of interest on the part of Republicans in the House to vote for a domestic budget that meets the needs of the American people, using the excuse of the budget deficit, which didn't seem to bother them when they gave away the store to the richest people in the country, the top 1 percent and corporate  As we face this decision today, it is a no-drama event, as far as I am concerned. The Senate Democrats' movement, in terms of getting a commitment on how we go forward on the budget and how we go forward on DREAMers, good for them. Our Members will make their decision about how they wish to vote.  But understand this: this isn't just about the This is about who we are as a nation, in terms of honoring what we care about most in our country and how we put that into a budget in terms of fighting the opioid epidemic; meeting the needs of our veterans, especially in terms of infrastructure; issues that relate to the National Institutes of Health and their investments there; CHIP, really, with the community health centers; medical education for primary care doctors; and the list goes on and on.  This will be a lively debate about a number of subjects, as we go forward. But understand this: it is going to increase the national debt. It didn't have to have such an impact if we didn't have the GOP tax scam, which led to the Trump shutdown.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-22-pt1-PgH616-3.txt,905,PAIN-CAPABLE UNBORN CHILD PROTECTION ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED,2018.0,22.0,January

Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Republican's latest stopgap funding bill. I take great pride in House Democrats overwhelmingly supporting the first continuing resolution in September to give the majority a chance to get the job done.  But after months of Republicans' excuses and extensions, I refuse to be an[[Page H619]]enabler to the Republicans' failures any longer.  This past week once again exposed the utter incompetence of the Republican-controlled government. Here we are ending the Trump shutdown with Republicans' fourth stopgap short-term bill. The Republicans have failed to get their act together for the fourth time to fund the government for a full year.  In August, Defense Secretary Mattis was asked: What would be the effect of another stopgap short-term spending bill on the military?  You all know he replied: ``It just creates unpredictability. It makes us rigid. We cannot deal with new and revealing threats. We know our enemies are not standing still.''  ``So it's about as unwise as can be.''  Mr.Speaker, there are also other statements for the Record to that effect from the Navy Secretary, et cetera.  Now, the Trump shutdown will end, but Republicans' wasteful incompetence continues. There is a dark cloud over the Capitol, Mr.Speaker: the deficit-exposing GOP tax scam, which has added nearly $2 trillion to the national debt.  The Republicans have made their choice: tax breaks for corporations and the wealthiest are more important than certainty for our military.

Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to Republicans' latest stop-gap funding bill.  I take great pride in House Democrats overwhelming support for the first continuing resolution in  But after months of Republican excuses and extensions, I refuse to enable Republicans' failure any longer.  The past week has once again exposed the utter incompetence of Republican-controlled government.

In August, Defense Secretary Mattis was asked: what would be the effect of another stop-gap, short term spending bill on the military?  ``It just creates unpredictability,'' he said. `` It makes us rigid. We cannot deal with new and revealing threats. We know our enemies are not standing still . . . So it's about as unwise as can be.''  Navy Secretary Richard Spencer has said: ``We have put $4 billion in a trash can, poured lighter fluid on it, and burned it . . . Four billion is enough to buy a squadron of F-35s, two Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, 3,000 Harpoon missiles. It's enough money to buy us additional capacity that we need. Instead, it's lost, because of inefficacy in the ways of the continuing resolution.''  Now, the Trump shutdown will end, but Republicans' wasteful incompetence continues.  There's a dark cloud over the Capitol: the deficit-exploding GOP tax scam--which has added nearly 2 trillion to the debt.  Republicans made their choice: tax breaks for corporations and the wealthiest were more important than certainty for our military.  Republicans control the House, the Senate and the White House--they control what bills we vote on in the  So, my colleagues, why haven't we voted:  For resources for the opioid epidemic that kills 94 people every day?  For funding our veterans' infrastructure and services?  For saving the millions of American pensions in crisis today?  For funding community health centers & lifesaving research at NIH?  For child care for hard-working parents?  For protecting patriotic young DREAMers?  Why were tax breaks for billionaires and corporations so urgent?  120 days after allowing CHIP to expire, Republicans suddenly claim to care about children on CHIP--but only as part of a cruel Sophie's choice to pit sick children against DREAMers fearful for their future.  Because of the Republican Majority's weakness, we still do not have a long-term spending bill that funds the military and the domestic investments that keep our nation strong.  We have not delivered strong disaster recovery funding for Puerto Rico, the U.Virgin Islands and other victims of hurricanes and wildfires.

795,topic-id,544,"Mr.Speaker, I am joined today by Jared Huffman from And eventually, I think, Brendan Boyle from Philadelphia, the home of the new NFC champions, is also going to join us.  What we are going to talk about is: What are the Republicans afraid of? What is it they are hiding? What is it they think is going on with respect to this investigation of the President and his ties to Russia?  It starts from the very beginning. This time last year, we asked the President: Are you going to turn over your tax returns so that people can see what is in your tax returns; whether you have relations with the Russians, or who knows who?  Every President for the last 40 or 50 years has turned over their tax returns. But, of course, the President did not turn over his tax returns and has refused to turn over his tax returns.  The first thing you ask is: What is in there? What are you hiding?  Now, what we see is a concerted effort by the Republicans in the Congress and in the White House to smear and disparage hardworking law enforcement officers in the FBI, in the intelligence community, and the Department of Justice, who have been tasked with trying to figure out whether or not Russia involved itself criminally in our elections last year and whether or not there is any implication of the Trump campaign with respect to those particular efforts by the  We need to make sure that Russia does not hack into our elections, does not participate in a way that favors one party over another or one candidate over another.[[Page H673]]  These investigations started and the first thing the President did was fire Jim Comey from the Through a process, the Justice Department then appoints a special prosecutor, a special counsel, to continue this investigation.  Since that has occurred, there have been a couple of indictments and a couple of plea agreements. Michael Flynn, who was the intelligence head for the President, has faced part of this investigation. There was Paul Manafort and Richard Gates, who were involved in the campaign, and then George  But that is just the tip of the iceberg. All these people, both on the Trump campaign side and all of these Russians, have played some kind of a role, and this investigation must be pursued.  My friends on the Republican side of the aisle can complain, can stomp their feet, can throw mud at the individuals who are asked to do these investigations, but these investigations must continue so that the people understand exactly what happened and to make sure that the Russians are not allowed to participate and infiltrate and affect our elections once again.  There are just a couple of questions: What are you afraid of? What are you hiding? Is there a coverup of some kind here?  The bottom line is: just let our law enforcement individuals do their detective work, do what they were asked to do, and leave them alone and let it be done. If it exculpates and proved that nothing happened, then great. But if there is some wrongdoing here, America needs to know about it.

Like any employer, the voters have expectations for us once we have been hired to do this job.  I will never forget I work for the people of Michigan, and I feel very fortunate to have earned the opportunity to serve them.

They expect us to keep our borders secure and enact reasonable human immigration policies that keep our Nation competitive and boost economic growth, and they expect us to responsibly fund the Federal  None of us should be proud of the recent government shutdown. There is no such thing as a good government shutdown. I am nevertheless hopeful that lessons can be learned from last weekend and a better path forward can be found. I think the coming weeks and months are of vital importance to the future of the U.Senate as a meaningful, functional institution.  Let's be honest with ourselves and with the American people. In the last few years, we have not been functional. We have blown deadline after deadline. It took us almost 4 months past the funding deadline to tackle the easiest problem: reauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance Program, a program that provides healthcare to millions of Americans children, while saving taxpayers money.  As I stand here, healthcare for over 600,000 Michiganders--including over 12,000 Michigan veterans--remains at risk because we have blown through deadline after deadline to fund community health centers, a program that provides cost-effective care to millions of Americans in both rural and urban areas across our country.  How is it that a nation that put the first man on the Moon still can't put lights on for our own American citizens in Puerto Rico? We need to help families clean out their flooded homes in the gulf, support communities that have faced out-of-control wildfires and mudslides during the devastating 2017 disaster season, and ensure affordable flood insurance is available to every homeowner who needs it.  Americans stand by each other in the face of tragedy. This is why Senator Stabenow and I fought for a year to deliver Federal resources to Flint and continue working to make sure families are receiving the care they need and get their damaged pipes repaired. In addition to addressing all of these urgent issues, we need to keep the lights on in the Federal Government, where funding is set to expire again in just 2 weeks.  While the government was shut down this past weekend, I worked with a bipartisan group of Senators pulled together by my colleagues Senator Collins and Senator This group is called the Common Sense Coalition, and we worked through the weekend to find a bipartisan compromise to open the Federal Government and find a path forward to tackle the complex, pressing issues before us in  While the lights are back on, the real work is just beginning. In the coming weeks, we need to find a legislative solution to provide certainty to the Dreamers--young men and women brought to the United States as small children. They grew up as Americans, went to school here, served in our military, only speak English, and are every bit as American as you and They graduate from our colleges and universities and provide critical talent to a growing American economy. They start their own small businesses and create jobs in our communities. They are young adults who voluntarily came out of the shadows to participate in the DACA Program and are fearful they will be ripped from their home and be deported to a country they have never visited, a country where they don't even speak the language and will find themselves a stranger in a foreign land, which is an absolutely terrifying situation.  Without question, we must also pass a disaster relief package to help communities devastated by the hurricanes, floods, and wildfires. We must also reauthorize the Community Health Center Program that provides essential healthcare to Americans and over 600,000  We must do more to fight the far-reaching opioid epidemic that is hurting and killing far too many of our friends, family, and neighbors. The opioid epidemic is a public health crisis that touches everyone in every State and every county.  We need to deliver certainty to the hard-working Americans who spent[[Page S515]]decades earning their pensions and now see them at risk as they prepare to enter retirement, and we must follow through on our most basic of duties.

229,topic-id,2385,"Mr.President, today I want to talk about the opioid epidemic that has gripped our country and my State of Ohio and talk a little about a report we issued last week with regard to synthetic opioids coming in through the U.mail system.  This tragedy has hit Ohio hard. We are not alone, though. Opioids affect every American regardless of age, area code, class, or color. Every State represented here in this body has experienced this--broken families, devastated communities, higher crime rates, friends lost, and, of course, lives taken through opioid overdoses.  The Centers for Disease Control recently reported that more than 63,600 Americans died in 2016 from drug overdoses. That is the last year for which they have statistics, but we all believe it was worse in 2017. With 63,600 Americans dying of overdoses, that means, on average, more than 174 Americans die every single day. That is up from approximately 143 Americans who died, on average, every day from drug overdoses a year earlier in 2015 and 105 Americans who died every day in 2010.  The problem is getting worse, not better. Drug overdoses, in fact, are now the 1 cause of death--not just accidental deaths but the 1 cause of death--in America for Americans under the age of 50. The reason for this increase in overdose deaths is the spread of heroin, prescription drugs, and now the synthetic opioids--fentanyl and carfentanil. Opioids were involved in more than 42,000--about two-thirds--of the overall deaths in 2016. Opioid deaths were five times higher in 2016 than they were just a few years ago.  This is a national epidemic. It has unfolded in three different waves.  The first wave was the prescription drug epidemic--pain pills--15 to 20 years ago. That started to increase dramatically.  Next, heroin deaths spiked. Heroin was turned to as a less expensive and more accessible way for people who were addicted to pain pills to continue to receive the high--in this case, from heroin coming mostly from  Now synthetic forms of heroin are overtaking the illegal opioid market, and the results have been even more deadly. Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that is 50 times stronger than heroin, has become the new scourge of the epidemic. Fentanyl is so deadly that 2 milligrams of it--as little as two flakes of it--can be lethal. It is cheap, easily accessible, and can be added to make any number of illegal drugs more potent--cocaine, heroin, pills.  In Ohio, fentanyl and its variations, such as carfentanil, were responsible for 60 percent of our State's more than 4,000 overdose deaths in 2016--the most recent year for which we have statistics. That 60 percent is a huge increase from just the previous year, 2015, when fentanyl was responsible for about 37 percent of the deaths. We have had more deaths from overdoses and a lot more deaths linked to fentanyl.  Sadly, again, this situation is getting worse, not better. Just last week in Ottawa County, OH, outside of Toledo, we had five overdoses in 1 single day. We had three people die of overdoses in 1 week. The suspected cause, of course, is fentanyl.  Earlier this month in Akron, a 57-year-old man--a board member of the Akron Public Schools system--was found unconscious in his car from a drug overdose. First responders were thankfully able to revive the man with Narcan--a miracle drug that reverses the effects of overdoses--and treat him at a local hospital. Again, fentanyl caused that overdose.  In July of last year, a 12-year-old Columbus boy encountered fentanyl while he was at his cousin's for a sleepover. He was rushed to the hospital but died days later from a lack of oxygen to his brain as a result of fentanyl.  These synthetic drugs have invaded communities across Ohio and across the country. Unbelievably, this deadly poison is primarily shipped into America from China through our U.Postal The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair along with ranking member Senator Tom Carper, recently held a hearing on this issue. It came on the heels of our yearlong bipartisan investigation that resulted in a 100-page investigative report that examined how these drug traffickers in China exploit vulnerabilities in our international mail system to ship these deadly synthetic drugs into our communities.  I encourage people to look at that report on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations website. The results of the report were shocking. We found that it was incredibly easy to buy fentanyl online. By simply searching ``fentanyl for sale'' on Google, our staff identified hundreds of websites, many affiliated with Chinese labs, all openly advertising this deadly drug. Online sellers were quick to respond, unafraid of being caught, and ready to make a deal. They even offered discounts for bulk purchases and tried to upsell us to carfentanil--fentanyl's even more powerful and deadly cousin.  This is an email from Chinese traffickers offering ``a hot sale'' for one fentanyl analogue before it is discontinued. Their preferred shipping method is the U.Postal Service because, as they told us, the chances of the drugs being seized were so insignificant that delivery was essentially guaranteed.  This chart shows a carfentanil advertisement and the online traffickers[[Page S569]]suggesting ``USPS'' as their preferred shipping method. Why? Because USPS is the way in which the delivery is virtually guaranteed. ``DHL, UPS, FedEx, TNT are quicker, but not safe, and will be detained frequently.'' Instead, they say: ``We suggest USPS only.''  It is inexcusable that these drugs are as easy to ship as a postcard and that traffickers' preferred shipment method for these deadly poisons is through a Federal agency. Our post office has become a conduit for these deadly drugs.  By the way, this is incredibly dangerous for the postal employees, the letter carriers, those who have to handle these packages.  I should note that our team never purchased any of these drugs online, but we did use the online sellers' payment information to determine if others were buying. Of course, we found out that they were. We narrowed our search to just six websites. From those six sites, we identified more than 500 payments to those six online sellers by more than 300 Americans in 43 States just in the last couple of years.  This map shows where the fentanyl went. As you can see, just from those six websites and those few hundred people, it went all over the country. The largest concentration of buyers was in my home State of Ohio, where you see the red. They were also in Pennsylvania and But, as I mentioned, it went to all 43 We were able to track hundreds of packages related to the online purchases.  By analyzing more than 2 million lines of shipment data obtained in our investigation, we located three individuals in the United States who seem to be distributing these drugs. We also identified two other individuals who purchased items to make pills, including pill presses, chemical bonding agents, and empty pill casings.  Our report also reinforced the risk associated with these deadly synthetic drugs. We identified seven individuals who died from fentanyl-related overdoses shortly after receiving packages from these online sellers. One of those seven individuals who died was a 49-year-old Ohioan from the Cleveland area who sent about $2,500 to an online seller and received 15 packages through the Postal Service over a 10-month period. His autopsy confirmed he died from ``acute fentanyl intoxication'' just a couple of weeks after receiving a package from this online seller.  We are already working with law enforcement authorities to make sure these drug dealers can be brought to justice. We recently released all our documents to the Department of Homeland Security for them to do their own investigation.  China has responded to our report. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said last week that China stands ``ready to work with the U.to enhance our coordination in this field.'' I welcome China's cooperation and coordination in this fight. But we need more than words. We need action. We need China to ban more of these deadly drugs and do it quicker. We need China to shut down these illegal fentanyl laboratories and arrest those responsible for shipping drugs into our country.  I had the opportunity last year to travel to China as part of a congressional delegation, and I was able to speak directly to some of the Chinese authorities, including Premier We talked about these deadly poisons coming into our communities and how we needed more help to be able to shut down these labs and to arrest these individuals. I also made the point that there is evidence that some of this opioid material that is being synthetically produced in China is leaking into their communities and that they have a problem too. We need to work together to shut this down.  One way that we can assist law enforcement in this war on synthetic opioids is by simply providing them the tools they need to identify packages coming in that likely contain these drugs. Whether they are from China, whether they are shipped somewhere else, or whether they are from another country that begins to produce these drugs, we have to do a better job finding these packages and stopping them.  Because of the roughly 500 million packages that come in by mail every year, interdicting these small packages is very difficult. It can be like finding a needle in a haystack. So law enforcement has asked us to help them be able to get the information they need to target suspect packages.  That is why what is called advance electronic data is so very important. This is information that comes in advance--such as what is in the package, where it is from, where it is going--is information for packages entering the United States that can greatly assists our law enforcement.  Customs and Border Protection is responsible for this mail coming into our country, and they want to identify these suspicious packages and be able to trace them back to both the U.distributor and user but also, of course, to their overseas traffickers. When they have that information, they are able to stop packages but also then initiate investigations, prosecutions, and arrests.  As part of our investigation, we found that last year the Postal Service only received this advance electronic data on about 36 percent of the more than 498 million packages coming into our country. That means the United States received more than 318 million packages with no data. That means there was little to no screening at all.  We also found that the quality of the data that was provided was often inadequate and unhelpful to law enforcement. Even when the Postal Service conducted a pilot program to screen for these drugs through the use of this data, they only presented 80 percent of these packages targeted by Customs and Border Protection for inspection. In other words, about 20 percent of these suspect packages came into our communities without inspection, despite being suspect packages.  With these glaring holes in the screening process, it is no wonder these drug dealers choose the Postal Service as their preferred drug delivery system. It is a massive loophole that is undermining the safety and security of our country.  After the September 11, 2001, attacks, collecting the advance electronic data was identified as a national security priority.  In 2002 Congress wrote legislation that required private carriers to collect this advance electronic data and authorized and encouraged the Postal Service to do it but left the implementation up to the Postal That was 16 years ago.  Because of the 2002 law, private carriers like UPS, FedEx, DHL, and others, require useful data on every package entering the United States, while the Postal Service gets its data for less than 40 percent of the hundreds of millions of packages it receives every year. Again, the Postal Service data is sometimes not usable, and 20 percent of those packages targeted because of the data are never presented to law enforcement to be inspected. Folks, this is just wrong. We can and we must do better.  We talked earlier about the number of people dying from fentanyl overdoses and the fact that this is the new scourge. It is coming in our mail system. We have to be able to do better, and we can.  This is why I have introduced what is called the Synthetics Trafficking and Overdose Prevention Act, or STOP This bipartisan bill will require the Postal Service to get that electronic data on all international packages entering the United The coauthor of the STOP Act is Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and we now have 29 Senate cosponsors from both sides of the aisle. The bipartisan House companion bill is now, I believe, cosponsored by a majority of the House of Why? Because this is just a commonsense solution that people understand has to be done.  I urge all of my Senate colleagues to join us in doing what we can to stop some of this poison from coming into America and to at least raise the price on the street of this synthetic heroin that is cheap and accessible.  By holding the Postal Service, a Federal agency, to the same standard we have for private mail carriers, we can give law enforcement the necessary tools they are asking for to identify and stop these deadly poisons from reaching our communities.  I understand that this is just one part of the solution to deal with the opioid epidemic. Trust me; I get that. I have been working on this for over 20 years, focused mostly on the prevention side, treatment, and the recovery. Those are all important. We need to continue to do that because our States[[Page S570]]are gripped by these opioids, and all of us need it. But there is clearly a need for a legislative solution to prevent these drugs from entering our country through our own mail system.  The STOP Act is a clear opportunity and responsibility for Congress to help turn the tide of addiction. I urge all of my colleagues to join us in supporting the STOP Act and, by doing so, in saving lives.  I yield back.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

671,topic-id,2247,"Mr.President, tonight I wish to talk about our responsibility in the U.Senate to reopen the government, to get back to work solving real problems, and to fix the system around here so we aren't tempted to play political games with government shutdowns in the future.  We are now in the second day of what I think is kind of a senseless shutdown. It is not helping anybody. There is a lot of disruption, dislocation, and dysfunction for no reason. It is a situation which was perhaps best described by Democratic leader Chuck Schumer in 2013 when he said: ``I believe in immigration reform. What if I persuaded my caucus to say I'm going to shut the government down, I'm not going to pay our bills unless I get my way. It's politics of idiocy, of confrontation, of paralysis.''  I think Chuck Schumer was right. I think the lesson of 2013 in that shutdown is, they don't work. I think they are a bad idea. They are unnecessary disruptions. They hurt our economy. They hurt families. They hurt our troops. By the way, they ultimately also cost the taxpayers more money, not less. That has been the history.  That is why, for 6 years now, I have been fighting to pass legislation called the End Government Shutdowns It is a very simple piece of legislation. By the way, my efforts in that have spanned Presidents of both parties and majorities in the Senate of both parties. It is not a political issue. We should end government shutdowns.  More on that in a minute, but let's take a look at the real-world impact of a shutdown. In my home State of Ohio, nearly 50,000 Federal workers are seeing their paychecks halted through no fault of their own. This includes rangers at parks across the State, like Cuyahoga Valley National It includes 3,000 employees at NASA It includes thousands of civilian employees at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and thousands of other employees around the Buckeye State who are going to be hurt. Why? Because of the shutdown here in Washington, By the way, Federal contractors are being told they can't go to work. Yet they are going to get paid after the fact. How does that help taxpayers?  How did we get here? Well, spending goes through The Constitution says Congress alone has the power of the purse, so every dime that is appropriated for spending has to go through this  Unfortunately, since the fiscal year ended on September 30, Democrats and Republicans in Congress have been unable to agree on an overall budget plan that allows us to fund our 12 annual spending bills. Since then, we have passed three of these so-called continuing resolutions. They are also called They provide short-term funding for the government; basically, a continuation of the spending from last year, just to keep the government from shutting down. That is what CRs do. They don't include any policies, typically, or any spending levels for the next fiscal year. It is just to keep things going and keep government operating. Nobody likes them. I don't like continuing resolutions. Who would? But the alternative is either come to an agreement on these 12 annual spending bills we have talked about or have a government shutdown.  That was considered unthinkable over the last 4 months, when these continuing resolutions were passed by big bipartisan majorities of both the House and the  By the way, 8 of these 12 annual spending bills I was talking about actually passed out of committee with big bipartisan votes. So 8 of the 12 actually have been passed. They are ready to come to the Senate floor, but they haven't come to the Senate floor because they require 60 votes out of 100 to be brought up, and Democrats, not having a solution to what the overall spending levels will be, have not cooperated to bring those individual spending bills to the floor.  That is obviously the best way to do this; that is, to have the 12 spending bills come to the floor, have the debate, put the best policies in place, and have the right levels of spending for this fiscal year. That hasn't happened so we have these short-term continuing resolutions.  One might ask: How can the continuing resolutions pass? Because they don't seem to be very popular. Well, but they are better than a shutdown. By the way, they also require 60 votes, but, again, it is the one thing we have been able to pass over the past 4 months to avoid shutdowns while we negotiate our differences over the level of spending, over the policies that are going to be in place between now and the rest of the fiscal year. They have always passed, again, on a broad bipartisan basis.  Some Democrats have voted with us to keep our government open in the past because, as the Democratic leader has said, shutting down the government just doesn't make any sense. In order to pass a CR--a continuing resolution--only 39 Senators can vote no because, again, we have to get 60 votes. On Friday night, 44 Democrats chose to vote down the latest CR, even though almost nothing of substance has changed in the continuing resolution since the last continuing resolution that was voted on, again, by big majorities.  The only thing that has changed is, there was added a very popular and urgent extension of a healthcare program called the CHIP program, Children's Health Insurance It is absolutely critical that we pass that because in the next couple of weeks we are told some States will begin to run out of money. CHIP actually expired back in September, and it has had short-term fixes since then, in this continuing resolution, the same as the last continuing resolutions, basically.  Nobody really objects to what is in the continuing resolution, but the addition has been this really important program; CHIP is reauthorized. By the way, it is reauthorized for its longest reauthorization ever in the history of[[Page S416]]the program--a 6-year reauthorization. I strongly support it, and I think my colleagues do across the board. If we don't deal with CHIP, again, this is urgent enough that some States are actually going to run out of money.  Some are choosing to shut down the government, even though they can't point to anything in the short-term continuing resolution they disagree with and even though it endangers the healthcare of children and families around the country. That is where we are. The main reason we have heard from Democrats who oppose an otherwise acceptable continuing resolution--and we just heard here tonight from my colleagues on the other side, including colleagues I work with a lot on other issues, and I respect them, but they said this is about something else. It is not the spending bill, but it is about how we deal with DACA and broader immigration reform.  I want to resolve DACA, too, and I believe most of the Members of this body sincerely want to resolve It is an administrative program that is appropriate to being legislated. The President gave us until March to deal with it, and we must and should deal with it. There is an ongoing, good-faith effort to resolve the DACA issue as well as broader immigration issues, like border security, and to do all that before DACA expires on March 5, which is 6 weeks away.  There has been a lot of finger-pointing--and there is always plenty of room for that around here, let's face it--but the situation is clear: We are in day 2 of a shutdown because my Democratic colleagues are holding hostage the entire Federal Government and children in need of healthcare through CHIP for a nonspending issue that is being worked on. We all know it expires on March 5, and we need to deal with it.  Without a spending bill or a continuing resolution to keep the government open short term, while we come to an agreement on larger issues, there are a bunch of Federal workers who are going to wake up tomorrow morning and find themselves furloughed. Many will not be able to go to work because their offices are closed. Some will, I am told, have to report to work, but they are not going to get paid, at least until the government reopens. Again, the taxpayer always ends up getting the short end of the stick on this.  I just think it is crazy that we are allowing this to happen. It doesn't make any sense. I don't get it. Yes, there are some larger issues we have to come together on and solve in a bipartisan way, but we should agree to a short-term funding deal to just get the government up and running and then work to solve those problems. We are not working on them now, I can tell you, because everybody is distracted by this issue--a government shutdown.  My understanding is, we are going to vote on a new proposal tonight to reopen the government. It is shorter term. Why? Because a number of Democrats have said they think the previous continuing resolution, which was for 4 weeks, was too long, so this one will be just 2\1/2\ weeks, until February 8. That is fine with me. I think that gives us enough time to resolve these issues and enough time to actually put the changes into legislation--2\1/2\ weeks. That would be pretty fast by congressional time.  I understand the new CR proposal will also be coupled with these important CHIP funding proposals; in other words, the long-term extension of the Children's Health Insurance Program, which is important, and a commitment to continue the negotiations to address all of the outstanding issues, including DACA, including defense spending, including disaster relief.  Let's support it. Let's get this behind us. Let's be sure people don't wake up on Monday morning to find they are furloughed, and then let's get back to these hard issues we were hired to resolve.  I know it is a lot harder dealing with those substantive issues than dealing with those political issues. It is easy to shut down government. That doesn't take any ingenuity or imagination. That is easy. It is harder to deal with these tough issues, but that is what we have to do. Shutdowns aren't the answer.  The situation tonight is a reminder that we should end government shutdowns for good. Again, that is why I have introduced the bipartisan legislation I mentioned earlier called the End Government Shutdowns Act, to avoid these types of unnecessary disruptions that are unproductive and unfair to our constituents. The bill would simply continue spending from the previous year for 120 days if any appropriations bill or any CR is not agreed to by the established deadline. Then it would gradually decline that funding by 1 percent, and then 1 percent, to give lawmakers the incentive that is needed around here to actually come together on a funding agreement. I think it is sensible. I think it is common sense. It has always been bipartisan in the past, so we can get it done.  By the way, I first introduced this bill in 2012 with my Democratic colleague Jon Tester from Montana, when a Democratic President, President Obama, was in the White House and Democrats controlled the So this is a commonsense solution that benefits the country, not one political party over another. It is what is best for our country.  If this bill were law, we wouldn't be in this situation. Instead, we would be talking about the substantive issues--how we resolve DACA, how we resolve defense spending. We have had 18 shutdowns in our country's history, and none of them would have happened if this was law.  There would be no last-minute political brinkmanship over issues unrelated to funding our government. Our constituents, including Federal employees, would not have their lives disrupted, taxpayers wouldn't get fleeced by shutdowns and the backpay that happens and the inefficiencies. Our legislation is bipartisan, but frankly we need a lot more Members to support it and help us put in place a long-term solution to make sure these shutdowns don't continue to happen.  I urge my colleagues tonight, and any staff who might be watching, please sign on to this legislation. We need your help. It is common sense. It is a time in which I hope we all realize these shutdowns don't make sense, and we have an alternative. A shutdown isn't helping anyone. It isn't helping Americans who need access to vital government services. It isn't helping Federal employees who instead should be working and not being furloughed, and it sure isn't helping the 9 million children who are facing losing needed healthcare services under  There are bipartisan discussions going on right now. I have spoken to colleagues on both sides of the aisle this afternoon and this evening. I think those discussions have been productive. Let's hope they are successful. Let's hope we can resolve this tonight. Let's hope we can have a vote to give the American people the certainty and predictability they are looking for. Let's reopen government, and let's get back to work.  I hope all of my colleagues will join me in doing that tonight.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

1008,topic-id,425,"Today, I am introducing the Control Your Personal Credit Information Act, which seeks to give consumers greater control over when and how their consumer reports are shared by consumer reporting agencies.  Under existing law, the current consumer reporting system is backwards. Consumer reporting agencies collect vast amounts of personal information on consumers, often without our knowledge, in order to compile consumer reports. These reports are then shared with financial institutions and others without our consent in all cases.  In the wake of Equifax's failure to secure troves of valuable personally identifiable information it collected on over 145 million Americans, it is clear that this system must change. Indeed, the National Consumer Law Center's[[Page S583]]Chi Chi Wu stated in her October 2017 testimony before the House Financial Services Committee that the Equifax breach ``means half of the US population and nearly three-quarters of the consumers with active credit reports are now at risk of identity theft due to one of the worst--if not the worst--breaches of consumer data in American history. These Americans are at risk of having false new credit accounts, phony tax returns, and even spurious medical bills incurred in their good names.'' To make matters worse, the risks of identity fraud may not dissipate over time because as Ed Mierzwinski, U.PIRG's Federal Consumer Program Director, points out ``unlike credit card numbers, your Social Security umber and Date of Birth don't change and may even grow more valuable over time, like gold in a bank vault. Much worse, they are the keys to `new account identity theft.' ''  My legislation attempts to address these concerns and fix the current upside down system by giving consumers greater control, at no cost to the consumer, over when and how their consumer reports are released when applying for new credit, a loan, or insurance. Under my legislation, consumer reporting agencies must confirm a consumer's identity and obtain their written authorization before releasing consumer reports in the instances that are especially vulnerable to identity theft and fraud.

I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their support of this important bipartisan legislation, and especially the lead Democratic cosponsor, Representative Jim Himes from  The Federal Savings Association Charter Flexibility Act is a commonsense reform bill that will help to ensure that community banks, many of which have histories stretching back generations, can continue to serve the needs of Main Street businesses and families.  Specifically, this bill focuses on Federal savings associations, also known as thrifts. These institutions are similar to national banks in the sense that they are both chartered and regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the  But these banks are constrained in their ability to pursue certain lines of business under the Home Owners' Loan Act, also known as Specifically, HOLA subjects Federal thrifts to commercial lending limits.  Under what is known as the qualified thrift lender test, at least 65 percent of a Federal thrift's portfolio assets must comprise certain mortgage and consumer-related assets. These institutions are also constrained in their ability to hold commercial loans, paper, or corporate debt. In contrast, national banks enjoy the ability to engage in a much wider range of lending activities.[[Page H647]]  These restrictions originally made sense because thrifts also enjoyed advantages not afforded to national banks. But changes in law have eliminated or curtailed many of those benefits, and some thrifts have expressed frustration that these restrictions prevent them from being able to meet the changing needs of their local communities. Unfortunately, thrifts have not been immune to the industrywide trend of consolidations and closures that has accelerated over the last decade.  The Federal Savings Association Charter Flexibility Act provides these banks with additional flexibility to adjust to changing times and continue to serve their communities, despite these persistent headwinds.  Under current law, the only option available to Federal savings associations is a costly and complicated conversion to a national bank charter. This is a particularly burdensome process for mutually chartered Federal thrifts since it requires that they first convert to stock form before converting their charter.  The Federal Savings Association Charter Flexibility Act provides another, less disruptive option. Under my bill, Federal thrifts will have the ability to pursue a path that will allow them to operate with the same rights and duties as a national bank. But these banks will not have to go through the costly and cumbersome process of converting to stock form and then rechartering. Instead, the bill sets up a simple 60-day election process that will allow these institutions to become covered savings associations.  It will also require the OCC, which has been supportive of this legislation and has responsibility for regulating Federal savings associations and national banks, to establish an orderly and streamlined transition process.  This bill also includes important safeguards to prevent potential fire sales of assets and subsidiaries during the transition process, and it protects the OCC's ability to prevent firms from abusing the new structure.  Altogether, this effort will help to ensure that time-tested community financial institutions will continue to be able to serve their customers for years to come.  The Federal Savings Association Charter Flexibility Act has the support of the American Bankers Association and the Independent Community Bankers of It is also bipartisan, and it passed the Financial Services Committee with a 55-0 vote. Similar language has been included in the bipartisan Senate Banking Committee package, also.  In short, this bill represents the sort of reasonable, commonsense, across-the-aisle reform that our constituents want to see.  I want to briefly share some comments from the Pennsylvania Bankers Association, which represents a wide range of banks in the Commonwealth of In their letter of support for this bill, they wrote: ``. . . this legislation represents sound, sensible regulatory relief.''  They also added that ``Federal savings associations are known for being responsive to their communities' needs, and this legislation will help them to expand and continue to do so.''

987,topic-id,3731,"Mr.President, I want to begin by thanking Senator Nelson, the senior Senator from our State, for once again raising this on the floor. I am glad to be able to follow him and to make many of the same points about the importance of acting on this.  The Presiding Officer is from a State that has been impacted by storms. He knows that long after the cameras leave and long after the stories have been written, real people's lives have been disrupted, sometimes permanently, certainly in ways that we don't think about. We have come to think about hurricane damage as roofs being ripped off of buildings and trees in the road, and once those are picked up, everything is back to normal. What we don't recognize is that underneath all of that is the long-term damage done to a small business that went 2 weeks without any sort of income, so they closed.  There is the impact we see in the Florida Keys, where there are a lot of people, for example, who have used their retirement savings to buy a small property that they rent out in the Florida It is very common. They buy a small townhouse, they rent it out in the winter for people to stay there, and then they use it in the summer for their family.  Well, guess what. This winter they are probably not getting a lot of visitors. In some cases--I know of one in particular--there is all this debris from the storm that is sitting in the canal. It is not very attractive for a visitor to come to the Keys and stay in a townhouse where they can't even go out into the ocean because the canals and the waterways that take them out have refrigerators floating in them and have all kind of debris in them. By the way, there is still debris there from previous storms, almost 15 years--10 years ago.  What does that mean? That means the owner of the unit doesn't have the rent they were using to pay the mortgage. She might be a teacher or he might be a firefighter, and now they are not getting the income they were counting on to make the mortgage, so they potentially could fall behind and could lose this rental property that they had invested in for their family. These are not rich people. These are people who had an investment for the future and had a good business model until the storm came. That is not measured anywhere, but that is real harm.  The small businesses have been harmed. The Florida Keys, in particular, is a place that has had lot of small businesses that have been there for a long time. Some of these places have gone months without clients. If that person doesn't come and rent out that unit I just described, that means that person isn't using the fuel from the local gas station, isn't eating at the local restaurants, and isn't contributing to the local economy.  To top it off, it is so expensive. Imagine if you are a worker at one of these buildings making $15 an hour. It is so expensive. They already had a housing problem, and this has made it worse. So it would be a mistake to say that the hurricane damage is over, and the effort to address it ends the minute the trees are removed from the road and the roofs are tarped and repaired. It goes on for a while.  In the case of this particular storm, Florida was also impacted by the impact that Maria had on Puerto As[[Page S562]]Senator Nelson just outlined, up to 300,000 American citizens--I say that because there are still a lot of people wondering, why are we giving aid to Puerto Rico? Puerto Rico is a U.territory, and its residents are U.citizens. There are 300,000 U.citizens from Puerto Rico who have moved to They enrich our State, but our schools weren't counting on the kids, so they have to scramble to deal with that.  Our housing stock--I met with a group of people on We still have people living in hotels who have been there for 3 or 4 months. Even if they wanted to go out and find an apartment, there is nothing available. There are all sorts of challenges. We have heard stories, for example, that they have to pay a $75 application fee for each one of the housing units they apply for, even if they are turned down. Just figure that out. If someone applies to just three or four of them, that is a lot of money out of pocket for someone who has already lost everything in the storm. Florida is facing that as well.  I am disappointed. If someone had told me that we would get to the last week of January without taking up disaster relief, I would have been surprised because we had a chance to actually address this at the end of last year. The House sent over a bill that didn't go far enough. The Senate had ideas about how to make it better, and then for reasons involving leverage and using it as a tool to get people to vote for CRs--short-term spending at the end--it has been held up. That is unfortunate because these problems are only getting worse, not better, as time goes on.  Senator Nelson talked about the citrus industry. One of our signature crops, if not our signature crop, was already being challenged by citrus greening, which is a terrible disease. Senator Nelson and I went to some of those groves together, and there are growers who basically were already hurting. They have lost everything for this year. There is no money coming in. The fruit is gone. Once that fruit touches the ground and that ground is wet, you can't sell it. The trees are damaged. It is not as though we can just buy a new tree at Walmart, and in 1 year it produces. It has to put it in the ground, and it takes 5 years before it will start to produce. They are hurting, and they are wondering, should I replant? Is this a good business for me to be in?  Some of these families have been in citrus for three or four or five generations, and this could be the end, not just the end for them but the end of Florida citrus. We helped them in the tax bill with the ability to immediately expense replanting, but that will not be enough. That is why this package has to include USDA resources to help replace these lost trees and rehabilitate the groves that were flooded. This is critical and essential to our food supply.  The Army Corps of Engineers plays a huge role in the State of For example, there is the Herbert Hoover Dike, which is a dike on Lake Okeechobee that would prevent a catastrophic flooding event, should the lake levels rise too high. We have people living just south of it, and what happened, almost a century ago, is that people died because of flooding there. So this dike was built. It has been found to be and rated among the most vulnerable water infrastructure projects in the Nation, and we are lucky that it wasn't breached in the storm, but it could have been, had the rainfall been located at the right place at the right time. It has been the priority of our delegation for a long time to expedite the construction of rehabilitation to strengthen that dike. This is a good opportunity to do that because there will be other storms. Because the project was delayed when the storm hit, this is a chance to finish that role.  Other parts that are critical to Florida's economy are beach renourishment and intracoastal navigation projects. These are hugely important and not just what makes Florida an attractive place to live; it is the reason people visit. Some of these beaches were severely eroded. Particularly in Northeast Florida, there is no beach, and the water is coming up to the edge of the property lines. If there is no beach, the hotels and the condominiums that rent out on that beach do not have visitors. People will not go there unless there is sand on the beach, and the erosion that happens in a storm like this needs to be fixed.  Of course, we have all been engaged, and I hope all are committed to our Everglades restoration projects. The Everglades are some of the most unique environments on the planet. They happen to be in the United States and happen to be in our home In these Everglades restoration projects, we want to continue to make progress toward our goal of saving them.  By the way, the Everglades are a source of water for over 8 million So I hope the disaster funding also addresses all the work that was destroyed and the damage that happened to a lot of the restoration projects that were in place.  I will not go deep into education because Senator Nelson has already addressed that, but suffice it to say we had thousands of students who were displaced, and we add to that thousands of people from Puerto Rico whom the school districts welcome but weren't counting on. Now we have to accommodate classroom space. In many cases, for these children, although everyone in Puerto Rico learns English and Spanish, their primary language is Spanish, so we have to get instructors who are able to bring them to proficiency in That is a challenge. All of that is falling on the State of Florida as well. While Florida welcomes our fellow Americans from Puerto Rico who are seeking refuge, the costs need to be accounted for.  We had hospitals that were damaged from the storms, and the repairs to some of these continue to rise. In some cases, these hospital repairs resulted in the closure of the hospital for more than a year.  There is a hospital in the Keys that is going to be completely rebuilt. If you have ever been to the Florida Keys, the distances are bad, and there is a hospital that is going to have to be completely rebuilt.  In addition to all of that, we have our healthcare providers in Florida who provided charitable care, not just to Floridians after the storm but to displaced Americans from Puerto Rico and from the U.Virgin They need to be reimbursed for doing that. They didn't sit back and say: We are not going to do it unless you send us a check. They did it, and there were real expenses. Then they were also hit by the storm, and they are dealing with those new expenses.  By the way, one of the things I hope we will do is expedite hiring authority for medical personnel in HHS because, for years, we have failed to maintain adequate levels of personnel willing to give a couple of weeks of their time to aid in a time of disaster. Our medical teams are depleted, and at this rate we will already have a staffing shortage by the next hurricane season, which is just a few months away.  NOAA, another Federal agency--the disaster bill needs to fund the continued removal of the things I have already discussed: marine debris, lost lobster traps, capsized vessels. There is an environmental component to it, and there is an economic component to it. If our canal is full of refrigerators, debris, things that need to be removed, the water cannot be navigated. The value of all that property is wiped out, and also what is wiped out is the desire of people to come and visit. Beyond increasing--or as we call it around here ``plussing up''--critical FEMA accounts like the Disaster Relief Fund, we should also include language in the bill to protect counties, cities, towns, and individual homeowners who received FEMA disaster assistance from the uncertainty about when the Federal Government may come back in a few years and claw back that support. In essence, they can come back in a few years and say: We gave you too much money; give it back to us.  If someone did something wrong, I am not talking about that. I am talking about a good faith estimate that both sides agreed on, and they delivered the money, and then 4 years later they show up and say: Hey, we have looked at it again, and in hindsight we gave you $1,000 more in the case of an individual or $50,000 or $100,000 more in the case of a city or a county, and now they have to scramble to pay this back.  So I will continue to work to make sure that FEMA has the resources it needs to assist for recovery victims for[[Page S563]]both short-term and long-term recovery but without this threat of clawback, and there are ways to do that which will allow us to be fiscally responsible.  I have already talked about the housing issue in Monroe County in Southwest Monroe County is in the Florida Keys, and that is why it is critical that FEMA has the resources to utilize programs such as direct relief assistance, which will enable the Federal Government to lease a property that would not generally be available to the public, such as corporate lodging, to house survivors, to house people, as opposed to just giving them a voucher and saying: Go find a hotel.  Here is what happens. They get a hotel in South Dade in Homestead, and the big rates come in February, and everyone gets kicked out in February because those rooms were booked a year ago at those rates, and they have nowhere to go. It is disruptive. If we were able to lease out an entire long-term corporate housing or lodging facility, these people would have some certainty to go about their lives while their homes and their lives are rebuilt. Programs such as Direct Lease assistance provide the type of flexibility that Florida and, quite frankly, the whole country needs. We are going to continue to advocate for the program so we can provide roofs over the heads of displaced Floridians and Puerto  Infrastructure damage throughout Florida is also substantial. In particular, I was able to go down to the Everglades to It is a place we have gone often. It is one of the places we leave from to go fishing with my children. The facilities there were already in bad shape, to be frank. It looked like something out of one of those 1960s black-and-white movies they show in schools.  This place was badly hurt. Again, this is Federal property. That is a national park that belongs to the American people, under the custody of the Federal Government, and it was wiped out and hurt and destroyed. We need to help rebuild it. By the way, that includes airports, NASA--the Kennedy Space Center--which also suffered damages.  I have a couple more points, then I will close.  Housing and Urban On December 14, I introduced the Disaster Assistance Simplification That prohibits HUD from penalizing victims of natural disasters who apply but then turn down an SBA disaster loan. So if you apply for an SBA disaster loan, HUD will come back and take away your assistance or render you ineligible for HUD assistance not because you received the HUD loan but because you applied for it. That should be taken out.  I have worked with colleagues to ensure that this language is included in the upcoming supplemental because I don't understand how we can allow unsynchronized and burdensome disaster assistance programs to make recovery more difficult for someone impacted by a storm. You just went through a storm. Your business was destroyed. Your home was destroyed. Your family had to move to another county or another city. On top of that, you have to agonize over what the Federal Government may or may not give you. If they gave it to you, you have to agonize over when they may come back and take it away. We can't further victimize victims by penalizing victims who do not take assistance. Our laws are discouraging people from applying for SBA disaster loans.  Again, on that particular point, I am not talking about people who are double-dipping. I am talking about people who applied for HUD and Just the act of applying for that loan means you can't get the HUD assistance. That is ridiculous.  I will close with Puerto It doesn't get enough attention, in my mind. We read about the situation every day. Now the articles are saying: Can you believe they still don't have electricity in Puerto Rico? There are a lot of problems that need to be addressed. Puerto Rico had a lot of problems before the storm.  At end of the day, here is the bottom line. Puerto Rico is a U.territory. It is the responsibility of the United These are American citizens. They are children. They are residents. They wear the uniform of this country. If you go to Arlington Cemetery, not far from here, you will see their names after paying the ultimate sacrifice. They contribute to every area of our lives, whether they choose to live on the mainland or on the island. Perhaps because it isn't always in the headlines, a lot of people just don't understand its status, its importance, and our relationship and obligations.  We have been involved from the very beginning, not just because of the impact it has had on Florida but because, on a personal level, I have so many friends and people I care about who live there. If you live in Florida, you know people who have people they love who live there.  Right after the storm, I sent three members of my staff, who spent over a week at their emergency operations center, just trying to act as a conduit to facilitate between Federal efforts and the efforts of Puerto Rico's government, but the work that remains is extraordinary.  I talk about the people who are still displaced. We have seen the story of people losing their housing vouchers who were staying in a hotel. People say: We just heard from the government in Puerto Rico that your home is habitable so you are done. Check out tomorrow afternoon. They have nowhere to go. If they have family, maybe, but if they don't, where do they go that night? It is a problem. We have seen that happen in Connecticut and fear it could happen in other places.  On the disaster relief, we think recovering is not just about putting up light posts. We think it is about helping the economy grow, about attracting business and investment back, and about helping people who want to stay to be able to stay.  We have a number of provisions we hope will be included. One is a temporary payroll tax deduction so whatever it is you get paid, you get to keep more of it. It would be temporary for a year, but at least it is a way of giving people a raise without being a burden on businesses.  We would also like to see a temporary expansion of the child tax credit. Because of a quirk in the law, people who file taxes from Puerto Rico are not eligible for it at its full value the way someone on the mainland would be. Again, all they have to do is move to Florida, and they can do it.  These are U.citizens. If they can fight in our Armed Forces, if they pledge allegiance to our flag, if they are citizens of our Nation, why should they not be entitled to the same tax versions there that they would be if they were living on the mainland?  We also need to deal with, as Senator Nelson talked about, the Medicaid cliff. Because of the healthcare law that passed a number of years ago, the funding mechanism that was created places them in a position where soon they will run out of money in their Medicaid Ultimately, what will happen is, people who need these services will move to Florida or some other State, and then they will sign up for Medicaid in the States and get what they couldn't get in Puerto It will actually cost more. If money is what you are worried about, it will cost more in the long run not to do it than to do it.  I also think we need to increase funding for energy grid technical assistance from the Department of On that note, I would say, we are getting reports that they are being forced to rebuild using the exact same equipment that was there before the storm. Some of this equipment is so old, it isn't even manufactured anymore. They don't make it anymore. They had to retrofit and make things up.  If we are going to rebuild or help rebuild the grid in Puerto Rico, shouldn't they be able to put in something that is modern as opposed to rebuilding the old stuff? That makes no sense. It will actually make the system more resilient.  A lot of these proposals may meet with resistance, but they all make sense. We can justify every single one of them. I hope we will pursue them. I worked very closely with Resident Commissioner Jenniffer Gonzalez on these efforts.

523,topic-id,1694,"Mr.President, since 2010, I have sponsored a State of the Union essay contest for Vermont high school students. This contest gives students in my State the opportunity to articulate what issues they would prioritize if they were President of the United  I would like to congratulate the almost 600 students who participated this year. It is truly heartening to see so many young people engaged in finding solutions for the problems that face our country. To my mind, this is what democracy is all about.  A volunteer panel of Vermont teachers reviewed the essays and chose Marjorie ``Maggie'' Parker as this year's winner. Maggie, a sophomore at Woodstock Union High School, focused on the need to prevent hate crimes, particularly against members of the LGBT community.  Alaura Rich, a senior at Johnsbury Academy, was the second place winner. Alaura wrote about the prohibitive cost of a college education at a time when the United States needs to have the best educated workforce in the world.  Oliver Minshall, a junior at Hanover High School, was the third place winner, having written about addressing income inequality and creating a more equitable and sustainable economy.  I am very proud to ask to have printed in the Record the essays submitted by Maggie, Alaura, and The material follows:        MARJORIE PARKER, WOODSTOCK HIGH SCHOOL SOPHOMORE, WINNER       In our current day and age, I believe that one major      challenge that faces our country is the prevention of hate      crimes against minorities. One group I believe needs specific      protection, especially with the new administration, are      members of the LGBT community. With the recent military ban      on transgender Americans, the LGBT community is feeling      singled out and at risk. One way to bring a greater feeling      of peace to these fellow Americans is by increasing      protections instead of taking them away. I believe two major      steps forward to help these people would be a law against      employment discrimination for LGBT people, and also a repeal      of ``bathroom bills'' which put transgender people at a      greater risk of being harassed for their identity.       Firstly, on the topic of employment discrimination, many      LGBT Americans face discrimination in the workplace simply      for being open about their identities. In 2011, the[[Page S576]]     Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation Law and Public      Policy conducted a series of surveys and found that 43      percent of LGBT Americans said they had faced discrimination      in the workplace, and also found that straight coworkers say      they had witnessed discrimination based on sexual      orientation. One way to solve these struggles would be to put      in place a law that prohibits employers discriminating      against current and prospective employees on the basis of      gender identity or sexual orientation. A law such as this      could help reduce workplace discrimination and make it easier      for LGBT people to find a hold a job.       Second, on the topic of so-called ``bathroom bills'', all      people should have a safe place to use the restroom,      regardless of gender identity. During the Obama presidency,      an order was put into place that allowed students in all      public schools to use the bathroom that best matched their      gender identity. While there was much push-back, this was      generally a step forward for young transgender people.      However, early in 2017, President Trump reversed this order,      effectively taking away much protection for transgender      youth. It is important for this order not only to go back      into place for schools but also in all places. It is unfair      and uncomfortable for transgender Americans, who are living      their lives as their true identity, to be forced to use a      restroom that does not correspond to that identity. This is      not only an embarrassment for them, but can also put them at      greater risk of violence in said bathroom.       All in all, I believe that protection for LGBT Americans is      one major challenge facing our country. If we truly want to      be an example of an accepting country, with protections for      minorities, we have to be able to step up and protect our      fellow citizens. Through the changes I have outlined above,      as well as others, I truly believe that our country can start      to be a leader in the civil rights movement across the world.        ALAURA RICH, JOHNSBURY ACADEMY SENIOR, SECOND PLACE       As the country that leads the global economy, the United      States needs the best-educated workforce in the world. Our      Nation cannot afford to be left behind due to a lack of fair      and just educational opportunities. Yet, the educational      system in America is failing to provide some of the brightest      and most capable young people across the Nation with equal      educational opportunities: ones that are affordable for      minorities who are of low socioeconomic status or are the      first in their family to attend college.       As a member of Upward Bound, one of the federally-funded      TRIO programs that supports first-generation, low-income      students, I have known for years that the cost of college was      going to be a considerable barrier for me. However, it was my      understanding that if I worked hard enough, I would find the      means to pay for my college education without going deeply      into debt. This assurance diminished after receiving my first      award letter from a public, in-state university with notice      that I would need to borrow $40,000 over a four year period--     $10,000 above the national borrowing average--just to attend      a public school within my own Many students like      myself across the Nation face these same financial barriers.       Although there are many major issues that our country is      struggling to solve, our fractured, inequitable educational      system does not fall short of making this list. The appeal of      a college education has shifted dramatically from what it      began as: rather than a means of developing equal      opportunities for young people in pursuit of work-related      skills and knowledge, it has become a societal expectation      with a large price tag that can only be easily achieved by      those of upper-middle-class status. First-generation, low-     income students are left at a significant disadvantage. These      students often lack parental support, knowledge of the      process, and critical resources. Furthermore, their country      is failing to provide them with the financial aid system that      they desperately need in order to afford a college education.       It's time to enact change within the American higher      education system. We must make public colleges and      universities tuition-free, end the Federal Government's      ability to make a profit off student loans, substantially cut      student loan interest rates, and allow low-income students to      use need-based financial aid and work-study programs to make      their college debt-free by covering room and board, books,      and living expenses. By taking these steps, the opportunity      gap in America would see a significant decrease. Minority      students would see the same basic right to higher education      as their more advantaged peers, and the future economic state      of our Nation would be in the hands of the promising young      individuals who are currently being underrepresented in      colleges nationwide due to a lack of support. The Declaration      of Independence birthed the underlying fundamental foundation      of our Nation's belief in both opportunity and upward      mobility, and it is the responsibility of the United States      government to ensure equal educational opportunities for all.        OLIVER MINSHALL, HANOVER HIGH SCHOOL JUNIOR, THIRD PLACE       Income inequality is our greatest challenge, our most      present danger and an existential threat to Our      society is among the most unequal societies in the world,      consistently ranking behind other industrialized nations,      like France and Denmark according to the Leaders are      taking notice of this issue, in 2013 President Obama declared      that making the economy work for everyone was ``the defining      challenge of our time.'' To improve the state of this great      country, we must find a solution to the pernicious scourge of      income inequality and create a more just, equitable and      sustainable path for our economy.       An analysis by economist Edward Wolf confirmed that the top      one percent of income earners own 40 percent of the country's      wealth, the highest share in 50 years. At a time when we are      among the most prosperous nations in the world, the bottom      ninety percent has less wealth than the top one percent.      Robert Reich has observed closely as the very building blocks      of capitalism have been strategically manipulated by the      wealthiest one percent and large corporations for their own      benefit. Thomas Piketty discovered that modern markets tend      to produce increasing inequality in the long run due to the      tendency of capital investments to increase in value at a      faster rate than the economy at large. Median income rose to      its highest level ever in 2017 according to Business Insider      but when adjusted for inflation the real purchasing power for      many poor and middle class people is stagnant. While the      sources of this inequality are far from certain, the      deleterious effect on society is indubitable.       This is not just a moral problem but a threat to the future      of American democracy. The political scientist Martin Gilens      contends that while America enjoys many of the features of      political democracy, citizens have so little economic power,      and therefore influence, their views do not have any      practical effect on policymaking. That is an attack on      popular sovereignty, a core principle of our democratic      system. Piketty too points out this trend, asserting that      while some inequality is necessary for the function of      efficient markets, excess inequality is detrimental to the      long term function of our democratic institutions.      Furthermore unequal societies undermine the very markets they      are based upon. Inequality causes political and economic      turmoil that harms society.       The solution to this issue is a comprehensive strategy to      deal with inequality. We need to raise taxes on the top one      percent, implement the Harkin-Defazio financial transactions      tax, remove the arbitrary and regressive cap on taxable      income for Social Security payroll taxes, tax capital gains      as earned income and use the revenue to fund new programs      like free tuition, a public option in healthcare, and new      infrastructure. If we embrace these policies and the shared      ideals of economic justice, and political democracy we can      transform America into a vibrant and equitable society worthy      of the American dream and those who strive every day to      realize it.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-30-pt1-PgS575-3.txt,1010,CHILD PROTECTION IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2017,2018.0,30.0,January
64,topic-id,1502,"Madam President, as we consider this legislation to protect 20-week-old babies who feel pain, I want to ask my friends in this body to put aside whip counts and score cards, politics and reelection, and let's talk today simply about beauty and about science.  We love beauty. Beauty calls us. Beauty inspires us. Beauty captivates us. It is part of what makes us human. It is not surprising that there is almost nothing more universal on this Earth, almost nothing more beautiful, than our natural impulse to care for a little baby.  We all start in the same place--vulnerable and dependent in every way. We all ``ooh'' and ``aah'' over sonogram pictures of our children, our grandchildren, our nieces, our nephews, even sonogram pictures from a stranger on a bus or a plane. We all ``ooh'' and ``aah'' in the same way. When we look at those pictures, we love. We love. You don't have to be taught this. You don't have to be conditioned to love. You don't have to be conditioned to know that we should help the vulnerable. This isn't because of economics. This isn't because of politics. We love because they are babies. You don't need anyone to explain this to you. Every one of us has experienced this when we have seen the sonogram pictures. We should note that this love is not just a feeling; it is also built on and backed up by facts.  As we consider whether these unborn babies--having been carried by their mamas for almost 5 months--deserve legal protection, whether they deserve our protection, we should think, too, about the science and what is becoming clearer year by year and month by month.  I want to associate myself with the comments of the Senator from Montana who preceded me. A huge part of why the millennials are becoming more pro-life than the two generations older than they are is because they are seeing these sonogram images, and it is changing them year by year and month by month.  I have been on the floor for about 45 minutes today, and I have heard many claims about polling and facts that just aren't true. I am not here to argue this case and argue how we should vote on this legislation because of polls; I am here because we should all love babies. That is why we should be doing this. But just at the level of polling, there have been claims on the floor today that are absolutely not true.  Younger people are becoming more pro-life, as the Senator from Montana said, year over year right now, and it is because of the prevalence and the pervasiveness of sonogram technology. This movement, the pro-life movement, is ascendant, and it is because people are grappling with science, grappling with images, and grappling with the reality of that intrinsic feeling we have to love.  We can and we should appeal to ethics. We can and we should discuss human dignity. We should reaffirm intrinsic value. For now, for this conversation today, we can limit ourselves to just scientific facts. As we consider those facts, I want to respectfully ask my colleagues in this Chamber today, where will we draw the line? No one seriously disputes that the little girl in that image is alive. No one seriously disputes that that little girl is a human being--no one. There is no one in this Chamber and there is no one outside this Chamber who has ever looked at that sonogram image who will come to the floor and say: Do you know the debate I want to have? I want to say that baby is not alive and she is not a human.  Somebody who is going to vote no on the legislation today should come to the floor and make that case, say that is not a life and that is not a human, because it is not true, and no one believes it.  The science is clear. We all know and understand that little baby in that sonogram image is a unique and separate being. We know she has unique DNA from her mother, and she has DNA that is unique from her father. The baby apps are now telling new moms and dads-to-be when that baby is the size of a sesame seed, then a blueberry, and then an apple. With the help of the sonograms, we are now catching pictures of her sucking her thumb, flexing her arms and legs, yawning, stretching, making faces. Here is what is really new the last couple of years: We are catching pictures and images of her responding to voices--familiar voices of other human beings that she is already in community with, people who are called to love her.  As early as 20 weeks postfertilization, which is about halfway through the pregnancy, scientists and our doctors now tell us that this unborn baby can feel pain. In fact, it has become routine procedure of late for us to give unborn and premature infants anesthesia for their fetal surgeries. Why? This is new. We didn't used to do this. Why do we do it? It is because we have new scientific evidence that they feel pain. It turns out that babies who are 20 weeks along in gestation are pain-capable inside mom's uterus.  As Kanwaljeet Anand testified before the Congress, ``The human fetus possesses the ability to experience pain from 20 weeks gestation, if not earlier, and the pain perceived by the fetus is possibly more intense than that perceived by term newborns.''  Not only can she feel pain, not only do the images show us that she recoils from being poked or prodded, advances in modern medicine are now helping babies who are born at 22 weeks, at 21 weeks, and at 20 weeks postfertilization survive outside the womb. The pain that those babies feel outside the womb is supporting the evidence that those babies also feel pain inside the womb, which leads me to ask my friends: Have our hearts grown cold to truth? Have we become indifferent to questioning our previously held convictions? Are we indifferent to what the science is clearly showing us?  This body, captive to abortion zealot-activists, might be ignoring the sonograms. That might be what is happening in this body today, but the American people are actually listening to the science and the sonograms. Contrary to those bizarre claims that were made on the floor a couple of times over the last hour, a hefty majority--it is not close--of Americans support this legislation, including a supermajority of women, including most young people, including most Independents, and now ticking up just shy of half of all This should not be a partisan issue, and in the future, it will not be because more and more people are looking at these images. It is not going to be a partisan issue; it is going to be a bipartisan issue. But you have to tell the truth--that those pictures are pictures of babies, and they are alive, and they deserve our protection. But have our hearts in this body grown cold to the truth?  We should also not forget the mothers because the pro-life message is about being both pro-baby and pro-mother. Late-term abortions are actually not safe, even for the mother. Women seeking abortion after 20 weeks are 35 times more likely to die from an abortion than when done in the first trimester--35 times more likely.  The United States is one of only seven countries on Earth that allow elective abortion after 20 weeks, and we are actually tied with only three other countries as having the most permissive abortion regime on Do you know who our peers are? North Korea and That is who our peers are. If our rhetoric about human rights should mean anything, it should mean we don't want to be on a ``human rights worst'' list with North Korea and That is where we are today.  There are many reasonable people who are going to argue against this legislation. They are reasonable in other ways in life, and they want to make an argument about the very complicated issues about abortion in the[[Page S540]]first trimester. There are many reasonable people who can have a reasonable debate about that. But when you listen to the arguments being made today, they are not actually grappling with today's legislation; they are talking about abortion in general. But nobody is telling us why we are tied with only China and North Korea as having the most permissive abortion regime on  My friends, beauty and compassion can stir our hearts, and science and facts should still confirm the truth. This legislation--the actual legislation we are voting on today--is pro-baby, it is pro-mom, and it is pro-science. These little babies, who are capable of feeling pain, deserve legal protection. They deserve our protection. I invite--I beg my colleagues to join in that conviction and to vote yes on this legislation today.

We all understand how insane this is to do four CRs in a row, and we all understand that we work very hard to get to the U.I am looking at all of you and thinking about how difficult everybody's race was just to arrive at the world's greatest deliberative body.[[Page S425]]  Forgetting, for the moment, someone's calculus about who has a temporary or even long-term partisan advantage in light of this shutdown, we all know shutdowns make this institution weaker, and we all know shutdowns make Senators weaker. We don't fight tooth and nail and go through that awful process--there are some joyful moments in a campaign, but nobody necessarily looks forward to it. It is a tough thing. You don't go through that so you can diminish the body in which you serve, and we are diminished by this process. General Mattis may have put it best when he said no enemy has done more harm to the readiness of the military than the combined impact of spending caps in 9 of the last 10 years operating under a  Nobody wants to do this anymore. We can't do CRs forever, but right now we need one to keep everyone at the table without hurting the American people. That is the purpose of the Brown UC and the Murphy UC, which is to say: Whatever our disagreements are, we have an opportunity, by unanimous consent, to make sure we don't punish the American people for our inability to agree with each other. Why not keep the government open for 24 or 48 or 72 hours?  From my standpoint, looking at my constituents in the State of Hawaii, we have extraordinary National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration workers; we have an incredible presence of the Department of Defense, civilian DOD employees as well as servicemembers; we have National Park Service people who do extraordinary work. We have lots of government employees, and it is not their fault. It is not their fault.  So I have a very simple unanimous consent request. It is a little different than the others. The others were to try to avoid this cataclysm, but should we be unable to avoid this cataclysm, I think we should keep our government workers whole because they didn't do this to us. We are doing this to them. So my UC request does a very simple thing. It just makes sure that whatever idiocy happens over the next 6 hours or 6 days or 6 weeks, that they are held harmless.

I think this is constructive and productive.  This last UC request is very simple. It is the same one, with a small modification that Senator McCaskill made on Friday night, and that is very simple.

Shutdowns are miserable. But during that shutdown and during every other shutdown that I am aware of, we always took care of our servicemembers. Senator McCaskill on Friday night put that UC in so that we made sure everyone who is serving in harm's way or prepared to serve in harm's way, supports our military, gets paid.  Frankly, in the heat of the moment on Friday night, when there was still a lack of clarity whether we were going to get through it without a shutdown, I understand nobody wanted to allow a UC request of any sort to go through. But then Friday came, and it was is not at all clear that we were going to move on this. And now we are into Sunday, and I don't know where we are with this, but I am getting increasingly worried. So it is really hard for me to understand why we wouldn't unanimously consent to pay our servicemembers.

233,topic-id,1722,"Mr.President, there are now only 13 days remaining before the continuing resolution expires on February 8. In that short amount of time, we must seek a budget deal, an agreement on healthcare legislation, and a bipartisan bill to protect the Dreamers and provide for border security. All these items are important. All of them are urgent, and we are working hard to get them all done.  On the issue of immigration, the bipartisan group of moderate Senators should continue trying to find a consensus. I think that is an excellent idea. The White House, unfortunately, has proven unreliable and wildly unpredictable. Within the course of hours, they say different things. Every time the President moves forward on one thing, his staff pulls him back and undoes what he said. The action should be here in the Senate to find a narrow deal on DACA and border security.  Now, as we have found time and again, when we open up the negotiations to discussions of broad immigration reform, there is no end to what each party says could be on the table. Republicans want vast curtailment of legal immigration. Democrats want to discuss a pathway to citizenship for 11 million. That is a recipe for delay when we can't afford one. Some on the other side are insisting on expanding this beyond the DACA and border security issues. That will just delay. That will just make sure that things don't work.  My Republican colleagues, particularly the leader and his more moderate Members, should feel the pressure to get this done, or else this administration will start separating families, taking kids out of school, servicemembers out of our military, and workers out of our companies. They will rip them from the American fabric in which they are embedded. What a tragedy that would be.  So the clock is ticking on Dreamers, and we don't have time for extraneous issues that some on the right or the left might want to add that have nothing to do with DACA or border security. The clock is also ticking for pensioners, for victims of opioid addiction seeking treatment, and for our veterans seeking quality healthcare. We have other issues: rural infrastructure, childcare, things that Democrats want to get done in this deal. We have to get a budget deal and a DACA deal that can get 60 votes--13 days before Dreamers get a lot closer to deportation; 13 days to help our economy, our communities, and the middle class, who have been waiting for over a year for this Congress to do something for them, instead of just helping business interests.                                  FBI  Mr.President, now I want to focus on one more thing that really should disturb every American, and it certainly disturbs me--recent events concerning the Federal Bureau of  For decades, the FBI has been our Nation's premier law enforcement agency, admired from one end of the country to the other. TV shows and movies all talked about how good the FBI was. We know because we trust them with protecting our country against many-faced threats: drug trafficking, terrorism, white-collar crime.  In 2016, the FBI--not politically, but just in the way it works to keep being vigilant to protect us in our security--was tasked with another mission of great importance--investigating Russia's interference in our elections.  As that investigation progressed, it found that members of the Trump campaign had concerning associations with the Russians in the lead-up to the election. That was pure law enforcement. That wasn't some political direction. Now that that investigation led by Special Counsel Mueller has resulted in two guilty pleas and two more indictments of Trump campaign officials, there seems to be a fervor on the other side to discredit what the special counsel's investigation has already revealed. That should give serious pause to Democrats, Republicans, and all[[Page S509]]A foreign power, probably the one that is most in our face, Russia, is interfering in our elections. I don't care if it is Democratic elections, Republican elections, national elections, or local elections. When a foreign power interferes in our elections, that gnaws at the wellspring of our democracy. All of us should be giving the FBI space and encouragement to finish their investigation without delay or interference.  Instead, ever since Special Counsel Mueller was appointed, too many Republicans and too many in the rightwing media have been desperate to distract the Nation from his investigation.  First they waged an aggressive and coordinated--I would say shameful--attack on the integrity of the special counsel. I was in the gym this morning. I spoke to one of my senior Republican colleagues, who said he knew Mueller, and he knew what a fine man he was. He is a model public servant. He spent decades earning the trust and reverence of both parties. He was known as somebody who was a registered Republican through my years in He wasn't regarded as a partisan figure, somebody who would have vendettas, political or otherwise--no. It got so out of hand--I couldn't believe this--that a Republican Congressman suggested Special Counsel Mueller's investigation was a ``coup,'' on the floor of the That Congressman ought to go back and read his Constitution and read his history books. The rule of law is not a coup. I would say to that Republican Member of Congress: No person, not even the President, is above the law.  The political smear campaign has now bled into a spiraling and delusional attack on the FBI itself. The Republican majority on the House Intelligence Committee has, according to Representative Schiff, manufactured a secret memo of partisan talking points, full of innuendo and glaring omissions, intended to suggest widespread corruption at the Department of Justice and the They are very, very serious allegations, if they had any truth to them or backing. Adding to the impropriety, some of those same Republicans are now trying to release this slanderous memo--and that is what it is, a slanderous memo--to the public.  Since this investigation has started, our Nation has had to endure conspiracy after conspiracy from Republican Congressmen and Senators and, of course, from the rightwing press, which acts in total cahoots. There are conspiracies about ``deep state'' leaks and unmasking requests, phone taps at Trump Tower, Uranium One, who paid for the so-called Steele dossier, and today it is this memo. On and on and on, they are conspiracy theories with virtually no fact--paranoia, delusion. Why? Are they afraid of the truth of the Mueller investigation? It seems so.  Meanwhile, Republican Members of this body, I am ashamed to say, picked up on casual texts sent between FBI agents to peddle the nonsense that there is a ``secret society'' at the Department of Justice, without a shred of evidence. I saw one of those--the Senator who was propagating this, this morning on television. It looked crazy. It looked delusional. It looked paranoid. What began as an attempt to discredit the investigator has now devolved into delusional, self-serving paranoia.  The Republican Party, which used to hold itself up as a law and order party, seems intent on destroying the credibility of our premier law and order agency and the hard-working men and women who serve there--all to assist a President who cares and knows very little about the boundaries of rule of law.  Imagine, the FBI, which for decades the Republican Party upheld--I remember lots of political debates here--now they are discrediting them with virtually no basis in fact. Guess who has joined the Republican campaign to attack the The Republican campaign to attack the FBI has been joined by the same forces that interfered in the 2016 election--Wikileaks, Julian Assange, and  Just a few years ago, those things were attacked by our Republican friends, particularly the hard right. Now they are joining them, wittingly or unwittingly. Can you imagine the outrage on the right if President Obama's message was being spread by Wikileaks, Julian Assange, or Kremlin sources?  Within hours of GOP lawmakers and FOX News calling for the release of the Nunes memo, Russian-linked bots began pushing the narrative using the hashtag ``releasethememo''--Russian bots, hashtag ``releasethememo.'' Just a few hours after some of our Republican friends started this push, use of the hashtag spiked and was used 100 times more than any other hashtag by Kremlin-linked accounts.  We are witnessing an effort by the Russian Government to intervene and influence our democratic processes in real time. Every single American should be concerned by this, particularly when their elected officials are willing to work--wittingly or unwittingly--alongside Russia to manipulate our opinion. Some of our Republican colleagues--sadly, unfortunately, wittingly or unwittingly--are acting as allies of Russia's disinformation campaign. Can you imagine? Can you imagine? It is hard to make this stuff up. It seems like we make this stuff up, but it is real--hard-right Republicans and the Russians trying to discredit our premier law enforcement agency.  This country erected institutions like the FBI and the Department of Justice to defend the vital interests of the Nation without deference to political parties. Much like the Federal judiciary, they act as an essential check on political power--whosever power it is--a defense against creeping authoritarianism.  What the FBI is investigating right now is about shielding our democracy from the disinformation campaigns of foreign adversaries. Russia wants nothing more than to undermine our democracy by eroding people's faith in its institutions, for without resilient democratic institutions, there can be no democracy.  Make no mistake about it. Today Russia may be doing the same thing that a lot of our Republican colleagues are. Tomorrow they may be attacking our Republican colleagues. The Russians have no interests other than hurting So the Republican attacks on the credibility of the FBI and the Department of Justice are playing right into Putin's hands. They constitute an attack on democracy itself.  There has to be a line. There has to be a line where the interests of your political party stop, because to go any further would be to diminish our country. I say that to my colleagues here and in the House who have participated in this besmirching unfairly, paranoically, self-interestedly of the Peddling delusions of secret societies, ``deep state'' leaks, and coup d'etats cross the line of what anyone of any party should do.

The continuing resolution extends government funding until February 8.  If an agreement on DACA isn't reached by February 8, the Senate will immediately proceed to immigration under a neutral process that is fair to all sides. This is the first guarantee that the Republican majority will give the DACA bill a fair consideration and an up-or-down vote on the floor, and it means we can hopefully resolve the fate of the Dreamers much sooner than the March 5 deadline.  The Republican majority now has 16 days to work with us to write a bill that can get 60 votes and prevent the Dreamers from being deported. The clock is ticking. Sixteen days--that is not much time.

Every Democrat--all 49 of us--supports Now the pressure is on Leader McConnell and the Republican moderate caucus to help find us a solution that protects the 800,000 Dreamers and can pass the  Over the weekend, a bipartisan group of Senate moderates came together and helped renew the urgency of the immigration debate. After talking with Senator Durbin, it is my understanding that this bipartisan group, which includes several Republican moderates, expressed a sincere desire to protect the Dreamers in the upcoming legislation--more so than before the weekend. Leader McConnell's promise to consider DACA legislation was made just as much to this bipartisan group as it was made to me. If he does not honor our agreement, it will be a breach of trust with not only the Democratic Senators but with several Members of his own party as well.  Democrats will continue to fight as hard as ever for the Dreamers, but I am more hopeful today than last week that we can assemble 60 votes for a DACA bill in the Senate, and we now have a real pathway to get such a bill through the  I am also very glad that a 6-year reauthorization of CHIP passed alongside yesterday's bill to reopen the government. It was a long time coming. Despite bipartisan majorities that support CHIP in both Houses, the Republican majority allowed CHIP to expire, leaving 9 million sick children in the lurch. That shameful wrong has been made right, but we should extend CHIP for an even longer period of time. The CBO projected that 10 years of CHIP or a permanent authorization would actually save the government $6 billion. How could that be? Because fewer children will go into the exchange and fewer will need subsidies because CHIP is an efficient, well-run, and successful program. So it is a no-brainer. We should make it happen.  Still, the Senate has 3 weeks in which to conclude a lot of work. A consensus has not yet been found on the budget, on healthcare legislation, on disaster aid, and, as I mentioned, on immigration. On each of these issues, the President has been either impossible to pin down or completely absent. This hooey that President Trump was involved in the negotiations--he was pretty invisible to me. President Trump's inability to negotiate with Congress is what caused the 3-day government shutdown from which we have just emerged. If we are going to get all of these things done, the Senate--the Senate--will have to work its will.  On the budget, we must lift the spending caps for defense and urgent[[Page S447]]domestic priorities. Just as our military needs the resources it requires to do the tough job we ask of them, we have critical issues here at home.  It is equally crucial to us--not more, not less--that we deal with the opioid crisis, where so many men and women, young men and young women in the flower of their lives, are passing on because of addiction. There is not enough enforcement at the borders, particularly preventing the evil fentanyl from coming in, and not enough treatment, so that when a young person, whether it is a veteran or anybody else, has this horrible addiction, they get the treatment to overcome it.  They have to wait so long in line, many of them with PTSD, for opioid treatment and treatment for other ailments. They shouldn't have to. They weren't waiting in line when they were in Afghanistan or Iraq fighting for us.  The heartland of America for decades has been our industrial complexes, our industrial might in our States, our Central Every week, every month these men and women put money into their pension plans, and now, because of the vicissitudes of the stock market and management, that money ain't there. It is our job through the PBGC to give them the pensions they deserve. No one is going to get rich on a pension, but at least they can retire in a life with some dignity.  On top of that, we must get a healthcare package done. The bill as proposed by Bill Nelson and Susan Collins on reinsurance, the bill as proposed by Patty Murray and Lamar Alexander on CSRs, as well as community health centers, the extenders that help so many of our rural hospitals, and other healthcare issues have to get done.  We must pass a disaster relief package.

It was their job to lead. It was their job to reach out to us and come up with compromise. They have failed.  Our democracy was designed to run on compromise. The Senate was designed to run on compromise. We are no dictatorship subject to the whims of an Executive, just as we are not a one-party system, where the winner of an election gets to decide everything and the minority nothing.  We are a government that can only operate if the majority party--the governing party--accepts and seeks compromise.

It has created the chaos and the gridlock we find ourselves in today. It all really stems from the President, whose inability to clinch a deal has created the Trump shutdown.  I agree with Majority Leader The Trump shutdown was totally avoidable. President Trump walked away from not one but two bipartisan deals, and that is after he walked away from an agreement in principle on DACA that we reached way back in the fall of last year. If he had been willing to accept any one of these deals, we wouldn't be where we are today.  On Friday, in the Oval Office, I made what I thought was a very generous offer to the President--the most generous offer yet. The President demanded for months that a deal on DACA include the wall. Most Democrats don't think the wall is effective. We think it is expensive and a waste of money. We are all for tough border security, but every expert will tell you that drones, sensory devices, roads, and personnel are far more effective than the wall.  Because the President campaigned on the wall--even though he said it would be paid for by Mexico--and demands the wall, for the sake of compromise, for the sake of coming together, I offered it. Despite what some people are saying on TV--and mind you, these folks were not in the room during the discussion--that is exactly what happened. The President picked a number for a wall. I accepted it. It wasn't my number. It wasn't the number in the bills here. He picked it. It would be hard to imagine a more reasonable compromise. All along, the President has been saying: I will do DACA and Dreamers in return for the wall. He has it. He can't take yes for an answer. That is why we are here.  We don't have anyone in the White House, in the Senate, or in the House, Republicans of the President's own party, to tell him he has to straighten this whole thing out. He can't say yes one minute and no the next--three, four, five times.  The bottom line is this: It would be hard to imagine a much more reasonable compromise. I was, in principle, agreeing to help the President get his signature campaign promise--something Democrats and Republicans on the Hill staunchly oppose--in exchange for DACA, a group of people the President said he has great love for. I essentially agreed to give the President something he has said he wants in exchange for something we both want, but only hours after he seemed to be very open, very eager about that generous, tentative agreement--and it was only tentative; there were no handshakes--he backed away from the last best chance to avoid a shutdown.  That is why, from one corner of America to another, this is being called the Trump shutdown. It is trending all over. People from one end of the country to the other know it is the Trump shutdown, and they know why. They have seen what the President has done. It is a direct result of the President, who has been proved unwilling to compromise and is, thus, unable to govern.  The deal wasn't everything the President wanted. It certainly wasn't everything we wanted. It was a compromise--something nobody loved, but everyone could live with; something good for the country. It would have staved off a government shutdown on It could still reopen the government today. I am willing to seal the deal to sit and work right now with the President or anyone he designates. Let's get it done.  Meanwhile, the Republican leader would have you believe we Democrats forced the shutdown. He forgets that several Members of his own party voted against the Are they holding the government hostage over illegal immigration? No, it doesn't seem that way.  The Republican leader accuses Democrats of holding up pay for our troops. I heard Speaker Ryan blame the Senate on TV, but yesterday Senator McCaskill offered a motion to make sure our military gets paid, and the majority leader himself objected. The[[Page S397]]majority leader prevented the troops from getting paid. This would have passed in a minute. Speaker Ryan should talk to Leader McConnell, who is the only person in the U.Senate standing in the way of paying our troops, not anybody here.  We don't want to use the troops as hostages. Unfortunately, some on the other side may be doing just that. We can make sure our troops get paid right now if the majority leader would only consent. If there is pride of authorship, let him offer the resolution. We will not block it. We will applaud it. I hope it can happen as soon as possible.  The Republican leader also accuses Democrats of blocking CHIP, when he full well knows every Democrat here supports extending It is 4 months lapsed. Who let that happen? The Republican majority. A Democratic majority would never have allowed CHIP to expire.  Now, just because it was placed on a CR--that was a bad idea for so many reasons--Republicans want to pretend they are advocates of CHIP, but quite the contrary. They were using the 10 million kids on CHIP and holding them as hostages for the 800,000 kids who are Kids against kids; innocent kids against innocent kids. That is no way to operate in this country.  Again, a party that controls the House, the Senate, and the Presidency would rather sit back and point fingers of blame than roll up their sleeves and govern.  The way out of this is simple. Our parties are very close on all of the issues we have been debating for months now. We are so close. I believe, we might have had a deal twice, only for the President to change his mind and walk away. The President must take yes for an answer. Until he does, it is the Trump shutdown.  He has said he has a love for Let him show it. He said he needs a wall and border security. Accept our offer to do both of those things because we Democrats--while we think the wall will not accomplish very much and cost a lot of money--we strongly believe in border security and fully supported the President's budget proposal on border security for this year.  So this is the Trump shutdown. Only President Trump can end it. We Democrats are at the table ready to negotiate. The President needs to pull up a chair and end this shutdown.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-21-pt1-PgS396-2.txt,1036,CHILD PROTECTION IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2017,2018.0,21.0,January
926,topic-id,1651,"Mr.President, the government funding bill that passed on Monday left us--all of us--with 3 weeks to come to a resolution on legislation to protect the At the same time, we must work on legislation to improve American healthcare--I see the Senator from Washington State, who has been so vigilant in that area--and a budget agreement that supports our military and our middle class, delivering long-awaited funds--we Democrats will insist on these--for the opioid epidemic, veterans' healthcare, and pensions. We should feel an urgency about all of these issues and many more that we can make happen.  Leader McConnell's promise to take up immigration on February 8 should light a fire under everyone. The Republican leader and moderate Republicans bear a special responsibility to make sure these votes happen. All of those in the country who want to make sure the Dreamers get treated fairly should be focusing their attention on getting 60 votes on a resolution that is fair to the  The clock is ticking. If we don't solve this problem in 14 days, the Republicans are going to have to explain to Dreamers what their plan is to prevent them from being deported. When those horrible pictures of deportation occur--God forbid that they do, but if they do, it will clearly be on the delay, the obfuscation, and the lack of humanity that too many of our Republican colleagues are showing in this regard.  Every Democrat--all 49 of us--supports Many of my Republican colleagues do as well. We certainly can find a bill that gets 60 votes in the Senate, and that is where our focus is. I had a very good meeting with the Hispanic groups yesterday. Some of us had disagreements about what happened a few days before, but it was an amiable and fine meeting, and we all agreed that we were going to focus on getting the 60 votes. I hope people throughout the country of both parties, of all political persuasions--business, labor--will join us like a laser in appealing to and imploring more Republican Senators to join us so that we get 60 votes on a fair DACA bill.  We cannot let those who are anti-immigrant, who call giving the Dreamers hope ``amnesty,'' block us because then we will fail, and it will be on the other side of the aisle that made that happen.  Over the weekend--and I am very glad about this--a bipartisan group of moderate Senators from both parties came together in a very inspiring way. Their efforts led to the agreement between the majority leader and me that an immigration bill will receive fair[[Page S482]]consideration in a few weeks. That is the first time we have ever heard that guarantee.  The same energy and spirit that the bipartisan group put into forging a compromise this weekend ought to be committed to finding a bill on DACA that will pass this body with 60 votes.  I support the bipartisan group. In fact, as some of our Members on the Democratic side had plans for it, I encourage them to join it and form it. I have had very good conversations with both leaders--Senator Manchin, a Democrat; Senator Collins, a Republican--and what they are doing is very good for the body. Speaking as Democratic leader, I encourage these kinds of groups to come forward.  I remember the old I remember that individual Senators were involved in negotiating very important and very difficult issues. It made the Senate a better place, it made the Members feel more fulfilled, and it made our ability to get things done much, much more likely.  Our task is different from the task last week. The Senate must find consensus. For that reason, we need to start from a new place. My negotiations with the President shouldn't dictate talks here on the That was then; this is now. It was a hope that last Friday the President would have reached out and supported something, that he wanted to get something that we wanted and he proclaimed to want too. It didn't happen. Now the group has to start in a new way, with no preconceptions, and come together and find a bill that can garner 60 votes. That is a job for these Senators who came together so well in the last few days.  Protecting the Dreamers is our moral obligation. The Senate is now in the spotlight. The eyes of the American people, who overwhelmingly sympathize with the Dreamers--90 percent, a majority of Republicans--believe in these They don't go for these calls of amnesty. These people have worked hard. They have been trying so hard to be They came across the border when they were little, and now they are in our Armed Forces, they are in our factories, they are in our schools, and they are in our offices. To say that allowing them to become Americans is amnesty is nasty--nasty.  Protecting the Dreamers is our moral obligation. The Senate is in the spotlight. The eyes of the American people, who sympathize with the Dreamers--the vast majority of Republicans, as well as Democrats, sympathize with Dreamers, and all of their eyes are on us. We need to get the job done.                          Republican Tax Bill  Mr.President, finally, a word on the Republican tax bill. Republicans promised that the massive corporate tax cut they passed would unleash unprecedented economic growth, raise wages, and boost jobs. We already have evidence that big corporations are not turning their new tax cut into jobs for the middle class.  There was a lot of hoopla when AT&T said they would give bonuses. Do you know what they did at the same time? They announced plans to fire more than 1,000 workers, starting early this year, despite the tax cut. Macy's announced that it would be cutting 5,000 jobs, despite the tax bill. Kimberly-Clark plans to cut up to 5,500 jobs and close or sell about 10 plants, saying the savings from the tax bill gave them flexibility to make these reductions. Is President Trump going to claim credit for that one? Carrier--a company the President promised to save--continues to bleed jobs. They are a metaphor. A lot of nice announcements, a lot of blitz and glitz, but actually the condition of the American worker is getting no better and many times, worse.  Meanwhile, what are most companies doing--so many of them--with these big tax breaks, these massive tax breaks they got? They are announcing stock buybacks. That benefits the It raises their stock and doesn't help anybody else. Mastercard, $4 billion; Bank of America, $5 billion; Pfizer, $10 billion; Wells Fargo, $22 billion; and many, many more. One hundred billion dollars has been announced in stock buybacks since the Senate passed its tax bill.  When the American people learn that some of them are not getting anything, that some of them are getting raises and the rest are getting crumbs and big corporations and wealthy individuals are getting nice, fat pieces of pie, they are going to be outraged. They are already.  My friend the majority leader will not come to the floor and brag about the stock buybacks. He will, however, announce when a company gives a bonus to its workers. Let's hear both sides and let the American people judge. The bonuses are a good thing, but the truth is, these one-time bonuses are a drop in the bucket compared to what corporations could be doing for their workers.  By the way, let me announce a few other things these corporations did after they got the tax breaks. When Bank of America announced $5 billion in stock buybacks, it also announced that it started charging low-income customers for free checking. When Pfizer announced its $10 billion buyback, it said it would no longer research for Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, laying off 300 people. Wells Fargo announced $22 billion in stock buybacks, helping its wealthy shareholders at the same time it is closing 800 branches.  Here is a paragraph from yesterday's New York       Bank of America's bonuses will cost the bank $145 million      in 2018, or about 5 percent of the nearly $2.7 billion in      savings it is expected to reap in 2018 from a lower, 21      percent corporate tax rate. Apple's bonuses will cost $300      million, a fraction of the $40 billion, at least, that the      tech giant is saving from a single provision in the law,      which allows it to return earnings held overseas at less than      half the rate it would have paid under the old system. And      two days before Walmart snagged glowing headlines for handing      out $400 million in bonuses and lifting its minimum wage at a      cost of $300 million, the nation's largest retailer by sales      unveiled a plan to buy back company-issued debt. . . . $4      billion.  Minimum wage, they pay out $300 million; stock buyback, $4 billion.  I am glad these workers are getting bonuses. They deserve them. But it seems that recently, these bonuses are token efforts to give corporate executives something to point to while they reap huge benefits for themselves and their shareholders.  A CNBC survey found that ``cuts in corporate taxes haven't yet had a meaningful impact on American companies' plans to boost investment or raise workers' pay.'' That is  Yes, we could have imagined tax reform that was deficit neutral, that closed loopholes while lowering rates, that lowered corporate taxes but actually stipulated that the money be put into wage increases and new jobs instead of what many companies are doing now--one-time bonuses and massive stock repurchasing programs. Many middle-class families have waited so long for better wages and more jobs. A tax bill properly constructed could have helped deliver that to them. Instead, Republicans squandered their once-in-a-generation opportunity on an extraordinary tax break for big corporations and the already wealthy, and we are already seeing the consequences.

984,topic-id,1727,"Mr.President, tonight the President will address a joint session of Congress in his first official State of the I want to talk about what I expect the President to say and also what I suspect he will not.  The President will be eager to defend the accomplishments of his nascent administration and take credit for a healthy American economy, pointing to low unemployment, job growth, and a soaring stock market, but the truth is, these trends were present before Donald Trump took office. President Trump was handed an already healthy economy by his predecessor. Like many things in his life, he inherited the healthy economy.  Here are two words we will not hear President Trump say tonight about the[[Page S559]]economy--thanks, Obama--because much of the growth in 2017 was created by President Obama's policies and, by many measures, the growth under President Obama was better than under President  Under President Obama, employment was driven from over 10 percent down into the fours. The tightening of the labor market finally started to reverse the stagnancy of median income. The stock market President Trump often touts on Twitter was booming under President Obama as well.  In President Trump's first year, the economy created 2.06 million jobs. That is less than the 2.24 million jobs created in 2016, the last year of Obama's term.  Again, President Trump, President Obama created more jobs in the last year of his term than you created in the first year of yours. So if you are going to pat yourself on the back, give a shout out to Barack Obama because he did even better than you in job creation.  In 2017, under President Trump, average monthly job growth was lower than in 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, and 2011, all under President  Again, President Trump, job growth in the first year of your term was less than in each of the last 6 years of President Obama's term.  How about the stock market. In the first 6 months of 2017, the percentage growth of the S&P 500 was lower than during the first 6 months of President Obama's term. In the first year of the Trump Presidency, the percentage growth of the Dow was lower than during the first year of President  So, again, here are two words we would like President Trump to say tonight about the economy: Thanks, We may never hear President Trump say those words, but he ought to.  I also expect the President to speak about bipartisanship. President Trump understands there is a very low bar when it comes to the topic. His first year in office has been so divisive, even a mere appeal to bipartisanship sounds like progress, but the proof will be in the pudding. Will President Trump pursue real bipartisanship through his actions or will he fall back on empty rhetoric? When it comes to bipartisanship, President Trump has to walk the walk, not just talk the talk intermittently. Mr.President, when it comes to bipartisanship, actions speak a whole lot louder than words.  I would remind President Trump that this has been one of the most partisan administrations many of us have ever worked with. I have worked under President Reagan, President H.Bush, and President Bush--all All of them were legions more bipartisan than President Trump's first year.  What have we seen? An assembly line of partisan CRAs designed not to need a single Democratic vote; a Supreme Court Justice picked by the hard-right Heritage Foundation and Federalist Society, no consultation, not a consensus nominee; a partisan healthcare bill that failed under reconciliation, specifically designed not to include Democrats; a partisan tax bill that ultimately passed, also under reconciliation--no consultation with Democrats, not a single Democratic vote.  The reason these don't get Democratic votes is President Trump and his administration don't talk to us. They don't ask us what we might suggest. They don't try to create a bipartisan meld which great Presidents have done from the time of George Washington; they just act in a narrow, partisan way, and the American people know it.  There has been hardly a shred of bipartisanship in the Trump era, despite our many appeals for it. The President and congressional Republicans seem to think that bipartisanship happens when one side puts together a bill, pounds the table, and demands the other side support the bill, with no negotiation, no compromise.  They are missing the step where they consult with the other side and work with the other side to earn their support. That is the hard work of legislating in our democracy, but this administration eschews hard work. The Republican majority and the White House have been content to craft legislation on their own, demand Democrats support it, and then label us obstructionists when, without consultation, without compromise, we don't. That dynamic is the root of the ineffectiveness and gridlock in I sincerely hope that changes.  If the President calls for bipartisanship tonight, I welcome it. But we eagerly await action, not just a sound bite in a speech. We await the honest debate, the good faith give-and-take, and the eventual compromise that are the actual hallmarks of bipartisanship. If those things arise, even though they haven't in the first year, Democrats will gladly work with our Republican colleagues and the White House to get things done for the middle class. But we need to see it to believe it. Mere words in a speech tonight will not create bipartisanship; actions will.  Finally, here is something that President Trump should discuss tonight: Russia sanctions. He ought to impose the sanctions, as Congress voted for in an overwhelmingly bipartisan fashion, or at least explain why he hasn't done so yet. We call on President Trump in the State of the Union to tell Americans that he will support the sanctions 90 percent of America supports or tell us why he will not.  Over a year ago, the U.intelligence community concluded that Russian President Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.Presidential election. That is a fact. That is a fact that is shocking. A hostile foreign power interfered with an American election and likely influenced it in measurable ways. The Founders of our country feared this very possibility. They knew that for a democracy to work, the election of the people's representatives must be free, fair, and legitimate, and that foreign powers, even back then, would try to corrupt the process. They wrote safeguards into the Constitution to protect it.  Last year, the American people were the victim of such an attack by an antagonistic foreign power: I call on President Trump tonight to use his State of the Union to tell Americans what he plans to do about Russian attacks on our democracy.  Implement sanctions, President Trump, or at the very least tell us why you haven't.  Today is the day the President is supposed to obey the sanctions issue Congress voted on overwhelmingly a while back. There is no subject more worthy of a thorough and unbiased investigation than the Russian interference in our elections. Yet the President and his allies have waged a scorched-earth campaign to discredit the investigation in any way possible--by assassinating the character of career civil servants, assailing the credibility of the media, attacking our own law enforcement agencies and officers, even denigrating the institutions of American  The White House and congressional Republicans' attacks on Mueller and his investigation make you believe it was taking place in a banana republic, Erdogan's Turkey, or Putin's Russia, not in the United States of What has been done by House Republicans and gone along with by just about the whole Republican establishment is not worthy of this democracy. It makes us look like a banana republic, and it is shameful.  A different kind of President would be encouraging Special Counsel Mueller's investigation and shouting down those forces who tried to interfere with it. A different kind of President would want to know how precisely Russia meddled in our election and would have severely punished Putin for it to discourage him from ever trying it again.  Here we are, 180 days since the President signed the historic Russia sanctions bill passed by this body by a vote of 97 to 2, and he hasn't even implemented those sanctions. He is supposed to do it today, the day of the State of the  Again, Mr.President, implement the sanctions tonight, or at least tell the American people why you are not, opening an invitation to Russia to do it again.  Why won't Donald Trump use the power given to him by a near-unanimous vote in Congress to hold Russia accountable?  The administration refused to implement secondary sanctions against the Russian defense and intelligence sectors. Last night, the administration released a mandated report of Russian[[Page S560]]oligarchs that seems to match a list already put together by Forbes magazine. This is a reflection of the lack of seriousness with which they took up this task.  When it comes to sanctions, the White House has engaged in a dangerous Kabuki theater that tries to show strength when in fact there is none. These actions are not good enough. They are for show.  Why is the President so afraid to sanction Putin, his associates, or other corrupt Russian actors and officials? Why is President Trump giving Putin a free pass after he attacked our democracy? What is he so afraid of? The American people are asking that question, and they have their answers.  Only a year after a hostile foreign power shook the very bedrock of our democracy, any other President would spend his first State of the Union talking about efforts that were underway to punish the abuser and prevent such an attack from ever recurring. Why not this President?  If President Trump wishes to save his Presidency from the shame of having failed to address one of the gravest threats threatening our country, he will announce this evening in no uncertain terms that he is sanctioning President Any other President would have already made it their priority to take decisive action in their first year, but this President is paralyzed when it comes to Putin and his cronies in  Here are two words the President may not say tonight: ``Russia sanctions''--but he ought to.

1046,topic-id,1191,"Thank you, Mr. Today, we enter the third day of the Trump shutdown, the first ever real shutdown to occur when one party controls the entire legislative process. The Republican Party controls the House, the Senate, the Presidency, and yet they were unable to keep the government open for the American people.  Leader McConnell knows it takes 60 votes to win passage of a spending bill, and yet he moved forward with a last-minute extension that he knew lacked the votes. Both Democrats and Republicans voted against that bill.  The reason the Republican majority had such difficulty finding consensus is they could never get a firm grip on what the President of their party wanted to do. These days you never know whom to deal with when it comes to the The Republican leaders told me to work out a deal with the White The White House said work it out with Republican leaders on the Separately, President Trump turned away from not one but two bipartisan compromises--each would have averted this shutdown, each would have led to a deal on the budget, healthcare, disaster aid, and things like opioids, veterans, pensions, and on immigration.  My recent offer to the President was a generous one. I put his signature campaign issue on the table in exchange for DACA and still he turned away. President Trump's unwillingness to compromise caused the Trump shutdown and brought us to this moment. The facts are well known.  Now I wish to update the Senate on where things stand after this weekend. Since our meeting in the Oval Office on Friday, the President and I have not spoken, and the White House refused to engage in negotiations over the weekend. The great deal-making President sat on the sidelines. Despite and because of this frustration, I have been having conversations with the Republican leader over the weekend about a path forward. After several discussions, offers, and counteroffers, the Republican leader and I have come to an arrangement.  We will vote today to reopen the government, to continue negotiating a global agreement, with the commitment that if an agreement isn't reached by February 8, the Senate will immediately proceed to consideration of legislation dealing with The process will be neutral and fair to all sides. We expect that a bipartisan bill on DACA will receive fair consideration and an up-or-down vote on the floor.  Now, it is a shame the American people and the Senate have had to endure such hand-wringing, finger-pointing stridency to secure a guarantee that we will finally move to address this urgent issue. It is something the majority could have avoided entirely, a concern the President could have obviated if he were only willing to take yes for an answer.  While this procedure will not satisfy everyone on both sides, it is a way forward. I am confident we can get the 60 votes in the Senate for a DACA bill, and now there is a real pathway to get a bill on the floor and through the It is a good solution, and I will vote for it.  I am incredibly grateful to the bipartisan group that has come together in recent days to renew the immigration debate with a sense of urgency. I believe this group has the potential to return the Senate to the kind of place it should be on the issue of immigration, a place for bipartisanship, a place for action, a place for achievement. The bipartisan group, in a very fine way, filled the glaring absence of the President in these talks.  I expect the majority leader to fulfill his commitment to the Senate, to me and to the bipartisan group and abide by this agreement. If he does not, of course--and I expect he will--he will have breached the trust of not only the Democratic Senators but Members of his own party as well.  Through these complicated and lengthy negotiations, Democrats have always sought to be reasonable, to act in good faith, and get something real done. Despite all of our entreaties, the President was obstinate. Despite bipartisan support for DACA, the Republican Party dithered.  The Senate has muddled along for too long, content to delay action on our most pressing challenges until the very last moment. That ends today. The Republican majority now has 17 days to prevent the Dreamers from being deported. We have a way to address the fate of the Dreamers starting right now, instead of waiting until March, with the minority and the moderate middle empowered to bring a bill to the floor instead of being held by the most strident anti-immigration voices in the Republican caucus.  We, on our side of the aisle, will continue to fight as strongly as we can for the Dreamers in the weeks ahead. I say to all Americans: Urge your Senators to vote yes on the bipartisan compromise when it comes forward. Write, tweet, email, phone, visit, do everything you can so we can finally pass this bill.  In a few hours, the government will reopen. We have a lot to do. The issue of the Dreamers demands resolution, a budget must be written, healthcare has to be addressed, relief provided to disaster-stricken parts of our country, pensions, opioids, veterans, and childcare--all have to be taken care of. The Trump shutdown will soon end, but the work must go on, and it will.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The majority leader.  Mr.Mr.President, I thank the Democratic leader for his comments and his indication that he intends to support the measure before us.  I think if we have learned anything during this process, it is that a strategy to shut down the government over the issue of illegal immigration is something the American people didn't understand and would not have understood in the future.

58,topic-id,818,"Madam President, I join my colleagues on the floor today to speak in opposition to the pending legislation to outlaw abortion procedures after 20 weeks.  This is yet another extreme effort to allow the government to interfere in the healthcare decisions that should be strictly between a woman and her family and her physician. This latest attempt is particularly dangerous. It would impose prison sentences of up to 5 years on physicians who don't fulfill the law's deliberately burdensome requirements for documentation and reporting, and it would even impose a prison sentence of up to 5 years on doctors who fail to inform a law enforcement agency about another doctor who fails to meet the law's requirements. Viewed more broadly, this bill is part of a continuing campaign to take away women's constitutional right to privacy--a right that protects profoundly personal decisions concerning our bodies and our families.  I remember very well the days prior to 1973, when abortion was outlawed in most An estimated 1.2 million women each year resorted to illegal abortions, typically performed in unsanitary conditions by unlicensed practitioners and often resulting in infection, hemorrhage, and even death. Well, I think women remember those days, and we are not going back.  As Governor of New Hampshire in 1997, I signed into law a bill that repealed our State's archaic law that dated back to 1848 and made abortion a felony. Like that 1848 law, the legislation now before the Senate would also threaten physicians with criminal charges and imprisonment.  Abortion later in pregnancy is extremely rare. Indeed, almost 99 percent of abortions occur before 21 weeks. When an abortion is needed later in pregnancy, it typically involves very complex, life-threatening, and heartbreaking circumstances--for example, the discovery of a severe and likely fatal abnormality, as described by Senator In these difficult circumstances, a woman consults with her doctor and with other people she trusts. A woman needs the freedom to consider every medical option, including serious risks to her own life.  The extremely narrow exceptions in the bill before us--exceptions if the pregnancy results from rape or incest--are deliberately designed to impose burdens, complications, and shame on women who have chosen to terminate a pregnancy. The victim must provide written verification that she has obtained counseling or medical treatment from a very specific list of ``medical providers'' who do not provide abortions and who are often strongly anti-abortion. This requirement is a completely unnecessary burden on a woman who is already dealing with a crisis. It is also insulting and condescending to all women. We are not children who need guidance from an adult. We can consult those we choose to consult, and we can make our own decisions. To impose this requirement in this crude manner is something right out of a handmaid's tale.  Then, if the rape victim is a minor, she is allowed access to an abortion only if she can provide proof that she reported the crime to law enforcement. Again, this is completely out of touch with the real world. Only a small percentage of sexual assaults and rapes are reported to police. Nearly 80 percent of rape and sexual assault victims know their offender.  So let's say this plainly. The reporting requirements in this bill are an outrageous attempt to judge and shame women and girls who have been victims of a violent crime.  I heard from Rachel, who is a registered, board-certified nurse in New She told me that bills to impose blanket rules and arbitrary limitations--bills like the one before the Senate today--are out of touch with the reality she sees in her practice every day. Rachel said:       While procedures at 20 weeks and beyond certainly comprised      a small portion of the[[Page S536]]     care we provided, it was absolutely critical for those that      needed it. Many pregnancies are not surveyed with ultrasound      until 19-20 weeks, at which time previously unforeseen      complications can be detected. Then, there are often further      procedures needed to finalize a diagnosis and a prognosis.      For people who receive devastating news about a pregnancy      after 20 weeks, abortion may be the best option, and they      deserve access to that care.  The American Medical Association opposes this bill. The AMA says: We ``strongly condemn any interference by the government or other third parties that causes a physician to compromise his or her medical judgment as to what information or treatment is in the best interest of the patient.''  I urge my colleagues to respect the women of this country and their right to make their own healthcare decisions without the unwelcome involvement of politicians and law enforcement agencies. Let's reject this partisan, extreme, and, frankly, unnecessary legislation today. Then, let's focus our bipartisan attention on the urgent business of passing a budget, funding our military, combating the opioid crisis, and the other needs that this country faces.

490,topic-id,457,"Mr.President, I have come to the floor to pay tribute to George Twigg III, a long-time Granite Stater and former New Hampshire State representative, who passed away last month at the age of 85. Though he was raised in Massachusetts and retired to Maine, George was in many ways a quintessential Granite Stater, with a big personality, a great sense of humor, and a lifetime passion for politics and public engagement.  After graduating from Boston University, he served 2 years in the U.Navy and later worked as a marketing representative for General Electric and other Fortune 500 companies. In 1968, he left his corporate career behind and moved to Gilmanton, NH, where he became a proud jack-of-many-trades, working in real estate sales, auctioneering, and appraising. George also worked as a justice of the peace, officiating at hundreds of weddings. He once married the same couple twice, though he felt obliged to warn them that, if they divorced again and later decided to marry for a third time, they would have to find someone else to officiate at the wedding.  Throughout his adult life, George was active in politics and public service and gave generously of his time as a volunteer in many different capacities. A lifelong Republican, he shared many Granite Staters' fiscal conservatism and distaste for taxes. Indeed, in one campaign for election to the New Hampshire House of Representatives, he crisscrossed his district in a snowplow painted with the message ``No Tax Snow Jobs.'' While always true to his conservative convictions, George was a practitioner of the New Hampshire way in politics, always ready to reach across the aisle in order to advance the best interests of our In 1974, then-Governor Meldrim Thomson asked him to chair New Hampshire's eminent domain commission. He went on to serve 21 years on the board of tax and land appeals.  George was a man of exceptional generosity. In 2014, he sold more than 85 acres of scenic land in Gilmanton at a price below fair-market value on the condition that it be preserved as open space for future generations to enjoy. He was equally generous in giving his time and talents to a wide range of volunteer activities. For decades, he refereed high school and college basketball games. He served on numerous town and county committees and volunteered his considerable skills as an auctioneer for countless charity auctions, including fundraisers for New Hampshire's public television station.  The Granite State, and the Gilmanton community in particular, are grateful for his many gifts and acts of selfless service. Family and friends hope to gather for a memorial service later this year. I will be with them in spirit as they celebrate the life of this good and generous man.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-29-pt1-PgS549.txt,1901,UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--READING OF WASHINGTON'S FAREWELL ADDRESS,2018.0,29.0,January
664,topic-id,920,"Mr.President, like I assume most of the rest of the Members of the Senate, I am very disappointed that today we have not reached a bipartisan agreement to reopen the government.  I think it is important to note that there is a lot of shared frustration on both sides of the aisle about how we got here. Leader McConnell, Senator Graham, and other Republicans have expressed their exasperation at the fact that for weeks President Trump hasn't stuck to a position for longer than a couple of hours and that he has derailed several proposals which would have addressed the concerns that have been expressed by Democrats in this body about how to move forward to keep the government open.  Thankfully, there is also a lot of bipartisan consensus in the Senate that we need to work together to fix our situation, to get the government up and running again, and to address some of the long-term challenges that have led to this moment.  However, in order to do this, we need the President and we need Republican leadership to provide some leadership so we can move forward. I am committed to negotiations that will allow us to address certain key issues: first and foremost, I believe, is a long-term budget agreement that will go through the remainder of this fiscal year. That will put our defense on solid footing, yet not shortchange our domestic needs. Congress has to set aside the short-term funding bills--this is the fourth one in just the last 3\1/2\ months, since the beginning of this fiscal year--because these bills inflict real damage on our domestic needs and also on our Armed  We also need the necessary Federal resources to help communities and first responders across the country effectively combat the national opioid epidemic. We need long-term funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program, for community health centers, and for other health issues we are facing.  I have rural hospitals in New Hampshire that if they don't get the disproportionate share payments, they could be in real financial trouble. We need to address these challenges that are facing States across the country.  We also need a solution that will give Dreamers the path to citizenship they deserve so they can live and work without fear of deportation. A bipartisan deal that will provide long-term budget certainty is absolutely critical for our national security.  It can't be overstated how much damage continued short-term funding causes our military. We have been repeatedly warned by the Pentagon of the damaging impacts of budget uncertainty. We heard from Secretary In just the last couple of weeks, he came to the Democratic and Republican Caucuses and said: Please don't give us another continuing resolution.  Army Chief of Staff GEN Mark Milley has cautioned that the Army's combat readiness is significantly hampered as training cycles are disrupted and sometimes completely discontinued. Just recently--in fact, on Friday, I believe--the Pentagon's spokeswoman echoed the sentiment, saying that operating under years of continuing resolutions is ``wasteful and destructive'' and that what is needed is a ``fully funded'' budget.  When we had our first Navy caucus--I know the Presiding Officer can identify with this because we met with Admiral Richardson, and Admiral Richardson said: We tell everybody in the Navy not to count on doing anything in the first quarter of a fiscal year because we have been operating under continuing resolutions for so long.  As we continue working toward a bipartisan compromise, it is critically important that we ensure our military servicemembers, as well as Department of Defense civilians and contractors who support them, receive the pay they have earned.  I was disappointed when Senator Kaine and Senator Duckworth made that unanimous consent request, and when Senator McCaskill made it on Friday night, that it was objected to. The fact is, there is an effort to get this done by unanimous consent, running what is called the hotline on both sides of the aisle, and the majority is objecting to allowing us to go ahead and make the commitment that we are going to pay our men and women of the military and their civilian support.  Our men and women in uniform, as well as Department of Defense civilians, work tirelessly to protect our national security, and they and their families should not have to worry about whether they are going to receive a paycheck. We urgently need to pass the Pay Our Military Act legislation. This is legislation that will allow our men and women in uniform to focus on their critical missions across the globe that are paramount to protecting this They need the peace of mind to know they will be compensated. I believe that is what everybody in this Chamber thinks we should do.  Importantly, that legislation would ensure that death benefits will be funded should a servicemember be killed overseas. Again, I think this is something that all of us agree needs to happen and that we can agree it should happen now because whether you are stationed in Afghanistan, on the Korean Peninsula, or deterring Russian aggression in Eastern Europe, our servicemembers should not have to worry about whether they will be able to provide for their families and loved ones back home.  We passed similar legislation in 2013 during the last government shutdown, and I urge swift passage of this important legislation again so our men and women in the military can continue to protect our country without worry.

929,topic-id,1113,"Mr.President, I join my colleagues on the floor to speak in opposition to the nomination of Alex Azar to head the Department of Health and Human  I believe Mr.Azar is, first and foremost, a product of the pharmaceutical industry, with a long, consistent track record of sharply increasing drug prices during his tenure at Lilly  Furthermore, his nomination makes clear that President Trump did not mean it when he said repeatedly during the campaign that pharmaceutical companies are ``getting away with murder'' and that he as President would dramatically reduce drug prices for seniors and all Mr.Azar's nomination is yet one more example of the Trump administration putting special interests above the public interest and public safety.  Mr.Azar has long opposed any Federal intervention in prescription drug pricing, things like allowing Medicare to negotiate for drug prices. Of course, his former company has profited handsomely from the government's hands-off approach. When Mr.Azar became the president of Lilly USA, he also became the chair of its pricing committee and had a major say in price increases for all domestically sold Lilly drugs from 2012 to 2014. During that time, the list and net prices of Lilly's drugs that were sold in the United States increased by double-digit percentages each year.  As cochair of the Senate's Diabetes Caucus, I am especially troubled that during Mr.Azar's time with the company, Lilly more than tripled the price of insulin--jacking up the price from $74 to $269. Much of that increase occurred during Mr.Azar's years as chair of the pricing committee. These price increases are not only exorbitant but have caused real hardship to many of the nearly 30 million Americans who live with diabetes. As Candidate Trump would have put it, Lilly, under Mr.Azar's leadership, was ``getting away with murder.''  I am also concerned that Mr.Azar will continue and even ramp up the Trump administration's across-the-board campaign to sabotage our healthcare system. We are now 1 year into this administration's efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Regrettably, it is working. The uninsured rate rose in 2017 by 1.3 percentage points. That was nearly 3.2 million more people who were without health insurance.  Already, the administration has eliminated those payments that allow insurance companies to keep down premiums and reduce copays and deductibles, and that has created further hardship on people who desperately need health insurance. Without reason or justification, the administration cut the open enrollment period by half. It slashed the budget for open enrollment ads on TV, radio, and the internet by 90 percent, which shut down most efforts to inform consumers about their enrollment options.  Despite these efforts, they were not successful in dramatically reducing the number of people who tried to enroll in the Affordable Care Act because enrollment for 2018 was 8.8 million people compared to 9.2 million the year before. It shows how desperately people want to have health insurance. Of course, we know that since that enrollment period, the Republican leaders in Congress have used the tax bill to repeal the individual mandate. Meanwhile, in an interview, Mr.Azar spoke of his desire to ``hasten [the Affordable Care Act's] demise.'' Apparently, he doesn't appreciate that the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansion, in particular, have been absolutely critical tools in the fight against the opioid epidemic.  I urge Mr.Azar and President Trump to read the front page story in Sunday's New York The story is about the devastating consequences of the opioid epidemic in my State of New The article is titled ``How a `Perfect Storm' in New Hampshire Has Fueled an Opioid Crisis.'' It was accompanied by an even more compelling article, titled ``1 Son, 4 Overdoses, 6 Hours,'' which profiles the life of Patrick Griffin of Pembroke, In shocking detail, the article documents how Mr.Griffin, who has struggled for years with a substance misuse disorder, overdosed four times within a 6-hour period. Twice within those 6 hours, emergency medical responders came to his house and revived him with Narcan, the antidote that reverses opioid overdoses.  In reading that article, some people will ask: Why can't he just control his substance use disorder? They don't understand this is a disease, that it changes people's brain makeups--the chemistry of an individual's brain. Just like heart disease or diabetes or any other chronic illness, there is a physiology that is involved with that that affects a person's ability to get better.  One of the things that saves people like Patrick when one is overdosing is the drug Narcan, or naloxone, which is the official name. It has been used so much in New Hampshire that most people refer to it as We have seen that the pharmaceutical industry has dramatically increased the price of Narcan as this epidemic has spread.  The price of the drug that is needed by so many to save their lives has increased dramatically. A two-dose package of Narcan, manufactured by Evzio, cost $690 in 2014. It is $4,500 today. Generic doses of Narcan have increased between 95 and 129 percent since 2012. Bear in mind, it often takes multiple doses to revive people who have overdosed, so this has an impact on our healthcare system. In New Hampshire, it has had an impact on families, on municipalities, on first responders--all of those people who are trying to save people who have overdosed.[[Page S485]]  As we all know, the opioid epidemic is a nationwide crisis, with some 63,000 Americans having been killed by drug overdoses in 2016. New Hampshire has been especially hard hit. The demise of the Affordable Care Act, which Mr.Azar says he wants, would mean that thousands of Granite Staters would lose access to treatment, with there being devastating consequences. That is true not just in New Hampshire but in States across this country. I think it is unconscionable that a Secretary of Health and Human Services would take away one of our most valuable tools for combating substance use disorders and that he would actively oppose access to healthcare for millions of  For me, between Mr.Azar's coziness with the pharmaceutical industry and his disdain for the Affordable Care Act, which is the law of the land and which Mr.Azar would be charged with administering as Secretary, I think he is the wrong person to serve in the critically important post of Secretary of Health and Human I intend to vote against his confirmation, and I hope my colleagues will do the same.

More than 50 years ago, as a young officer in the U.Air Force, Smith was the on-call explosive ordnance disposal, EOD, technician at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in Goldsboro, Nothing out of the ordinary had occurred throughout his shift on the evening of January 23, 1961, when the 24-year-old Smith received an alarming phone call. He was informed that two Mark 39 hydrogen bombs had broken loose from a B-52 bomber and landed in a field just outside of He was told the general location of the bombs, but other details were unknown.  Upon arriving to the crash site, Smith and other EOD technicians found that one bomb had crashed at such a speed that it was buried underground, but the other was visible and appeared to be intact. Although the protocol was to alert the Atomic Energy Commission before inspecting the bomb, Smith's instinct was to act quickly. Ralph Lapp, a physicist involved in developing America's first nuclear bombs as part of the Manhattan Project, stated in his review of the Goldsboro incident that ``one simple, dynamo-technology low voltage switch stood between the United States and a major catastrophe.''  Smith graduated from the U.Navy's EOD school just 9 months prior to the incident. However, his training, combined with his immense bravery, allowed him and other EOD technicians to successfully disarm the bomb over several days of harrowing work. Experts estimate that, if detonated, the bombs were powerful enough to destroy everything within an 8.5 mile radius. When asked in a recent interview why the bomb did not go off, Smith replied, ``the Lord Jesus Christ only knows.''  Such incidents prove that the security we enjoy every day as Americans is because of courageous individuals like Earl Smith's willingness to risk his life, along with his ability to maintain the secrecy of this formerly classified event for half a century, serve as distinct and sobering reminders that there are American men and women serving tirelessly throughout the world to maintain the way of life we hold dear.

Mr.Speaker, one in five American seniors will be a target of financial abuse, and seniors lose an estimated $2.9 billion to exploitation. The financial institutions that serve America's seniors are in a unique position to detect and identify the suspicious patterns of activity that often accompany financial abuse.

877,topic-id,390,"Mr.Speaker, today I join my colleagues in calling attention to an attack on one of our most basic fundamental rights as American citizens--the right to organize in our workplace.  The impending Supreme Court case, Janus v. AFSCME, is nothing more than a continued attack by corporate CEOs on American workers' right to unite and advocate for fair labor standards. This critical right offers working people the opportunity to get ahead through bargaining with their employers for better wages, benefits, and working conditions.  Wherever you work, if you appreciate a 40 hour work week, sick leave and vacation days, guaranteed safe working conditions, then you have unions to thank. And the outcome of this Supreme Court case will impact you. It was not a benevolent employer who brought fair labor standards to the American workforce; it was American workers. And an attack on the ability to organize in the workplace is an attack on all of them.  Since the inception of labor unions, American workers--both unionized and non-unionized--have enjoyed substantial gains in wages, safety, and stability. In fact, throughout the 20th Century, the growth of unions gave rise to the creation of the great American middle-class, who has contributed immensely to our great nation. Over the years, however, a change in global economy, unfair trade agreements, and a deliberate effort to weaken unions have made life much harder for the middle class. In fact, for far too many middle-class families, the American dream has sadly now become nothing more than a memory of time passed.  This decimation of the middle class coincides with the Majority's relentless attacks on labor unions. The Majority has pushed right-to-work legislation, tried to weaken enforcement of workers' collective rights, and has even tried to repeal prevailing wage laws. They are working hand-in-glove with the Trump administration, which supports a national right-to-work bill. We are seeing many dangerous attacks on the state level, too.  I continue to fight against these attacks on our workers. All the while, I will also keep fighting to overhaul NAFTA, which has caused my district to lose half of its manufacturing jobs. In holding our trading partners to a higher standard, it is critical that we practice what we preach.

509,topic-id,491,"Mr.President, I would like to celebrate Vice President Walter Mondale, who recently marked his 90th birthday. When Vice President Mondale was asked about the legacy of the Carter administration, he responded this way: ``We told the truth, we obeyed the law and we kept the peace--and that's not bad.'' Not only was that description apt and characteristically humble, I submit that it captures Walter Mondale's values and virtues.  First, Walter Mondale tells the truth. And aren't we so sorely in need of this today? Sometimes, when Mr.Mondale told the truth, it was painful. And sometimes, when he told the truth, he paid a political price. But truth in public service is a luminous thing, and Walter Mondale has always shone brightly.  Honesty was taught early by his parents, Theodore, a Methodist minister, and Claribel, a music teacher. An old friend of Mondale's once observed that he would often ask, ``I wonder what my mother's going to think about that?'' Well, his mother did not see her son become Vice President and ambassador, and Reverend Mondale did not see him become attorney general and Senator, but I suspect, he thinks about them still.  Second, Walter Mondale respects the rule of law and lives the rule of law. And aren't we so sorely in need of this today?  Not surprisingly, one of Fritz and Joan Mondale's favorite movies was ``A Man for All Seasons,'' in which Sir Thomas More famously observes that, when the last law is down and the Devil turns on you, there is no place to hide. In other words, the rule of law protects all of us.  You might say, well, respect for the law is just the baseline we might expect of the most famous graduate of the University of Minnesota's law school--now Mondale Hall--who went on to become the State's chief lawyer; yet we have seen that even prominent public officials, trained in the law, can cut corners when tempted by money or power.  Walter Mondale has never cut corners. In both his private life and his public life, this is a man who has always turned square corners.  Finally, Walter Mondale works for peace. And aren't we so sorely in need of this today?  We know of the Vice President's important role in the Camp David Peace Accords and the Egypt-Israel Peace We know of his role as ambassador to one of our most important allies. But when we think of Walter Mondale and peace, we must think also of his goal of community reconciliation through civil rights. As the lead author of the Fair Housing Act, for more than half a century, he has fought for equity and fairness.  Yes, Walter Mondale tells the truth, obeys the law, and works for peace. That, I would suggest, is not just ``not bad''; it is wonderful and extraordinary.  As I recognize Vice President Mondale and his contributions to this country, I wish him a happy birthday.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-01-23-pt1-PgS464-3.txt,2191,2015,2018.0,23.0,January
222,topic-id,2367,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak about why I, too, will be opposing Alex Azar to be the Secretary of Health and Human  I appreciate, as always, my great friend from Massachusetts and her advocacy for the people of her State and all of the country.  Perhaps more than any other agency, the Department of Health and Human Services touches the lives of people in Michigan and across the country every single day. It provides families access to Head Start and other early childhood education programs that help our youngest learners get off to a strong start. It helps ensure that families have health insurance, whether through Medicare, Medicaid, children's health insurance, or private insurance. It administers the Food and Drug Administration, which makes sure that medications are safe and effective. It works to ensure that health insurance and prescription drugs are affordable because the best medication and health coverage in the world will not help anyone if they can't afford them.  In short, this position is all about people. I expect our next Secretary of Health and Human Services to, above all, put people before politics or profits. Unfortunately, I do not have confidence that Mr.Azar will do that.  Some of my biggest concerns come in the area of prescription drugs prices--an issue that is extremely important in I have spent a tremendous amount of time focused on that over the years, on what needs to happen. Bringing down costs for families is a very, very critical issue for so many, if not every family in Far too many of our families are struggling to keep up with the rising cost of prescription drugs.  Take Patricia, who is 73 years old and a retired nurse. Patricia's doctor prescribed Humira for her severe rheumatoid arthritis. When she called the pharmacy, she learned the prescription would cost $1,405. Patricia told me:       There is absolutely no way I can afford this amount on a      monthly basis. Someone somewhere is getting extremely wealthy      off of seniors. These companies should be called to task for      their greed.  I agree with  We know that Patricia is not alone in her struggling to afford her medication. Between 2008 and 2016, prices on the most popular brand name drugs rose over 208 percent--more than double in the United  I can tell you that the average Michigan family's income didn't double during that same time. These outrageous price increases force people in Michigan and across the country to do things we have heard so much about--split pills in half, skip doses, and even go bankrupt--just to stay on the medications they need to stay healthy or to even stay alive. These folks are spending money on prescriptions that they could be using to save for their retirements or to pay for college for their kids. That is wrong, and it needs to change.  I don't believe that Mr.Azar--a long-time pharmaceutical company executive with a track record of dramatically increasing drug prices--is the person who can make that change.  Here is an example: insulin. People who have diabetes, as we know, need it to stay alive--children, adults, seniors. Yet staying alive has become increasingly unaffordable, in part, thanks to Mr.Azar, the former president of Eli Lilly The price of one vile of Eli Lilly's Humalog increased from $21 in 1996 to $123, when Mr.Azar became its President, to $255 in 2017, when Mr.Azar left. As we know, people need more than one vile.  Mr.Azar says he agrees that prices are too high, but he does not seem ready or willing to do much about it. I want to know, if he thought they were too high, why he didn't lower them rather than raise them when he was in his position as president of Eli Lilly I told him that the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine at our Finance hearing recommended allowing HHS to negotiate prices. He said they were wrong, that the Federal Government shouldn't negotiate prices for people to get the best deal. Common sense tells us that that is what should be happening and should have been happening for years.  Mr.Azar also opposes the importation of safe and affordable prescription drugs from That is despite the fact that his former company, Eli Lilly, sells the identical insulin product in Canada and around the world for less than it sells it for here.  Now, let's get this picture. One can go across a bridge from Detroit, into Windsor, which is 5 minutes, 10 minutes across the bridge, and dramatically drop the cost of one's insulin from the same company. Eli Lilly and other drug companies argue that the problem is it is not safe. So are they saying that Eli Lilly's insulin on one side of the bridge, in Windsor, is not safe to take across to the other side of the bridge? We open our bridges, and we export and import every single day most everything but prescription drugs. Why does Mr.Azar think people in Michigan should pay more for a decades-old drug than the people who are just a few miles away in Canada?  By the way, insulin has been around for--what?--I don't know--100 years or something. I mean, at some point, you recoup your costs, but this particular brand of insulin is sold on one side of the bridge in one country, in Canada, for less than it sells it on the other side. People in Michigan need to know why they think that makes any sense. It sure doesn't make any sense to me, and it sure doesn't make any sense to Steven from Michigan.[[Page S462]]  Steven is a 47-year-old veteran from Swartz Creek, who has type 2 diabetes. His doctor prescribed an Eli Lilly medication called Glyxambi, which has worked really well to control his blood sugar, but he cannot afford it. The medication costs more than $2,000 for a 90-day supply, and there is no generic equivalent. I wonder what it costs in  In Steven's words:       The drug companies are holding us hostage! I now see why      some seniors cut their meds in half. Something has to be      done.  I couldn't agree more. Something has to be done, as Steven has said. Unfortunately, I don't believe that Mr.Azar will do it.  Drug prices aren't the only issue that concern me about this nomination. Last week, we learned that 3.2 million more Americans were uninsured at the end of last year, in December, than at the end of the year before. There were 3.2 million more people who didn't have insurance. It was the largest single year drop in the number of people who have insurance. It was the highest increase since 2008 of those who don't have insurance. This was a huge step backward from just a year earlier when the United States hit an all-time low of 10.9 percent of the number of people who didn't have insurance. Recently, we saw the passage of a tax bill that, among other things, will leave 13 million more Americans uninsured and will drive up the premiums--even higher--by double digits.  They are not done yet.  Right now, the HHS and the Trump administration are considering rules that would expand the availability of insurance plans that don't cover essential health benefits. At another time, they were called junk plans. I can remember before we put in place the requirement for basic health benefits to be covered that someone would call me and say: I have had insurance for years and have never needed it. I got sick and discovered--oh, my gosh--it would only cover 1 day in the hospital. I didn't know. Those are called junk plans. You think you are OK until you actually need medical care, until you actually need coverage. Then you find out you were paying for something that was just a bunch of junk.  We now have in place consumer protections. We have in place consumer requirements that are called essential benefits. Why? Because they are essential. Emergency room coverage is pretty essential as well as hospitalization. Everybody assumes, if one has insurance, one is covered in the hospital for the amount of time one needs to be in the hospital. Mental health and substance abuse treatment, prescription drugs, and maternity care are basic things that every person may need in one's lifetime as it relates to one's health.  When I asked Mr.Azar if he believed plans should have to cover essential health benefits, he avoided really answering the question. He said that he would ``work to ensure the least disruptive approach to implementing these policies and to appropriately consider the concerns expressed by stakeholders''--called people who need healthcare--``during the rulemaking process.'' We don't need the least disruptive approach to implement bad rules. Instead, we need an approach that doesn't disrupt people's healthcare. This is a matter of life and death every day for someone in Michigan and across the country.  I also asked Mr.Azar whether he believes that all health plans should be required to cover maternity care and newborn care at no additional cost. It is pretty basic. If you are a woman, it is pretty basic in terms of coverage. Once again, he ducked, saying, ``It is critical that every woman have access to high-quality prenatal care.'' We know what that means because, before the Affordable Care Act, only 12 percent of the plans in the individual market covered maternity and newborn care.  You find yourself in a situation as a young woman--a very common situation that will happen--where you are newly married and struggling to get started. You don't plan to get sick, and you are not planning to have a baby, so you get the skimpiest health plan that you can have that you think will kind of cover you. Then something happens. Fifty percent of the time, we know that in young couples, there are unexpected pregnancies. Then whoops. It is prior to the Affordable Care Oh, now you have a preexisting condition. You are going to have to pay more if you can get coverage at all.  I cannot tell you how many times I have heard that from women I know, from people I represent in It is pretty basic for women that maternity care and newborn care should be covered, and it is now without extra cost because it is basic care for women. Yet we have an HHS nominee who is not willing to say: Yes, maternity care is basic for women, and women shouldn't have to pay more to get basic healthcare, like maternity care and newborn care.  Let me speak about another issue. If confirmed, Mr.Azar would also be in charge of Medicare and Medicaid, which raises additional concerns for me about the people whom I represent.  Thanks to Michigan's Medicaid expansion--a bipartisan effort in Michigan--660,000 more people have insurance, and uncompensated care has been cut by 50 percent--cut in half--which means 50 percent more of the people who walk into the emergency room can actually pay for the care they are getting. It is not rolled over onto everybody else. It used to be, if somebody could not pay, everybody else would see his insurance rate go up, and taxpayers would pay more. Those costs have gone down 50 percent, and 30,000 jobs have been created as part of that process. Projections show that last year, the State of Michigan ended up saving money for the taxpayers; $432 million was saved because more people had insurance and could pay for the medical care they were getting. I thought that was what we wanted--for people to be able to pay for their medical care.  Despite the President's promise not to cut Medicaid, every Republican health proposal that came before Congress last year had one thing in common--huge cuts to Then-Secretary Price pushed for the passage of these bills, and during that time, Mr.Azar said he supported those bills to gut In fact, the current budget resolution that we are under, which was passed by this Senate, has $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts, as well as almost one-half trillion dollars in Medicare cuts. It has not yet taken effect because they have to take another step to actually pass the bills in the Senate, but it is ready to go. It is in the budget resolution.  Mr.Azar said he supported the bills, and it would put Medicaid on a more sustainable footing. Three out of five seniors in Michigan who are in nursing homes get their nursing home care through Medicaid health insurance--three out of five seniors. A more sustainable footing? Not for them and not for their families. I will tell you what is not sustainable--Michigan families trying to survive without health coverage, the medical care that they need.  In conclusion, the people in Michigan know what the next Secretary of Health and Human Services needs to do. It is a pretty big job that affects part of everyone's life in some way.  That person needs to, among other things, bring down the cost of prescription drugs immediately through the power of negotiation. He needs to take the shackles off in terms of exporting and importing prescription drugs. Just like any other product, we ought to have safe importation and competition across the border to bring down prices. We ought to have increased transparency, not the nominee's history of raising prices over and over. That person needs to protect and strengthen Medicaid and Medicare, not cut benefits, and that person needs to enforce patient protections, like the essential health benefits, like the ability for a woman to know that her basic healthcare--and, if she has a baby, prenatal care or postnatal care--will be covered without her having to pay more because she is a woman. That is what should be happening--patient protections. We do not need someone who thinks it is OK to go backward and erode them.  That is why I am voting no on Mr.Azar's confirmation. I hope my colleagues will take a serious look and do the same. The health of the people of Michigan and the people of this country depends on it.  I thank the Presiding  I yield the floor.

Think about that. One team dominated the U.Cross Country Championships this year.  They train year-round. In the summer, the ski team trains on Eagle Glacier, accessible by a 10-minute helicopter ride from Girdwood, As the Anchorage Daily News put it, this unique training area has ``been a springboard to APU's international and domestic success [and dominance]. Flora and his staff have groomed serpentined, undulating trails there that mimic [international] courses'' on a glacier in Alaska in the summer. That is great training. It is year-round.  In addition to training and coaching these world-class athletes, the APU Nordic Ski Center also has a popular junior program, which helps develop the next generation of Olympic skiers.  I have had the honor to get to know some of these skiers, these wonderful athletes, over the past few years. They certainly would make Alaskans proud, but I think they would make all Americans proud. They are great young men and women who are dedicated, disciplined, humble, hard-working, and very smart. They are students; they are very, very good students. I even had the opportunity to go and train with them occasionally. I am more of a downhill skier than a cross-country skier. I went with them in the fall, when there wasn't any snow on the ground, to do some mountain interval training, running with them up and down the mountains. To witness and train with these world-class athletes was an amazing experience. I must admit, it was a difficult experience for me. I think I was smoked after about 10 minutes with them, and they had about a 2-hour workout session on the mountain. It gave me a sense of how hard they work and what dedicated, world-class athletes we have in my hometown.  Next month, several of these APU skiers will travel to Korea to represent the United States of America at the Winter Olympics, the way they have in previous They are top skiers for Let me name a few.  First and I would say foremost, Kikkan Randall, America's most decorated cross-country skier in U.history and an Alaskan icon--she will participate in her fifth Winter Let me say that again. She will participate in her fifth Winter That is an incredible record for any American athlete, winter or summer games. She is also a wonderful person. She is very, very community-oriented. Alongside her will be APU teammates Sadie and Erik Bjornsen--they are brother and sister--Rosie Brennan, and maybe, hopefully, even a few more. Additionally, their APU teammate Jess Yeaton, who was born in Australia but grew up in Alaska, will ski for the Australian cross-country ski team. You are getting the picture. This is a group of people who are going to do very, very well in the Olympics and are going to represent our country and other countries proudly.  Cross-country skiing is woven into the fabric of Alaska's winter community. It brings people together, and it helps build community. So many of our skiers, including and especially the APU team, are also generous and kind in helping others learn how to ski and graciously host skiers from all across the country, as was on full display during the recent U.Cross Country  On behalf of all Alaskans--really, on behalf of all U.Senators--I wish the team good luck in We will be watching.

632,topic-id,1315,"Mr.President, as you can see here, a lot of the Senators are coming down to talk about the government shutdown. We are in a completely avoidable shutdown. There are a lot of speeches, but I think it is important to be clear on one fact. The position of the Democratic leadership on Friday night was this: Unless you agree with our demands on the DACA issue by midnight, we will shut down the Federal I don't think anybody disagrees that is what the position was Friday night. The irony, of course, is there wasn't even a bill to agree on, but that still was their position. The decision was in their hands and they made it and here we are. This was completely avoidable, and we need to get this government of ours up and running again.  I have been coming to the floor for the last few days--on the eve of the shutdown and each day during the shutdown--to emphasize one point; that the American people need to be skeptical. They need to be very skeptical as the Members of the Senate Democratic leadership and some of their colleagues trot out newly polished talking points emphasizing their concern for the military readiness, rebuilding our forces, and more spending on defense.  You might be hearing this. As a matter of fact, I have heard that argument from the leadership on the other side more in the last 3 days than I have heard in the last 3 years as a Senator in this body. Even the junior Senator from Vermont this morning on CNN was talking about the importance of rebuilding our military. That is new. So you are seeing these new talking points.  I respect and get along well with all these Senators, the Democratic leader, Democratic whip, the junior Senator from Vermont I just mentioned, and the Senator from Wisconsin was just on the floor talking about--again, a big emphasis on the Democratic side on the military. I have respect for them. I know they are all patriotic, and they all love their country, but one thing I think is pretty clear--at least in my 3 years in the Senate--this has not been their area of focus. It hasn't been. Go look at the speeches. There has not been the focus on fully funding and rebuilding our military. That is not where the Democratic leadership has been, but it seems to be now with these new points.  Of course, I welcome this. I welcome this change of heart. I welcome this new emphasis on fully rebuilding our military forces. In fact, there are many of us in the Senate who serve on the Armed Services Committee, like the Presiding Officer, led by Senator We have been focusing on this issue for years. There are a lot of Republicans and some I mentioned a few on the floor the other day. This is an issue we have been focusing on literally daily because it is a huge problem right now in the country. It is enormously important for my State, the great State of Whether it is our Active-Duty Forces or Reserve Forces, we have thousands not only serving in the military now but who have served. We have more vets per capita than any State in the country and thousands of civilians and family members who support them.  These issues of military funding and rebuilding our military are really important to a lot of us. I welcome the Democratic leadership's new focus in the past 72 hours on military readiness, supporting our troops, and rebuilding our forces. But I will admit this--I am skeptical. I am very skeptical.  The American people watching this debate at home or in the Gallery should be skeptical too. You should be skeptical when the junior Senator from Vermont goes on CNN and talks about being strong on military funding. You should be a little bit skeptical.  Why? What is really going on here? Why is there all this new talk from the Democratic leadership about how important fully funding our troops is? Why weren't they talking about this last year or the year before?  I think they might be overcompensating. I think they might be worried. I think they might be feeling a bit defensive. I think they might be trying to preempt arguments that their policies of late have actually been harmful to the military and our troops and their families. The truth is, their policies of late have been harmful to our military forces and our readiness.  Here are a few important points. From 2010 to 2016--the second term of the Obama administration--the Department of Defense budget declined by 25 percent. That is not a focus on the buildup of military; that is for sure.  There were also dramatic troop cuts. As a matter of fact, when I first started in this body in 2015, the Obama administration announced that they were cutting 40,000 Active Duty Army[[Page S405]]troops; 5,000 were focused on Because of this, we have seen readiness in our Armed Forces plummet.  Here are just a few disturbing facts and a few disturbing trends. At least one-third of Marine aviation isn't flying right now. We have had numerous mishaps that have killed marines because of aviation accidents. Only 5 out of 58 Army brigade combat teams are fully ready. We have the smallest Air Force in U.history. We have a pilot shortage--really, a crisis--in the Air Force and the Navy with regard to being able to recruit pilots. Training hours for our pilots each month have been cut in half. There are reports right now that Chinese and Russian pilots are getting much more monthly training than our forces. We have had naval mishaps at sea that have killed several sailors in the prime of their lives--the best and the brightest of our country.  We all recognize that there is a big problem. As we were cutting forces and cutting spending for the last several years, the national security threats to our country were dramatically increasing. We are cutting forces, we are cutting spending, and ISIS is rising. North Korea is becoming an enormous and immediate threat, as are Iran, China, and  The world isn't any safer, yet we have been cutting our military forces and the funding for our troops. That is why there is starting to be a change right now. We passed the National Defense Authorization Act with a dramatic authorization for an increase in military spending, but it is still not appropriated.  When it comes to the Democratic leadership's new talking points, actions speak louder than words. The new talking points don't mean much in the face of actions that have actually undermined our military.  Let me provide a few examples. In the past 3 years, every Defense appropriations bill that has passed out of the Appropriations Committee has been filibustered by the Democratic side. Let me say that again. Every single time we have brought a bill, usually a very bipartisan bill, out of the Appropriations Committee for the funding for our troops, it gets filibustered by the Democratic side. That is not supporting our military.  A number of us have come down and talked about this. We have encouraged our colleagues: Don't support the filibuster. We have asked: Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this?  We all know that our forces have been cut too dramatically. The national security challenges have increased, yet every single time we bring a bill out of the Appropriations Committee to fund our troops, the other side filibusters that bill.  If most people back home knew that, whether you are a Democrat or Republican, it doesn't matter what State you live in--if you knew that was what was going on here on the Senate floor, you probably wouldn't be happy. But that has happened. That still happens every time.  ",CREC-2018-01-21-pt1-PgS397-3.txt,2290,FEDERAL REGISTER PRINTING SAVINGS ACT OF 2017,2018.0,21.0,January
633,topic-id,1222,"No, I will not yield. I will finish, and the Senator can respond to this later.  Hopefully my colleague from Hawaii hasn't been one of those who have been filibustering spending for our troops, but it has happened. In the summer of 2015, it happened five times in a row.  Next--right now we are having these discussions on the appropriate level of defense spending, but the other side is saying: No, there has to be parity, with ``parity'' meaning that if we increase defense spending, which people are now saying we need to do--and we do--we have to correspondingly increase domestic spending.  Well, again, the vast majority of Americans don't agree with that position. That is not a position that is showing strong support for our military, yet that is the position right now. That is one of the reasons we have had difficulty coming to a final topline number.  In other words, if you want to increase the budget for the Marines, you need to increase the budget for the EPA or another domestic agency. Well, that is not showing this newfound emphasis and importance with regard to the military.  Let me provide just one last point. This government shutdown--we all know that really hurts our troops. We all know that really hurts training. We all know that really hurts planning. Right now, if you are a lance corporal in the Marine Corps fighting in Iraq or somewhere else around the world for our national security, you have just been told that you are not getting paid. Right now, the families of survivors for the military--meaning that your husband, your wife, or your dad was killed in action--get survivors benefits. Guess what happened on Friday night. Those families no longer get survivors benefits.  We have all heard it, and I agree that a CR is bad for the military. I fully agree with that. There is one thing that is absolutely worse for the military and our troops right now--shutting down the government. That is worse. That is worse than a  When my colleagues on the other side trot out statements from General Mattis and others, that is their view. Shutting down the government is the worst thing we can be doing right now.  There was a little bit of news today. This was in the Alaska Dispatch News, or what is now known as the Anchorage Daily News, about what is going on in my State of I am going to quote a couple of sentences from this article.  It says that LTC Candis Olmstead of the Alaska National Guard ``wrote that the Alaska National Guard also canceled its monthly drill weekend, scheduled for Saturday and Sunday, due to the government shutdown. About 4,000 Guard members''--we have a lot of military in Alaska--``throughout the state had planned to attend.''  I guarantee, some were en route, and they were told to go home. Alaska is a big Sometimes you can fly 1,000 miles within Alaska to go to a drill weekend.  She said: ``Drill weekends are when the bulk of our force--our traditional or part-time Guard members--train alongside our full-time personnel.'' Well, that is not helpful for our military.  National Public Radio this morning did a big story on what was going on with the military. Again, they focused on Alaska as well. They said that at least 4,000 people were impacted.  The reporter talked about how stressful this is for families. Let's say you are a corporal in the You and your family can go into debt because you are not getting paid. Think about being deployed overseas, and your wife is calling you, saying: I can't pay the rent. That is what we did. That is what my colleagues did on Friday night.  These new talking points, saying ``We really support the military,''--be skeptical because actions speak louder than words.  It is not just the military members. In Alaska, there are hundreds, probably thousands, of family members in the civilian world--many of whom are veterans--who, according to an NPR story this morning on the radio, are going to go to work on They are going to be told whether they are essential or not, and they have 4 hours to pack up their stuff and go home.  This is clearly, clearly disrupting our military. It is not just It is all over the country. To be honest, it is all over the world.  Let's talk about the civilian workforce in In this same article that I read from earlier, it says:       While uniformed personnel are largely shielded from the      shutdown effects--  Because they are still working and, by the way, they are not getting paid--     civilian employees whose jobs are not deemed critical to      defense operations will be furloughed.       There are more than 740,000 Defense Department civilians.      Mattis said Friday that about half of them would be      furloughed.  Again, it is not just military members. It is the families. I mentioned survivors benefits. There is also something called insurance that covers things, for example, like funerals.  This article continues:       Already on Saturday, other effects were felt across the      military. One particularly sensitive one is the temporary      suspension of $100,000 payments promised to military families      in the event their loved one dies so that they can travel and      prepare for funerals.  Well, that has now been suspended. It even affects our forces overseas.  The article goes on to say:       The American Forces Network, which carries television      broadcasts of sporting events and other programming, was      taken off the[[Page S406]]     air at midnight, leaving deployed U.troops without one      common way to watch National Football League playoff games      this weekend.  That might sound like a small thing. It might sound like a small thing, but if you are deployed overseas, serving your country overseas, you want to touch base with Watching a football game is a great way to do that. Guess what. Our troops are not even going to have that small privilege.  In conclusion, the next time the Democratic leadership or some of my colleagues come to the floor or go on CNN emphasizing their concerns for the troops and rebuilding our forces, knowing that we have to do a lot more, spend on the military, be skeptical. Be skeptical.  The talking points are nice. We are hearing them from everyone. It is the actions that count. It is the actions that count, and they speak louder than these newly crafted, slick talking points.  This has not been the focus of the Democratic leadership. It hasn't been. I believe some of those giving these new talking points are a little bit concerned or maybe a little bit haunted by the specter of the Democratic Party once again being known, as they were in the 1970s, as the anti-military party.  Now, I will say this: The vast majority of my colleagues, Democrat and Republican, care about our forces, are patriotic, and care about our veterans. But the way you show that is not through new talking points; the way you show that is through actions and policies that are truly and sincerely focused on supporting our troops and rebuilding our military.  We can start that. We can start those kinds of actions by ending this ill-conceived government shutdown with a vote tonight.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

For the past 4 years, courts have held that public sector unions can charge a[[Page H668]]small fee to workers that benefit from the collective bargaining agreements that unions negotiate and enforce. Reversing that precedent is not an honest shift in legal interpretation. It is a political attack against American workers and the organizations that represent them, and it has been years in the making.  For decades, a relentless, coordinated campaign supported by large corporate interests, advanced by political partisans, and funded by the Koch brothers has tried to rebrand union membership as a burden on American workers. Their campaign is as cynical as it is misleading.  For nearly a year, the United States Senate refused to give the highly respected Judge Merrick Garland even one hearing, then overruled at least 100 years of Senate tradition to steal a seat on the Supreme  That seat is now the difference between a Court that upholds the rights of public sector unions and one that undermines their existence. Today, President Trump, the real estate billionaire who promised to be a voice for American workers, has pursued the most aggressive antiworker agenda in recent memory.  Thank you to my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus for holding this important discussion.  This evening I am speaking--not just as a strong supporter of public sector unions--but as a former union member myself. Throughout my 24 years in the classroom, I was a proud, dues-paying member of the California Teachers  And here's why: Union membership means higher pay, better training, and safer working conditions. It means access to paid sick leave if you or a loved one gets sick. It means medical benefits, life insurance, and retirement security for families in communities across the country. It means a compassionate, humane workplace. And it means greater opportunities and a better future for the children of union workers.  At a time when income inequality is high. middle-class wages are stagnant, and workers' benefits are rapidly disappearing, collective bargaining is the last remaining source of leverage for American workers.  And now the conservatives on the Supreme Court are preparing to strip that leverage away.  For the past 40 years, Courts have held that public sector unions can charge a small fee to workers that benefit from the collective bargaining agreements that unions negotiate and enforce. Reversing that precedent is not an honest shift in legal interpretation. It is a political attack against American workers and the organizations that represent them . . . and it has been years in the making.  For decades, a relentless, coordinated campaign, supported by large corporate interests, advanced by political partisans, and funded by the Koch Brothers, has tried to rebrand union membership as a burden on American workers.  Their campaign is as cynical as it is misleading.  For nearly a year, the United States Senate refused to give the highly respected Judge Merrick Garland even one hearing, and then overruled at least 100 years of Senate tradition to steal a seat on the Supreme  That seat is now the difference between a Court that upholds the rights of public sector unions and one that undermines their existence.  And today, President Trump--the real estate billionaire who promised to be a voice for American workers has pursued the most aggressive anti-worker agenda in recent memory.  In the White House, in Congress, and now in the Supreme Court, American workers are being deprived of the protections that built the middle class. And instead of accepting blame for exacerbating the challenges facing working families, Republicans are pointing the finger at immigrants and refugees in an attempt to divide and distract our nation from the true source of inequality.  The decision in Janus v. AFSCME must be the beginning of a new effort, supported by all my colleagues here this evening, to restore the respect and benefits that American workers deserve.                              {time}  2115  ",CREC-2018-01-29-pt1-PgH661-2.txt,2110,FEDERAL REGISTER PRINTING SAVINGS ACT OF 2017,2018.0,29.0,January

629,topic-id,1268,"Mr.President, I rise today for one simple reason, and that reason is to tell this body to stop pointing fingers and start writing a budget that works for not only my State but every State in the It can be done. It has been done many, many times before.  Unfortunately, this year our budget ran out on September 30. We had a CR that took us from the next day, October 1, to December 8. When December 8 rolled around, we had another continuing resolution to take us from December 8 to December 22. When December 22 came around, we had another CR that took us from December 22 to January 19, and that is where we are today, because some of us said enough is enough. We need to have a budget that works for this country. Here we are on day 2 of the government shutdown, and this body can't even agree to pay our troops. That is how dysfunctional we have become. Now we are using military men and women as political pawns because of the dysfunction we have here in Washington, In the past, we have always taken care of these folks because our servicemembers and their families have sacrificed much for this country, but we continue to draw it out--the leadership of this body--for political gains.  The folks I talk to, the rank-and-file folks on both sides of the aisle, think it is ridiculous. They think it is ridiculous that we have gotten here in the first place. But the truth is, if we are going to give predictability and the ability for our agencies to plan and the military to plan and the VA to plan and our border security folks to plan and everybody else, we need to have a budget that goes longer than month to month or 3 weeks to 3 weeks.  We need a budget that funds more than just It is interesting that CHIP could have been reauthorized months ago. I did events in Montana and talked about how important it was months ago. I am cosponsoring a bill that has sat on the leader's desk that could have been passed months ago. But it was put in I guess as a sweetener. Unfortunately, using CHIP as a political pawn isn't exactly what I had in mind for a program that has been around for nearly 20 years and has served Montana's families so very, very well.  That is not the only program we haven't funded. We haven't funded our community health centers. I heard the Senator from Alaska talking about how critically important they are for They are critically important for I have a notion that they are critically important for every rural State in the Union and probably every urban State, too, as far as that goes. That needs to be taken care of. In Montana, where we have just over 1 million people, 100,000 people depend on community health centers for their healthcare.  There is a thing called 340Not to get into the weeds too far, but these are payments given to hospitals that hold pharmaceutical companies accountable and keep our hospitals open. I have had hospital administrators and former hospital administrators in my office over the last month telling me that if this doesn't get fixed, we are going to lose hospitals in Montana, once again taking access away from many folks. This is not included in any of this. It could have been done months ago.  There have been plenty of folks who have come to the floor to talk about opioids and to talk about pensions. Neither of those is included in this.  There is no money for the borders. The southern border needs some attention. The northern border does, too, particularly the ports.  There is no predictability for our military. Defense Secretary Mattis has said that many, many times.  Things that are closer to home, such as rural ambulance services, need to be addressed. This isn't addressed and isn't going to be addressed unless we push the envelope and work to get things done.  Teaching health centers allow us to have doctors in places around this country that can't get doctors, and this is critically important.  Medicaid coverage for physical therapists and occupational therapists--we are going to lose these folks if we don't have it.  The Special Diabetes Program--particularly for Indian Country, where diabetes is rampant--needs to be addressed, plus a whole lot more.  When I was in high school, I debated for a couple years, and one of the things that were interesting during debate--you go through debate, and you hear the affirmative and negative lay out their cases, much in the same way that is being done by the two leaders here on this issue. When you were done debating and one team was particularly behind or ahead, they would say, well, they didn't make a case on why this is a good idea, or, they didn't make a case--the negative did not make a case on why their case should stand over the affirmative.  I hear the same thing today when folks come to the floor and say: People agree with everything that is in this. Well, I don't because there ain't much in there. We have been coming here for the last 4 months since the budget ran out at the end of September and continue to kick the can down the road. That is just how dysfunctional this body has become. We can't do the basic thing we were elected to do, and that is to pass a budget for the year for the[[Page S402]]things that are included that are important to this country. Whether it be military or healthcare or whether it be issues that revolve around Medicare or pensions, we just don't do much, and I think many of us are getting very tired of saying: You know what, we don't want to put forth any excellence in this body. We don't want to put forth any vision or any leadership. We are just going to do the bare minimum every day.  We need to stop. Congress needs to stop with short-term solutions, going from crisis to crisis. That is no way to run a nation, and I will state that most folks on both sides of the aisle would agree. That is why we need to start working together to get this problem fixed, because it is a problem--the problem of 3-week or 4-week CRs, the problem of not addressing the issues that are so critically important to working families and businesses in this country. It needs to stop. We need to work together.  I said yesterday that we are being pulled apart by the far left and the far right, and that is the truth. In days gone past, in Mike Mansfield's day, 70 percent of the work got done in the middle. Now we don't even do the basic work today.  So I would say, let's get together. The truth is, the Republicans control the White House, they control the House, they control the Senate, and they control the agenda. And they should--they won the last election. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't work together as Democrats and Republicans and most importantly as Americans to do what is right by this country.  So I would just ask that particularly the leaders on both sides get together, do the tough negotiations, compromise, and come up with a budget that works for not only Montana but for every State in this great country.

992,topic-id,576,"Mr.President, I rise today on this 13th day of January to call out this body, the body of the U.Senate, for its dereliction of duty. Enough is enough. We need a long-term budget bill for all of America, including my home State of Montana, because that is what Americans expect because it is our job.  It has been 122 days since Congress has failed to pass a budget. What makes this even more egregious is the fact that we haven't done anything but continuing resolution after continuing resolution after continuing resolution. There is no certainty in that. And even if we passed a long-term budget deal, it isn't even for that long of a term--through the end of this fiscal year, which is when it needs to be done by.  For the last 122 days, Congress has left community health centers, small business owners, America's families, Montana's families without the certainty of a long-term budget. During that time, Congress has instead settled for four short-term, crisis-funding bills that don't do what is necessary and that provide more uncertainty and more chaos.  I have heard a lot of folks say that government needs to be run like a business. There is no business that would put off what it is doing just because it is convenient. In my real life, I am a farmer. I know that you have to plan. I know that you can't go from month to month with uncertainty ahead of you because if you do, you will end up in a situation where it will put you out of business. You have to be able to[[Page S566]]plan, whether it is for the seeds you buy or equipment maintenance or anything else in agriculture. It is the same way in any business, and by the way, it is the same way in government.  Unfortunately, the norm has been a month of funding in continuing resolutions, or 3 weeks, instead of coming to a point where we can fund things until the end of the fiscal year, which will give folks certainty, whether it is the military or our southern border or community health centers.  Why do I bring this up? It is because fully 10 percent of the citizens of Montana depend on community health centers for access to their healthcare. It is in some cases the only source of healthcare for these folks. I have had listening tours and roundtables and over a dozen different public meetings on healthcare over the last year, and I can tell you that these facilities are critically important.  So who cares? Why should we worry about that, because we have a continuing resolution. Why? Because these folks right now, if you go talk to them in the State of Montana and I think in any other State in the Union, they will tell you they are not sure whether they will keep their doors open. That does not provide the kind of certainty they need and the kind of access to healthcare folks in our country need, and Montana is no exception.  We cannot continue governing from crisis to crisis. Montana deserves better. America deserves better. We need a budget that goes to the end of the fiscal year, that provides the kind of certainty and security the American people elected us to do. Congress simply needs to do its job.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

328,topic-id,480,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I appreciate her strong, persistent leadership on behalf of our troops and our  Mr.Speaker, in the days leading up to the most recent government shutdown, we heard a number of Members of both bodies, on the floor and in the press, say that they were opposed to that continuing resolution because of the damage that continuing resolutions do to the military. It is absolutely true that continuing resolutions do erode our fighting capability.  This is the chance--the bill that the gentlewoman from Texas has brought--this is the chance to do it right. This is the chance to fully fund the military for the rest of the fiscal year and get them out of the CR mess. So all of those Members who came here to the well and have talked to the press and in the other body, who expressed concern about the damage that a CR does, this is the chance to fix that problem by voting for the bill that is before us today.  Mr.Speaker, it is another opportunity to remove our troops from the partisan political morass that has seemed to bind them. We just heard in the previous speech everything from healthcare, taxes, funding for housing, the full panoply of issues. Some Members have used all of their desire to get an outcome they want on those other issues as an excuse for not funding our military.  More recently, we have heard Members who say: Yes, I know the military needs to be funded, they need more money, but I can't support it until we have the outcome I want on an immigration issue.  So from taxes and healthcare and immigration, it is all an excuse to not fund the military, to keep them hostage, until those other issues are resolved the way that Members want them to be.  Mr.Speaker, I just think that is wrong. We need to set our military free of all of the other issues. I may well agree on finding a reasonable solution to the DACA issue. I may well agree on more funding for a number of domestic spending programs. But none of them, however important they may be, should be an excuse for failing to support the military so that when they go out and perform the missions our country asks them to perform, they are fully trained, fully supported, and equipped with the best that this country can offer.  Mr.Speaker, I think it is important for all of us, whatever committee we serve on, to remember that the men and women who are out there risking their lives for us, do so unconditionally, whether it is in the mountains of Afghanistan, near the DMZ of Korea, whether they are doing exercises in Eastern Europe or the Middle East, they perform their service unconditionally.

20,topic-id,903,"Mr.President, I am glad that Democrats decided that they needed to reopen the government. The political theater they engaged in over the weekend endangered funding for our military, threatened the future of the Children's Health Insurance Program, and created uncertainty about important government services, from programs for veterans, to worker and product safety, to public health. And for what? For politics. Democrats were feeling pressure from certain interest groups within their party, and so they decided to use the government funding bill to take a stand on an unrelated illegal immigration issue. It didn't matter that Republicans had already expressed an interest in working on an immigration bill with Democrats or that the deadline for such a bill was not imminent. No, Democrats weren't getting the bill that they and their interest groups wanted, when they wanted it, so they decided to jeopardize the operation of the entire government.  Unfortunately, obstructing for political reasons has been the Democrats' modus operandi so far this Democrats were supposedly fervent advocates of extending the Children's Health Insurance Program, but they chose to obstruct the substantial 6-year extension of CHIP included in the government funding bill because they wanted to make a political point. On Presidential nominees, they have obstructed and obstructed again, even when they planned to eventually support the nominee. And of course I don't need to remind anyone of Democrats' refusal to accept Republicans' offer to work together on tax reform--this, of course, despite the fact that Democrats had previously called for tax reform and supported many of the proposals that were included in the law.  Obviously, there are going to be disagreements in politics, sometimes very serious ones. Sometimes opposing legislation is absolutely the right thing to do, but opposing legislation because you have a serious disagreement with it and opposing legislation for political reasons are two very different things. But unfortunately, since their defeat in the 2016 elections, Democrats have spent a lot of time doing the latter. That is irresponsible, it is shortsighted, and it is a disservice to their constituents. Democrats are missing the chance to help deliver major benefits for the American people.  That tax reform legislation Democrats fiercely decried despite their previous support for many of the included proposals, well, that legislation, which has been the law of the land for barely a month, is already delivering big benefits for the American people. More than 200 companies have announced wage hikes, 401(k) increases, and/or bonuses.  The Nation's largest private employer, Walmart, announced an increase in its starting wage for hourly employees and bonuses for eligible employees. It also announced expanded maternity and parental leave benefits and the creation of a new adoption benefit for their employees. More than 1 million Walmart employees will benefit from the changes.  Tech giant Apple announced last week that thanks to tax reform, it will bring home almost $250 billion in cash that it has been keeping overseas and invest it here in the United It also announced that it will create 20,000 new jobs and provide $2,500 stock bonuses to employees.  The list goes on--better retirement benefits at Aflac; increased capital investment and bonuses at AT&T; bonuses at PNC; increased investment in infrastructure and facilities at Boeing; a hike in starting wages at Capital One; new jobs, bonuses, and investment from Fiat Chrysler; bonuses at Southwest, JetBlue, and American Airlines; better retirement benefits at Visa; and the list goes on and on. There are the utility companies that are seeking approval from the regulators to pass savings on to consumers. These benefits are going to make a real difference in families' lives this year and, in some cases, well into the future.  The main benefits of tax reform are still to come. The IRS has released the new withholding tables for the tax law, and Americans should start seeing the results in Thanks to lower income tax rates and the near doubling of the standard deduction, 90 percent of American workers should see bigger paychecks starting next month. On top of that, the doubling of the child tax credit will mean even greater tax relief for hard-working parents, and that is just the beginning.  One major goal of tax reform was to provide immediate, direct relief to hard-working Americans, and that is happening right now. But our other goal was to create the kind of robust, long-term economic growth that would provide long-term security for American families. That is already starting with the wave of wage increases and bonuses, but there is a lot more to come. As businesses large and small experience the benefits of tax reform, American workers will see increased access to the kinds of jobs, wages, and opportunities that will secure their American dream for the long term.  I am proud that we passed tax reform, and I am very excited about the benefits that it is already delivering for American families and American[[Page S449]]workers. We have a lot more to accomplish this year, from improving our Nation's infrastructure to strengthening our military, to border security.

So I hope we will have the 60 votes that are necessary to do that when we have that vote later today.  In fact, what we will be voting on later today has been modified from what was originally sent over from the House, which was a 4-week continuing resolution.

It is really important, in my view, that we do that.  There has been a lot of discussion throughout the course of the afternoon here on the floor and in the previous days leading up to this about who is to blame and all that sort of thing. I don't[[Page S417]]think the American people, frankly, care much. They just want to see their elected officials work together to get results.  The one thing I will point out--because a number of my colleagues here on the Democratic side have spoken earlier today and consistently said that this is President Trump's fault somehow--is that the President of the United States doesn't appropriate a single dime. That is not his authority under the That is the authority of the That is our article I power. Congress has the ability to appropriate funds. The President of the United States--let me repeat--cannot appropriate a single dime. So the idea that this is somehow the President's fault is completely missing the point and is simply an attempt to try and dodge responsibility.  I would also point out, as many of our colleagues have come down here today and tried to blame the President and tried to blame Republicans, or whatever, that I think the American people get this, and it seems like the news media seems to get it. These are headlines.  This is from the Associated Press: ``Senate Democrats derail bill to avert shutdown.''  New York Times: Senate Democrats blocked passage of a stopgap spending bill to keep the government open.  Bloomberg: Senate Democrats block GOP funding plan as shutdown kicks in.  Those are just a few of the coverages of this by the media.  The point I would make is that I think it is not being lost on people outside this Chamber what is happening here. This is purely an attempt to hijack the Senate over a debate on an issue which, frankly, doesn't have an urgent deadline. There is nothing that says we have to have the issue of DACA solved tomorrow, or even the day after that. There is a deadline in March, and there were good-faith negotiations under way between Republicans and Democrats in the House and in the Senate to resolve that issue, and it is an issue which, frankly, needs to be resolved. There is great sympathy on both sides of the aisle here in the Senate for how to deal with those young people who were brought into this country illegally, through no fault of their own--a tremendous amount of sympathy, I would say. The President has said he wants to see that issue resolved, which is why those negotiations and discussions were under way--the House of Representatives and the Senate, Republicans and Bicameral, bipartisan negotiations were under way to address that issue.  The other thing that was included in the funding resolution, of course, was an extension--a reauthorization--of the Children's Health Insurance Program, which I think pretty much everybody here supports. There may be some who would vote against that, but I doubt it. I think it enjoys broad bipartisan support. It is a 6-year extension. That is something we needed to get done as well. That is included in this funding resolution that the Democrats are objecting to.  Now, one of the reasons for objecting, interestingly enough, as I listened this afternoon, was that it should have been done last year. Yes, OK, so does that mean we can't vote for it now? We have a fix in place. We have a solution in place, a 6-year reauthorization of the CHIP program. I serve on the Senate Finance When we reported it out, it was 5 years. So it has added an additional year. There is a 6-year reauthorization of CHIP, and all of a sudden now, Democrats say: We can't. I don't know why we are voting on it now; we should have voted on it last year.  When does it become too late in the game to solve a problem that needs to be solved?  I think, notwithstanding their assertions this afternoon on the floor--that somehow that ought to prevent us from moving forward with that legislation or give them an excuse to vote to shut down the government--that that is just beyond me. I find it incredibly hard to believe.  The other thing that was pointed out, which the Democrats have said, is that they have made this about DACA, which I get. It is an issue that they are very passionate about and, as I said before, there is passion on both sides about that issue, and there is a real desire to find a solution. But I am not sure that you are in the best position to find that solution in the middle of a government shutdown.  I want to point out what Senator Schumer, the Democratic leader, said back in 2013. This was on a Sunday morning talk show, ABC's ``This Week,'' in the context of the 2013 shutdown. Senator Schumer said then:       Basically, it's sort of like this. Someone goes into your      house, takes your wife and children hostage and then, says,      let's negotiate over the price of your house. You know, we      could do the same thing on immigration. We believe strongly      in immigration reform. We could say we're shutting down the      government, we're not gonna raise the debt ceiling, until you      pass immigration reform. . . . It would be governmental      chaos.  It was governmental chaos in 2013, according to Senator Schumer then, now the Democratic leader--governmental chaos to shut the government down or hold the government hostage and try to get another issue addressed. Interestingly enough--it is almost prescient here--he made that same argument about immigration. He went on to say that there are Democrats here.       We could do the same thing on immigration. We believe      strongly in immigration reform.  Of course, at the time that the shutdown happened in 2013, it had to do with ObamaCare, and, in fact, the roles were reversed or flipped in that situation. It was the Republicans, and, frankly, President Obama at the time did a fairly effective job of pointing out, as I am pointing out right now, that he can't appropriate money. That is the role of the  But the point is, at that time, the Democratic leader thought it would create governmental chaos to shut the government down, and it should not be done to try to solve some other unrelated issue. Yet here we are, 2 days into a government shutdown that could have been totally avoided. We had a vote a couple of nights ago--a bipartisan vote, I might add--to keep the government open.  So what do we have so far? The House of Representatives has sent a resolution to fund the government, to keep the government open, and to give us some additional time now to resolve some of these outstanding issues, including the DACA issue. The President of the United States has expressed support for that funding resolution to keep the government open. He has made it very clear that he wants the government to stay open. He has also made it very clear that he wants a solution on DACA and is willing to engage in conversations and discussions about how to resolve that issue.  Then, we had a vote in the Senate, which was bipartisan--a bipartisan majority in the Five Democrats joined Republicans here in the Senate on a resolution to keep the government open and functioning, and to keep it from shutting down.  So we have bipartisan support in the Senate for that--majority support--and the House of Representatives and the President are all on record. The only thing right now preventing us from opening up the government and getting back to where we were, discussing and debating those issues, and to extending health insurance coverage to 9 million children in this country--the only thing standing in the way of that--is the Senate  So I am hopeful that this evening, when the time comes to vote, we will have a sufficient number of Democrats here in the Senate who will join with We had a bipartisan majority, as I said, Friday night on the vote, but we didn't have the 60-vote threshold necessary to keep the government from shutting down. Now it is going to take 60 votes to open it back up. I am hoping there will be Democrats who will find their way to see that this does create, as Senator Schumer described, governmental chaos--a situation in which it is very difficult for people to see clearly and to have a fair, reasonable, thoughtful discussion about how to solve big issues like DACA--a discussion, which, as I pointed out, is already under way.  It is pretty clear what is going on here. The media understands it. The American people, I think, understand it. And attempts by our colleagues on the other side to obfuscate it or try to dodge it or try to run away from it or deflect it or create some other shiny object for people to look at just aren't going to work. It is clear. It is a matter[[Page S418]]of record. It is a vote. We had the vote once on We will have another vote tonight, another opportunity for Senate Democrats to go on the record and say: We aren't going to shut this government down; we are not going to keep this government shut down, and we are going to move forward in a reasonable way to deal with the issues that we think need to be dealt with on behalf of the American people--not in the middle of a crisis mode or, as described by Senator Schumer, in the middle of governmental chaos.  Let's get on with that. Let's have the vote, and let's hope that we have a bipartisan 60-vote threshold that will allow us to get this government back open and get these discussions and negotiations back on track.

996,topic-id,751,"Mr.President, the good news about tax reform continues to roll in--wage increases, better benefits, increased investment, and employee bonuses. So far, more than 250 companies have announced good news for their employees--pay hikes, increased retirement contributions, or bonuses, and the list continues to grow.  Last week, JPMorgan Chase, Disney, Starbucks, and FedEx all announced increased investment in American workers. JPMorgan Chase announced that it will raise wages for 22,000 workers, add thousands of new jobs, and open 400 new branches in the United It also plans to increase its lending to small businesses. Disney will invest in employees' education and provide employee bonuses. Starbucks is raising wages, increasing benefits, and rewarding employees with company stock. FedEx announced plans to expedite raises and invest $1.5 billion to expand its FedEx Express hub in It is also making a $1.5 billion contribution to its pension plan. To top it off, yesterday ExxonMobil announced that, thanks in part to tax reform, it will invest an additional $35 billion into the U.economy over the next 5 years. That means a lot of new jobs and opportunities for American workers.  Stories like this are why we made business tax reform a key part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Obviously, a huge priority was immediately lowering Americans' tax bills, which is why we lowered rates across the board, nearly doubled the standard deduction, and doubled the child tax credit. But our other priority was creating the kind of economy in which Americans can thrive for the long-term--an economy that would create good jobs, higher wages, and more opportunities.  So how do we go about doing that? Well, the only way for individual Americans to thrive is for American businesses and the American economy to thrive. So we took action to improve the situation for American businesses.  Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, American businesses, large and small, were weighed down by high tax rates and growth-killing tax provisions. Plus, our outdated international tax rules left America's global businesses at a competitive disadvantage in the global economy.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act changed all that. We lowered tax rates across the board for owners of small and medium-sized businesses, farms, and ranches. We expanded the business owners' ability to recover investments they make in their businesses, which will free up cash that they can reinvest in their operations and their workers.  We lowered our Nation's massive corporate tax rate, which up until January 1 was the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. We brought the U.international tax system into the 21st century by replacing our outdated worldwide system with a modernized territorial tax system so that American businesses are not operating at a disadvantage next to their foreign counterparts. Now, just a month into the new tax law, we are already seeing the results.  Thanks to the new tax law, businesses are seeing a future of growth, and based on those forecasts, they are making plans to invest in their workers, raise wages, create new jobs, and invest in the American economy: AT&T, Boeing, Fiat Chrysler, Bank of America, Home Depot, Great Western Bank in my State of South Dakota, First Hawaiian Bank, SunTrust Bank, Comcast, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Humana, Visa, Nationwide Insurance, JetBlue The list of companies announcing good news for American workers thanks to tax reform goes on and on and on.  Tech giant Apple announced that as a result of tax reform, it will bring home almost $250 billion in cash that it has been keeping overseas and invest it here in the United That is good news for the American economy, and it is a direct result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our Tax Code encouraged American businesses to keep cash overseas. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ended that. Now that we have altered the Tax Code to remove the penalty for bringing profits home to the United States, we can expect to see more companies bringing profits home and investing in the U.economy the way that Apple is doing.  We have seen a tremendous amount of good news this month, but it really is only the beginning. As the benefits of tax reform continue to sink in, we expect to see more growth, more jobs, and more opportunities for American workers, and we expect to see the kind of economy that will provide security and prosperity for Americans for the long term.

50,topic-id,349,"Mr.President, I am here to talk about a vote we will be considering later this afternoon on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection  I thank Senator Graham and my fellow cosponsors on the bill. I think it is a very important bill. I think it is a balanced bill as it is a bill that has the support of the vast majority of the American citizens and would make us consistent with all but only seven other nations in terms of restricting abortions to a limited number of exceptions after 20 weeks. Those exceptions would be a threat to the life of the mother, someone who may have been raped, or someone who may have been the victim of incest.  This is a balanced bill, and it is a policy that most of the world population agrees should be in place. I think it is our job to make sure this restriction is put into place, with medical science today suggesting that after 20 weeks an unborn child can experience pain, while still allowing for the choice of the mother. We could discuss different opinions about that in the earlier terms but certainly after 20 weeks. I think this is balanced policy and is something I hope my colleagues will support and ultimately send to the President's desk.  I was speaker of the house in North Carolina for 4 years. We worked on commonsense changes to protect the lives of the unborn, changes that also received the support of the majority of North This is just another example of where we at the Federal level can enact a law that I think can help us to demonstrate that the life of the unborn is a precious life.

378,topic-id,661,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, as financial service products continue to merge with the ever-evolving world of technology, the opportunities to reach unbanked and underserved households also continue to increase. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 7 percent of the U.population is unbanked, and 19.9 percent is underbanked.  The FDIC has concluded previously that mobile banking is well positioned to meet the day-to-day financial service needs of underbanked consumers as well as consumers at risk of account closure. Providing mobile financial services products to these households has shown to improve their financial outcomes by giving consumers more control over their finances, which helps households avoid burdensome fees and allows them to manage necessary payments more conveniently.  Further FDIC research suggests that nearly three-quarters of all underbanked households have access to a smartphone and that more than one-third of underbanked households used mobile banking in the past year. In particular, the FDIC found that mobile financial services improved account stability by helping underserved consumers successfully manage and maintain bank accounts.  Unfortunately, access to mobile financial service products is not equal across the United The Making Online Banking Initiation Legal and Easy Act remedies this lack of parity by establishing a uniform policy nationwide, allowing a financial institution to record personal information from a driver's license for the purpose of opening a bank account with a scan or copy.  The MOBILE Act creates uniform access to helpful financial products and provides certainty to financial institutions to offer their full range of mobile banking products to all consumers nationwide.  While the MOBILE Act creates a consistent law across the United States, it is careful to protect consumer privacy information and existing State privacy laws. The bill requires financial institutions to delete all copies of a driver's license and personal identification after having used them for the permitted purposes of opening an account.  The legislation is also careful not to reduce any financial institution's commitment to comply with Federal and State laws aimed at preventing identity theft, financial fraud, money laundering, or know your customer and Customer Identification  A Federal Reserve report from 2016 found that mobile banking use was rising at relatively fast rates, reporting that 43 percent of all mobile phone owners with a bank account had used mobile banking in the past 12 months, up from 39 percent in 2014 and 33 percent in 2013.  Following this trend, the use of mobile banking will continue to grow, and the MOBILE Act ensures that every consumer across the country who wants to use a mobile banking product is able to do so. This bill was passed out of the Financial Services Committee on a unanimous, bipartisan vote.[[Page H645]]  The MOBILE Act provides consumers easier access to the highly regulated financial services industry by simplifying their ability to open an account through the process of scanning or copying their State-issued identification card. As one State banking association wrote to me:       This legislation is mutually beneficial to both financial      institutions and their customers. The MOBILE Act will help      expand access to critical banking services for underbanked      populations by offering similar retail services through      mobile technology.  Increasing access for mobile financial services products also means giving rural communities, like many of the small towns I represent in Colorado, access to financial success. While many of us can drive a short distance, walk into a bank, and open an account, there are rural communities where physical bank locations are few and far between. By allowing those with smartphones to essentially have their bank accounts in their pocket, geography is no longer a constraint to accessing financial services products.  All families should have the tools they need to be able to achieve the financial stability and the prosperity the MOBILE Act will provide.  Mr.Speaker, this legislation is important for the future financial health of our Nation's customers. I urge its passage here today, and I reserve the balance of my time.

385,topic-id,295,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, the living wills process, as mandated under the Dodd-Frank Act for systemically important financial institutions and designated nonbank financial companies, has become a heavily burdensome process for the institutions subjected to it.  Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more to annually submit detailed plans to the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation that describe the company's strategy for rapid and orderly resolution under the Bankruptcy Code in the event of its material financial distress or failure.  The Federal Reserve and the FDIC have near total discretion in deciding whether a plan is acceptable, and, therefore, whether an institution will be subject to heavy penalties.  Mr.Zeldin's legislation, the Financial Institution Living Will Improvement Act, will do just that: improve the regulatory process for both sides of the living will assessment. This bipartisan legislation will provide needed change by limiting the frequency of the living wills process to a 2-year cycle, requiring regulators to publicly disclose the framework used to be able to review resolution plans, and requiring feedback on resolution plans within 6 months of the date they were submitted.  Mr.Speaker, the regulators themselves--members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the FDIC--have suggested before Congress that reforms should be made to the living wills process. Recognition from those running the process that the living wills framework needs to be reformed demonstrates the necessity of Mr.Zeldin's bill.  Mr.Zeldin's legislation, which was voted out of the Financial Services Committee unanimously, takes steps toward effectiveness and efficiency in this process, and I urge my colleagues to support this measure here today.

440,topic-id,452,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, mutual savings banks, cooperative banks, and mutual savings and loan associations are essential community-based financial institutions that have a long history of serving their neighbors and promoting small-town economic growth.  However, many of the benefits once given to Federal savings associations, also known as thrifts, that encouraged community growth and financial well-being have been stifled by changes initiated under the Dodd-Frank While Dodd-Frank eliminated many of the benefits provided to Federal savings associations, the HOLA restrictions, unfortunately, remain.  These restrictions have left Federal savings associations at a disadvantage and without the flexibility needed to adapt to meet community needs and, as a result, are forcing many mutual banks to either close or merge with other institutions, meaning fewer and more expensive choices for consumers hoping to finance important purchases.  H.1426, Mr.Rothfus' bipartisan legislation that passed out of the Financial Services Committee unanimously, would help to preserve these important community financial institutions by providing mutual banks with a framework to become covered savings associations. This process would provide thrifts the ability to operate with the same rights and duties as national banks without subjecting them to a complex, time-consuming, and costly charter conversion process.  Providing thrifts the flexibility to exercise national bank powers without changing their charters would give institutions the ability to exceed the commercial and consumer loan limits that apply under the Home Owners' Loan Act but continue to benefit from their structure for purposes of consolidation, merger, dissolution, conservatorship, and receivership.  Because the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency already supervises both national bank and Federal savings association charters, it is uniquely positioned to provide the structural framework for the election process that would transition the rights and duties of a national bank to a thrift.  Mr.Rothfus' bill instructs the OCC to develop a series of rulemakings to outline this election process, while also requiring safeguards to prevent malpractice in the transition process, as well as abuses in the new structure once it has been instituted.                              {time}  1800  Community financial institutions should be given the tools they need to lend effectively to their communities, and this bill creates the legislative landscape for savings associations to do just that.  Ultimately, the bill creates opportunities for families and small businesses to access financing for their important purchases, from buying a home to expanding a business.  Federal savings associations have a long, proud history of being responsive to their communities' needs, and this legislation will help them to enhance and continue that record.  I cannot give more emphatic support for this commonsense, bipartisan legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support this measure.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

453,topic-id,577,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to be able to speak on behalf of these important bills today.  While low-income applicants and homebuilders seek to provide affordable, decent housing opportunities to qualifying individuals and families, these nonprofits rely on the generosity of others in their communities to accomplish their mission. These groups also heavily rely on meticulous budgets, and a change in the input costs can have serious implications for a project's success as well as the number of families a group can serve.  The Dodd-Frank Act increased requirements for real estate appraisers and transferred rulemaking authority for residential mortgage appraisals to the Under Dodd-Frank, professionals who furnish appraisal services for a fee are able to receive a payment that is ``customary and reasonable'' for the market area where the appraisal services were performed. However, the CFPB has not defined find the terms ``customary'' and ``reasonable,'' which has left nonprofit housing organizations with the serious concern that they violate the law when the work of appraisers is donated.  If nonprofit housing organizations are required to start paying for appraisal services, which could cost over $1,000 per appraisal, the Dodd-Frank statute could unintentionally limit the number of families in need that these nonprofit organizations can serve.  Mr.Trott's legislation, the Housing Opportunities Made Easier Act, would remedy this uncertainty by amending the Truth in Lending Act to allow mortgage appraisal services to be donated by fee appraisers to an organization that is eligible to receive tax-deductible charitable contributions.  This simple fix will ensure that housing nonprofit organizations can continue to provide their incredibly important services for as many in-need families in our communities as possible, and I commend Mr.Trott for this legislation.  I would also like to voice my support for H.4281, the Expanding Access to Capital for Rural Job Creators  As a former small-business owner in a rural part of Colorado, I know firsthand how important access to capital is for the success of a small business. The majority of capital for small businesses is concentrated in urban areas, and access to capital for rural small businesses can be difficult to come by.  H.4281 would require the SEC's Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation to identify any unique challenges that rural-area small businesses have in securing access to capital and require the Small Business Advocate to provide updates on its findings in its annual report.  Small businesses are the lifeblood of communities across our country, providing jobs and services to those they serve, and this legislation will help hardworking small businesses in rural communities to continue to create jobs and grow their businesses.  I would also like to give my support to Representative Sinema's and Representative Poliquin's bill, the Senior Safe Act, here today. H.3758 takes important steps to safeguard our senior citizens from fraud and abuse by encouraging covered financial institutions to train supervisors, compliance officers, or legal advisers on how to spot and report predatory activity against senior citizens.  This legislation also protects banks, credit unions, investment advisers and[[Page H649]]broker-dealers and their employees from civil or administrative liability when reporting fraudulent activity related to senior citizens if an employee is properly trained and reports such activity ``in good faith'' and ``with reasonable care.''  This group of bills will make important and impactful changes for our communities, and I am pleased to see them considered here on the floor today.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

876,topic-id,1588,"Mr.Speaker, in the years following the Great Recession (2009-2012), 91 percent of all new wealth created accrued to the top one percent of earners.  From 1980 through 2014, incomes for the wealthiest one percent of Americans rose by 204 percent while incomes for the bottom 50 percent rose by just 1 percent.  During that period, the size and productivity of the U.economy have essentially doubled.  President Trump likes to tout a booming stock market, but the wealthiest 20 percent of Americans own 92% of the stocks. The other 80 percent, four out of five Americans, own just 8 percent of that wealth and are being largely left behind.  And things are about to get much worse, because the Trump tax scam does exactly the same thing that has failed us for decades: trickle-down economics. It failed under Reagan, it failed again under Every time Republicans ram it through, it adds billions, in Trump's case trillions of dollars to our debt, and the wealthy walk away with the benefits. The rich get richer and the rest of us just have to work harder for less.  Meanwhile just in the past six weeks, Sam's Club laid off some 11,000 employees. Carrier cut another 1,500. AT&T laid off some 4,000. Kimberly Clark, the company that makes Kleenex and Huggies, just announced that it would use Trump's tax scam as an opportunity to lay off 5,000 or more workers and close 10 manufacturing facilities.  Janus v. AFSCME is an effort by the wealthy and powerful to further insulate their economic power and ability to restrict access to wealth for the rest of us.  Strong unions are key to unrigging this economy, improving local communities and the lives of union and nonunion families alike.  Unions are associated with greater productivity, lower employee turnover, improved workplace communication, and a better-trained workforce.  Data shows that unions and unionization lead to increased economic growth and competitiveness.  According to the BLS, among full-time and salary workers, in 2017 union members had average weekly earnings of $1,041, non-union members had median weekly earnings of $829.  When union membership is high, entire communities enjoy wages that represent a fair return for their work and greater social and economic stability and mobility. And unions advocate for policies that benefit all working people, e.g. minimum wage, affordable health care, and quality public schools.  Unions provide a path to the middle class for working people by increasing their income and the economic security of their families.  As union membership has decreased because of attacks on working people, income inequality has risen in the U. Through collective bargaining, members of strong unions are scoring victories that help entire communities--like safer nurse-staffing levels that help patients and smaller classroom sizes that help students.  AFSCME Region President, Ron Briggs, suggested you may recognize the following members because they have worked diligently to sign agency fee payers in their locals/units and are active in fighting back against the Janus case, right-to-work and the pro-corporate agenda:  Lorraine Aumic from Local 688 Office of Temporary & Disability She lives in  Bryan Schaeffer from Local 886 Schenectady School Districts, Municipalities, and He lives in  Michele Kuiber from Local 671 Workers Compensation She lives in  Jodi Aubin from Local 655 Environmental She lives in Clifton  Janus v. AFSCME is the product of a political scheme to further tilt economic power away from working people and the middle class. It strikes at the freedom of working people to come together in strong unions.  Unions are critical to America's middle class, providing economic stability, a good life, home and education for workers and their families.  CEOs and corporate special interests behind this case oppose letting workers negotiate a fair wage for their work.  The case was brought to manipulate the Supreme Court to satisfy blatantly political goals. In a 10-page State Policy Network (SPN) fundraising letter reported on in The Guardian, SPN President and CEO Tracie Sharp wrote that the goal of their Koch-backed network's $80 million campaign was to ``defund and defang'' unions.  The original plaintiff in this case was Illinois Bruce Rauner, who launched a political attack on public employees after taking office. A U.District Court judge ruled in 2015 that Rauner had ``no standing'' to bring suit, so the legal arms of the National Right to Work Committee and the Liberty Justice Center went looking for plaintiffs to serve as stand-ins for Rauner in the federal lawsuit.  The Supreme Court case Janus v. AFSCME, Council 31 aims to take away the freedom of--and opportunity for--working people to join together in strong unions to speak up for themselves, their families and their communities. When teachers, nurses, police officers, firefighters and other public service workers are free to come together in strong unions, they win benefits like better working conditions, better wages, health care, clean and safe environments and retirement security that benefit non-union members as well. But the CEOs and corporate special interests behind this case simply do not believe that working people should have the same freedoms and opportunities as they do: to negotiate a fair return on our work so that we can provide for ourselves and our families. They are funding this case through the National Right to Work Foundation, because they view strong unions as a threat to their power and greed.  When working people have the freedom and opportunity to speak up together through unions, we make progress together that benefits everyone. If the billionaires and corporate CEOs behind this case get their way, however, they will take away the freedom of working people to come together and build power to fight for the things our communities need: everything from affordable health care and retirement security to quicker medical emergency response times. The CEOs and billionaires want to use the highest court in the land to take away our freedom to create the power in numbers to win better lives for ourselves, our families, our communities and our country.  People in unions continue to win rights, benefits and protections not only for union members, but for all working people and their communities in and outside of the workplace. When nurses, firefighters, 911 dispatchers and EMS workers belong to strong unions, they fight for staffing levels, equipment and training that save lives. And when union membership is high, entire communities enjoy wages that represent a fair return on their work and greater social and economic mobility. Without the freedom to come together, working people[[Page H670]]would not have the power in numbers they need to make our communities safer, stronger and more prosperous.  The National Right to Work Foundation is part of a network funded by corporate billionaires to use the courts to rig the rules against everyday working people. For decades, the corporate CEOs and billionaires funding this case have used their massive fortunes to pay politicians and corporate lobbyists to chip away at the freedoms people in unions have won for every single one of us. Now they want the highest court in the land to take away our freedom to come together to protect things our families need: a living wage, retirement security, health benefits, the ability to care for loved ones and more.  This case originated from a political scheme by billionaire Bruce Rauner, governor of Illinois, to advance an agenda benefiting corporations and the wealthy. Rauner launched a political attack on public service workers immediately after taking office, filing a lawsuit on his own behalf to bar the collection of fair share fees by public service unions. A federal judge ruled that Rauner could not bring this action because he was not himself an employee paying fair share fees. But the legal arms of the National Right to Work Committee and the Liberty Justice Center were able to carry the case forward by finding plaintiffs as standins for Rauner in the federal lawsuit. The district court dismissed the case, based on long-standing precedent. The plaintiffs asked the lower court to fast-track their appeal and rule against them in order to more quickly get the case before the U.Supreme  Unions work because we all pay our fair share and we all benefit from what we negotiate together. Fair share fees provide public service workers with the power in numbers they need to negotiate better wages, benefits and protections that improve work conditions and set standards for everyone. Each individual public service worker chooses whether or not to join a union, but the union is still required by law to represent and negotiate on behalf of all public service workers--members and nonmembers alike. The corporate special interests behind this case want to take away the freedom of public service workers to have the power in numbers to provide for their families and make their communities stronger. That is why they want the Supreme Court to rule that workers can receive all the benefits of a union contract without contributing anything in return. Look at it this way: If you go out to dinner with a group of friends, you still pay your fair share of the check even if you didn't get to choose the restaurant.  No one is forced to join a union and no one is forced to pay any fees that go to politics or political candidates. That is already the law of the land. Nothing in this case will change that. This case is about taking away the freedom of working people to come together, speak up for each other and build a better life for themselves and their families.

993,topic-id,1130,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak about two separate matters. The first is a very painful and difficult topic, but I feel it is important to address.  I wish to recognize, acknowledge, and honor the heroic life and legacy and sacrifice of one of Pennsylvania's finest: Deputy U.Marshal Christopher  On January 18 of this year, Deputy Hill was shot and killed while he was apprehending a fugitive in Harrisburg, Christopher Hill lived in York, He was only 45 years old. He was a husband and the father of two young children. He dedicated his life to serving and protecting first his country and later his community. He was an 11-year veteran of the U.Marshals He was a former U.Army Ranger who had been deployed to In 2014, Deputy Hill was one of the deputy marshals who helped capture a notorious cop killer in Pennsylvania, Eric Frein, who was the subject of one of the largest and longest manhunts in recent history throughout rural  The fact is that day in and day out for a very long period of time, Christopher Hill put his life on the line for the rest of us. He did it as an Army Ranger in He did it as a deputy U.marshal. I had the privilege of attending the memorial service for him recently. It was extraordinary to hear one after another of the people whom he had served with in various capacities speak about a truly extraordinary individual, a guy who was by all accounts humble and modest but absolutely dedicated with a passion to his family, to his community, and to his country.  Sometimes it is easy for us to forget the risks and sacrifices that are being taken by the men and women who wear various uniforms that represent the various organizations that defend and protect us. But I want to say to the people of Pennsylvania and to the family of Christopher Hill that we are never going to forget the bravery and the sacrifice and the service he provided for all of us.                               Tax Reform  Mr.President, another topic I wish to touch on this afternoon is a much happier topic; that is, the extraordinary consequences we are already seeing of the tax reform we passed just about a month ago.  Yesterday, I had a chance to tour a small- to medium-sized company in the eastern part of Pennsylvania--Easton, PA, which is where they are located. Sussex Wire is the name of the company. They have a very sophisticated technology whereby they take wire, and without heating it and without grinding it, they use a process that turns it into the shape and form that their customers require. It is a very sophisticated process. They can crank out tremendous volumes.  This relatively small business--I think they have 55 employees--is doing very well. It is manufacturing in Pennsylvania, in As a direct result of the tax reform we passed, their tax burden has been diminished, and that has, in turn, allowed them to speed up the hiring of five or six new workers--five or six people who don't have a job today, but they are going to have a job soon because Sussex Wire is hiring. Right now they are out looking for the folks who are going to expand their workforce, expand the ability of this terrific company to do even more.  The tax reform is also accelerating their ability to purchase new equipment. The new equipment they buy allows them to do more work more productively. It allows their workers to produce more of the little tools and devices that they produce. When workers produce more, when they are more productive, they can earn more income, and that is exactly what is happening at Sussex This is before we have had the opportunity to have all of these investments actually take place.  I am thrilled at how quickly we are seeing tangible benefits for the people I represent as a result of this tax reform.  Of course, it is not just Sussex Wire; it is happening all across It is happening certainly all across Pennsylvania, and I hope we will hear about some of the examples tonight when the President gives his State of the Union  At latest count, there are over 3 million American workers who have already gotten an increase in their compensation. Their employers have provided them either a pay raise or a bonus or a contribution to their pension plan or some combination of those things precisely because these businesses have more free cash flow as a result of lower taxes. Three million workers from almost 300 businesses, and since the last time I came to the floor and spoke about this phenomenon, there have been many more Pennsylvanians benefiting from this.  The employees of Home Depot, at 70 locations across Pennsylvania, are benefiting. Those employees--thousands, I suppose, altogether--are receiving $1,000 each.  FedEx, which has a huge presence in Pennsylvania, has announced $200 million in raises, $1.5 billion in new investment in distribution hubs, and another $1.5 billion that they are contributing to their employees' pensions.  PPG in Pittsburgh, PA, is spending $50 million in new capital projects, in part because the Tax Code treats that investment better than our Tax Code used to, and it is encouraging more of this investment.  H&K Equipment in Coraopolis in western Pennsylvania is increasing its investments by 15 percent this year, again in response to this tax reform.  The Wall Street Journal reported over the weekend that manufacturing investment is already going up. It is already increasing. This is going to be very beneficial. First of all, it helps all the workers who produce the equipment in which companies are investing. Secondly, someone needs to operate this equipment, so when a company goes out and buys a new piece of equipment, new machinery, there is the job security or the new job being created for the person who operates it. Thirdly, there is the enhancement in productivity, which allows for higher compensation.  This is all happening at a time when our unemployment rate is relatively low. It is at an alltime record low for African It is low generally by standards of recent decades. This means that demand for more workers is going to translate into upward pressure on wages. I think we are already seeing it. It is very, very encouraging, and it is just a tremendous success for our workers.  I was very confident that this would be among the constructive consequences of our tax reform, but I will confess that I didn't realize it would happen so quickly. This is great news for Pennsylvanians, and it is great news for  I yield the floor.

457,topic-id,595,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend from Colorado for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.2255, the Housing Opportunities Made Easier, or the HOME  Mr.Speaker, I thank my good friend from New Jersey (Mr.Gottheimer), for being the lead Democrat on this bill. I appreciate his bipartisan leadership and his efforts to bring this bill to the floor for a vote.  I also thank my colleague in the Senate, Senator Portman, for his leadership on this issue. It has been a pleasure working with him to ensure Habitat for Humanity and other nonprofits are able to continue their important mission.  Finally, I thank Chairman Hensarling for his support in the Financial Services  During my first term in Congress, I, along with my entire district office, had the opportunity to join Habitat for Humanity on one of their builds in Oakland County, It was great fun helping them build a Michigan family's home, but I think we often forget that Habitat for Humanity and other nonprofit housing organizations do so much more than just build a home.  These nonprofits actually offer families who live in their homes, no- or low-interest homes, making the dream of homeownership affordable for so many. The home, of course, needs to be appraised before a loan may be approved. Many times, professional appraisers volunteer their services so that the nonprofit does not have to incur additional expense.  Early last year, I met with Habitat for Humanity leaders from Michigan and I heard about their struggle to ensure that homes remain affordable under the regulations promulgated by Dodd-Under the new law, all fee appraisers must be paid a customary and reasonable fee for their work.  So where does this leave Habitat for Humanity and other nonprofits?  This means they may no longer accept donated appraisals, forcing them to divert money from their core homebuilding activities.  In fact, Habitat for Humanity told me that these complex rules have tripled the cost of originating loans. This is particularly a problem in rural areas where, under Dodd-Frank, appraisers are also required to be compensated for mileage expenses. Some chapters have informed us they may need to stop or limit their work altogether, denying a valuable service to many communities.  My bill, the HOME Act, which passed out of committee with a unanimous bipartisan vote of 55-0, would exempt Habitat for Humanity and other nonprofits from this burdensome rule, allowing them to accept donated appraisals, which, in turn, will lower the cost for homes for Michigan families.  We in Congress should stand by their side, not in their way. This bill gets Washington out of the way by providing that a donated appraisal may be considered ``customary and reasonable'' when benefiting charities. All other consumer protections in the Truth in Lending Act remain in place. It is a simple, targeted fix that does nothing to harm the underlying law or Dodd- When I came to Congress, I knew that I would be fighting for small businesses who are often ignored or hurt by Washington, but I never thought we would need to defend charitable organizations. I am glad that Congress is using some common sense to solve this obvious unintended consequence.  There is no need for debate or dissent on this bill. We cannot let Dodd-Frank undermine these fine organizations from their mission of providing homes to our neighbors in need.  Again, I thank all of the members of the Financial Services Committee for their unanimous bipartisan support. I urge all of my colleagues to support the work of worthy housing charities by voting ``yes'' on H.2255.

7,topic-id,738,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I want to start off by thanking both Chairman Hensarling and Ranking Member Waters for working with me on this legislation and moving it onto the floor. This has truly been a bipartisan effort.  My bill, H.4792, the Small Business Access to Capital After a Natural Disaster Act, is simple and straightforward.  One of the most important functions of the SEC's Office of the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation is to develop proposals and recommend changes to Congress that will promote the interests of small businesses and their investors, mitigate their problems, and help them secure access to credit.  When we created the Advocate's Office in 2016, we specifically charged it with looking into the unique challenges facing minority- and women-owned small businesses. My bill requires the advocate to now also consider the unique challenges that small businesses affected by hurricanes or other natural disasters have with securing access to credit and work to promote their interests.  I developed this legislation because, as ranking member of the House Small Business Committee, I understand that small businesses are the lifeblood of many communities around the country, and I have witnessed firsthand the terrible impact hurricanes and other natural disasters can have on the economic outlook for small businesses.  For example, in 2012, Superstorm Sandy ripped through the tristate area and decimated many communities along the New Jersey and New York coasts. Toms River, New Jersey, was considered ground zero for the storm.  Half a decade later, the Greater Toms River Chamber of Commerce reports that the small businesses in that community are still trying to recover at a cost of $600 million in lost ratables, even at this point.  For small businesses in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands trying to recover from the effects of Hurricane Maria, the situation is much worse.                              {time}  1915  2017 was the costliest year on record for weather and climate disasters in the United States, and the effects of Hurricane Maria on Puerto Rico's small businesses are unprecedented.  Nelson Ramirez, the president of the Centro Unido de Detallistas, a small business advocacy group in San Juan, estimates two-thirds of the island's roughly 45,000 small and midsize businesses have closed at least temporarily, and as many as 10,000 will never reopen.  Small and midsized businesses represent 90 percent of the private companies on the island and about one-third of the workforce. In October, the Puerto Rican Retail Trade Association revealed that a study conducted by economists estimated that the island's small business sector will lose $8.9 billion in a period of 6 months due to a lack of electricity on the island.  But while the situation in Puerto Rico is unprecedented, this legislation is about more than just Puerto Rico or the Virgin This legislation will serve to drive capital to other areas of our Nation impacted by hurricanes and other natural disasters this past season including Texas; Florida; the U.Virgin Islands; and California, which is facing the effects of devastating wildfires and mudslides.  Ninety-nine percent of the companies in Houston are considered small businesses, and most of them do not have the same economic resources as the State's massive oil and medical industries. As a result, these businesses face[[Page H655]]a long and expensive road to recovery. This legislation seeks to shorten that distance for those businesses as well.  FEMA estimates that nearly 40 percent of small businesses never reopen after a disaster. Therefore, developing strategies to drive private capital to a community's small business is one of the most efficient uses of private sector capital and one of the most effective ways we in the Federal Government can help an area recover.  Nearly 4 months after Hurricane Maria, the Puerto Rican economy is at a near standstill and thousands of the island's small businesses are teetering towards insolvency. The businesses in southeast Texas, Florida, the Virgin Islands, and California face tough situations as well, and we must do all that we can to help them recover.  Mr.Speaker, I again want to thank Chairman Hensarling and Ranking Member Waters for working with me on this important legislation, which passed our committee earlier this month on a wide bipartisan basis, 57-0. I also want to thank Representatives Green, Sinema, and Plaskett for cosponsoring this legislation with me.  Mr.Speaker, I urge Members to vote ``yes'' and I yield back the balance of my time.

379,topic-id,453,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, H.1457, the Making Online Banking Initiation Legal and Easy, or MOBILE, Act, permits financial institutions to copy or scan a consumer's driver's license or personal ID card when a consumer decides to obtain a financial product or service.  At a time when more Americans are conducting their business online and through their phones, the MOBILE Act will help expand access to banking products and financial services for those consumers who do not have access to a traditional brick-and-mortar financial institution by allowing consumers to utilize their smartphones to open a checking or savings account.  While financial inclusion has increased significantly over the past 20 years, still, too many Americans do not get their basic financial needs met by traditional financial service providers. For example, in June 2016, the Obama administration released a report indicating that about 7 percent of American households still lack access to a bank account, and another 20 percent supplement their bank account with nontraditional financial services like check cashing or payday loans.  Technological innovations in the financial industry and commonsense proposals like the MOBILE Act here in Congress will continue to help us close this gap. The bill will expand credit opportunities for consumers who cannot easily get to a bank in person and provides them access to innovative new products that can improve their overall financial health.  An amendment in the nature of a substitute was adopted in committee that makes the MOBILE Act even stronger, and I want to thank Mr.Tipton for putting these improvements forward.  These improvements require financial institutions to permanently delete copies of consumers' ID cards within a reasonable amount of time after they have opened the account, made clarifying changes to better harmonize the bill's requirements with Federal bank secrecy laws, and recognized identification cards issued by federally recognized Indian Tribes as an acceptable identification card.  Perhaps most importantly, the bill also prohibits financial institutions from selling or otherwise sharing the personally identifiable information they collect from consumers with unaffiliated third parties.  The bill is supported by several financial technology and industry groups, including the Innovative Lending Platform Association and the Financial Services  Again, in a day and age when more and more Americans are conducting their business online and through their smartphones but still continue to lack access to traditional banking services and financial products, we need to be doing all we can to simplify the process and encourage account openings through these platforms.  The MOBILE Act is a strong step in that direction, and I have been proud to join the bill as a cosponsor. I encourage Members to vote ``yes.''  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

441,topic-id,354,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, currently, the Home Owners' Loan Act imposes limitations on the portfolio mix of loans and investments that a thrift institution can make. Such limitations include the amount of commercial and consumer loans that a thrift can hold and a requirement that they hold a certain percentage of qualified thrift investments. These restrictions are not currently faced by national banks and other financial institutions.  If a thrift decides that it wants to engage in more commercial lending or otherwise seeks to expand its product offerings beyond what is allowed under current law, they have to undergo a time-consuming process of converting the stock form of their organization in order to apply for a national bank charter. For smaller thrifts in particular, the charter conversion process can be costly.  H.1426 solves this problem by amending the Home Owners' Loan Act and creating an election process for thrifts to operate as a national bank without having to convert their charter to a national bank.  This proposal originated from former Comptroller Curry in 2014 to give thrifts flexibility with respect to the current limitations on the amount of commercial and consumer loans that a thrift can hold.  While the terms and conditions of a charter are important, we should be careful about blurring lines. Therefore, I am pleased that the OCC can reject providing the flexibility to a particular thrift under this bill and can take other supervisory actions to promote safety and soundness.  According to the FDIC, there were 768 thrifts as of last September, compared to nearly 5,000 State and national banks, and all but 15 of these thrifts have less than $10 billion in assets, which underscores that this bill will mostly help small institutions better serve their communities.  Former Comptroller Curry described the proposal as a tool for enabling ``Federal thrifts to diversify their loan portfolios, maintain their Federal charter, and retain the OCC as their regulator.''  I thank Mr.Rothfus and Mr.Himes for introducing this bipartisan bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

466,topic-id,319,"Mr.Speaker, H.2255, the HOME Act introduced by Mr.Trott and Mr.Himes amends the Truth in Lending Act to allow fee appraisers to voluntarily donate their appraisals to non-profit groups without violating the requirement that lenders and their agents compensate fee appraisers at a rate that is customary and reasonable.  Historically, appraisal services relating to no- or low-interest mortgage loans that were provided by non-profit organizations or to families often had to be donated by professional appraisers in the community and considered permissible charitable donations for tax purposes.  However, such non-profit organizations like Habitat for Humanity, have raised concerns this provision reduced the number of families it could serve because the voluntary donation of appraisal services could now be interpreted as a violation of the TILA's ``customary and reasonable'' fee requirement.  While the CFPB--under the direction of former-Director Richard Cordray--has already provided non-profit organizations like Habitat with informal guidance suggesting that the ``customary and reasonable'' provision does not apply to donated appraisals because the appraiser is no longer a ``fee appraiser'' in this circumstance, these organizations have continued to raise concerns and are seeking further clarity.  Specifically, non-profit organizations continue to raise concerns that they remain vulnerable to enforcement actions because this guidance appears to be inconsistent with the common industry usage of the term ``fee appraiser''; they also contend that it remains unclear whether or not other agencies would align with the CFPB's interpretation.  Thus, this bill provides the non-profits with the certainty they are seeking, and builds upon the great work already done by former Director Cordray by clarifying appraisers can voluntarily donate their appraisal services without violating TILA's ``customary and reasonable'' fee provision.

306,topic-id,712,"Mr.Speaker, I first want to start by associating myself with the remarks of my chairwoman and suggest to this body that it is time for Congress to begin to govern and run the day-to-day operation of the Government of the United States in a timely fashion.  Mr.Speaker, this is the third iteration of the fiscal year 2018 Defense Appropriations Act that has been brought to the floor. I, for one, have[[Page H720]]nothing more to say about the merits of this legislation that would not be redundant. However, I do want to reiterate my profound respect for the exceptional work that has been put into this legislation, time and time again, by Chairwoman Granger, all of the members of our subcommittee, and our superlative staff.  Today, January 30, 2018, Congress is 122 days late. We are 122 days past the start of the current fiscal year and 122 days past the time that the legislation we are considering today for the third time should have been completed, conferenced, and signed into law.  Mr.Speaker, we have a number problem. As an appropriator, I ask for a number to craft a bill that, by law, does not violate the Budget Control We need a number so that Chairwoman Granger, our subcommittee members, and I can make decisions on how best to move forward so our military leaders are not hindered and forced to comply with the constraints of continuing resolutions. As an appropriator, all I want is a number. Give us a number, and we will finish our work for this fiscal year and give the certainty that has been repeatedly asked for by the Department of Defense and our 17 intelligence agencies.  Unfortunately, operating under the fourth continuing resolution and passing essentially the same Defense Appropriations measure for a third time does nothing--nothing--to solve the number problem, nor does it remedy the slight inconvenience that this bill exceeds the Budget Control Act by $35 billion.  Today's legislation does recognize this inconvenience by obviating sequestration. I guess that is what passes as budget control in these days in this  Some may say that we must pass this bill today to support our men and women in uniform. I would respond by saying that today's 60 minutes of theater continues to avoid meaningfully addressing the needs of our troops. If we were serious about that, we would have solved our number problem and allowed the chair and ranking member of the full committee, and the subcommittee chairs and ranking members of all 12 committees, to negotiate a realistic budget figure last summer so that we could have completed our bill last That would be helping our troops.  I would also add that if we don't agree to an overall domestic discretionary number, then we will continue to disinvest in the true security of this Nation--our people.  We need a domestic number so we can make decisions and give direction to all Federal agencies so they can plan on how to best invest in our national economy, jobs, and the health and prosperity of our people. The International Trade Commission needs direction so they can fully enforce our trade laws. Customs and Border Protection needs direction. This government needs timely decisions and certainty.  According to the Department of Defense, 71 percent of people aged 17 to 24 years of age in the United States would fail to qualify for military enlistment because of physical or mental health issues, low educational scores, or major criminal convictions. General Joseph Dunford, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has testified that the strength of the United States military is a direct reflection of the strength of U.society.  I would propose that improving the strength of our country is not just a robust defense number that I desperately want. We need a robust domestic number that allows for the critical investments necessary for the success of our economy, the creation of jobs, and for the people of this country.  Our number problem is solvable. Give us a negotiated budget number so we can stop wasting everybody's time and the money of the American taxpayers. Then we can truly start supporting the strength of our national security, our troops, and our national economy.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

1053,topic-id,393,"Mr.President, I want to echo a number of the comments my friend, the chairman, the Senator from North Carolina made. Ten days ago, we asked for reauthorization of section 702, and I came to this floor and advocated that this was a critically important tool. Part of the reforms of that legislation would even give us more insight into how that tool was used. We said, at that point, not only to those Members who didn't agree with us on that but to all of the Members--for that matter, the American people--that the Intelligence Committee would continue its vigorous oversight of that program and other programs.  Being on the Intelligence Committee, at least until recently, has not been necessarily all that high attention and profile. We spend hundreds and hundreds of hours every month in a One of the things I find so rewarding about the Intelligence Committee's work is that on issue after issue, you couldn't tell who is a Democrat and We all take extraordinarily serious our oversight responsibilities.  If this exemption is granted, you could potentially have an administration--any administration--go off and take on covert activities, for example, with no ability for our committee, which spends the time and has the oversight, to say timeout or to say we actually disagree with that policy.  I have been very disturbed about the whole process that arose in the House, how it was attempted to get slipped in. I hope, as well as the chairman, that no Member would choose to object. If they do choose to object, I hope they will be able to explain to the American public why they would want to remove the Intelligence Committee's ability to monitor, and then if we make a decision, withdraw funds if we don't agree and have that ongoing tool that is one of the most key components of our oversight responsibility--why they would want to, in effect, give any administration, for that matter, a blank check.  Again, my hope is no one will object to this request; that we will continue the policies that existed for as long as I have been on the committee; and that those of us on that committee will continue to take the responsibility of oversight very seriously and will continue to do it in a bipartisan way.  With that, I yield back to the chairman.  ",CREC-2018-01-22-pt1-PgS430-2.txt,1897,CLARIFYING ACCEPTANCE OF DONATED MORTGAGE APPRAISALS BY NONPROFIT,2018.0,22.0,January

15,topic-id,786,"Mr.President, I am concerned that as Chair of the Fed, Governor Powell will roll back critical rules that help guard against another financial crisis, and that is simply a risk we cannot afford.  While big banks have bounced back from the 2008 financial crisis and are posting record profits, many American families are still trying to rebuild their lives 10 years later. Yet Governor Powell seems to think that the 1 problem with our current financial system is that we are too hard on the banks. In his confirmation hearing, he said that he would ``continue to consider appropriate ways to ease regulatory burdens.'' When I asked him if there were a single financial rule he thought should be stronger--just a single provision in one of the Fed's dozens of rules where there might be an unintended loophole or where an innovative product has introduced a new risk into the system--he couldn't name a single one. Not one.  In my questions for the record, I also asked Governor Powell about a report that the Treasury Department put out last This report was really just a cut-and-paste job of the banking lobbyists' wish lists for rule rollbacks. Governor Powell could not identify any recommendations in that report that he disagreed with. Again, not a single one.  That is not all. At Governor Powell's confirmation hearing, when my Republican colleague Senator Kennedy asked him about whether there are any institutions today that are too big to fail, Governor Powell said: ``I would say no to that.'' Governor Powell expanded on that statement in his answers to my written questions, saying that ``we have made enough progress that the failure of one of our most systemically important financial institutions, while undoubtedly posing a severe shock to the economy, could more likely than not be resolved without critically undermining the financial stability of the United States.''  First of all, that is an incredibly narrow definition of what too big to fail means. But second of all, and more importantly, Governor Powell's view is out of step with the mainstream of serious experts. Giant institutions still have the ability to blow up our economy, and that is the biggest problem facing the Fed and other regulators.  I am deeply concerned that as soon as Governor Powell unpacks his boxes in the Chairman's office, he will begin weakening the new rules that Congress and the Fed had put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, and he will have help. Right down the hall will be his close friend, Randal Quarles, the Fed's new Vice Chair for Governor Powell told me when we met that he intended to rely a lot on Vice Chair Quarles on regulatory issues. That is a really dangerous prospect.  Before coming to the Fed, Vice Chair Quarles spent more than a decade in private equity, where he made his mark arguing for weaker rules on big banks--and he has gotten a running start now that he is in the In a speech a few weeks ago at his old private equity firm, Quarles announced that he was working on reducing capital standards for Wall Street banks, weakening the Volcker rule, and making stress tests easier for big banks to pass. In other words, he has already set up his to-do list to gut measures put in place after the financial crisis that are there to try to keep our economy safer.  So Governor Powell says that he will take his cues from a guy who wants to get rid of as many rules as he can and take the teeth out of the rules that he can't. No thank you. That will make American families less safe. It will make the American economy less safe.  To make matters worse, Powell's gifts to the giant banks will come at a time when banks of all sizes made gigantic profits last year and got giant tax giveaways in the bill that was passed in Good grief, when will enough be enough for these guys? But even with the banks rolling in money, the army of lobbyists and executives have come back, storming Capitol Hill and the halls of the Fed, spinning a story that financial rules are throttling them and need to be cut back.  We need a Fed Chair who can stand up to Wall Street and think about the needs of working families in this country. We need someone who believes in the toughest rules for banks, not in weaker rules for banks. That person is not Governor  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

55,topic-id,1253,"Mr.President, I want to thank the senior Senator from Washington for her leadership on this important issue and for gathering women to come to the floor today to talk about the Republican bill that has been proposed and that we will be voting on soon.  When I was a girl growing up in Oklahoma, women got abortions. Make no mistake, abortions were illegal back then, but women got them. Desperate women turned to back-alley butchers, and some even tried the procedure on their own, using coat hangers or drinking turpentine. Some were lucky, but some weren't. Some women bled to death. Some died of infection. Some were poisoned. And they all went through hell.  In 1973, the Supreme Court stepped in. Forty-five years after Roe v. Wade, abortions are safer than getting your tonsils out. A lot of women are alive today because of Nearly 70 percent of Americans agree, Roe v. Wade is worth celebrating.  I wish I were here today to acknowledge the impact of Instead, I am here to defend it from attack.  Last week President Trump marked the anniversary of Roe v. Wade by calling for a ban on a rare category of abortions--ones that take place after 20 weeks of pregnancy. So today, the Senate is voting on a bill to do exactly that.  Let's be honest about why this vote is happening now. Today's vote is happening because politicians who have never been pregnant, who have never had an abortion, who have never had to make a wrenching decision after learning that the child they are carrying will not survive childbirth--those politicians want to score political points at the expense of women and their families.  We are having this vote today because President Trump asked for it. If it passes, this unconstitutional bill would put women's lives and women's health at risk. Government officials who seek to insert themselves between women and their doctors ought to listen to the women whose lives are on the line and the doctors who care for them. If they were listening right now, we wouldn't be holding this vote.  Only 1 percent of abortions take place at 21 weeks or later, and the reasons are heartbreaking. I have heard from people across Massachusetts who shared their devastating stories. The Senate should hear these stories.  One woman who wrote to me explained that she was ecstatic to have a second child but learned late in her pregnancy that her daughter's brain was severely malformed. She said:       Being a grown woman with a husband and daughter, I never      imagined that I would need to [get an abortion]. But when I      learned that the baby I was carrying suffered from a set of      severe brain malformations, I faced a binary choice for her:      peace or life. . . . I am deeply grateful that I was able to      give her the gift of peace.  She and her husband did what they thought was best for their baby girl. They got an abortion in the third trimester.  Another couple chose to get an abortion at 22 weeks, after learning that their son's heart would never fully develop. The husband wrote to me:       His pulmonary veins did not connect to his heart in the      right place. He had ventricular septal defect, an atrial      septal defect . . . and the left side of his heart was      smaller than his right. . . . We hoped to be eligible for in-     utero heart surgery, but our fetal cardiologists told us that      our son's heart could not be fixed. Our little boy--our      miracle--wasn't going to make it.  He described their choice as an act of mercy. He said:       My wife and I are both pro-life, and we would never      encourage an abortion. [But] there isn't a day that I regret      what we did because we both believe our child is watching      over us from a safer place. There also isn't a day I wonder      who else could possibly understand what we went through. No      law can save my child from his complex congenital heart      disease, or save my wife from her suffering.  But the bill we are voting on today says that the government should have been part of that decision--no, not just part of that decision. It would have allowed the government to make that decision, instead of leaving the choice to these brokenhearted parents.  The bill we are considering today would ban all abortions after 20 weeks, with only limited exceptions. It would force women to carry an unviable fetus to term. It would force women with severe health complications to stay pregnant until their lives were on the line. Whatever you believe about abortion generally, this legislation is dangerous and cruel.  Devastating fetal abnormalities aren't the only reason women get abortions after 20 weeks. Some women face so many delays when seeking an abortion, like finding a provider, raising money for the procedure, and paying for travel costs--so many delays that a procedure they wanted earlier in pregnancy gets pushed later and later. These logistical hurdles fall hardest on young people, on women of color, and on low-income communities.  What is behind some of these delays? State-level abortion restrictions pushed through by Republican legislatures that close down clinics and make it harder for women to get access to the care they need. You heard that right. Republican-sponsored abortion restrictions push women to have abortions later and later, and today, Republicans in the Senate push a bill to ban late abortions. It is all connected.  This bill is only one part of a broad and sustained assault by Republican politicians on women's rights to make decisions about their own bodies. Through repeated efforts to limit birth control access, to defund Planned Parenthood, and to restrict abortions, Republicans are chipping away at women's health, women's safety, and women's economic independence.  If Mitch McConnell or Paul Ryan or Donald Trump actually wanted to reduce abortions, they could embrace policies that would lessen the economic pressures of pregnancy and of motherhood. They could act to help pregnant women and their babies access healthcare early and often. They could help young women avoid unwanted pregnancies in the first place.  Instead, they have spent the last year doing exactly the opposite. They have held vote after vote to try to gut the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid, when we should be expanding those programs. Affordable healthcare, accessible contraceptives, and other programs that support working women and families are all under attack. And today, Republican politicians want to distract from their hypocrisy with an unconstitutional 20-week abortion ban--one that will not pass, that ignores the actual experiences of women, and would cause enormous harm if it were signed into law.  Today's vote, which we all know will fail, isn't about policy; it is about political theater. But women don't get abortions to prove a political point. Reproductive rights are about health. They are about safety. And this particular vote about banning abortions at 20 weeks is about a bunch of politicians intruding on one of the most wrenching decisions that a woman will ever make.  It has been 45 years since Roe v. Wade; 45 years since women gained the constitutional right to a safe, legal abortion; 45 years since the days of illegal abortions. I have lived in that I have lived in the world of back-alley butchers and wrecked lives. And we are not going back--not now, not ever.  Thank you.

221,topic-id,1203,"Mr.President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote against the confirmation of Alex Azar to serve as Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, or When Congress confirms somebody to be HHS Secretary, they are putting that person in charge of some of the most important decisions made by the Federal Government--decisions that touch the lives of every family in The safety of the food inside our refrigerators, the quality of our nursing homes where our grandmothers live, the price of our health insurance policy, the government's response to a flu outbreak--on these issues and many, many more, the HHS Secretary calls the shots.  When Congress debated Tom Price's nomination to be Secretary of Health and Human Services 1 year ago, I said that we should not hand over the keys to this agency unless we were absolutely sure that he would put the American people first every minute of every day. And let's be honest: Tom Price did not clear that bar; he didn't even come close. When he was nominated, Tom Price already had a track record of using his position in government to help exactly one person: Tom But Senate Republicans were so excited to get started gutting the Affordable Care Act and ripping up Medicaid that they jammed his nomination through without a single Democratic vote.  It turns out we are looking at someone whose record is a pretty good way to judge how they are going to fight for the American people. Tom Price didn't spend his time as HHS Secretary working for American families; he spent it burning taxpayer dollars as he flew around on private jets and military aircraft. During the 8 months Tom Price was on the job, he put his own interests before those of the American people--again and again.  Now President Trump has nominated Alex Azar to be Tom Price's replacement as Secretary of Republicans have been trying to spin Mr.Azar as a breath of fresh air--someone who can be trusted to stay off private jets while he helps them carry out their plans to gut the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid without attracting quite so much unwanted attention.  The American people aren't fooled by the spin because in the ways that matter most, Alex Azar is like Tom Mr.Azar's resume reads like a how-to manual for profiting off government service. About a decade ago, he worked in government, helping regulate the Nation's most profitable drug companies. When he left, he shot straight through the revolving door and became an executive at Eli Lilly drug company. Last year, they paid him more than $3.5 million. Not bad. Now he wants to swing right back through the revolving door again and once again regulate those same drug companies--regulate them at least until he decides to spin through the revolving door again and make more money from drug companies.  I don't think private sector experience should disqualify anyone from serving. I am rooting as hard as anyone for an HHS Secretary who actually cares about the job. But the American people deserve to know that the person running HHS is looking out for them and not for his own bank accounts or for the profits of his former employer or what makes him more marketable to his next employer.  That is why Mr.Azar faced some very tough questions in his confirmation hearing before the HELP Committee about whether he would be willing to hold giant drug companies accountable when they break the law. After all, he worked for Eli Lilly while they were cleaning up the mess after being forced to pay the largest criminal fine of its kind in U.history--a punishment for lying about one of its drugs and peddling that drug to nursing homes as a treatment for dementia and Alzheimer's with no proof that it worked. The word for that, by the way, is ``fraud.'' Eli Lilly's scheme cost the government, and taxpayers, billions of dollars.  Mr.Azar started out by saying the right thing about this. He said:       Oh, that sort of behavior is unacceptable. Of course,      anyone who breaks the law should be held accountable.[[Page S461]]  Sounds great. But then I scratched the surface just a little. When I pressed just a little bit harder and asked him to give the American people something more than a polished talking point, he started dancing around in his chair, bobbing, weaving, doing everything he could to avoid answering the question. Mr.Azar said he believed lawbreakers should be held accountable. I asked him five separate times during his confirmation hearing whether he thought Eli Lilly's settlement represented adequate accountability for the company's illegal behavior--five times in a row. He dodged, he danced, and he refused to give a straight answer. I asked him twice whether CEOs should be held personally accountable when drug companies like Eli Lilly break the law. Both times, he squirmed away from the question like it was some kind of snake that would bite him.  The American people deserve better than an HHS Secretary who struggles to answer the question of whether giant drug companies and their CEOs should face the music when they cheat taxpayers and lie about drugs.  On the topic of the Affordable Care Act, it is the same story all over again. Mr.Azar spent his whole confirmation hearing before the HELP Committee pretending that the Trump administration hasn't been trying to rip up healthcare coverage for tens of millions of He sat before the committee, like butter wouldn't melt in his mouth, saying things like ``Oh, I don't think the Administration wanted fewer people to enroll in health insurance coverage. I'm sure they just cut the enrollment period in half because they thought it would improve access to insurance.'' He actually said that.  When I heard that, I wondered if he thought we were stupid. His answer was so ridiculous that I even asked him a followup question in writing to make sure I had it right, and he responded--think about this--that when the Trump administration cut the period of time that people could enroll for health insurance, he said, ``I do not agree with the characterization that the Administration or the Department has made an effort to undercut open enrollment.'' You can't make this stuff up.  Republicans want to pretend that Alex Azar is totally different from Tom Price because Tom Price was a terrible HHS Secretary who didn't put the American people first. I don't see the difference. I see someone who doesn't want to say it out loud but who intends to behave exactly like Tom Price when he sits down behind Tom Price's old desk. He will support efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, gut efforts to enroll people in health insurance, and take Medicaid away from people who need it the most.  No one here should be fooled. This week is the 1-year anniversary of Tom Price's confirmation hearing before the Senate, and we know how that ended.  The American people deserve better. They deserve an HHS Secretary who will put them first. I will be voting against Alex Azar because I don't believe he meets that standard.  Mr.President, I yield.

I wish, once again, to thank our law enforcement and first responders for their heroism, and I would also like to recognize Marshall County Judge-Executive Kevin Neal for his leadership when his community needed it the most.  For most of us, this tragedy is barely even conceivable, but to the parents of Bailey Holt and Preston Cope, it is now a painful reality. Bailey Holt was 15 years old, and her mother said that she had a ``perfect, sweet soul.'' She has been described as compassionate, confident, and comfortable being herself. When she wasn't busy cheering for the University of Louisville Cardinals, Bailey was always ready with a kind word or a friendly gesture for those who needed it.  On social media, her family and friends are using the expression ``Be Like Bailey,'' encouraging everyone who sees it to act with charity.  Preston Cope, who was also 15, was known for being kind, soft-spoken, and a quick learner. He loved reading about history and playing baseball for Marshall County High School and the Calvert City Preston's friends remember his ability to inspire them and to make them laugh.  One of Bailey and Preston's classmates called them ``the nicest people I ever met. They never had anything negative to say. They always had a smile on their face.''  This weekend, friends and family gathered at the high school gym by the hundreds to remember Bailey and Preston and to comfort one another.  As the other injured students fight to recover and the entire Marshall County community continues to grieve and heal, they will have Bailey and Preston's example to draw on and they will have the prayers of their fellow Kentuckians, of us here in the Senate, and of the entire country.                           Work of the Senate  Mr.President, on an entirely different matter, a great deal of work remains in the Senate in the coming days. Bipartisan discussions continue on a variety of important issues, including immigration, border security, disaster relief, healthcare, and funding for our Armed With our February 8 deadline fast approaching, it is vital that we continue these serious and constructive talks.  Last week, the administration provided its framework for immigration legislation. As I noted, it builds upon the four pillars for reform that the President has consistently put forth and indicates what is necessary for him to sign a bill into law. As discussions continue in the Senate on the subject of immigration, Members on both sides of the aisle should look to this framework as they work toward an agreement.  The President's proposal has received praise as a serious effort to solve some of the problems with our broken immigration system. Not surprisingly with a subject this complicated, it has also received criticism from both the right and the left. Constructive critiques are one thing, but the type of irresponsible racial invective used yet again on this subject by the Democratic leader of the House is decidedly unhelpful.  These comments are precisely the kind of divisive partisanship that dim the prospects that a bipartisan compromise could become law. The American people elected us to legislate, not to trade insults. To resolve President Obama's unlawfully established DACA Program and other important issues in immigration, I would urge my Democratic colleagues to put serious, good-faith discussions ahead of cheap, partisan point scoring.                       Nomination of David Stras  Mr.President, now on another matter. These negotiations aren't the only important business before us this week. We will also consider another of President Trump's well-qualified judicial nominees, David Stras, of Minnesota, to serve on the U.Court of Appeals for the Eighth Judge Stras serves as an associate justice of the Minnesota Supreme Three of his former colleagues on that court, now retired, praised him in an open letter last year for his sterling academic record, his considerable experience, and his ability to hear cases ``with objectivity and an open mind.''  Their testimony confirmed Judge Stras's well-known reputation for thoughtfulness, fairness, and intellectual excellence. I look forward to voting to advance his nomination and to send this capable jurist to the Federal bench.  Mr.President, the Senate will vote to take up a measure to ensure that the most vulnerable in our society are granted the protection they deserve under law. The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act reflects a growing mainstream consensus--mainstream consensus--that unborn children should not be subjected to elective abortion after 20 weeks.  There are only seven countries left in the world that permit this, including,[[Page S531]]unfortunately, the United States, along with China and North It is long past time that we heeded both science and commonsense morality and remove ourselves from this very undistinguished list.  Some refer to this legislation as Micah's Law in honor of a little boy who was born premature at just 22 weeks. Today, Micah Pickering is a healthy 5-year-old boy. He shows what can happen when we give life a chance.  This afternoon, every one of us will go on record on this issue. On the commonsense side of this issue are 63 percent of Americans, according to a recent survey, and every other country in the world, save seven. There is no reason why this should be a partisan issue. I hope our Democratic colleagues will not obstruct the Senate from taking up this bill.  I urge every one of my colleagues to join me in voting to advance it this afternoon.                       State of the Union Address  Mr.President, now, on a final matter, the President delivers his first State of the Union Address tomorrow. I am especially looking forward to his remarks on tax reform and the state of our economy. Already hundreds of businesses have announced significant bonuses, pay increases, new jobs, and expanded benefits. Just last week, we learned that Verst Logistics, which is based in Walton, KY, and employs nearly 1,600, has distributed bonuses to full-time employees. The company's CEO told workers: ``I want to be sure that you and your families share in the benefits of your accomplishments and the new tax reform legislation.''  When I hear my Democratic colleagues denigrate tax reform bonuses as ``crumbs,'' I think about workers like these. I think about the Verst worker who came to her boss with tears in her eyes when she received word of her bonus. It was She and her husband had recently had their fifth child. Money was tight. Mom and dad had enough saved up to buy gifts for the kids but were planning to skip presents for each other, but tax reform changed that. Thanks to the tax reform bonus she earned, this employee and her husband could go out to a nice dinner and buy each other Christmas gifts after all. The CEO says he has never been hugged so hard in his life.  It is a shame that none of my Democratic colleagues voted for tax reform--not a single one of them--and it is jarring to hear some of them now denigrate the pay increases and the benefits that only wealthy people could deem insignificant. Maybe in San Francisco or New York an extra $500 or $1,000 is no big deal, but try telling that to families in North Dakota, Missouri, and Try telling that to that mother of five. I suspect you would get an earful.  Tomorrow evening when the President describes tax reform's impact for middle-class Americans, every one of us should stand and applaud.  I yield the floor.

After a year of Pruitt at the helm of EPA--a tenure that has been marked by mass staff departures, a slowdown in enforcement actions, questionable travel and other personal spending, rolling back critical clean air and clean water protections, a purge of scientists, an influx of industry insiders, a smorgasbord of meetings with industry bigwigs, many of whom coincidentally also bankrolled his political career back in Oklahoma, an obsession with secrecy, and heaps and heaps and heaps of climate denial--Pruitt will finally be appearing before our committee. I urge my Republican colleagues on EPW to bring some good questions to tomorrow's hearing.  Judging by Pruitt's first year, he is running dangerously amok. He has turned EPA into perhaps the swampiest Agency in a very swampy administration. Pruitt's record at EPA demands the sort of oversight this body used to exercise. If you don't believe this about Pruitt's record, just take a look at what some distinguished Republicans have to say. William Ruckelshaus, who under both Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan ran the EPA, has criticized Pruitt's penchant for secrecy in this Washington Post op-ed contrasting it with his own more transparent management style. He said:       We release[d] my full schedule and the publication of      written communications on a daily basis . . . Scott Pruitt is      taking the absolute opposite approach. Pruitt operates in      secrecy.  In an interview with HuffPost, former New Jersey Governor and chairman of the 9/11 Commission, Tom Kean, is also troubled by Pruitt's fixation with secrecy. I think this New York Times op-ed makes his opinion clear. He writes:       [T]o satisfy his penchant for secrecy, [Pruitt] is      installing--at a cost of nearly $25,000 to taxpayers--a      secure phone booth in his Washington office to keep people,      including staff members, in the dark.  Imagine that. While demanding massive cuts to EPA's budget, Pruitt is spending thousands of dollars to build himself, like Maxwell Smart, a cone of silence. He doesn't run the He doesn't run the He doesn't even run the State What possible purpose could this very expensive, secure phone booth have at the Environmental Protection Agency?  Governor Kean believes Pruitt is doing this to keep his own staff members in the dark, which begs the question: What does Pruitt have to hide from his own staff? It sounds like a question my Republican colleagues on EPW should ask him tomorrow.  Pruitt's wasteful spending isn't just limited to his cone of silence. As Governor Kean points out, Pruitt has used private jets costing taxpayers another $58,000. His princely habits have even prompted questions from Senator So I ask my EPW Republican colleagues: If Senator Grassley is troubled by Pruitt's wasteful spending of taxpayers' money on personal luxuries, shouldn't you ask him about it at tomorrow's hearing?  Pruitt's penchant for secrecy goes well beyond the expensive cone of silence that was designed to keep his own staff in the dark. It also extends to his schedule, where he tries to keep the American people in the dark. Unlike Ruckelshaus and previous EPA Administrators, Pruitt will not even disclose whom he is meeting or when he is traveling. As Governor Kean notes, our only idea of the folks he is meeting comes from the Freedom of Information Once EPA finally released the first few months of Pruitt's calendars in response to a FOIA request, that is when we learned he was meeting with scores of industry fat cats and almost no environmental groups.  As for his travels, we only find out about them after the fact, which of course prevents the press from covering Pruitt, say, when he jets off to Morocco to lobby for American natural gas producers. One of my Republican colleagues on EPW might want to ask Pruitt why he is jetting around the world playing Commerce Secretary for the fossil fuel industry when he should be working here at home in America to protect people's health and their environment.  What does Governor Kean have to say about Pruitt's industry ties? ``He has elevated cronyism to new heights.'' Those are Governor's Kean's words, not mine.  In an interview with HuffPost just this past Friday, Mr.Ruckelshaus echoed this concern that Pruitt cares more about his political ties than protecting the environment. ``He's just like Trump,'' Ruckelshaus said. ``He's got an ideological approach to it, an approach that affects the large contributors in his party in Oklahoma.''  Here again, Republican colleagues on EPW might want to ask Pruitt about his close ties with industry and whether he is working for the fossil fuel interests that donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to his political activities back in Oklahoma or working for the American people. Governor Kean goes on to say that Pruitt ``built his[[Page S532]]political career by attacking clean-air and clean-water rules'' and that he is ``blocking scientific input,'' which brings us to science.  Science, of course, gives society its headlights to look ahead and see oncoming hazards. Without science, if we ignore it or block it, as Governor Kean says Pruitt is doing, the decisions we make are simply uninformed and irrational, and Governor Kean and I aren't the only ones who think this.  Yet another high-profile Republican, the former New Jersey Governor and George Bush EPA Administrator, Christine Todd Whitman, agrees. Pruitt claims he will pursue so-called ``red team/blue team'' exercises instead of the long-established gold standard peer review process for rigorously evaluating science. Governor Whitman sees right through that.       [D]ecisions must be based on reliable science. The red team      begins with his politically preferred conclusion that climate      change isn't a problem, and it will seek evidence to justify      that position. That's the opposite of how science works.  Pruitt doesn't want to follow the scientific method, at least not when it comes to climate science or any other science, for that matter, that his industry backers object to. He wants to fabricate a case for his industry backers' politically preferred hypothesis. This isn't science. This is a counterfeit of science. As Governor Whitman writes, ``True science follows the evidence. . . . Government bases policy on those results. This applies to liberals and conservatives alike,'' or at least that is the way it used to be before Scott Pruitt turned the keys over to polluting industries.  So, EPW Republicans, there is another question for you to ask Pruitt tomorrow: How does he justify throwing out the real scientists and the real science in order to arrive so predictably at the fossil fuel industry's preferred conclusions?  Governor Whitman calls Pruitt's climate denial scheming ``a waste of the government's time, energy, and resources, and a slap in the face to fiscal responsibility and responsible governance.'' It is, in her words, ``shameful,'' ``unjustifiable,'' and a ``wild goose chase.'' It sounds like more great questions for EPW Republicans to ask Pruitt tomorrow: How does he justify spending taxpayers' money on his backers' climate denial schemes.  This question is particularly relevant in light of Pruitt's campaign to radically cut EPA's budget and staff. Under his tenure, EPA staff has been reduced to the lowest level in more than 30 years. EPW Republicans, take note because here is another question you can ask Pruitt tomorrow: How can he justify spending taxpayer money on frivolities like his Maxwell Smart cone of silence or personal luxuries like exorbitant private travel or crazy climate denial schemes all while demanding drastic cuts to the people who do the real work of protecting the public at his Agency?  In an interview, Governor Whitman said she ``would like to see [EPA's] budget have enough in it to ensure we are enforcing the regulations we have in place,'' a fairly conservative notion. As she notes, EPA enforcement actions are slowing down ``in some instances fairly dramatically because they've cut the budget for the number of enforcement agents.'' You can't do cleanups or police polluters without money and people, both of which Pruitt is looking to cut. Simply put, Pruitt's so-called back-to-basics campaign is a smokescreen to hide his attempts to gut the Agency he is supposed to lead because it will make his industry backers happy.  Once again, I ask my EPW Republican colleagues: Will you confront Pruitt about his sham promises to get back to basics while he is really just cutting staff and resources and reducing enforcement?  Governor Kean speaks for many Americans when he writes, ``For the sake of our children's health, it's time for Scott Pruitt to go.'' When you are hearing that from the Republican side, it is worth listening.  Pruitt's tenure at the EPA has been an unmitigated disaster for public health, for the environment, and for the future of the planet we call home. Its only value is if you have some peculiar connoisseur interest in government corruption to watch all the many ways in which industry can work its will within its supposed regulator.  Tomorrow, those of us who sit on the Environment and Public Works Committee have an important opportunity to put the Senate's oversight authority to good use and expose how badly Pruitt is in the pocket of the polluters he is supposed to police. I sincerely hope that my Republican colleagues on EPW will seize the opportunity. You can be sure that my Democratic colleagues and I will.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2018-01-29-pt1-PgS527-6.txt,1823,FEDERAL SAVINGS ASSOCIATION CHARTER FLEXIBILITY ACT OF 2017,2018.0,29.0,January
82,topic-id,913,"Mr.President, Senator Blumenthal and I have come to the floor with a shared concern that the raiding parties are circling the Mueller investigation and preparing for an attack on that investigation.  We see this with collateral attacks on individual members of law enforcement. We see this with efforts to discredit the FBI and the Department of Justice in general. We have seen it even with Presidential tweets seeking to discredit folks who might be witnesses before a grand jury, which would, with the right state of mind, actually amount to obstruction of justice itself.  The first thing I want to say is that the Senate is entitled to a full and truthful explanation of why Deputy Director McCabe of the FBI left. We do not know the reason behind his sudden, abrupt departure. But we do know that Sally Yates was fired; we do know that Jim Comey was fired; we do know that Bob Mueller was not fired only because White House Counsel threw himself in front of that decision by President Trump and said: If you do that, I am out.  So firings at the top of our Department of Justice are becoming an unpleasantly frequent thing, and they tend to relate to matters where investigations touch on the White House: Sally Yates and the Flynn investigation; Jim Comey and the obstruction of justice, Russia collusion investigation; and, of course, Bob Mueller leading that investigation. I think we are entitled to answers, and I call for a full and truthful explanation.  The second thing going on is the more general attack on the FBI, the latest episode of which is this so-called Nunes memo, which has been described by Democratic House Members who have seen that memo and the underlying documents out of which it was selectively cherry-picked as profoundly misleading. It had the political purpose of spreading a false narrative--the political purpose of spreading a false narrative. This is like the information operations the Kremlin used to run against the free world if they had a political purpose of spreading a false narrative.  They also said it has the purpose of undermining legitimate investigations. Guess which legitimate investigations they mean.  This business of selectively cherry-picking things out of classified information to spread a false narrative has a very unpleasant echo for me because this is what the Bush administration was up to when it was trying to defend the torture program. They selectively declassified, for instance, that Abu Zubaydah had been the subject of what they called their enhanced interrogation techniques program and that he had produced important, actionable intelligence. What they did not declassify was that all the actionable intelligence he gave them had been provided before they started on the torture techniques. Then, once the pros from Dover came down--who didn't know anything about how to interrogate somebody but only knew how to do torture techniques--he clammed up, and that was the last actionable intelligence we got out of him. So deliberately misleading by selectively declassifying is an established technique, and it is one that is both shady and dangerous.  The process by which this so-called Nunes report or memo came out smells. It is the first ever invocation of an obscure House rule allowing for the selective declassification of material. It happened on a purely partisan vote. Trump's own appointees to the Department of Justice have called efforts to release the memo ``extraordinarily reckless.'' Yet, on a purely partisan vote, using this previously never used rule, they are putting the selectively cherry-picked false narrative out into the public debate.  Why are they steaming ahead with a report that Ranking Member Adam Schiff says ``contains significant errors of fact, mischaracterizations, and omits critical context and detail''? At the same time, they are pulling one more procedural stunt, which is to stall for at least a week a Democratic report that would rebut and expose the misleading character of the Republicans' document.  The only conceivable purpose is to take the false narrative and give it a headstart of a week so that the poison gets out into our information system. Sure enough, they are pounding away at getting that information out. FOX News is already whipping it up, talking about how it is going to be a bombshell and explosive. The House Freedom Caucus has Trump revved up about the memo, urging him to support its release--against the advice of his own law enforcement and national security officials.  Over at Breitbart, FOX News, and throughout the rightwing echo chamber, hashtag ``Release the Memo'' became the rallying cry. Not only was it the rallying cry of Breitbart and FOX News--guess what. It was the rallying cry of our friends, the Hashtag ``Release the Memo'' remains the most used hashtag by social media accounts associated with Russian influence operations. Even the President's son, Don junior, got involved in the game, tweeting out that ``Democrats & deep state govt officials''--I guess by that he means the Trump appointees who said that releasing this report would be extraordinarily reckless--are behind some mischief and therefore, all caps, ``RELEASE THE MEMO.''  When you see a political steamroller like that happening, when you see bizarre, peculiar, and unprecedented procedures, when you see that it is entirely partisan and against the advice of our national security officials, it is hard to draw a good conclusion about what the heck is going on.

84,topic-id,598,"Mr.President, to follow the words of my distinguished colleague from Connecticut, not only are House Republicans--to use his phrase--playing into the hands of the Russians, they are actually playing by the playbook of the If you understand the Russian information warfare, the Gerasimov doctrine, the way in which Russians--and before them, Soviets--for years tried to poison the factual environment around them, and then you put that up against this scheme where you start with the selective release of classified material that the public can't get behind because the rest is classified, the false narrative that the ranking member has pointed out that that creates, the partisan and peculiar process for getting there, the ignoring of warnings from their own national security officials about how bad this is, the convenient whipping up of all of this in far-right media at the same time, the amplification of that actually by Russian bots and other sources, and the fact that this is all pointed, not coincidentally, at the agency and officials who are engaged in investigating the Trump White House and the Trump campaign, it is so appallingly obvious what the game is that is being played here.  It is stunning to me, to follow on what Senator Blumenthal said, that we have heard nothing--at least I have heard nothing--perhaps the Senator from Connecticut can illuminate further, but I have heard nothing from our Director of National Intelligence, DNI Coats, and I have heard nothing from CIA Director Pompeo for--how long it has been? Since the very foundation of the FISA Court in the wake of Watergate, it has been an essential defense of our intelligence community that they don't want release of the FISA Court records. Now we have a partisan release that touches back to FISA applications that the Department of Justice has said is reckless. And where are they? It is astonishing that the custodians of those secrets appear to have absolutely no concern about this[[Page S574]]partisan and peculiar, selective release of classified information.  I will echo another point Senator Blumenthal made. This just happens to be happening at a time when the sanctions we voted on by massive bipartisan majorities--I can stack the votes together, House and It was something like 515 to 5. It was an enormous, bipartisan vote to sanction the Russians for what they have been doing, and that just went live. The President could impose those sanctions now. Yet he has not. What is the explanation?  The only people this President seems incapable of being tough on are It is a very unpleasant set of coincidences. At the same time, here we are with the Republican leadership in the House and the Republican leadership in the Senate and virtually every law enforcement and national security official who has come before us is saying: Hey, yeah, they did attack our last election in 2016, and they are going to attack our next election in 2018.  We are warned that a hostile foreign power is going to attack our 2018 election. Where is the legislation to defend against that? Where is the markup of the legislation? Where is the effort to do what needs to be done to defend our democracy? Here we are just a few months out from the election. We are 9 months out. Do I have the math right? It is 9 months between here and there.  Why is it that whenever the Russians come up, it seems that the Republican Party has to go into complete stasis, just roll right over.

719,topic-id,1742,"Mr.President, I begin today by adding a Rhode Island voice to the chorus of coastal communities around the country standing against President Trump's reckless and unwelcome choice to try to allow oil and gas drilling off of nearly all U.coasts.  The Rhode Island ocean economy is worth over $2 billion and employs more than 40,000 people. For whatever potential gain of fossil fuel corporations, offshore drilling introduces all sorts of hazards to our fishing industry and people who work in tourism and recreation along Narragansett  Remember how devastating the 2010 BP oilspill was in the Gulf of Mexico? This graphic depicts what a spill that size would look like off of New  The administration has tossed aside a 5-year plan that underwent multiple revisions and involved multiple agencies over multiple years taking into account the input of stakeholders and literally millions of comments from the public.  The final plan that had been developed after all that effort allowed for only 10 lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and one sale in the Cook Inlet program area off the Alaska coast. There were no lease sales allowed in the Pacific or Why? Because everybody hates it.  In ruling out drilling off our Atlantic coast, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management cited ``strong local opposition, conflicts with other ocean uses, . . . current market dynamics, . . . [and] careful consideration of the comments received from Governors of affected states.''  None of that has changed, and the Trump administration ought to listen to those coastal voices, not just the occasional Republican Governor of a coastal State seeking a political boost.  Rhode Island, the Ocean State, has come out strongly opposed to this proposal. Our Governor, Gina Raimondo, said the administration's plan is ``endangering the health of nearly all coastal waters in our country, including our 400 miles of coastline in Rhode Island, so that rich oil companies can get richer.''  Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Kilmartin vowed to ``continue to fight this latest move by the Trump administration to give the oil and gas industry carte blanche to destroy our environment.''  Rhode Island is a leader in offshore wind development. It was the first in the Nation to have steel in the water, first in the Nation to have electrons flowing to the grid. We also have vibrant fisheries and a longstanding fishing economy. We depend on our coastal economy for that, for tourism, and for many other things. Also, we are especially susceptible to sea level rise and other consequences of climate change. We are not about to go back in time and endanger our coast with the extraction of more dirty fuels.  Here in Washington, I led a bipartisan group of New England Senators seeking legislation to bar offshore drilling along our New England coast. My Rhode Island colleague, Representative David Cicilline, introduced the companion legislation in the House of The Trump administration will not be following through on its rash plan if New England's bipartisan Members of Congress have anything to say about it. The value of healthy oceans and coasts is tangible and immediate for us.  The larger backdrop to this conversation about offshore drilling is that our oceans are steadily getting sicker, even without the threat of additional oilspills. The oceans have absorbed approximately 30 percent of the excess carbon dioxide that we have added to the atmosphere since the industrial revolution began. That is changing the ocean's chemistry dramatically. The oceans have already absorbed roughly 90 percent of the excess heat trapped in the atmosphere by those greenhouse gases. We would not be living the way we have gotten used to through our development as a species if it weren't for the ocean absorbing so much of that excess heat. We owe the oceans a lot, but as a result of that excess carbon dioxide and excess heat, our oceans are warming, and because they are warming, they are rising and, as well, of course, they are growing more acidic, putting marine life, coastal communities, and ocean economies all in jeopardy.  Oceans face another emerging problem, which is deoxygenation. Oceans need oxygen, and fish and other creatures that live in the ocean need oxygen, and we are finding that there is less and less. Low-oxygen zones in the ocean are nothing new. Dead zones or areas where oxygen levels drop too low for marine life to survive occur naturally, but dead zones are worsening. They are worsening near the coasts where agricultural runoff spurs rapid blooms of phytoplankton. When the phytoplankton die, their decomposition consumes large amounts of oxygen from the water, and fish and other marine animals suffocate. We saw this just a few years ago in Narragansett Bay's Greenwich Bay area.  Now, the Gulf of Mexico routinely sees dead zones as nitrogen-rich waters[[Page S495]]flow from farms in the heartland, down the Mississippi River, and into the gulf. Last year's gulf dead zone reached record levels. NOAA, which measures these things, estimated the dead zone to be the size of New Jersey--the largest ever recorded in the Gulf of NOAA assessed that the cause was unusually heavy rains in the Midwest associated with climate change that washed large amounts of fertilizer into the river and down to the gulf.  NOAA is not alone. Last year's Climate Science Special Report, the scientific backbone for the Federal Government's Fourth National Climate Assessment, discussed the growing issue of climate change-driven ocean deoxygenation. The report did not mince words. ``Global ocean deoxygenation is a direct effect of warming.'' As water warms, it loses its capacity to absorb gases like oxygen, and warmer water circulates less, meaning there is less mixing of water and oxygen between the surface and deeper waters. The report attributes 85 percent of global oxygen loss to this stratification, as it is known, of the water.  Worldwide, ocean oxygen levels have declined. According to the Climate Science Special Report, the North Pacific, North Atlantic, Southern Ocean, subtropical South Pacific, and South Indian Oceans are all expected to experience further deoxygenation. Oxygen may drop off as much as 17 percent in the North Pacific by 2100 if we don't rein in carbon emissions.  Not surprisingly, fish and other marine wildlife try to steer clear of dead zones. If they are not able to breathe in these low-oxygen waters, they can die. Callum Roberts, a researcher at the University of York, has also warned that large and fast-moving fish that use more oxygen, like tunas, billfish, sharks, and fish like this unbelievably beautiful marlin, are being relegated to shrinking high-oxygen areas causing them to change how they hunt. A 2010 paper in Deep-Sea Research estimated that from 1960 to 2008, the areas in the ocean where oxygen levels are too low to support fish and other big ocean organisms have grown by over 1.7 million square miles--an added 1.7 million square miles with oxygen levels too low for God's beautiful creatures like this one.  One example of this phenomenon comes to us from former NOAA researcher Eric Prince, who noticed that blue marlin, a fish which is actually well known for its diving capabilities, would not leave the top hundred feet of ocean off of Costa Rica and Elsewhere, in the ocean, marlin regularly go half a mile down to hunt. The reason for constraining themselves to that top 100 feet of ocean? ``A deep, gigantic and expanding swath of water that contained too little oxygen.'' A 2011 study in Nature Climate Change estimated that over 50 years the surface ocean habitat in the tropical Northeast Atlantic used by tunas and billfish, like the blue marlin, has shrunk by 15 percent due to deoxygenation.  A study published earlier this month in the prestigious journal Science warned that though there may be a short-term fishing surge due to the crowding of fishing species into surface waters--they are easier to find because there is less oxygenated water that they are in--``[i]n the longer term, these conditions are unsustainable and may result in ecosystem collapses, which ultimately will cause societal and economic harm.''  This portends devastating effects. The World Health Organization says around 1 billion people rely on fish as their main source of protein. The U.Food and Agriculture Organization estimates 10 to 12 percent of the world's population base their livelihoods on fisheries or aquaculture. Bringing it closer to home, commercial fish landings for Rhode Island for 2016 totaled 82.5 million pounds and were valued at nearly $94 million. In 2014, the New England ocean economy was valued at over $17 billion and employed nearly a quarter of a million people. All of that is at risk as we pull out the cornerstones of our ocean ecosystem.  Here is where it actually gets a little weird. Oxygen depletion could actually spur a boom in nitrogen-breathing microorganisms--tiny microbes that breathe nitrogen instead of oxygen. They might then demand enough valuable nitrogen that they crowd out other ocean species that also need nitrogen, and these nitrogen species exhale nitrous oxide, which is a greenhouse gas which creates another possible climate change feedback loop.  As a recent Washington Post story put it, our growing understanding of ocean deoxygenation ``underscores once again that some of the most profound consequences of climate change are occurring in the oceans, rather than on land.''  As Denise Breitburg, the lead author of the recent Science paper said, ``Of course, declining oxygen isn't happening in isolation. . . . Warming itself threatens marine food webs, as does acidification caused by increased carbon dioxide in the water. But the threats are worse when combined.''  That is what we are seeing--deoxygenation, warming, acidification combined.  We recklessly ignore the warnings that the oceans are screaming at us. Scientists are seeing numbers and conditions in the oceans they have never seen before. We ignore also the high tides that now regularly flood downtowns of major cities as sea levels rise. We ignore fish species moving northward and offshore in search of cooler waters away from traditional fisheries. We ignore the oyster spat dissolving in acidic seawater before they can grow to maturity. We ignore coral reefs turning white and dying in warm, acidic seas. We ignore the record strength of warm-water-fueled 2017 hurricanes that killed people, destroyed homes, and caused billions of dollars in damage.  I wonder how long can we ignore the cries from our oceans? Truly, it is time to wake up.  I yield the floor.

31,topic-id,1321,"Mr.President, the Senate voted yesterday to reopen the government. I am glad that cooler heads and bipartisan good will prevailed before too much damage was done, but where do we go from here?  The leadership of both Houses needs to negotiate appropriations caps for the rest of this year and all of next year. We all need to do our part to make sure this is done immediately. As a matter of fact, half of that job is practically done. Our colleagues in the House have a promise from the Speaker of the House to consider a Defense appropriations bill at the spending level set by the most recent National Defense Authorization That amount is $700 billion and represents an increase of $88.6 billion over last year's enacted spending level--a welcome development. It would seem to make sense for this body to adopt that figure in the Senate bill, and the job would be halfway done. I hope our leaders will not wait until the week after next to get us an agreement on domestic spending.  Let's not approach the next few days as if the battle lines are again drawn. Rather than using the coming days to suit up for the next showdown, perhaps we can work to strengthen the Senate so that it does the governing that our Founders envisioned, the governing that the statesmen who preceded us have protected. Americans do their jobs day in and day out, and they expect the same hard work from their elected representatives in  In this regard, I would like to call attention to an op-ed by radio host Hugh Hewitt that was published online yesterday by the Washington It is titled ``How to end the Senate's astonishing dysfunction''--a pretty graphic title for an op-ed. Mr.Hewitt warns that the institution of the Senate is ``careening toward widespread contempt, as happened to its Roman predecessor even before the emperors turned it into a fancy advisory council.'' One might be inclined to agree given the events of the past few days. Indeed, we have reached an embarrassing low point where a government shutdown is wrongly used as a bargaining chip for merely political gain. Mr.Hewitt concludes, ``It would be best for both parties to head off change imposed from pressure from the outside with change organically orchestrated from within by those with care for the body and its original design.''  There are plenty of experts with ideas on how to create a more efficient and more effective Those ideas should be welcomed now. But those of us who took an oath in this Chamber and serve with the great legacy of this institution cannot stay on the sidelines. We occupy a unique position to drive reforms and to make the Senate better, ensuring its existence and its success for the next generation.  There is real hope that these reforms have already begun. For example, there has been support by both Democrats and Republicans to change the procedural rules on executive and judicial nominations, shortening postcloture debate from 30 hours to 8 hours. The Democratic-led Senate passed this rule on a temporary basis in 2013, with bipartisan support. Our colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Lankford, has a thoughtful proposal. He suggests that we permanently shorten postcloture debate on executive and judicial nominations. I agree with this proposal. The practice of confirming noncontroversial nominees is a courtesy historically given without needless delay to whoever occupies the Oval Office, to whomever the public has installed as President, Democrat and Republican alike.  Delays are not only inconvenient as the new administration tries to put its team in place, but more importantly,[[Page S453]]delays keep highly qualified individuals from serving the American people--sometimes in positions affecting our national security or delivering disaster response.  Like Mr.Hewitt, I believe we can do more to make the Senate work for the American people with ``an overhaul of its rules'' that ``preserves the rights of the minority in some cases . . . while also reflecting the speed at which the world moves today.''  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the op-ed by Mr.Hewitt be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, 22, 2018]            How To End the Senate's Astonishing Dysfunction                            (By Hugh Hewitt)       Remember Roscoe Conkling? Few people do even though for      many years the New Yorker was the ``first man'' in the Senate      and king of patronage.       How about Henry Cabot Lodge? ``Something about the League      of Nations?'' you ask, if you are going off your college days      or AP history prep. ``No, wait, Nixon's running mate!'' you      say, and head to Wikipedia to discover both fragments of      memory are right. The Lodges were a father-and-son team of      senators.       How about Robert Taft and Mike Mansfield? Lyndon Johnson      was preceded as Senate majority leader by the man known as      ``Mr.Republican'' and followed by the good and decent      Mansfield, who went on to be a good and decent ambassador to      Japan under Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald (When      was the last time anyone thought of a senator as such a      statesman that he or she could serve as ambassador to a key      ally for more than a decade under presidents from both      parties?)       The point is that the Senate as an institution is--or was--     quite the work of genius, but its individual members, no      matter how famous in their day, fade into background      characters in presidential biographies. (And most      presidential biographies don't really get read all that      much.) Now the Senate itself is careening toward widespread      contempt, as happened to its Roman predecessor even before      the emperors turned it into a fancy advisory council.       Whether the decline began with the sliming of Robert Bork      or the segregationist filibusters of civil rights      legislation, the modern Senate has been on a downward spiral      for some time, and even current Senate majority leader Mitch      McConnell (R-Ky.), the Senate's most able leader of my      lifetime, isn't shrewd enough to reverse the trajectory in      the public's eyes. After another government shutdown,      President Trump and others are pushing hard to make the      apparently dysfunctional upper chamber a purely majoritarian      place. McConnell resists this, knowing that the rights of the      minority party are (or at least used to be) key impediments      on the country rushing into dangerous waters.       What the Senate needs is an overhaul of its rules, one that      preserves the rights of the minority in some cases--key      legislation, for example, and perhaps appointments to the      Supreme Court--while also reflecting the speed at which the      world moves today. Simple majorities on appropriations and      time limits on debate over minor nominees are two obvious      reforms. They could be traded for agreement on the high court      vacancies, formalizing the modern precedent established by      McConnell of no nominations in an election year but      consideration and votes on nominees from the year prior such      as Anthony The same deal could also include      changes to the ``Byrd Rule,'' which gives the Senate      parliamentarian broad sway over what is allowed under budget      reconciliation--an extraconstitutional expansion of the      parliamentarian's powers that makes sense only under a Cubist      understanding of how the Senate is supposed to operate.       Now, with the shock of the shutdown very palpable,      McConnell and his minority counterpart, Charles Schumer      (D-N.Y.), should empower a small group of widely liked and      respected members to fashion a package of reforms with the      only guarantee being that their work product receive an up-     or-down vote made effective by a simple majority.       The Senate's dysfunction is astonishing to Americans who      have to make things actually run and who have to do their      jobs to keep their jobs. Trump has shrewdly taken aim at the      Senate's vulnerability as an issue. It would be best for both      parties to head off change imposed from pressure from the      outside with change organically orchestrated from within by      those with care for the body and its original design.

32,topic-id,751,"Mr.President, we can do more to streamline nominations, and we can do more to prevent the next budget stand-off.  I want to remind my colleagues of the bipartisan work that has been done by Senate Appropriations members--Republican and Democratic--in just the past year. Eight of the twelve annual appropriations bills passed out of committee last year. Most passed unanimously, with unanimous votes from Republicans and Democrats in the full Appropriations The remaining four were released as chairman's marks.  Let me recount the work that was done last year.  On July 13, 2017, the full Appropriations Committee, on a bipartisan basis, unanimously approved the fiscal year 2018 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies appropriations bill. The vote was 31 to 0.  On July 20, 2017, the committee unanimously--again by a vote of 31 to 0--approved the fiscal year 2018 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies appropriations bill.  Also on July 20, the committee approved the fiscal year 2018 Energy and Water Development appropriations bill by a vote of 30 to 1--still an overwhelming bipartisan vote on the part of the Appropriations  On July 27, 2017, the Appropriations Committee unanimously, by a vote of 31 to 0, approved the fiscal year 2018 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations  Also on July 27, the Appropriations Committee approved the fiscal year 2018 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations That was by a vote of 30 to 1--overwhelmingly bipartisan.  On the same day, July 27, the committee unanimously approved the fiscal year 2018 Legislative Branch appropriations bill.  I could go on and on. Two more:  In 2017, the full Appropriations Committee approved the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies appropriations The vote then was a little closer--29 to 2--but still overwhelmingly bipartisan by a pretty evenly divided Appropriations  On September 7--well before the end of the fiscal year--the Senate Appropriations Committee unanimously approved the 2018 Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs appropriations bill.  All of these bills and then four chairman's marks have been available to this Senate for consideration, and not a single one of them has been brought to the floor. What would be the reason for that? I think Members of the majority would say it is because we couldn't get 60 votes for cloture on a motion to proceed, and realizing that we couldn't get the 60 votes, we decided not to burn the time that we needed for other considerations, such as nominations or tax reform or other legislation that had a chance. Members of the minority party would probably say we couldn't get to a realistic caps agreement for domestic spending and for defense spending, and so there was no point in doing that, so we wouldn't agree to the 60 votes. But for whatever reason, citizens should know and Members should know that the Appropriations Committee did its work, and they had bills within the caps available to them, that were available for consideration. Yet, for whatever reason, they were not allowed to come to the floor for a vote.  Shouldn't we make a commitment to at least bring one bill or at least a minibus, combining three bills, to the floor and see if Members can work their will during this calendar year of 2018?  Annual appropriations bills should be passed in committee and then should come to the floor for a vote. This is how the spending process ought to work. We can do that more easily with a budget deal. We can do it with a bipartisan agreement on spending caps, which is the next big item to be negotiated. We need to eliminate sequestration, and we need to agree to defense and domestic spending levels. As I say, the work is already halfway done for us. A parade of weeks- or months-long continuing resolutions is not how we should be funding the government, and we have a resounding agreement to that statement from Members on both sides of the aisle.  The government shutdown this week was unfortunate, but it does not mean we have to continue the Senate's ``downward spiral,'' as Mr.Hewitt describes. We now have an opportunity for reform and for reflection about how we want to shape the future of this institution.

675,topic-id,1429,"Mr.President, as we all know, our government is now in its second full day of a shutdown. Public opinion is swinging against what is happening. As that occurs, it has been interesting to me to see that the talking points have changed on the part of the congressional We have just seen an example of that on the Senate floor. Let's first look at a few uncontested facts.  Our government has been operating since September 30 of last year under a series of continuing resolutions--In other words, Congress has passed a series of temporary funding bills instead of enacting appropriations for the full fiscal year. This is not an ideal practice--and there is plenty of blame to go around--but it is generally considered better than allowing funding to lapse and the government to shut down.  We have heard about generals and Pentagon officials decrying the practice of continuing resolutions. I can assure my colleagues that generals and defense officials like government shutdowns far less than temporary spending bills. So let's not say we are taking the advice of our military leaders in shutting down the government.  The last CR was adopted to run until midnight of January 19, this past Friday night. That was the date on which our Democratic colleagues decided not to extend temporary funding for the entire Federal Government for 1 more month. The specific reason the Democratic leadership gave for not agreeing to another CR was DACA--Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals--a program designed to protect those young immigrants who were brought to America illegally through no fault of their own.  President Obama implemented this program through Executive order. President Trump, in believing it was better to handle this issue through legislation, decided to end the program in March of this year. In ending the DACA Executive order, President Trump has called on Congress to formulate a legislative, statutory fix for DACA recipients. We should bear in mind that Republicans and Democrats have been working on a DACA solution and will continue to do so.  There are other important immigration issues that I believe should be attached to the DACA issue, including the funding of a border wall and the replacement of chain migration. Chain migration, as we know, is the practice of allowing immigration lottery persons to bring in a host of relatives to the United The good news in this regard is negotiators have until March to reach a deal on  It is also a fact that this government shutdown is happening because an overwhelming majority of Senate Democrats voted no on a cloture motion to bring a new funding bill to a vote. Now, cloture votes take 60 votes, and my Democratic friends can say until they are blue in the face that the Republicans are in charge of the entire government--in charge of the Senate, in charge of the House, and in charge of the Presidency--but that does not take away from the fact that it takes bipartisan support to end a filibuster. It takes 60 votes. It takes Democrats and Republicans in the Senate to move to cloture on a new funding bill, and it is simply a fact that a majority of Democrats voted no. That is why we are in a shutdown.  Another undisputed fact is, the most recent CR would have run until mid-February and that the DACA Program--this program for childhood arrivals--is not set to expire until How does it make any sense to shut down the government over a program that will last longer than the temporary funding bill? It doesn't. Yet that is exactly what our Democratic friends decided to do--shut down the government on an immigration issue.  Here is the front page of Friday's New York Times, which is not exactly known as a great friend to the Republican It reads: ``Senate Showdown Looms As Spending Bill Advances.'' This was the morning before the evening when our Democratic friends refused to fund the government. ``House approves a stopgap measure while Democrats dig in on immigration.'' According to the New York Times, it was an immigration issue that caused the Democrats to dig in.  The Washington Post reported the same: ``Shutdown looms despite House action.'' The subhead read that the Democrats tie Dreamers--another way to say the DACA recipients--to the passage of a budget deal. Again, that is the headline by not exactly the strongest Republican paper in the country--the Washington  I find it interesting to hear the Democrats now talking about other reasons for their votes to shut down the Federal Government, reasons that are unrelated to the immigration issue, which was their real reason. We have seen it on the Senate floor tonight. We saw it yesterday on the Senate floor--a colloquy of distinguished Democratic Senators who talked extensively about the S-CHIP program for children's health as having somehow been inadequately treated in the CR they helped to defeat.  My colleague from South Dakota pointed out just a few moments ago that, in fact, the continuing resolution provided for a 6-year extension of the S-CHIP program for these 9 million Yet somehow that became a reason, and it was a reason listed by my good friend from New Jersey just a moment ago.  I tuned in to hear the House proceedings yesterday and heard the Democrats going on at length about community health centers all of a sudden and then about flood and hurricane relief. We heard on the floor tonight that a good reason to vote against the CR was that we have just done it too many times. Three times is OK, but four times is just too many. Of course, they proposed yet another fourth CR, but it was only a CR they had preferred to vote for. We hear them talk about tax cuts for the wealthy, the National Institutes of Health, and opioids. This Congress has done marvelous work on this pressing opioid problem. Medicaid has been mentioned. Medicaid is a mandatory program. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the year-to-year appropriations bills.  We have just heard every reason in the world other than the reason the national press has pointed out, which is[[Page S421]]that this is an immigration dispute that doesn't even ripen until March, but our friends have refused to give us 60 votes to bring that to a close. I wonder why that is.  Could it be our Democratic friends are beginning to realize that shutting down the government over an immigration dispute is not turning out to be a winner for them?  It may be they have read the most recent CNN poll. That poll showed 56 percent of Americans saying that approving a budget to avoid a shutdown is more important than continuing the DACA Let me repeat that: 56 percent of Americans said to approve a budget and avoid a shutdown. Only 34 percent chose DACA over a shutdown. Maybe that poll and other indications of public disapproval have caused those who voted for the shutdown to modify their reasons. I hope it causes 60 of us later on tonight to say yes to a solution that will get the government back open.  I say to my Democratic colleagues, it might have been nice or even desirable to include a DACA bill in the most recent CR proposal, but there is still at least a month and a half to resolve that issue. We have time to tend to the DACA issue, and we don't need to shut down the government over that issue.  What the people cannot understand is how it makes sense to force a shutdown over an issue that is completely unrelated to the temporary spending bill. My Democratic friends now seem to be searching for a figleaf of a solution so they can relent and allow the Federal Government to reopen and to function. I hope they find that reason. Maybe a 3-week CR is that vehicle.  If a solution is agreed to, it will take about that long to actually write the legislation, but something needs to give, and it needs to give tonight. The American people need this shutdown to end, our adversaries around the world need to see we can get our act together, and our military, our security personnel, and all of our public servants deserve the right to get back to the jobs they have signed on to do.

35,topic-id,1877,"Mr.President, very shortly, the Senate is going to take two votes on the President's nominees. The first is to confirm Jerome Powell as the next Fed Once that vote wraps up, the Senate will vote on whether to begin debate on the nomination of Alex Azar to be Secretary of Health and Human  This is one of the key roles in our entire Federal Government in caring for America's sick and vulnerable. Let me begin by saying that Mr.Azar does not come with the staggering ethical challenges of his predecessor, the first Trump HHS nominee, Tom  Here is my concern: Mr.Azar's nomination is a clear symbol of the President's broken promises on prescription drugs and pledge to secure better and more affordable healthcare for all At the outset of my remarks, I am going to start with the issue of skyrocketing prescription drug prices that now clobber millions of Americans at pharmacy windows across It is one thing for a Presidential candidate to have claimed he would just be too busy working to have time to golf and then spend almost 1 out of 3 days in office golfing. It is another thing altogether to promise cheaper prescription drugs to sick and vulnerable Americans who empty their pockets to pay for their medications only to abandon them completely once you are in office.  Now, it was barely a year ago that Donald Trump stood before our country and said prescription-hiking drug companies were getting ``away with murder.'' Those were his words, not mine, not somebody in the news media. The President said the drug companies were ``getting away with murder.''  Now he has nominated Alex Azar, a drug company executive with a documented history of raising drug prices, to lead the Department of Health and Human From 2012 until last year, Mr.Azar--who is the head of Eli Lilly's American subsidiary; that is, Lilly USA--chaired the U.pricing reimbursement and access steering committee, which gave him a major role over drug price increases for every product Lilly marketed across the country.  On Mr.Azar's watch, the price of Forteo, a Lilly drug used to treat osteoporosis, more than doubled. The price of Effient, a Lilly drug used to treat heart disease, more than doubled. The price of Strattera, a Lilly drug used to treat ADHD, more than doubled. The price of Humalog, a Lilly drug used to treat diabetes, more than doubled, and these are only a few of the drugs that were under Mr.Azar's purview.  Mr.Azar told the Senate Finance Committee that he had never--not even one time--signed off on a decrease in the price of a medicine, and when asked about that statement in his confirmation hearing, Mr.Azar was quick to say: That is just the way the system works, but he didn't give us any concrete examples of how he would buck that system if he became the head of the Department of Health and Human It seems to me, given the fact that he was asked questions about what concrete ideas he had for reforming the system and carrying out the President's promises to hold down prescription drug prices, he came up empty. I guess that says he would fit right in with the Trump administration on prescription drug practices.  In its first year, the Trump administration has made exactly no progress when it comes to tackling these skyrocketing pharmaceutical prices. They don't have any Executive orders that have any teeth in them. There don't seem to be any new initiatives at all. No new legislation has come from the Department or the White Perhaps, in my view, that is because the administration seems to be busy on other fronts, like taking healthcare away from those who need it, people who can least afford to have their bills climbing upward because of a decision made by a bureaucracy here in the Nation's  This nomination, as you are going to hear Senators discuss tomorrow, is about more than just the administration's failure on prescription drugs. It is, in effect, a proxy on an entire healthcare agenda. This is really a referendum on a healthcare policy from this administration that I think is an abject failure.  It is a year in now, and the administration's track record on healthcare is pretty clear. New data came out a few days ago showing that the number of Americans with health insurance dropped by more than 3 million people. That means 3 million Americans are a sudden illness or injury away from the nightmare of personal bankruptcy, having to sell their home or their car or empty a retirement account to escape from under that mountain of medical bills.  A very substantial part of that problem stems from the administration's sabotage on the Affordable Care The administration cut the open enrollment period in half. That meant anybody who clicked on the internet, hoping to sign up this month, has found out that they are just too late. They slashed advertising budgets that helped reach the younger and healthier customers that make the private health insurance market affordable. And they made it harder for those having difficulty signing up for coverage to get a little bit of help in person.  This sabotage agenda, in my view, is an attack on the kind of health insurance this administration says it is for. They say they are for a private health insurance market, but the fact is, what they have been doing is undermining[[Page S459]]the private health insurance market as part of their effort to undermine the Affordable Care So this policy, perpetrated by a party and the President who professed to want to run this country like a business, certainly doesn't reflect the kinds of sound business practices we see from business leaders in my home State of  If that wasn't harmful enough, the administration also is allowing fraudsters to, once again, sell junk coverage insurance policies that aren't worth the paper they are printed on.  A major part of the Affordable Care Act was laying down basic consumer protections for the private market. It was all about saying that Americans would no longer get stuck with junk insurance that turned out to be worthless when they actually suffered an injury or came down with an illness. I can't tell you what a step backward it is to see the sale of these junk insurance policies.  Years ago, when I was director of the Gray Panthers, it was common to see older people buy 15 or 20 private health insurance policies to supplement their Medicare, and they weren't worth the paper they were written on. They were junk. Finally, we got that changed. We passed a law with teeth to change it.  But now the Trump administration has, with respect to the private market and the Affordable Care Act, decided to turn back the clock and bring back junk insurance in the private insurance marketplace. So instead of working on a bipartisan basis to make the private health insurance market more affordable and competitive, the Trump administration has sabotaged those markets, hiking the number of Americans without coverage and sticking a whole lot of Americans with junk coverage that, in my view, is virtually guaranteed to fail them when they are most in need. The biggest threat their strategy poses on a basic level is that it wipes out the ironclad guarantee of protection for Americans with preexisting conditions. Guarantee of access to healthcare isn't worth much if you can't afford it, and the Trump administration is doing a bangup job of making healthcare unaffordable for those with preexisting conditions.  The Trump administration has also undermined years of progress with respect to women's health. They attack the rule that says women have to be guaranteed no-cost access to contraception--one of the most popular healthcare rules in recent memory. Fortunately, the administration's action on that issue has been held up in the courts, but that is only one part of the anti-women's health agenda that plays out now.  Just last week, the Trump administration overturned longstanding protections dealing with States and family planning providers. This, in my view, is an attack both on a woman's right to see the provider of their choosing and Planned The administration is also broadening the exceptions that give employers and universities say over what kinds of healthcare women can access.  Here is how Mr.Azar described his perspective on that issue when he went before the HELP He said: ``We have to balance, of course, a woman's choice of insurance that she would want with the conscience of the employers and others.''  We don't have to that. A woman's choice of healthcare is her choice--her choice and nobody else's. The care she has access to and receives is not up to her employer and not up to her university. It is up to that woman and her physician. And now the administration is even going after protections for LGBTQ  The bottom line is, the administration is doing a lot more to protect the perpetrators of discrimination than the victims. Healthcare is a right in America, but discrimination is not.  The way Mr.Azar describes the position he is nominated to fill, it sounds as if he understands it. He said in his confirmation hearing: If I get this job, my job is to ``enhance and protect the health and wellbeing of all Americans.'' But he is not committed to reversing these kinds of anti-discriminatory practices I just described.  When I heard Mr.Azar say it would be his job to ``enhance and protect the health and wellbeing of all Americans,'' I couldn't help but think back to the first nomination hearing the Finance Committee had for a Trump HHS nominee. Back then, Tom Price told the committee it would be his job at the Department just to administer the laws passed by He would be out of the legislative business. Once he got the job, he broke his word, and that has been the norm for the Department over the year. Congress has every reason to believe that is going to continue, regardless of the talking points Mr.Azar and administration officials use.  Finally, I want to discuss Just in the last few weeks, the administration has begun giving States a green light to slap new and punitive requirements and other limits on Americans covered by State Medicaid My bottom line is, Medicaid is a healthcare program. The vast majority of those who count on Medicaid either already have a job or are unable to work due to old age and infirmity. We shouldn't be trying to make life harder for those folks. The action by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services goes after people who are just trying to get by. It is a decision by bureaucrats in Washington, going after Americans who walk an economic tightrope, who might just be trying to take care of kids or elderly parents or struggling with a chronic condition. This looks, on Medicaid, like yet another ideologically motivated attack on a program that covers vulnerable Americans--all generations, from newborn infants to two out of three seniors. The Trump administration is giving States permission to attack it.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.  The PRESIDING Without objection, it is so ordered.

They are back at it again, and this latest attack that we will be discussing this week goes after women's essential healthcare decisions.  In my view--and I want to be very clear about this point--this is another key part of the Trump agenda of healthcare discrimination. This time, it is going after women.

To do that, I think it is important to describe what has happened on healthcare since day one of the Trump administration.  The administration and Republicans in Congress came right out of the gate with legislation that would have deprived hundreds of thousands of women of the right to see the doctor of their choosing. There was another attack on Planned Parenthood that completely ignored the fact that the Congress already regulates what these trusted healthcare providers can and cannot spend public funds on. What Planned Parenthood does use public funding for are vital healthcare services that have absolutely nothing to do with abortion. Let me just make sure people understand what I am talking about. We are talking about cancer screenings, prenatal care, preventive services, routine physicals, and more.  I have townhall meetings in every county in our I have had more than 860 of them. The vast amount of terrain in Oregon is rural. When I go to those small communities and the least populated areas of our State, that is what people tell me they go to Planned Parenthood for--to get those basic essentials, ranging from cancer screenings to routine physicals. That is what women would lose with this Trump agenda of healthcare discrimination.  Next up, given the way the year and a little bit longer has evolved, is the ongoing attempt by the Trump administration to deny women guaranteed no-cost access to contraception. This is one of the most popular healthcare policies in recent memory. There are a lot of reasons why this is smart, not just because it is a matter of fairness for all women to have access to birth control. When women have access to contraception, it means healthier pregnancies and healthier newborns. It also reduces the risk of cancer among women.  You can also look at it in terms of dollars and cents. When you take away no-cost contraception, you are essentially taxing women based on their gender. You are driving up the cost of their routine healthcare. It flies in the face of everything my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say about the problems of healthcare costs in  So those are strikes one and two: denying women the right to see the doctor of their choosing and making it harder for them to access contraception. Now the Senate is debating[[Page S528]]whether to throw a matter of settled law out the window with a hyperpartisan ban on abortion after 20 weeks.  My view on abortion throughout my time in public service is it ought to be safe, it ought to be legal, and it ought to be rare. I have supported a whole host of policies that bring both sides of the aisle together.  The Presiding Officer is fairly new to the Senate Finance Committee and is looking to be involved in a host of issues. My guess is, he will be very interested in the adoption tax credit concept which I and others have championed for some time, something that brings both sides together.  So my view is, abortion, safe, legal, and rare; find ways to bring both sides together; and respect that the Federal Government ought to leave women alone on these most intimate decisions that involve women, their spouses, and their healthcare providers.  The proposal the Senate is now debating is all about telling women what they can and cannot do. It criminalizes healthcare services that ought to stay between women and their doctors--healthcare services often necessitated by potentially life-threatening complications.  I just, for the life of me, don't see the wisdom of a lawmaker or a bureaucrat in Washington, DC, or a State capital telling a woman how severe the danger to her life has to become before she is legally allowed to make this variably gut-wrenching decision to choose an abortion.  This issue has been settled law in America for 45 years. The debate should be over, but here it is again, along with these other policies I have just described, as part of the Trump administration's healthcare discrimination agenda which is particularly punitive against women.  Let me also recognize the biggest victims under this discriminatory agenda are women who walk an economic tightrope every single day. If their local Planned Parenthood clinic is forced to close its doors, they may not have the ability to take time off work and travel long distances to see another provider for routine healthcare. They already balance every day the food against the rent, the rent against electricity, electricity against gas. Take away these choices, like no-cost contraception, and make their struggle to get ahead that much harder--especially when the rate of unintended pregnancy is five times higher among women living in poverty--folks who may not be able to afford a plane ticket or even a bus ticket to somewhere where they can find the essential healthcare services they believe are necessary.  There are serious, genuine healthcare challenges that face the country. Millions of Americans get clobbered every single time they walk up to a pharmacy window and get pounded by the cost of prescription drugs. That is the kind of bipartisan debate looking for solutions.  Another example is the opioid epidemic raging from one end of the country to the other. More than half a million lives lost in the last two decades, countless families and entire communities torn apart. The Congress and the Trump administration haven't done nearly enough to fight the crisis and, frankly, not anywhere near close to what was promised in the fall of 2016.  Instead of taking on these challenges, the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress are just full steam ahead with this agenda of healthcare discrimination; this week, an attack on women and their healthcare choices. Passing this bill is going to make it harder for women to be in a position to make the healthcare choices they believe are important--maybe essential--for their lives.  I urge my colleagues to oppose the bill.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2018-01-29-pt1-PgS527-6.txt,1247,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2018.0,29.0,January

941,topic-id,1740,"Mr.President, a year ago, the President stormed into office promising better, cheaper healthcare for everyone. He said he would bring prescription drug prices down because, in his words, drug companies were ``getting away with murder.''  So as we move to this vote, as the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, I wanted to make sure we took stock after year 1. The Trump record on healthcare is worse than your garden variety case of a President failing to live up to his campaign promises. This President has surely hurt the people he promised to help. Very shortly, the Senate will vote on the nomination of Alex Azar to be the Secretary of Health and Human In this position, he would be the captain of the President's healthcare team. So in my view, this debate is about a lot more than Mr.Azar's resume. It is a referendum on a year of healthcare failure, particularly on prescription drug costs, and it is a referendum on what I consider to be a healthcare agenda of discrimination.  I am going to begin with the skyrocketing prescription drug prices because they are a gut punch for millions of Americans each time they step up to the pharmacy window. Few promises the President made with respect to healthcare resonated more than his promise to bring down prescription drug prices, but now, a year later, he has chosen Alex Azar, a drug company executive with a documented history of raising drug prices.  From 2012 until last year, he was the head of Eli Lilly's American subsidiary, Lilly He chaired its U.pricing, reimbursement, and access steering committee, which gave him a major role over drug price increases for every product Lilly marketed in On Mr.Azar's watch, Lilly more than doubled the prices of drugs used to treat diabetes, osteoporosis, heart disease, and And these are only some of the drugs under his purview.  He told the Finance Committee staff that he had never once approved a decrease in the price of a drug at Mr.Azar said: That is just how the system works. Prices always go up. I would say that Mr.Azar may have had his facts straight about the system, but that doesn't make it right. Mr.Azar was a part of this broken system, and despite the cheerful overtures that he has made to Senators on both sides of the aisle over the last few weeks about how he wants to work on the issue, he has not offered even a single concrete example of how he would actually change the system he said is broken. He will not give us an example of how he would change it to make it better.  Members of this body, Democrats and Republicans, have come forward with specifics about what they would do to help those Americans getting clobbered at the prescription drug windows across the land. We have colleagues who are for drug importation. We have colleagues who are for more negotiating power for We have colleagues who understand the challenge with the pharmaceutical benefit managers, where there is so little transparency. We asked Mr.Azar repeatedly for examples, but all he had to say about this system that was so broken is that he would be ``open'' to ideas.  As important as that is, there is a whole lot more for Senators to reflect on as they think about this vote. After a year in office, the Trump administration is steadily and relentlessly enacting a healthcare agenda of discrimination--discrimination against those with preexisting conditions, discrimination against women, discrimination against LGBTQ Americans, discrimination against those struggling to get ahead. The question up for debate today ought to be whether or not this nominee to head this critical office of healthcare policy is going to end that discrimination.  Colleagues, as you think about this vote, all I can tell you is that when you review the record--in the face of an administration moving relentlessly to promote discrimination in healthcare--there is not a shred of evidence that Mr.Azar is going to try to stop it, reform it, or in any way try to make sure that those Americans--all of them--get a fair shake.  From day one, in addition to this pattern of discrimination, the administration has been on a campaign of sabotage against the Affordable Care Act and the private health insurance markets. They cut the open enrollment period in half. They slashed the advertising budgets. They made it harder for people to sign up in person. That is the major reason why the number of Americans without insurance coverage increased by more than 3 million last year. Our friends and our neighbors are one sudden illness or injury away from the nightmare of personal bankruptcy[[Page S493]]as a result of the healthcare policies this administration has pursued and cheered.  Even worse--and I touched on this yesterday--the administration is bringing back to life junk insurance, letting fraudsters get back into the insurance business with health plans that aren't worth the paper they are printed on. It takes me back to my days as codirector of the Oregon Gray Back then, I met older people who sometimes had 15 or even 20 private insurance policies to supplement their Those policies were junk. Some of them were just out-and-out scams.  So the Congress passed a law. I was proud to be a part of that bipartisan coalition to change it to protect older people. The law worked. We drained the swamp when it came to those fraudsters ripping off seniors. Then 8 years ago, some of the key parts of the Affordable Care Act put consumer protections in place so that nobody of working age would get ripped off with junk insurance. It is those policies and those people that the Trump administration would let the fraudsters exploit because the Trump administration wants to undo those protections against fraudsters who are ripping off those of working age.  They have already taken steps on what are called Association Health Next up are short-term plans that are likely to be even worse.  What this comes down to is the Trump administration's tradition of turning back the clock on healthcare and allowing junk insurance to discriminate over preexisting conditions and age. This is going to be a big test for Mr.Azar if he is confirmed.  I would just ask my colleagues: We will see if Mr.Azar is going to look the other way and allow scam artists to peddle junk coverage, or is he going to protect Americans who need care and health coverage they can count on?  There is also an array of discriminatory policies with respect to women's health. They tried to take away guaranteed no-cost access to contraception, essentially taxing women for their gender. Fortunately, that move has been held up in the courts. They overturned longstanding protections dealing with States and family planning--what amounts to an attack on a woman's right to see the doctor of her choosing and an attack on Planned  They are broadening exceptions that give employers and universities say over what healthcare women can access. When asked on these issues during his nomination hearing, Mr.Azar said: ``We have to balance, of course, a woman's choice of insurance that she would want with the conscience of employers and others.'' My counter to that is absolutely not. There is no balancing women's choices against anything. In America, a woman's choice of healthcare ought to be her choice and nobody else's.  In much the same way as going after women's healthcare, this administration is permitting discrimination against LGBTQ Americans in need of healthcare.  Then, finally, there is In just the last few weeks, the administration has been giving States a green light to slap punitive, new requirements and limitations on Americans covered by State Medicaid This action by Health and Human Services goes after people across the country who are working on an economic tightrope. They are people who are taking care of kids or elderly parents or who are struggling with a chronic condition.  These punitive new requirements aren't going to improve anybody's healthcare. As the first waivers are coming out from the Department of Health and Human Services, the public is learning some disturbing details. In Kentucky, the State is introducing what sounds a lot like a literacy test for healthcare. Nobody in this body should have to be reminded that the history of literacy tests is an ugly and discriminatory one. That is the wrong direction to take on healthcare.  I close by saying that the record after 1 year shows that the Trump agenda on healthcare isn't about improving care for all The Trump agenda on healthcare is about discrimination and ideology.  So the question, as my colleagues come over to this floor to cast their votes, is whether the Trump administration is going to be allowed to continue to turn back the clock and advance discrimination. Given the opportunity to demonstrate that he would actually lead the Department in a new direction, he came up short. So I will not support his nomination.  Through my time in public service, back from those early days working with the senior citizens, I have always said: Healthcare has to be a bipartisan issue. To do healthcare right, you have to find a way to bring people together.  If Mr.Azar is confirmed, I hope he will make his stated willingness to listen to ideas a reality and begin to work closely with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to actually make some changes in these key areas I have described. From policies where we just sit on the sidelines with our skyrocketing drug prices, to sitting out in the fight against opioids, to allowing discrimination against women, to rolling back the protections on Medicaid--these are issues that go right to the heart of the health and safety of millions of  Mr.Azar certainly does not carry the ethical baggage of his predecessor, Tom The question for the Senate this afternoon--after we have asked him again and again and again to give any examples of how he would break with these harmful policies of the last year, we have come up short. So I regret to say to the Senate that I am going to oppose this nomination.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING Without objection, all time is yielded back.  Under the previous order, all postcloture time has expired.  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the Azar nomination?

388,topic-id,362,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of this bipartisan legislation, which I was proud to introduce with my colleague from New York, Congresswoman Carolyn  This legislation would provide needed reforms to the living will submission process, would ensure that impacted financial institutions get needed feedback from their regulators, and would uphold sensible standards to protect the financial system.  This may sound like wonky financial policy, but to the hardworking men and women in my district, fixing these confusing regulations that have choked off community lending can be the determining factor with regards to getting a small business loan or a mortgage.  These are the financial products that provide access to the American Dream, that help communities grow through homeownership, and that allow small-business owners to hire and expand.  Now, more than ever, we need to be working on a bipartisan basis to improve the standards and reform the confusing regulations that are being imposed on our community banks and financial institutions.  This bill changes the procedure for the submission and review of resolution plans, also known as living wills.                              {time}  1830  This legislation is in line with recommendations from a 2016 GAO report in which it was recommended that banking regulators should publicly disclose the assessment frameworks, consider shifting to a 2-year cycle, and provide feedback to companies within a minimum of 6 months.  The vast discretion granted to Federal regulators under the current law's living will regime is essentially a license for those regulators to decide the proper size, scale, and business model of private sector enterprises.  This legislation reins in that unchecked government authority and provides greater accountability and much-needed transparency to the living will process.

493,topic-id,809,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Mr.Gaetz for organizing this important Special Order and all my colleagues for coming to the House floor tonight encouraging the President of the United States now to certify the release of this memo to the American public.[[Page H658]]  The American public is a lot smarter than a whole lot of other people give them credit for. Present them with the facts and the truth, and they can form their own independent judgment as to what transpired. That was the first thought that came to my mind when I went to the basement a week before last--the basement of the House Capitol--to read this classified memo of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, that this memo should be immediately released to the American public so that they have all of the facts.  In addition to releasing the memo, I believe it is important to be releasing relevant material sourced in the memo.  Now, tonight, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence voted to publicly release this memo to the American public, and, at the same time, the House Democrats came to the committee calling for the declassification and public release of their memo.                              {time}  1945  Let me add a little bit more context on this memo that the House Democrats came to the floor asking to be released.  They did not allow the voting members of the House Intelligence Committee to read the memo tonight before voting to declassify and publicly release it.  Let me repeat that. The House Democrats, led by Ranking Member Adam Schiff, went to the House Intelligence Committee tonight calling for the public release of their memo, asking for their colleagues to declassify the memo and to publicly release it immediately, without giving them the opportunity to read it first.  I can speak for myself. I haven't read the memo that the House Democrats offered up tonight. I haven't been granted any access to read it. I am not aware of any other of my colleagues who have been able to read it. I can't even confirm it exists.  After the committee met, it was fascinating to watch the minority members of the House Intelligence Committee going straight from the hearing room to the cameras to give their narrative. At no point did they mention whatsoever, when they were saying that they were outraged that the majority members of that committee didn't vote to publicly release it, at no point did they mention that they never gave them the opportunity to read it first.  What you don't see, at the same time, are the majority members of the House Intelligence Committee racing off to all those same cameras to give their same side of the narrative, the members of that House Intelligence  What we are asking for is the American public to get the facts so that they can form the judgment of this FISA abuse for themselves.  I, too, applaud the leadership of Mr.Nunes and the House Intelligence Committee for their work to restore faith with the American people.  As a former Army intelligence officer and JAG officer myself, I understand the importance of giving our intelligence agencies the critical tools they need to protect our homeland, assist our troops on the front lines, and surveil our enemies. However, it is critical that we strike a balance between national security and civil liberty to prevent any gross violation of individual liberties under the guise of national security.  Congress has the responsibility of ensuring an appropriate balance is struck, and when it is not, to release information we feel is in the national interest and of public importance. Today, Congress took an important step in making this possible.  Americans deserve the truth. To pull the wool over the eyes of the American public insults their intelligence and debases the freedoms and liberties on which our government was founded. Government transparency and accountability should be neither partisan nor divisive.  I would urge my colleagues on either side of the aisle, especially those who have voted against its release, to evaluate and reflect upon their position and come together united in favor of our belief that the American public is a lot smarter than many give them credit for. Give them the facts, and we have faith they will be able to form their own independent conclusions.  Now it is up to the I would encourage him to release the memo. I would also encourage him to release relevant material sourced in it. Americans have the right know. If we as their elected Representatives fail to stand up for them, who will?  The only way forward is to give the American public more information, not less. Release the memo.  I thank Congressman Matt Gaetz for his leadership throughout this entire process and his efforts to make sure the American public learns more, not less.
