                        HONORING MAYOR VI LYLES

  (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mayor Vi Lyles, who 
recently made history as the first African-American woman elected mayor 
of Charlotte, North Carolina.
  A selfless and devoted public servant, Lyles' journey began in a 
deeply segregated South, requiring her to overcome numerous obstacles. 
After more than three decades in public service, she retired from the 
city of Charlotte and was then elected to serve two consecutive terms 
as a member of the Charlotte City Council, rising to mayor pro tem. Her 
leadership helped mold our city into one of the fastest growing cities 
in America and a beacon of the South.
  Mayor Lyles, mother and grandmother, is one of my sheroes and a role 
model to many. Like strong African-American leaders who came before 
her, like Shirley Chisholm and Fannie Lou Hamer, Lyles' election 
shattered yet another glass ceiling.
  As the 59th mayor of Charlotte, the story of Vi Lyles will be an 
inspiration to young girls and boys and women throughout North Carolina 
and the Nation for generations to come.
  Join me in welcoming and congratulating our new mayor, Mayor Vi 
Lyles. I look forward to our continued partnership to move Charlotte 
forward.
