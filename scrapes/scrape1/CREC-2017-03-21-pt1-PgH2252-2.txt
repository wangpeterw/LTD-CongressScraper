               TRUMPCARE IS A TOTAL DISASTER FOR AMERICA

  (Mr. SOTO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, TrumpCare--a total disaster for America. Here 
it is by the numbers, per our own nonpartisan Congressional Budget 
Office: 24 million Americans will lose coverage, with 14 million 
Americans losing coverage in year one; 15 to 20 percent increases in 
health insurance premiums in year one; and if you are paying $1,700, 
you will be paying $14,600 in premium increases if you are a 64-year-
old making $26,500 per year.
  But where does the money go? $592 billion in tax cuts for the rich. 
That is where it is going.
  The conclusions: TrumpCare robs health care from American working 
families to give tax cuts to the rich.
  So vote ``no'' on TrumpCare to vote ``yes'' on health care for 
America's working families.
