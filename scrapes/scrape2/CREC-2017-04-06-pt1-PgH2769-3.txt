   HONORING MICHIGAN FARMERS HELPING THOSE AFFECTED BY WILDFIRES IN 
                           AMERICAN HEARTLAND

  (Mr. MOOLENAAR asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. MOOLENAAR. Mr. Speaker, today another farm convoy left Michigan 
and headed south to help those suffering in America's heartland, where 
wildfires have burned more than 1 million acres in four States.
  This convoy, and those like it in days gone by and the days to come, 
is the work of the amazing farming community in my district and across 
the State of Michigan.
  They have donated trucks, trailers, and time to drive supplies to the 
affected areas. They have donated food and fencing to help farmers 
recover and rebuild. They have donated care packages with candy and 
cards to care for the hurting souls.
  Many volunteers are staying and helping in the devastated 
communities. In fact, tomorrow, two young men from Ogemaw County, Brady 
and Keaton, are scheduled to travel with 4-H kids from Michigan's Thumb 
area to volunteer their skills and help build fencing in Kansas.
  The overwhelmingly and generous efforts of the Michigan farming 
community, in response to this tragedy, represent the best of America. 
I pray for God's blessing on all those involved as they help with this 
crisis.
