                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Our Father in Heaven, clothed in dazzling splendor, we bow our hearts 
in Your presence. You are our helper, our defender, and our refuge. You 
are our hope for years to come.
  Strengthen our Senators for today's challenges. Direct their 
thoughts, words, and actions, enabling them to follow Your leading. Use 
them to transform dark yesterdays into bright tomorrows. Lord, give 
them peace during turbulent moments and a faith that will not shrink 
under pressure. Make their words fountains of life. Help them to 
understand what really matters so that they may live pure and blameless 
lives that glorify You.
  We pray in Your marvelous Name. Amen.
