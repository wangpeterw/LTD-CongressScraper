             CONGRATULATING THE HILLSIDE HIGH SCHOOL COMETS

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate my alma mater, 
Hillside High School, class of 1976, in Hillside, New Jersey. The 
Hillside Comets football team won their State championship against the 
Point Pleasant Boro Panthers on Saturday.
  The Hillside Comets finished their season with a 9-3 record. They 
beat the top-seeded Panthers to bring home Hillside's first State title 
since 1985. The Comets are only the second football team from Union 
County to win a State title in central Jersey in 15 years.
  Mr. Speaker, the Hillside Comets football team are winners both on 
and off the field. Sixteen players are on the honor roll, and five of 
them are members of the National Honor Society. The team's successes 
are, no doubt, a testament to the high expectations set by their head 
coach, Barris Grant.
  I was honored to join the Comets at their celebration on Sunday, and 
I am proud to have such outstanding students in my district. I ask my 
colleagues to join me in congratulating the Hillside High School 
Comets, winners on and off the field.
