                       INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY

  (Mr. CHABOT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, in recognition of International Women's Day, 
I would like to acknowledge the efforts of two women from Cincinnati.
  Long ago, Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote ``Uncle Tom's Cabin'' in 
Cincinnati. When she later met Abraham Lincoln in the White House, he 
reportedly said: ``So you are the little woman who wrote the book that 
started this great war.''
  More recently, Elina Govil, a high school student from Indian Hill, 
is fighting to provide at-risk girls in conflict zones with access to a 
proper education.
  To assist Elina in her efforts, as a senior member of the Foreign 
Affairs Committee, I introduced the Protecting Girls' Access to 
Education Act, bipartisan legislation that could help millions of young 
girls across the globe.
  Children who are denied an education, because they live in an area 
that is torn by chaos and war, have little chance of ever attaining a 
stable existence. Girls, in particular, are subject to exploitation and 
the pitfalls of human trafficking, violence, and poverty.
  Thank you, Elina, for helping girls everywhere to have the 
opportunity to reach their fullest potential.
