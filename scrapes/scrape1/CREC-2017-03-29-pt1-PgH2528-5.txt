                  TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TIES TO RUSSIA

  (Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, the American people are demanding a real 
investigation into President Trump's ties to Russia and Vladimir Putin.
  I was a journalist for nearly two decades, and for part of that time, 
I was an investigative reporter. I could tell you that, where there is 
smoke, there is usually fire. Right now, smoke is billowing out of the 
White House.
  No matter how many times President Trump tries to distract us with a 
tweet, no matter how many times President Trump advisers have held 
secret meetings with the Russians, no matter how many times the 
Republican chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on 
Intelligence changes his story to protect President Trump, sooner or 
later, the truth will come out.
  Vladimir Putin has a driving mission and that is to weaken America 
from within.
  So to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I ask one simple 
question: What would President Ronald Reagan do?
  Well, I can tell you. He would put our national security ahead of 
partisan politics. He would follow the facts, and he would leave no 
stone unturned.
  Our democracy demands a complete, thorough, and independent 
investigation into President Trump's ties with the Putin regime.
