            CONGRATULATING ABBOTT HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL TEAM

  (Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WILLIAMS. Madam Speaker, today, I would like to recognize and 
congratulate the Abbott High School baseball team on being this year's 
Division 1A State champions.
  Located in Abbott, Texas, this small town high school has defied the 
odds. Since opening its doors in 1886, this is the first time the 
baseball program has earned the title of State champions.
  Just last week, I visited the Panthers, as well as Principal 
Pustejovsky and Head Coach Crawford. It was an honor to meet them and 
these young Americans and be able to congratulate them on a hard-earned 
victory.
  As a former baseball player myself, it is inspiring to watch a new 
wave of students become interested in America's favorite pastime. These 
boys are bright and eager to do their best by giving 110 percent at all 
times, and that is the kind of spirit we need in this country.
  In a time when we are finally recovering from the last 8 years of 
turmoil, kids like these are exactly the driving force behind what will 
make this country great again.
  Madam Speaker, as long as I am up here in Washington, I am committed 
to continuing to fight for our Nation's future generations.
  I am proud to represent the black and gold in the 25th Congressional 
District of Texas, and I look forward to watching their baseball 
careers unfold.
  And, remember, keep your head over the plate, swing as hard as you 
can, and always look fastball.
  In God we trust.
