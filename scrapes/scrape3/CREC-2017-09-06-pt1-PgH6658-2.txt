                            RETURN TO CHAOS

  (Mr. BLUMENAUER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, we return to Capitol Hill amidst chaos--
wildfires in the West, choking smoke in my community, the cruelty of 
800,000 young people having their lives turned upside down 
unnecessarily by Trump yesterday, and we are dancing with the debt 
ceiling chaos with the world economy. All are made unnecessarily worse. 
Even Harvey was predictable due to government action and inaction.
  Congress should stop pretending these things are beyond our control. 
A majority of Congress would treat young DREAMers, fairly if given a 
right to vote for it on the floor of the House.
  We should fund disaster prevention, including forest fires, and stop 
subsidizing more floods, and not play unnecessary games with the world 
economy, pretending we won't pay for money we have already spent.
  In the end, we will probably spend the next 3 weeks setting up the 
next crisis later in the year.
  Isn't it time that Congress stop playing the victim and take charge?
