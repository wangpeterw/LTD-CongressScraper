             RECOGNIZING JERUSALEM AS THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to President 
Donald Trump and Ambassador Nikki Haley--South Carolina's former 
Governor--for the announcement that the United States will recognize 
Jerusalem as the capital city of Israel and relocate the American 
Embassy to the holy city which protects all religions.
  As President Trump said at the White House: ``This long overdue 
recognition of reality is in the best interests of both the United 
States and the pursuit of peace between Israel and the Palestinians.''
  America's bond with Israel is unique, and its strength is the 
foundation for peace through stability for all of the Middle East 
providing for prosperity for all countries.
  The President's announcement strengthens that alliance, and I 
appreciate his honoring another of his campaign commitments. Friends of 
Israel know they have a true friend in the White House, which was 
heartfelt when I met last month with Sheldon and Miriam Adelson at the 
Washington Convention Center.
  President Trump's team is leading boldly. The President is clear: 
peace is never beyond the grasp of those willing to reach for it.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism, just as America had 
resolved December the 7th, 1941.
