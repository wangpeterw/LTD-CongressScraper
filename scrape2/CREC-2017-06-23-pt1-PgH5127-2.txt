                  HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN CHECHNYA

  (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, during this Pride Month, I rise today to 
speak out about the human rights violations occurring in the Russian 
republic of Chechnya.
  It has been reported that in that country, men are kidnapped, 
detained, tortured, and even murdered just because of their sexual 
orientation. Families have been shamed by these kidnappings and have 
resorted to taking their own sons' lives.
  In April, I, along with 48 other Members of Congress, signed and sent 
a letter to Secretary of State Tillerson asking him to raise the issue 
of this horrible violence against innocent men with the Russian 
officials, but to date, neither Secretary Tillerson or President Trump 
or anybody else in the administration have committed to taking action 
on this issue.
  The United States must speak out about this atrocity, and Russia must 
investigate such human rights violations so that there is 
accountability for an end to these senseless crimes.
  During this Pride Month, we here in the United States celebrate our 
equality. However, every month we must say and act for the men in 
Chechnya as we fight for equality across the globe.
