                  GIVING SMALL BUSINESS A BETTER DEAL

  (Ms. VELAZQUEZ asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, Donald Trump has now been President for 
188 days, and despite the promises, his Republican-controlled Congress 
has not passed a single meaningful piece of job creation legislation.
  Last night, we watched as Republicans failed in their latest effort 
to take healthcare from the American people. Mr. Speaker, it is time, 
at last, to move on.
  The American people are looking for real proposals to create jobs, 
increase wages, and strengthen our economy. They are looking for--and 
they deserve--a better deal.
  As the ranking member of the Small Business Committee, almost every 
day I hear from entrepreneurs and small businesses who create jobs in 
our communities, and under Democratic plans, we will give them tools to 
further succeed.
  We will offer small firms tax incentives to bring on and train new 
employees. We will invest in apprenticeship programs to help meet small 
businesses' workforce needs. We will expand internet access to fuel the 
next generation of innovation and e-commerce.
  I ask my Republican colleagues, at long last, give up on this 
obsession with attacking America's healthcare. Instead, let us move 
forward with giving America's workers and small businesses a better 
deal.
