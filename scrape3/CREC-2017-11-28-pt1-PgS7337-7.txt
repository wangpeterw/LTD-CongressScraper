     AUTHORIZING TESTIMONY, DOCUMENT PRODUCTION, AND REPRESENTATION

  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 343, submitted earlier today.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:

       A resolution (S. Res. 343) to authorize testimony, document 
     production, and representation in Arizona v. Mark Louis 
     Prichard.

  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the 
resolution.
  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for 
testimony in a criminal action pending in Arizona State court. In this 
action, the defendant is charged with threatening to cause physical 
injury to Senator Flake and for trespassing on his Tucson, AZ, office. 
A trial is scheduled for November 29, 2017.
  The prosecution is seeking in this case testimony from an employee in 
the Senator's office who witnessed the relevant events. The enclosed 
resolution would authorize that staffer, and any other current or 
former employee of the Senator's office from whom relevant evidence may 
be necessary, to testify and produce documents in this case, with 
representation by the Senate legal counsel.
  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 
resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to 
reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no 
intervening action or debate.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  The resolution (S. Res. 343) was agreed to.
  The preamble was agreed to.
  (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today's Record 
under ``Submitted Resolutions.'')
  Mr. DAINES. I suggest the absence of a quorum.
