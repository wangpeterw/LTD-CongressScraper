                             MARCH FOR LIFE

  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about this 
Friday's March for Life. This Friday, the National Mall and Capitol 
campus will again be filled with men and women from every corner of the 
country. Together, they will gather in celebration of the sanctity of 
life and in solidarity for its protection. For 43 straight years, the 
March for Life has given a powerful platform for average people to join 
in the political discourse to influence Federal policy in support of 
life.

change is the theme of this year's march. Now, this year's march is 
called the Power of One. The March for Life uses the following quote 
from the author J.R.R. Tolkien to encapsulate this theme: ``Even the 
smallest person can change the course of history.''
  This is a powerful message that we should all embrace. It reminds us 
that from the young people marching on a cold January morning to the 
unborn children whose futures are filled with unlimited potential, any 
one of them has the power to be a positive force for good.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.
  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning 
business.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
