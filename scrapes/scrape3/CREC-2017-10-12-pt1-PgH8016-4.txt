                   FALLEN TTU OFFICER FLOYD EAST, JR.

  (Mr. ARRINGTON asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a fallen 
hero, Officer Floyd East, Jr. Officer East was a police officer for the 
Texas Tech University Police Department. On Monday, October 9, Officer 
East completed his final patrol to protect and serve.
  Officer East has been described by friends as someone you could rely 
on and someone who was always there to help or just listen. No doubt, 
he represented the very best of the values of Texas Tech.
  His loss reminds us that policemen and -women put their lives at risk 
every day. He left behind a loving wife, Carmen, who generously allowed 
him to dedicate his life to keeping us safe.
  To his children, Ana and Monica: Our prayers are with you. Scripture 
tells us that ``there's no greater love than for a man to lay down his 
life for his friends.'' That was God's greatest gift to this world and 
that was your dad's greatest gift. Our Red Raider family is behind you, 
and we will never forget Floyd and how he held the thin blue line. God 
bless your family.
