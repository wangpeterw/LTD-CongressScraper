     CELEBRATING NATIONAL CHARTER SCHOOLS WEEK AND SUCCESS ACADEMY

  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate National Charter Schools Week, 
I want to highlight my recent visit to Success Academy Harlem 1, which 
is 1 of 41 charter schools in the largest and highest performing public 
charter school network in New York City.
  Success Academy current serves 14,000 students and has more than 
16,000 families on its wait list. Founded in 2006, Harlem 1 is Success 
Academy's first school, and founder Eva Moskowitz served as its first 
principal.
  With a focus on developing the whole child, Success Academy aims to 
make its schools joyful places of learning. I am here to tell you that 
these schools are getting results, and they are joyful.
  Five of the top five schools in the State of New York in math and two 
of the top five schools in English are Success Academy schools.
  Every student in every school deserves an excellent education, but 
unfortunately we are falling far short of that goal as a nation. 
Thankfully, innovative charter schools like Success Academy Harlem 1 
are providing thousands of families with new hope and opportunity.
