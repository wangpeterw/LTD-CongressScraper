               CONGRATULATIONS TO ORONO GIRLS BASKETBALL

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the Orono girls 
basketball team for recently winning the Minnesota High School State 
Championship.
  After falling short of high expectations to win it all last year, the 
Spartans bounced back this season with an impressive 27-4 record and 
the top seed, despite many thinking that they had missed their window. 
That didn't stop these girls though. They were determined to finish the 
job this season as they stormed through the playoffs. Led by senior 
Tori Andrew, the team played selflessly. Andrew, the only returning 
starter from last season, made it a point to give her teammates the 
recognition that they deserved.
  The Spartans went on to beat Winona 65-47 in the State title game.
  Orono's resilience, Mr. Speaker, in response to the previous season, 
speaks highly of their character and their program led by Coach Lavesa 
Glover in her very first season with the team. These girls showed that 
they give their all in everything they do, whether it is for their 
team, their school, their families, or their community.
  Mr. Speaker, we are so proud of the Orono girls basketball team. 
Congratulations on the State title.
