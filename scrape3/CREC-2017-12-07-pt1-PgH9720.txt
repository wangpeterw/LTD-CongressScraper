                        REMEMBERING PEARL HARBOR

  (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, my heart is in Hawaii today as we 
commemorate the 76th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, a day 
that forever changed Hawaii and our country.
  We remember those who paid the ultimate price on that fateful day and 
the millions of Americans who answered the call to serve in the months 
and years that followed, including two of our former U.S. Senators, 
Inouye and Akaka.
  We remember the famed ``Go for Broke'' 442nd Infantry Regiment and 
other units made up of young men who, despite seeing their friends and 
family members be sent off to internment camps, still stood up and 
volunteered to serve, putting their lives on the line for this country. 
They served bravely, sacrificed greatly, and became the most highly 
decorated unit in all of the U.S. Army's history.
  We must never forget what happened at Pearl Harbor, the lessons 
learned, and the sacrifices of those who served. There is no question 
that the stories of the Greatest Generation will live on forever in the 
hearts of a grateful nation.
