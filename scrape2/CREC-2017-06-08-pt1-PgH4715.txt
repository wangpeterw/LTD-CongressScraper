                          REPEALING DODD-FRANK

  (Mr. RASKIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise because the majority is expected to 
vote today to repeal Dodd-Frank, the legislation that we passed after 
Wall Street predators in the mortgage meltdown crisis cost the American 
people 8.7 million jobs and $19 trillion, including $2.7 trillion in 
retirement savings. Ten million Americans lost their homes and entire 
communities were devastated.
  But, amazingly, the majority wants to destroy the most important 
piece of financial safety legislation passed for the American people in 
75 years. They call it the Financial CHOICE Act, but what kind of 
choice does it give you?
  It destroys the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has saved 
26 million people nearly $12 billion from scams and rip-offs. It 
destroys the Volcker rule, which keeps banks from making speculative 
bets with your money.
  The Financial CHOICE Act is the wrong choice for America and a very 
bad choice for Congress.
