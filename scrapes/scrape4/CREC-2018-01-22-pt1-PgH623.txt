                     FACT-CHECKING THE INACCURACIES

  (Mr. RICHMOND asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I come to the mike tonight just in a way 
of fact-checking all of the inaccuracies that we hear.
  If Members listen to the White House, if Members listen to my 
colleagues on the other side, they pretend that this whole shutdown was 
over illegal immigrants versus American citizens.
  Our DREAMers, who came here as children through no fault of their 
own, were legal until the President decided to withdraw their legality 
and their documentation. He made them here undocumented.
  The second part of all of this is they are saying: Oh, we are funding 
our troops.
  It was General Mattis who said that funding the troops with a 
continuing resolution was debilitating for our armed services.
  So there are a lot of things that we hear, but on the House floor in 
this United States Congress, the one thing we owe to the American 
public and to our citizens is the truth, whether it is on our side or 
whether it is not.
  The truth is they have well over 230 Members. They could pass a 
budget if they wanted to. If they would work with both sides, then we 
could continue to do what the Congressional Black Caucus has done since 
the beginning of time, which is make this country a more perfect Union.
