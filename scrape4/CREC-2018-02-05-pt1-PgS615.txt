   MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 1551, H.R. 2372, AND H.R. 2579

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I understand that there are three bills 
at the desk, and I ask for their first reading en bloc.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bills by title for the 
first time en bloc.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (H.R. 1551) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 
     1986 to modify the credit for production from advanced 
     nuclear power facilities.
       A bill (H.R. 2372) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 
     1986 to clarify the rules relating to veteran health 
     insurance and eligibility for the premium tax credit.
       A bill (H.R. 2579) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 
     1986 to allow the premium tax credit with respect to 
     unsubsidized COBRA continuation coverage.

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I now ask for a second reading, and I 
object to my own request, all en bloc.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection having been heard, the bills will be 
read for the second time on the next legislative day.
