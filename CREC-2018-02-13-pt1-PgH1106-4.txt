                         WE NEED REAL SOLUTIONS

  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to the bad 
deals President Trump continues to push onto the American people.
  As the administration continues to celebrate rewarding the top 1 
percent with its bonanza, his administration is looking to slash 
programs like Social Security, Great Lakes water restoration, heating 
assistance for the elderly, and food for hungry people, just to name a 
few. The President's budget is as unrealistic as it is cruel. But 
Congress holds the power of the purse, and we intend to employ it.
  When you think about it, President Trump's hollow $1.5 trillion 
infrastructure plan actually only includes $200 billion in Federal 
investment and expects the States to come up with five times that much. 
I suppose some would call that a Ponzi scheme.
  His plan cedes Federal leadership and passes the buck to struggling 
State and local governments. Maybe some of my colleagues represent 
places that can afford all that. We certainly can't in Ohio.
  I can't figure out why the President, who claims to be a builder 
himself, shortchanges his real chance to invest in America. Whether it 
is the deficit-raising budget or his flawed infrastructure deal, we 
know the American people need real solutions, not more hollow, false 
promises.
