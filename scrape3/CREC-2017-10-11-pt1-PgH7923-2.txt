                  CELEBRATING THE WORK OF TERESA LEWIS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the work of a very 
wonderful constituent of the Fifth District of North Carolina, Teresa 
Lewis.
  Every September, we celebrate American Business Women's Day in order 
to recognize the many different backgrounds and diverse occupations of 
American businesswomen. However, it is my belief that we should 
celebrate American businesswomen like Teresa Lewis every day.
  Teresa's success was born out of determination and the desire to 
provide a better life for her family. In 1986, Teresa founded WorkForce 
Carolina, a professional staffing service that includes recruitment, 
interview completion, and skills assessment.
  As CEO of WorkForce Carolina, Teresa has employed thousands of 
people, and her company has served as a boon to the North Carolina 
economy.
  Most importantly, Teresa serves as a role model to all women and men 
in our country. I commend Teresa Lewis on all of her many 
accomplishments and thank her for all she does for the community.
