                        NATIONAL ADOPTION MONTH

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, November is National Adoption Month, which 
is an opportunity to remember the more than 400,000 children across the 
country who are waiting for a family to provide them with a loving 
home, one they can call their own. The backbone of American society is 
the family unit. The children in foster care systems around the country 
deserve to know the love and warmth of a supportive family, and more 
and more across the country are promoting awareness of adoption and the 
children waiting to be shown support by adoptive families.
  The best way to help children grow up to be good citizens, hold jobs, 
invent new technologies, discover cures for diseases, and become role 
models for other children is to provide them leadership, love, and 
support as they grow up.
  Mr. Speaker, adoption brings so much joy to so many children as well 
as their new families. During National Adoption Month, let's continue 
to devote resources to ensure we can continue spreading this joy.
