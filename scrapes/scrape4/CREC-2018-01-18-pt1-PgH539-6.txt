                         NEW WITHHOLDING TABLES

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
immediate benefits that H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, is already 
delivering for American families.
  On January 11, the Treasury Department released its updated 
withholding tables for 2018. These tables work to implement the Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act, the tax reform package passed by Congress and signed 
into law by President Trump just before Christmas.

  With the implementation of these new withholding tables, the Treasury 
Department has estimated that 90 percent of wage earners will 
experience an increase in their take-home pay. A married couple with 
two children, making $75,000 a year, would see a $1,350 wage increase 
per year.
  I am thrilled to see what closing unfair loopholes, simplifying the 
Tax Code, and getting the Federal Government out of the way does to 
boost the financial stability of American families.
