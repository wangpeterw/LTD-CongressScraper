                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Dr. Dan C. Cummins, Peoples Church, Jacksonville, Texas, 
offered the following prayer:
  Heavenly Father, as we approach holy week, may all in government 
emulate the humility of the king of kings and lord of lords, who 
entered Jerusalem not a conquering monarch but a lowly servant riding 
upon a donkey.
  His was not to reign over Rome but to remain obedient to His Father's 
will and the passion of His cross. In death, He showed us how to live, 
for greater love has no man than this, than to lay down His life for 
His friends. In His resurrection, He conquered death, Hell, and the 
grave. By His ascension, He established His eternal throne and kingdom.
  Demonstrating His eternal dominion over sin, He gave us power through 
His indwelling Holy Spirit. Therefore, let us serve one another, esteem 
one another, and love one another. Empower us to choose obedience to 
our King. In the majestic name of Jesus Christ I pray.
  Amen.
