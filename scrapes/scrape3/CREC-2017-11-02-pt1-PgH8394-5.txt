       CONGRATULATING THE HOUSTON ASTROS WINNING THE WORLD SERIES

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, good morning, America. What about those 
Houston Astros?
  As Representative of the 18th Congressional District in the great 
city of Houston, let me thank the Houston Astros for taking a Harvey-
worn community to the highest lengths. We had never won the World 
Series.
  Minute Maid is a fine stadium and the L.A. Dodgers were a very fine 
competitor. Let me thank all of them for the great sportsmanship, the 
character that was shown.
  It shows what America is about. You can be two great adversaries on 
the battlefield of baseball, but you can still be great friends and 
colleagues and part of the great American pastime.
  Thank you to the mayor, the county government, the State government, 
all of those fans out there. Thank you to George Springer and Altuve, 
who caught the final out. Oh, I was so excited.
  Congratulations to those southern boys, the boys of the south, the 
boys of the southwest. They did a great job. Yes, we are the World 
Series champion, the American League champion. Go, Houston Astros.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank you for your kindness. I am so excited. They are 
great young men.
