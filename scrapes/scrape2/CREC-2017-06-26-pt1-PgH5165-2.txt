                                              Office of the Clerk,


                                     House of Representatives,

                                    Washington, DC, June 22, 2017.
     Hon. Paul D. Ryan,
     Speaker, House of Representatives,

       Dear Mr. Speaker: I have the honor to transmit herewith a 
     scanned copy of a letter received from Ms. Marci Andino, 
     Executive Director, South Carolina Election Commission, 
     indicating that, according to the preliminary results of the 
     Special Election held June 20, 2017, the Honorable Ralph 
     Norman was elected Representative to Congress for the Fifth 
     Congressional District of South Carolina.
       With best wishes, I am,
           Sincerely,
     Karen L. Haas.
                                  ____

                                                    South Carolina


                                          Election Commission,

                                      Columbia, SC, June 22, 2017.
     Hon. Karen L. Haas,
     Clerk, House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Ms. Haas: This is to advise you that the unofficial 
     results of the Special Election held on Tuesday, June 20, 
     2017, for Representative in Congress from the Fifth 
     Congressional District of South Carolina, show that Ralph 
     Norman received 44,906 votes or 51.1% of the total number of 
     votes cast for that office.
       It would appear from these unofficial results that Ralph 
     Norman was elected as Representative in Congress from the 
     Fifth Congressional District of South Carolina.
       To the best of our knowledge and belief at this time, there 
     is no contest to this election.
       As soon as the official results are certified to this 
     office by all counties involved and the State Board of 
     Canvassers certifies the official results, a certification of 
     the official results will be prepared and transmitted to the 
     S.C. Secretary of State as required by law.
           Sincerely,
                                                     Marci Andino,
                                               Executive Director.

     

                          ____________________
