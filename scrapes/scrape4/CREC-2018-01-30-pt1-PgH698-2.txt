     independent contractors that requires, as a condition of 
     employment, that the employee or independent contractor agree 
     to resolve through arbitration any claim under title VII of 
     the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or any tort related to or 
     arising out of sexual assault or harassment, including

     through arbitration any claim under title VII of the Civil 
     Rights Act of 1964 or any tort related to or arising out of

     personally determines that the waiver is necessary to avoid 
     harm to national security interests of the United States, and 
     that the term of the contract or subcontract is not longer 
     than necessary to avoid such harm. The determination shall 
     set forth with specificity the grounds for the waiver and for 
     the contract or subcontract term selected, and shall state 
     any alternatives considered in lieu of a waiver and the 
     reasons each such alternative would not avoid harm to 
     national security interests of the United States. The 
     Secretary of Defense shall transmit to Congress, and 
     simultaneously make public, any determination under this 
     subsection not less than 15 business days before the contract 
     or subcontract addressed in the determination may be awarded.

     Appropriations Act, 2018''.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 714, the motion 
shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations.
  The gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Granger) and the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. Visclosky) each will control 30 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.
  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, once again, I stand before you today to ask for your 
support to pass the fiscal year 2018 Defense Appropriations bill. It is 
past time that this essential, must-pass funding bill for our military 
be enacted into law. Congress must act responsibly and do its job to 
quickly get these dollars out the door and where they are needed as 
soon as possible.
  The legislation before you provides $659 billion for defense, more 
than $60 billion above last year's levels. When combined with the 
almost $5 billion already enacted into law in December, this bill 
matches the top-line funding level in the final National Defense 
Authorization Act enacted into law.
  All Federal dollars are not the same. We need to provide and 
prioritize national security after years of neglect and an increasingly 
dangerous international situation.
  Nor can we continue to hold our troops hostage as leverage for 
unrelated issues. We are almost 4 months into fiscal year 2018, and our 
troops still don't have their funding. It is time that the Congress 
fulfill its responsibility to fund our troops at the levels needed.
  It is time to lift the budget caps and enact a full-year Defense 
Appropriations Act so that our military can begin to rebuild. This bill 
does that by lifting the budget caps on defense and fully funding the 
Department at the top line already approved by the Congress in the 
National Defense Authorization Act.
  It takes care of our troops by providing additional manpower and 
fully funding a 2.4 percent pay raise, and it provides additional 
funding for key readiness programs and robustly funds maintenance of 
equipment and facilities.
  The bill includes specific investments in several areas, such as air 
superiority, $4.3 billion above request; shipbuilding, $1.6 billion 
above request; research and development, $10 billion above 2017; 
defense health, an additional $644 million for medical research; and 
grants forces fully equipped.
  The bill also provides additional resources in a National Defense 
Restoration Fund in the amount of $28.6 billion to allow Secretary 
Mattis to begin investing in the new defense strategy now instead of 
waiting a full year.

                              {time}  1400

  This bill gives our military leaders the sufficient, sustainable, and 
stable funding they have told us, over and over again, that they need.
  The House has done its job more than once to fund our troops at the 
levels they need only to have the Senate fail to act. Congress must 
step up and fulfill its most fundamental constitutional responsibility, 
which is to ensure that our troops have what they need to defend our 
Nation.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  (Mr. VISCLOSKY asked and was given permission to revise and extend 
his remarks.)
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I first want to start by associating 
myself with the remarks of my chairwoman and suggest to this body that 
it is time for Congress to begin to govern and run the day-to-day 
operation of the Government of the United States in a timely fashion.
  Mr. Speaker, this is the third iteration of the fiscal year 2018 
Defense Appropriations Act that has been brought to the floor. I, for 
one, have

[[Page H720]]

nothing more to say about the merits of this legislation that would not 
be redundant. However, I do want to reiterate my profound respect for 
the exceptional work that has been put into this legislation, time and 
time again, by Chairwoman Granger, all of the members of our 
subcommittee, and our superlative staff.
  Today, January 30, 2018, Congress is 122 days late. We are 122 days 
past the start of the current fiscal year and 122 days past the time 
that the legislation we are considering today for the third time should 
have been completed, conferenced, and signed into law.
  Mr. Speaker, we have a number problem. As an appropriator, I ask for 
a number to craft a bill that, by law, does not violate the Budget 
Control Act. We need a number so that Chairwoman Granger, our 
subcommittee members, and I can make decisions on how best to move 
forward so our military leaders are not hindered and forced to comply 
with the constraints of continuing resolutions. As an appropriator, all 
I want is a number. Give us a number, and we will finish our work for 
this fiscal year and give the certainty that has been repeatedly asked 
for by the Department of Defense and our 17 intelligence agencies.
  Unfortunately, operating under the fourth continuing resolution and 
passing essentially the same Defense Appropriations measure for a third 
time does nothing--nothing--to solve the number problem, nor does it 
remedy the slight inconvenience that this bill exceeds the Budget 
Control Act by $35 billion.
  Today's legislation does recognize this inconvenience by obviating 
sequestration. I guess that is what passes as budget control in these 
days in this Congress.
  Some may say that we must pass this bill today to support our men and 
women in uniform. I would respond by saying that today's 60 minutes of 
theater continues to avoid meaningfully addressing the needs of our 
troops. If we were serious about that, we would have solved our number 
problem and allowed the chair and ranking member of the full committee, 
and the subcommittee chairs and ranking members of all 12 committees, 
to negotiate a realistic budget figure last summer so that we could 
have completed our bill last September. That would be helping our 
troops.
  I would also add that if we don't agree to an overall domestic 
discretionary number, then we will continue to disinvest in the true 
security of this Nation--our people.
  We need a domestic number so we can make decisions and give direction 
to all Federal agencies so they can plan on how to best invest in our 
national economy, jobs, and the health and prosperity of our people. 
The International Trade Commission needs direction so they can fully 
enforce our trade laws. Customs and Border Protection needs direction. 
This government needs timely decisions and certainty.
  According to the Department of Defense, 71 percent of people aged 17 
to 24 years of age in the United States would fail to qualify for 
military enlistment because of physical or mental health issues, low 
educational scores, or major criminal convictions. General Joseph 
Dunford, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has testified that 
the strength of the United States military is a direct reflection of 
the strength of U.S. society.
  I would propose that improving the strength of our country is not 
just a robust defense number that I desperately want. We need a robust 
domestic number that allows for the critical investments necessary for 
the success of our economy, the creation of jobs, and for the people of 
this country.
  Our number problem is solvable. Give us a negotiated budget number so 
we can stop wasting everybody's time and the money of the American 
taxpayers. Then we can truly start supporting the strength of our 
national security, our troops, and our national economy.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. Frelinghuysen), who is the chairman of the full committee.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman from Texas for 
her time and for her leadership on national security and intelligence 
issues. Indeed, I would like to thank all members of the subcommittee--
Republican and Democrat--and the staff for their hard work to assure 
defense and intelligence funding and also for their work on a variety 
of continuing resolutions that relate to the same.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise, once again, to support this Defense 
Appropriations bill just as I did in July and again in September.
  I visited our troops in Iraq twice last year in addition to official 
trips to north Africa and Southeast Asia. My goal is always to assess 
U.S. posture in those regions militarily and diplomatically. I can tell 
you, from those experiences, our Nation's competitive military 
advantage is badly eroding, and our allies, partners, and adversaries 
know it.
  So how have we responded? The reality is: not well enough. In fact, 
we have pushed our military towards its breaking point. Instead of 
upgrading our hardware, we have allowed our equipment to age. Instead 
of arming our troops for tomorrow's fight, we have let them become 
seriously under-equipped. Instead of rightsizing our Armed Forces, we 
have reduced their size.
  Mr. Speaker, we ask a great deal of our men and women in uniform. We 
ask them to leave their families to complete difficult training. We ask 
them to move from duty station to duty station without complaint. We 
ask them to tolerate long deployments far from home. We ask them to 
carry out dangerous missions in dangerous corners of the world. We ask 
them to reenlist with their families to preserve the strength of our 
Armed Forces.
  Every passing day of reduced military funding levels creates an ever-
increasing risk for our men and women on the front lines. We should not 
ask them to continue to do more with less. This full-year Defense 
Appropriations bill needs to be enacted now, and may I say the other 11 
appropriations bills as well.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
New York (Mrs. Lowey), who is the ranking member on the full committee.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to say a few words about 
the retirement of my chairman, Rodney Frelinghuysen. Chairman 
Frelinghuysen has carried out his responsibilities with fairness and 
earnestness, and it has been such a pleasure to serve as ranking member 
during his chairmanship.
  I look forward, however, to working together for the remainder of 
this year on our shared goal: bipartisan and responsible full-year 
funding for all discretionary investments.
  Today, we are considering the FY 2018 Defense Appropriations bill for 
the third time, a time-wasting consequence of an agreement between the 
Speaker and rightwing Republicans--the third time. Last week, 
Republican leadership kicked the can down the road and passed yet 
another continuing resolution delaying investments in our military, 
education, infrastructure, biomedical research, and so much more.
  Yet again, the bill before us removes Congresswoman Barbara Lee's 
amendment to debate a new Authorization for Use of Military Force which 
received bipartisan support in the Appropriations Committee markup. 
This undemocratic maneuver, which the majority has repeated once again, 
is outrageous.
  In addition to the many procedural inequities, the majority's effort 
to increase defense spending is a mirage because the bill would turn 
off sequestration for defense in FY18, allowing Republicans to violate 
the spirit of our budget laws and increase defense spending while 
ignoring other investments that grow our economy, create jobs, and 
further provide for our security.
  This is hardly about fiscal responsibility. If it were, the majority 
would eliminate the seven slush funds in this bill that equals $28.6 
billion for a department that would receive far more than it requested.
  Four months into the fiscal year, the Federal Government is 
irresponsibly operating on the fourth continuing resolution. We do not 
have an agreement on top-line spending numbers, let alone an omnibus 
spending package ready when the current CR runs out next week on 
February 8. So, my friends,

[[Page H721]]

this is not the time to pat ourselves on the back for a job well done. 
On the contrary, we should be settling down and working together to 
pass spending bills for FY18.
  If the majority were serious about funding our military, then they 
would move forward toward a full-year, bipartisan omnibus that could 
pass both Chambers. Instead, they continue to show their inability to 
govern by leading us down a path that will require another CR that is 
detrimental to our men and women in uniform.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.
  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. Rogers), who is the chairman of the State, Foreign 
Operations, and Related Programs Subcommittee.
  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding time.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this fiscal year 2018 DOD 
Appropriations bill. Although I am proud to support this critical 
legislation, I will say that I am disappointed to be here, yet again, 
speaking in support of the DOD Appropriations bill as we, again, seek 
its passage in the House.
  Despite Chairman Frelinghuysen's Herculean efforts to complete all 12 
bills on time and passing several packages that included the Defense 
bill, the Senate refuses to act. We recently saw the effects of this 
when the government shutdown put great stress on the backs of our 
servicemembers and their families.
  Mr. Speaker, it is time that we push aside partisanship and do what 
is right for the country and for our national security by passing this 
bill. While it certainly represents the outcome of many hard choices, 
it prioritizes funding where our troops need it most. It wisely invests 
in readiness, training, maintenance, and procurement of new equipment 
and technology to ensure that our troops are prepared for the tasks 
before them.
  I am pleased that this bill takes care of our troops and their 
families at home by granting them a long-awaited 2.4 percent pay raise. 
Our Nation has been at war for nearly two decades, and our 
servicemembers have put their lives on the line to ensure that we can 
live our way of life. This raise represents just one small way for us 
to honor their service.
  Mr. Speaker, they say that the third time is the charm, and I hope 
this holds true here. After the House passes the bill, I urge the 
Senate to do so as well so that the President can sign this bill into 
law. According to the Constitution, it is the Congress' responsibility 
to provide for our common defense. This bill does just that.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), who is the ranking member on the Interior, 
Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee and a member of the 
Defense Subcommittee.

                              {time}  1415

  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, here we are again. For 4 months, the 
Federal Government has been operating under a series of short-term 
continuing resolutions. And as we approach yet another deadline to fund 
the government next week, the Republican majority is spending time on 
the floor today voting a third time on a Defense Appropriations bill 
that they know will not pass in the Senate.
  The most basic, fundamental responsibility of Congress is to provide 
adequate and timely funding for the entire Federal Government, both our 
national defense and our domestic priorities, for a full fiscal year. 
The fact that this bill is on the floor for a third time highlights the 
absolute failure of the Republican majority to advance a responsible 
budget process.
  Mr. Speaker, voting on the same bill three times is the very 
definition of playing political games. The American people deserve 
better than this continuing Republican chaos.
  Democrats and Republicans agree. We agree that defense spending is 
vitally important, but so is funding education, transportation, 
healthcare, and all the other Federal programs that all Americans and 
our military--their families, included--depend upon.
  If anyone doubts the harmful impacts of the endless stopgap spending 
bills, perhaps they should listen to our Secretary of Defense: ``For 
too long, we have asked our military to stoically carry a `success at 
any cost' attitude as they work tirelessly to accomplish the mission 
with now inadequate and misaligned resources, simply because the 
Congress could not maintain regular order.''
  If Republicans are serious about supporting our military, they should 
heed the Secretary's warning and work with Democrats on a bipartisan 
budget agreement to fund the entire government for the rest of the 
year. I have been ready. Democrats have been ready for months to work 
across the aisle to advance this process. It is long past time that 
Republicans join us.
  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Calvert), the chair of the Subcommittee on Interior, 
Environment, and Related Agencies.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure to 
fund the Department of Defense for fiscal year 2018.
  Today marks the 122nd day that our military has gone without funding 
for FY 2018. Like the rest of the Federal Government, it has been 
forced to operate under a CR for the past 4 months. Secretary of 
Defense James Mattis explained the impacts of operating under a CR, 
particularly those related to readiness and maintenance. They include a 
scaled-back training exercise across the services, the delayed 
introduction of 11 ships by the United States Navy, the postponement of 
all noncritical maintenance work orders by the Army, the curtailment of 
hiring and recruitment, rising acquisition costs from severed 
contracts, and renegotiated terms due to the CR.
  A CR means no new starts, and impacts to current readiness and future 
plans are disastrous. This must stop. Today's passage of this bill 
marks, as was pointed out, the third time we have passed the FY 2018 
Defense Appropriations bill in some form. Let's hope the third time is 
the charm.
  I commend Chairman Frelinghuysen and Chairwoman Granger on their 
tireless persistence and relentless determination on behalf of the U.S. 
servicemembers. The bill provides robust funding for shipbuilding, 
aviation, combat vehicles, and more. It invests in our greatest assets, 
the men and women who wear the uniform, through increased funds for 
training, equipment, and the best healthcare.
  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I implore the Senate to 
act.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Energy and 
Water Development, and Related Agencies, and also a member of the 
Subcommittee on Defense.
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, Groundhog Day isn't until Friday, but here 
we are again, voting for the third time in 7 months on a Defense bill 
that will go in the hole--nowhere. We are 9 days out from the threat of 
another shutdown and 4 months into the fiscal year of 2018, which 
started last October 1, yet we still have no budget framework from our 
Republican friends and their so-called leadership, nothing to direct 
appropriators on what numbers from which to negotiate funding for the 
entirety of the government--not just Defense, not just this account.
  Instead, Republican leadership wastes important, precious time to 
debate a bill that has already passed this Chamber twice before. 
Meanwhile, our Republican colleagues force the entire government to run 
on autopilot for over a third of the fiscal year and trumpet their 
claim that only they prioritize the military.
  How can anyone take this seriously?
  Republicans have provided no overall roadmap of a funding strategy 
for the Federal Government. They failed to agree within their own 
caucus on funding priorities, leaving them incapable to even begin to 
negotiate with Democrats. As a result, law dictates a defense funding 
level of $549 billion. That is a lot of money. Half a trillion. But 
here we are debating, for the third time, an astounding $659 billion 
for defense. That is $110 billion more. Hmm.

[[Page H722]]

  We can all agree that funding defense is a priority, but so are 
pensions, community health centers, Federal workforce training, the 
opioid crisis, keeping our waters clean, domestic security. Well, the 
list goes on, and each deserves attention.
  Why are we voting again on a lopsided bill that blows up budget caps 
when there are so many other bipartisan priorities?
  This is a partisan sideshow that attempts to mask Republican Party 
dysfunction. This is not leadership.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Ohio an 
additional 30 seconds.

  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to once again oppose 
this partisan talking point and demand action on an agreement to fund 
the entire government for the remaining part of this fiscal year. We 
have little more than a week to secure a plan for the remainder of 
2018, but it may be a road too far if Republicans don't come to the 
table to talk among themselves seriously and then be willing to 
negotiate with this side of the aisle.
  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Carter), chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee.
  Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this Defense 
Appropriations bill which will provide full-year funding for the 
Defense Department so they can continue to effectively defend our 
country from an ever-expanding threat which exists in the world today.
  This bill ends uncertainty and ineffectiveness of a continuing 
resolution, allows the DOD to plan and execute on the things they need 
to do today, not last year. Our military needs to modernize to face new 
threats it will face in this world, and they can't do that with a CR.
  This bill also lifts sequestration caps which have, to paraphrase 
Secretary Mattis, caused more harm to our military than any enemy. 
Lifting these caps for FY18 is essential towards improving the 
readiness of our force.
  The world is changing rapidly and so is the nature and threat to our 
military forces and what they face day and night. We owe it to our 
servicemen and -women to give them the resources to modernize their 
capabilities so that they can best face this threat.
  Mr. Speaker, our military is the greatest natural resource in the 
country. I am reminded of this every time I visit The Great Place, Fort 
Hood, in my district. The troops at Fort Hood are currently leading the 
fight against ISIS and will benefit from this bill, and we owe it to 
them.
  We sleep every night under the blanket of freedom they provide 
through their sacrifice. I am proud to support them and hopeful that we 
will pass this bill so we can give them what they need right now so 
they won't face the uncertainty of endless sequestration and CRs. I 
support this bill and encourage my colleagues to support it.
  And it is a current event. Last night, as I flew into Washington, 
D.C., we carried the remains of an American warrior. It is a current 
event. We are all responsible for it. We need to get this job done.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. Lee), my friend and a senior member of the 
Appropriations Committee.
  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman for yielding me time 
and for his tremendous leadership as our ranking member on the Defense 
Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition once again to this bill. I think 
the House has taken it up now for a third time this year.
  Let me just start by saying I grew up in a military family. I am a 
military brat. My dad fought in World War II and in the Korean War. He 
was stationed, among his posts, at Fort Bliss, Texas.
  And I want to say that supporting our troops, making sure that they 
have everything they need, is extremely important. And opposing this 
budget, for me, of course, does not reflect my support for our troops.
  But I just have to tell you, this bill appropriates the $664 billion 
in defense spending for this already out-of-control Pentagon budget. It 
also includes more than $75 billion for wars that Congress has never 
debated or voted on. And what is worse, this bill includes $1.2 billion 
in overseas contingency operations to increase troop levels in 
Afghanistan by 3,500 troops. This is really outrageous, and this fund 
should really be eliminated.
  Now, the Pentagon has failed to achieve the requirement to audit 
itself by 2017, and we know that billions of dollars have been found in 
waste, fraud, and abuse. That is unacceptable.
  Instead of writing blank checks--which is what I think this bill 
does, another blank check to the Pentagon--Congress needs to live up to 
its constitutional obligation to complete an audit, first of all, to 
determine how to make sure we have a rational defense budget that 
protects our national security and supports our troops, not to provide 
excess contracts that lead to waste, fraud, and abuse. We also need to 
debate matters of war and peace.
  So we need to pass my amendment, which I tried to do, quite frankly, 
last year in this very bill, that would sunset the 2001 AUMF, and it 
would give us 8 months--not immediately, but 8 months--to debate and 
vote on a new one before it would be enacted. It took 3 days to enact 
the last one. That is what the debate was. I am asking for 8 months.
  This important amendment would provide Congress plenty of time to do 
our job and finally have a debate on matters of war and peace. However, 
even though my amendment passed the Appropriations Committee in a 
bipartisan fashion, Republicans unilaterally decided to strip this 
amendment from the bill, really, I have to say, in the dead of night.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from California 
an additional 1 minute.
  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, this was very undemocratic and underhanded, and 
it makes me wonder: What is the Speaker afraid of?
  So I asked for my amendment to be debated and voted on on the House 
floor, and again Republican leadership refused--really a shame. Our 
brave troops deserve us to come together and do this so that they know 
that their country has their back.
  I voted against the 2001 authorization because I believe it opened 
the door for any President to wage endless war without a congressional 
debate or vote. Quite frankly, unfortunately, history has borne that 
out.
  According to the Congressional Research Service report, the 2001 AUMF 
has been used more than 37 times in 14 countries to justify military 
action. This report examines only unclassified incidents, and it was 
conducted 3 years ago. So how many other operations have been conducted 
without the knowledge of Congress or the American people? These 
authorizations have also been used to justify perpetual wars that are 
thousands of miles away.
  I will conclude by saying that now any President--any President--can 
unilaterally wage war under this outdated authorization forever, 
really, until it is repealed. Now we have an administration bent on 
increasing our presence in Afghanistan and never leaving Syria, both 
wars that the American public know nothing about.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill, and reject this 
wasteful spending.
  Ms. GRANGER. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. 
Aderholt), chairman of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and 
Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.

                              {time}  1430

  Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to 
support this Defense Appropriations bill.
  It has been noted here already: a total of $659 billion for full-year 
funding for the Department of Defense, including $584 billion for base 
funding and $75.1 billion for overseas contingency operations. It also 
fully funds a 2.4 percent pay raise and supports an increase in troop 
numbers.
  When you add the $4.7 billion in emergency missile defense and other 
funds requested by the President in November, funding for this DOD 
appropriations totals $664 billion--fully consistent with the NDAA for 
FY 2018.

[[Page H723]]

  The House passed nearly identical legislation last year back in July, 
and then again in September.
  Despite the best efforts in the House, here we are again. We are 
doing this legislation again--the other body has failed--and we are 
operating on the fourth continuing resolution for FY 2018. That is the 
30th CR--or continuing resolution--that Congress has passed since 
January of 2011.
  The House passed each of the 12 appropriations bills and their 
individual subcommittees and each of the 12 appropriations bills in 
full committee markup, and each bill has seen the light of day on the 
House floor.
  The other body, Mr. Speaker, is a different story. Not one single 
appropriations bill has seen the light of day on the Senate floor. No 
progress has been made on any individual appropriations bills because 
that body can't seem to get them on the calendar. Part of that has been 
the demand of every administration nominee be discussed for a full 30 
hours--something that this Congress never did under President Obama.
  If going to a 51-vote process for appropriations bills is the only 
way to break this logjam, then such a decision should be made. I am on 
record for that idea, as are many Senators as well.
  Mr. Speaker, we find ourselves in this situation once again. The real 
question is: Will the other body do theirs?
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the ranking member on the Military 
Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.
  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding and for his leadership--particularly, his responsible 
leadership--as the ranking member of the Defense Appropriations 
Subcommittee.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the political gambit that 
the Republican leadership is pulling today.
  Virtually identical versions of the Defense Appropriations bill we 
are considering have already passed the House twice. The Republican 
majority is so bankrupt of ideas that they are now going around in 
circles playing political games.
  As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I strongly support 
moving appropriations bills through the committee and to the floor 
through regular order. I applaud all of my committee colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle for working in good faith on all 12 appropriations 
bills.
  But the appropriations process has been hijacked by Republican 
leadership and the rightwing ideologues who now run the House. 
Regardless of the outcome of today's vote, all appropriations bills 
will remain stuck in the swamp that is this Republican Congress.
  The reason for this holdup is that Republican so-called leaders have 
refused to work across the aisle toward an agreement on a budget that 
would prevent the gutting of investments in vital national priorities: 
from education to infrastructure, from healthcare to housing, from 
diplomacy to defense.
  We need to provide our military with the resources they need. There 
is no question about that. Instead, the Republican majority is using 
the brave servicemen and -women who defend our Nation as pawns in a 
partisan crusade that would undermine the nation our troops are 
defending.
  The stated Republican rationale for their intransigence is that they 
are concerned about the deficit, yet these are the same Republicans who 
voted to explode the deficit by more than $1.5 trillion in order to 
give a huge tax cut to big corporations and the top 1 percent.
  As each day passes, it becomes more and more clear that the 
priorities of the Republican majority are backward and immoral.
  Instead of expanding access to affordable healthcare, Republicans 
tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act and leave millions uninsured.
  Instead of investing in the middle class, Republicans gave a huge tax 
giveaway to those who have turned their backs on the middle class.
  Instead of building on bipartisan efforts to advance reasonable 
reforms to our immigration system, Republicans are trying to tear apart 
families and close the door on aspiring Americans.
  Instead of responsibly funding national priorities, Republicans are 
playing political games to distract from their failure to govern.
  Instead of investing in all of our people, Republicans are pitting us 
against each other to deflect the blame from where it belongs--with the 
party who controls both Houses of Congress and the White House.
  This is no way to keep the state of our union safe. This is no way to 
keep the state of our union strong.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this political charade. 
Let's work together to invest in all of our national priorities and 
make the state of our union more perfect.
  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Thornberry), the chairman of the House Armed Services 
Committee.
  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I 
appreciate her strong, persistent leadership on behalf of our troops 
and our Nation.
  Mr. Speaker, in the days leading up to the most recent government 
shutdown, we heard a number of Members of both bodies, on the floor and 
in the press, say that they were opposed to that continuing resolution 
because of the damage that continuing resolutions do to the military. 
It is absolutely true that continuing resolutions do erode our fighting 
capability.
  This is the chance--the bill that the gentlewoman from Texas has 
brought--this is the chance to do it right. This is the chance to fully 
fund the military for the rest of the fiscal year and get them out of 
the CR mess. So all of those Members who came here to the well and have 
talked to the press and in the other body, who expressed concern about 
the damage that a CR does, this is the chance to fix that problem by 
voting for the bill that is before us today.
  Mr. Speaker, it is another opportunity to remove our troops from the 
partisan political morass that has seemed to bind them. We just heard 
in the previous speech everything from healthcare, taxes, funding for 
housing, the full panoply of issues. Some Members have used all of 
their desire to get an outcome they want on those other issues as an 
excuse for not funding our military.
  More recently, we have heard Members who say: Yes, I know the 
military needs to be funded, they need more money, but I can't support 
it until we have the outcome I want on an immigration issue.
  So from taxes and healthcare and immigration, it is all an excuse to 
not fund the military, to keep them hostage, until those other issues 
are resolved the way that Members want them to be.
  Mr. Speaker, I just think that is wrong. We need to set our military 
free of all of the other issues. I may well agree on finding a 
reasonable solution to the DACA issue. I may well agree on more funding 
for a number of domestic spending programs. But none of them, however 
important they may be, should be an excuse for failing to support the 
military so that when they go out and perform the missions our country 
asks them to perform, they are fully trained, fully supported, and 
equipped with the best that this country can offer.
  Mr. Speaker, I think it is important for all of us, whatever 
committee we serve on, to remember that the men and women who are out 
there risking their lives for us, do so unconditionally, whether it is 
in the mountains of Afghanistan, near the DMZ of Korea, whether they 
are doing exercises in Eastern Europe or the Middle East, they perform 
their service unconditionally. Our support for them should be 
unconditional, too.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).
  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill.
  I have said it before and I will say it again:
  Last summer, the House passed all 12 appropriations bills before the 
2018 fiscal year started on October 1. In those bills, we appropriated 
the funds necessary to equip our servicemembers with the resources they 
need to defend this country in the face of threats from North Korea, 
China, Russia, al-Qaida,

[[Page H724]]

ISIS, Iran, and cyber threats, just to name a few.
  Yet our servicemembers have been routinely denied access to these 
resources as Senate Democrats have been holding back the full funding 
of our armed services. In doing so, they ask our servicemembers to go 
into battle with aging equipment and insufficient resources, risking 
their lives to defend America. Just 10 days ago, we had another 
helicopter accident and we lost two pilots who were in an Apache.
  Our men and women in uniform haven't even had a modest pay raise in a 
very long time. It is time to deliver on this commitment.
  Mr. Speaker, we have the opportunity at times to visit our troops 
overseas. I had the opportunity at the end of last year to look into 
the young faces of our men and women over there. They are expecting us 
to do this.
  I would like to remind my colleagues across the aisle that our 
adversaries are on the move. Russia and China are expansionists now. 
North Korea and Iran fire off ballistic missiles at our allies, 
destabilizing those regions. There is no doubt that our inaction only 
emboldens them.
  Mr. Speaker, we must rebuild our military before it is too late. The 
choice is easy: we either deter our enemies through superior strength, 
or we risk greater conflict by demonstrating weakness.
  Let me be clear: what we spend on our defenses should not be a 
function of any other program. It should be a function of the threats 
our Nation faces and what we owe our servicemembers in the field.
  Mr. Speaker, I implore my colleagues across the aisle to fund our 
military today.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I would simply close at the point where I began and ask 
the Members of this institution at large--the United States Congress, 
both Houses--to please give the Appropriations Committees numbers for 
defense and discretionary spending so that under the leadership of 
Chairman Frelinghuysen and Mrs. Lowey, in this case under Chairwoman 
Granger, myself, and the other 11 subcommittees, we can finish our 
work. It is less than 2 weeks before we will begin fiscal year 2019. I 
would ask my colleagues to please give us those numbers so that we can 
do our work effectively.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, as we conclude our remarks and, again, call for a vote 
on this very important bill, I want to express my respect and 
appreciation for the help of Ranking Member Visclosky, and certainly 
for the leadership of Appropriations Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen. I 
have been fortunate to follow the chairman, as chair of Defense 
Appropriations, and I speak for all who serve on his committee, who 
look to him for leadership and respect him for his service. He is an 
extraordinary public servant and a model for us all, and we thank him.
  Mr. Speaker, the time is long past for Congress to fulfill their 
duty. I urge all Members to support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.
  Pursuant to House Resolution 714, the previous question is ordered.
  The question is on the motion by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
Granger).
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it.
  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The yeas and nays were ordered.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15-
minute vote on adoption of the motion will be followed by a 5-minute 
vote on:
  Suspending the rules and passing H.R. 4292.
  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 250, 
nays 166, not voting 14, as follows:

                             [Roll No. 49]
