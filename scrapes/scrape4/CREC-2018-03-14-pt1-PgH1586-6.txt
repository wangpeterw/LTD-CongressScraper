                         CHILDREN OF OUR NATION

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, the children of our Nation are raising 
their voices. In the last couple of days in my district, many young 
people representing the 140,000 DACA-status young people in Texas and 
800,000 in the Nation walked and shouted and asked and cajoled and 
spoke eloquently about the ridiculous malaise of this Congress, where 
we have not reauthorized DACA when there is a bill ready to move.
  Do we care about our children? Do we care about the doctors, lawyers, 
and astronauts? Do we care about the teachers? Do we care about the 
parents--mothers and fathers--all DACA-status individuals who love this 
Nation?

  Raise the age. Ban the bump stocks. Have universal background checks. 
The children's voices are crying.

his mind that he can fire FBI Directors, Assistant Directors? And where 
in the world does the President get in his mind that he can fire the 
Secretary of State in such a disgraceful manner?
