        REPUBLICAN HEALTHCARE PLAN WILL HAVE DEVASTATING IMPACT

  (Mr. SUOZZI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Republican 
healthcare plan and its devastating impact. When it comes to the 
Affordable Care Act, I have always said: mend it, don't end it.
  I came to Congress wanting to work together on a bipartisan plan that 
would build and improve upon the Affordable Care Act. Unfortunately, 
the plan the Republicans have offered and that is supported by the 
President was written in secret, kept under wraps, and is now being 
rushed through marathon subcommittee sessions so the American people 
don't have a chance to actually see what is in this bill.
  Republicans refuse to wait for the Congressional Budget Office, a 
nonpartisan group, to tell us how much their plan will cost and how 
many people will get thrown off their health care plans. Maybe that is 
because their plan offers tax breaks to the wealthy while the rest of 
us get stuck paying the bill.
  Reductions proposed in this bill would result in over $1 billion in 
cuts for New York State this year. Now the American Association of 
Retired Persons, the American Hospital Association, the American 
Medical Association, and a growing list of Republican and Democratic 
Governors throughout the Nation oppose this plan.
  So instead of pushing through a bill that we know will result in 
rising premiums and throw people off their healthcare, let's come 
together and find a solution that makes sense for all Americans.
