                           MAKE IT IN AMERICA

  (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, in the 20th century, good-paying 
manufacturing jobs built the middle class in Rhode Island and across 
our country. But in recent decades, millions of these jobs have 
disappeared. Factories have been shuttered. Bad trade deals have moved 
American jobs to other countries.
  It is time to rebuild American manufacturing. It is time to support 
making things in America again. That is why I have introduced H.R. 
1672, the Make It In America Manufacturing Communities Act, a 
bipartisan bill that will help revitalize American manufacturing and 
promote the creation of good-paying jobs in our country.
  This is a commonsense bill that incentivizes communities, together 
with the private sector, higher education, and other key stakeholders 
to work together to strengthen their manufacturing economies. It 
provides targeted investments and support to make regions and local 
communities competitive in manufacturing again--communities like those 
in my home State of Rhode Island, the birthplace of the American 
industrial revolution.
  Mr. Speaker, let's put America back to work at good-paying jobs. 
Let's get this done and pass H.R. 1672. Let's work to export great 
American goods and not great American jobs.
