                               CBO SCORE

  (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Budget Office 
has come out with their score--or, as we call it, cost--that was 
released today that further confirms the actions taken by the Senate 
Republicans are just as mean as the House Republicans.
  Protections for millions of Americans with preexisting conditions 
will be undermined; hardworking families will be expected to pay more 
for less coverage; and $772 billion will be cut from Medicaid, a safety 
net for millions of seniors in nursing homes, pregnant women, children, 
and people with disabilities.
  The Senate Republicans can change the name of the bill, but, as we 
now know, it is not fundamentally different.
  I hope this score raises a red flag for Republicans in both the House 
and the Senate. I urge that they reconsider in trying to cram their 
TrumpCare bill through the Senate.
  Years ago Senator Dirksen said: ``A billion here, a billion there, 
and pretty soon we are talking about real money.''
  Mr. Speaker, a million here, a million there, and pretty soon the 
Senate Republicans will be talking about denying coverage for 22 
million people; 15 million will lose coverage next year alone.
  How on Earth is this a debate? This is not healthcare. It is a tax 
cut for the wealthiest of Americans at the cost of low-income and 
middle class families.
  Twenty-two million people will lose healthcare.
