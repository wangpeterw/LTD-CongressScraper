Your path. Remind them that the narrow and difficult road eventually 
leads to abundant living. As You teach them tolive abundantly, replace

discouragement with optimism. Lord,remind them that no weapon formed 
against them will be able to prosper. Give them a strong faith in the 
efficacy of prayer, asthey continue to commune with You throughout this
