                                 PRAYER

  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Today's prayer will be offered by Father 
Steven E. Boes, executive director of Boys Town in Boys Town, NE.
  The guest Chaplain offered the following prayer:
  Lord God, we recognize today, on Pearl Harbor Day, the sacrifices of 
those young men and women who gave their lives for their country.
  Lord God, in these troubled times of fires and floods and hurricanes 
and terror attacks and mass shootings, help us to rely on Your strength 
to envision and build a stronger and more secure America. Give us more 
visionaries like Father Edward Flanagan, who founded Boys Town on 
December 12, 100 years ago. Father Flanagan was an Irish immigrant who 
lived the American dream and taught us all that even the most troubled 
child could grow up to be a useful citizen if given half the chance. He 
saw the best in the kids whom others rejected as useless.
  Help us but especially each of our Senators to see the best in those 
who have different political or social views so that we can, together, 
build an America that enables and calls forth the best in its citizens.
  Amen.
