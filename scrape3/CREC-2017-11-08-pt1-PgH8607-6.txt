                       REJECT REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN

  (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, here is the Republican tax scam: first, 
cut taxes for the wealthiest corporations and for the superrich. Number 
two, cut Americans' healthcare.
  Don't take my word for it. Just look at the Republican budget. After 
clearing the way for a $1.5 trillion tax cut, it proposes cutting 
Medicare and Medicaid--coincidentally, I don't think so--by $1.5 
trillion.
  It gets worse. Under the Republican tax bill, American families would 
no longer get to deduct major medical expenses from their taxes. Seven 
in 10 households using the medical expense deduction make under $75,000 
a year, and over half of the Americans who depend on that medical 
deduction are over 65 years old.
  Families struggling to afford cancer treatment or long-term care 
should not have to pay a health tax so that billionaires can get a huge 
tax cut.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this scam. Americans 
deserve a better deal.
