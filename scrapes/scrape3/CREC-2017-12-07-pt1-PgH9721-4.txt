                                 TAXES

  (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, ``Kill the bill, don't kill me''; ``Tax the 
rich, not the sick''; these are the chants of hundreds of protestors 
who have taken to the Halls of Congress. I have never seen anything 
like it.
  The American people know this GOP tax scam is one of the most 
dangerous pieces of legislation to come before this body. This 
legislation adds trillions to the deficit, cuts Medicaid, and increases 
healthcare premiums. It is an unpopular bill pushed by an unpopular 
President and an unpopular Congress.
  Mr. President, the American people don't want your bill. They want 
healthcare, Medicaid, and Medicare. They want CHIP and community health 
centers.
  Trump, Ryan, and McConnell are bankrupting America's priorities to 
give tax cuts to the wealthy. Their bill is welfare for Wall Street.
  In the past year, Republicans have attacked our healthcare, ignored 
our gun crisis, abandoned our DREAMers, failed to pass a long-term 
budget, and now this.
  Enough is enough. It is time for Republicans to start working for 
their constituents, not their donors.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would ask Members to address their 
remarks to the Chair.
