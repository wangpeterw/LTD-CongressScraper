                HONORING THE LIFE OF JAMES B. BRIEN, JR.

  (Mr. COMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember Mr. Jim Brien of 
Mayfield in Kentucky's First Congressional District, who passed away on 
Friday, October 6.
  Jim's decades of service established him as a titan within the 
western Kentucky legal community. Having served as assistant prosecutor 
for Mayfield, an assistant Commonwealth attorney, and as a partner at 
the Law Offices of Neely, Brien, Wilson, and Toombs, he developed an 
unparalleled legal knowledge and community network which he utilized to 
defend his fellow citizens and work tirelessly on their behalf.
  He was widely respected for his selfless service to his family and 
community, as evidenced by his leadership in community organizations 
and his membership at the First Baptist Church in Mayfield.
  For all who knew him, he was a dedicated public servant and a staunch 
advocate for Graves County, whose passion for bettering the community 
was rivaled only by his love for University of Kentucky football and 
basketball.
  May God continue to bless his sons, James B. Brien III and Joshua V. 
Brien, and his family and friends, through which his legacy lives on.
