                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Eternal God, we thank You for giving us another day.
  Send Your spirit upon the Members of this people's House to encourage 
them in their official tasks. As the Members approach the votes they 
are making in the days to come, may they be imbued with courage and 
leadership that looks to the health and vibrancy of our great Nation.
  Assure them that, in the fulfillment of their responsibilities, You 
provide the grace to enable them to be faithful in their duties and the 
wisdom to be conscious of their obligations, and fulfill them with 
integrity.
  May we be faithful stewards not only of Your creation, but also Your 
desire that all people would be free from whatever inhibits them to be 
fully alive.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
