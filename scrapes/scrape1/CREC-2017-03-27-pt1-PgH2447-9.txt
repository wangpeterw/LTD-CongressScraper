                      NORTH KOREAN NUCLEAR THREAT

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, the bizarre totalitarian 
regime in North Korea continues to threaten American families and our 
South Korean allies by testing nuclear capabilities and intermediate- 
to long-range missiles. I am grateful that, this week, the House 
Foreign Affairs Committee will consider H. Res. 92, a resolution I 
introduced in February, condemning North Korea for their recent missile 
testing and calling for additional sanctions.
  The committee will also consider H.R. 479, designating North Korea as 
a state sponsor of terrorism, and H.R. 1644, to enhance sanctions with 
respect to companies and individuals doing business and enabling the 
regime in North Korea.
  I appreciate the leadership of Chairman Ed Royce and Ranking Member 
Eliot Engel of the House Foreign Affairs Committee as we address the 
threat posed by North Korea, where its dictatorship has reduced its 
citizens to starvation.
  Additionally, congratulations to the University of South Carolina 
men's basketball team and Head Coach Frank Martin on their victory at 
the Elite Eight last night in New York. I look forward to joining the 
rest of Gamecock Nation and cheering the Gamecocks in their first-ever 
Final Four participation on Saturday.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
