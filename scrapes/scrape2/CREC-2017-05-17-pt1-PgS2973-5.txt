                       NOMINATION OF RACHEL BRAND

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate voted to confirm 
Jeffrey Rosen as the Deputy Secretary of Transportation. In a couple of 
hours, we will take a cloture vote to advance another well-qualified 
nominee, Rachel Brand, to serve as the Associate Attorney General.
  Rachel Brand's impressive background includes experience clerking for 
Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, and she has already been 
confirmed by the Senate twice before. She is ``extraordinarily 
talented,'' as Chairman Grassley noted at her hearing, and ``dedicated 
to the full and even-handed enforcement of our laws.''
  Ms. Brand also has the support of a bipartisan group of former senior 
officials at the Justice Department, including Jamie Gorelick and Seth 
Waxman, who, in a recent letter on her behalf, cited her ``stellar 
reputation for . . . integrity, legal skills, and respect for the 
law.''
  As they pointed out, Ms. Brand's extensive private and public sector 
experience would serve her well as the Associate Attorney General. They 
also noted she would be a ``trusted leader in the Department.'' I look 
forward to advancing her nomination later this morning.
