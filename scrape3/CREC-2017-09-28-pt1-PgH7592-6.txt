           RECOGNIZING MIDDLETOWN POLICE OFFICER MEGAN FREER

  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, over the course of several weeks this 
summer, our Nation focused on my district as the tragic news of missing 
teenagers led the news.
  My heart goes out to the families of those boys and our entire 
community touched by this tragedy. In that darkness, we saw the best of 
our community shine through: neighbors in prayer; local businesses 
engaged in investigation efforts; and through it all, the commitment 
and the dedication of our local law enforcement officers.
  One such officer, Middletown Township Police Officer Megan Freer, was 
recently recognized at the National Liberty Museum in Philadelphia for

her investigatory work. Middletown Police Chief Joe Bartorilla noted 
well: Megan exemplifies our law enforcement who are committed to doing 
the very best job they can, day in and day out to protect and safeguard 
our citizens.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud of Officer Freer and the entire law 
enforcement community in Bucks County, to include District Attorney 
Matt Weintraub, who committed to this investigation. Through their 
efforts, our community can begin to heal from this terrible tragedy 
that we suffered.
