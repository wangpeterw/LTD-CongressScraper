            MIAMI LIGHTHOUSE DIAMOND ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend the Miami Lighthouse 
for the Blind and Visually Impaired, an amazing nonprofit service 
organization which is located in my congressional district, on its 
recent Diamond Anniversary Celebration of 85 years of service.
  The Miami Lighthouse has served south Florida since 1931, offering 
essential programs and experiences for all of those who have visual 
impairments.
  As a co-chair of the Congressional Vision Caucus, I understand the 
importance of the mission of the Miami Lighthouse: to provide vision 
rehabilitation, eye health services that promote independence, to 
collaborate with and train professionals, and to conduct research in 
related fields.
  Mr. Speaker, organizations like the Miami Lighthouse form the 
backbone of our civil society.
  Congratulations to my dear friend Virginia Jacko and all of the staff 
and many volunteers of the Miami Lighthouse as they continue their 
life-changing work into their 86th year.
