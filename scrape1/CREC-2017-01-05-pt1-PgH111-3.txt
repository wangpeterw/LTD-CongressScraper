                  HONORING THE LIFE OF A. WARREN KULP

  (Mr. THOMAS J. ROONEY of Florida asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. THOMAS J. ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
the life of A. Warren Kulp, Jr., better known as Sonny, who passed away 
on New Year's Eve in West Palm Beach at the age of 81.
  Sonny's life was the American Dream personified. After graduating 
from Hilltown High School in Pennsylvania in 1953, he worked as a self-
employed dairy farmer for most of his life. He also earned his real 
estate license and worked as the head of the real estate department for 
8 years in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. After moving to Florida with his 
wife, Judy, he worked at the Palm Beach Kennel Club until his 
retirement in 2007.
  Outside of work, Sonny pursued many different interests. He was a 
loyal, lifelong Republican and served as an officer and committee 
chairman for the Pennridge Republican Club in Pennsylvania. He was a 
consummate grassroots advocate and always could be relied upon for 
sound advice on both politics and sports.
  Mr. Speaker, our thoughts and prayers are with Judy and the Kulp 
family and the entire community as they mourn his passing today. He 
will be greatly missed.
