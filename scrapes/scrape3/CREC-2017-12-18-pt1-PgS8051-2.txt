                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal Father, strong to save, we love You because You are our 
shield and deliverer. You have been our God from the moment of our 
birth, loving and sustaining us with Your mercies.
  Lord, You loved us before we loved You, and You empowered us to live 
productive lives. Cast out of our Senators any fear and anxiety, as 
their love for You increases. Teach them to treat others as they would 
want to be treated themselves, fulfilling Your admonition to practice 
the Golden Rule. May they seek You early, realizing that not an hour 
goes by when we do not need You. Supply all their needs from the bounty 
of Your riches in glory.
  We pray in Your sovereign Name. Amen.
