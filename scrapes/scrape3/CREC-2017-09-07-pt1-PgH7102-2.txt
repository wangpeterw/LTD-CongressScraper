LET US VOTE TO RESTORE OUR VALUES AND GIVE DREAMERS OPPORTUNITIES THEY 
                                DESERVE

  (Ms. JUDY CHU of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, Ana was an intern in my 
office. She is also an undocumented immigrant. When DACA was announced, 
Ana was ecstatic. She told me that DACA meant she could qualify for 
financial aid or be an intern at the State Department. All she saw were 
opportunities to contribute to our country, and that is exactly what 
she has done.
  Thanks to DACA, Ana earned her master's degree and got a job helping 
other immigrants to lay roots and contribute, like she did. She was 
able to get a driver's license to safely get to school and work. And 
today, she is attending law school.
  Ana represents the promise that if you come here, work here, and 
contribute here, you will have a future here. But Donald Trump is 
breaking that promise by ending DACA.
  And so it is up to us to fix it. The bipartisan Dream Act will 
protect these DREAMers who are American in every way but on paper.
  Mr. Speaker, let us vote to restore our values and give these 
DREAMers the opportunities they deserve.
