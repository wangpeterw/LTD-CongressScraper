                         ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
incredible work of the Anti-Defamation League, or ADL.
  The founder of this uplifting organization, Sigmund Livingston, 
envisioned an America where we all are created and treated equally. 
This is an objective that remains ever-relevant in today's America. 
Through programming in schools, the ADL creates dialogue to educate and 
prepare students to fight back against hate and confront discrimination 
wherever it may exist. In addition, the ADL works to bring individuals 
together to build understanding.

                              {time}  1045

  I have had the pleasure of meeting a special person, Rabbi Gruenberg, 
a leader in Congregation Beth El, in my community, as well as the 
Philadelphia ADL, earlier this year. I am proud to stand with my 
neighbors, advocates, and elected officials of every stripe to reaffirm 
that there is no room for hate or discrimination in any of our 
communities.
  The work of the Anti-Defamation League must continue and expand, 
because the only way we can end senseless hate is by building bridges 
and engaging with people we may perceive as being different from 
ourselves.
  Again, Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the ADL for the incredibly 
important work they are doing. I stand with them, as should everyone in 
this Chamber.
