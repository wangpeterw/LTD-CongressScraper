        RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF PAMELA PALANQUE-NORTH

  (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and 
legacy of Pamela Palanque-North, a dedicated advocate for northern 
Manhattan and the citywide New York City community.
  Ms. North was an unstoppable force of good in her own community. 
Beginning at Queens College, when she spoke out to increase minority 
student admissions, she since then served on numerous influential 
advisory boards across the city. She was the chair of Manhattan 
Community Board 12, where she served with distinction.
  She was also the chair of and president of the Metropolitan Chapter, 
Jack and Jill, Inc., and founder of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's 
trustees' Multicultural Audience Development Initiative Advisory 
Committee. Her legacy should and will be remembered in her enthusiasm 
for giving back and the strong work that the entities she influenced 
continue to do.
  Ms. North left a permanent mark in the northern Manhattan community, 
for which she will be forever fondly remembered for years to come.
