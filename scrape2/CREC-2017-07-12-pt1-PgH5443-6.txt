                     RECOGNIZING ROBERT LEE BECERRA

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House

  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize Robert Lee 
Becerra, a very special young man

[[Page H5444]]

from my district who is severely impacted by autism and has made a 
positive difference in thousands of lives in south Florida. How has he 
done this?
  Mr. Speaker, for years, Robert has helped train 6,000 Miami police 
officers, firefighters, and EMTs to identify people with developmental 
issues and tailor their actions and responses accordingly. With 
Robert's help, officers and first responders in south Florida are 
trained to de-escalate volatile emergency situations involving 
individuals on the autism spectrum or with mental illness.
  Robert's assistance in emergency response training has not only 
helped officers to connect with autism patients on an emotional level, 
but it has also made a positive impact and has saved many lives in our 
south Florida community.
  I thank Robert for his tireless work and participation in police and 
first responder training for more than 10 years. His efforts have 
helped make south Florida an even better community for all of us.
  Thank you, Robert.
