            THE GRAND CANYON FFA TEAMS RECEIVES A GOLD MEDAL

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate the Grand Canyon FFA for bringing home the gold at a 
recent national competition.
  The Wellsboro High School team of 10th graders recently traveled to 
the National FFA Convention in Indianapolis. The team competed in the 
Conduct of Meeting event that is focused on parliamentary procedure.
  As part of the competition, the team performs a meeting demonstration 
that includes an opening ceremony and a surprise issue to debate. They 
make motions and resolve the issue within 13 minutes. Each team member 
has to answer oral questions and take a knowledge exam.
  Mr. Speaker, I am incredibly proud of the Grand Canyon FFA team for 
advancing to the Gold Level Round and placing sixth overall in the 
Nation.
  It is clear that the FFA is making a positive difference in the lives 
of students by developing their leadership skills, personal growth, and 
career success through agricultural education.
  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the members of the Grand Canyon FFA team 
on a job well done: Kylie Butler, Nina Coolidge, Rayann Pierce, Austin 
Richards, McKenzie Sweigart, Katarina Swendrowski, and Taylor 
Wetherbee.
