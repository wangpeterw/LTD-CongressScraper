               DON'T UNDERMINE HEALTH CARE FOR AMERICANS

  (Mrs.BUSTOS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr.Speaker, I spent 10 years of my professional life 
working in health care, both during and after the Affordable Care Act 
passed,so let me tell you what a Republican repeal would mean.
  It would mean raising prescription drug costs on Illinois seniors 
bymore than $1,000 every year by reopening the Medicare doughnut hole.
  It would mean returning to the days when insurancecompanies could 
discriminate against women by charging them more than men for basic 
care.
  It would mean telling diabetics,survivors of a heart attack, or even 
babies with a birth defect that they aren't qualified for healthcare 
coverage because oftheir preexisting condition.
  It would mean denying cancer patients lifesaving care after they have 
reached their lifetimelimit on their insurance policy.
  Republicans have talked about repealing the Affordable Care Act for 
almost 7 years, butthey have no plan for replacement. Again and again, 
we have heard that repealing ObamaCare will make America great again. 
Well,I say it will make America sick again.
  Please, let's work together. Don't undermine the health of millions 
of Americans.
