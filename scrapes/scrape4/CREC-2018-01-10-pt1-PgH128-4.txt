                CONGRATULATING TEHAMA COUNTY FARM BUREAU

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Tehama 
County Farm Bureau in my district on their 100th annual meeting. This 
on the heels of their centennial of being in business in Tehama County.
  They are headquartered in Red Bluff, California. They have been an 
organization very dedicated, obviously, to farming, ranching, and 
agriculture in all its forms in Tehama County and its neighboring 
counties as partners as well.
  Just last month, it was actually recognized as the Midsize Farm 
Bureau of the Year, according to the California Farm Bureau Federation 
Annual Meeting.
  The Farm Bureau is very important and very involved in the fiber of 
rural communities with ag production, farming, ranching, hay, and all 
those operations that make what agriculture needs go round, as well as 
the activities at the fair with the kids, and with their future. The 
Farm Bureau, indeed, is an important part of the future of agriculture 
and feeding people in this country.
  Mr. Speaker, again, I congratulate Tehama County Farm Bureau's 
membership, board, and leadership for hanging in there and serving that 
group of people for 100 years.
