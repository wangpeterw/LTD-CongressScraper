              HONORING THE MEMORY OF JAMES ``JIM'' CARNEY

  (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor James ``Jim'' 
Carney for his selfless service to residents of the 10th District as a 
firefighter in our communities for more than 2 decades.
  Sadly, Jim passed away last month after a heroic 3\1/2\-year battle 
with cancer. Jim was a native of the 10th District, born in Waukegan, 
grew up in Wadsworth, and attended Warren Township High School.
  After studying at Columbia Southern University, Jim returned home to 
serve as an on-call member of the Newport Township Fire Protection 
District in Wadsworth and received his paramedic license. Later, in 
2000, he joined the Lincolnshire-Riverwoods Fire Protection District 
and eventually earned the rank of lieutenant.
  Jim was both respected and beloved by his fellow firefighters. They 
remember him for his calm under pressure and for the welcome he 
extended to the new members of the department.
  ``Jim was the kindest person you could ever meet, and he showed 
everyone respect,'' recalled his close friend and colleague, Steve 
Shetsky, in the Lincolnshire Review.
  Jim's memory is one of willingness to put his own life in danger to 
save those of his neighbors, and our communities are incredibly 
grateful for his service.
  Mr. Speaker, I offer my most sincere condolences to Jim's wife, 
Janelle; to his children, Peyton and Brett; and to many family, 
friends, and colleagues who mourn his loss.
