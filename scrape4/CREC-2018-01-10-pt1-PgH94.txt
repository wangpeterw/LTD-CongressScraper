                      SUPPORTING PROTECTED STATUS

  (Mr. GUTIERREZ asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, President Trump took action to 
undocument 200,000 immigrants from El Salvador, who have TPS and have 
been working regularly and renewing their documents in the U.S. for 
more than 20 years. He said the same thing to 58,000 Haitians. They 
need to leave in another 16 months. This is the same thing that 
happened with the DREAMers. He made them undocumented, 800,000 of whom 
are working.
  Mr. Speaker, I am tired of coming to work here and meeting people in 
the cafeteria and people who are sweeping floors and doing all kinds of 
work here in the Capitol who now are in fear of losing their legal 
protected status and being able to work here in this country because 
they are undocumented. They want to make people who are working, yes, 
right here in the Capitol of the United States undocumented.
  For that, I call upon us to do the work that we were sent here to do 
and to protect people. We shouldn't be sending 58,000 Haitians back to 
the poorest country in this hemisphere from the richest country. That 
is unfathomable and unconscionable and we shouldn't do it.
