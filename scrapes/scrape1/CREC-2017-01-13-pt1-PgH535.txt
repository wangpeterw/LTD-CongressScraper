             WE ARE MAKINGA MISTAKE IF WE REPEAL OBAMACARE

  (Mr. ENGEL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act has improved the 
health care and financial security of every American,regardless of 
where he or she gets health insurance.
  Healthcare costs have been growing at the slowest rate in more than 
50 years. Seniors in the so-called Medicare doughnuthole have saved 
more than $23 billion on their prescription drugs. Every American woman 
can rest easier knowing that women areno longer charged more than men 
for the same coverage. And 137 million Americans with private insurance 
now receive freepreventive services.
  Despite this remarkable progress, the majority has made it their 
mission to destroy the Affordable Care Act, no matter thecost, and 
those costs would extend far beyond the healthcare system.
  A recent report found that repeal would cause just New York to lose 
more than 130,000 jobs in 2019 alone.
  The Affordable Care Act has reduced the burden of healthcare costs 
for hardworking families not only in New York, but acrossthe Nation; 
and it is those Americans for whom repeal would be so devastating.
  We are making a mistake if we repeal ObamaCare.
