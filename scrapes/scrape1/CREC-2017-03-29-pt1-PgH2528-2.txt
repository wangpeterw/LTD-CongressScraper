             IN MEMORY OF CAPTAIN JOHN JOSEPH KEARNEY, USN

  (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Captain John 
Joseph Kearney, who passed away on Pearl Harbor Day last year at the 
too-young age of 62.
  After graduating just 2 years before me at Catholic High School for 
Boys in Little Rock, John received a Presidential appointment to the 
United States Naval Academy. Upon graduation and commission, he 
followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a lifetime career in the 
Navy, ultimately retiring at the rank of captain.
  Captain Kearney dedicated his life to his distinguished military 
career and received numerous honors and medals for his service, which 
included work here in Washington and on the 7th Fleet staff in Japan.
  John leaves behind a legacy of warmth and passion, and his example is 
one all Americans and Arkansans can admire. I extend my respect, 
affection, and prayers to his fine family and loved ones.
