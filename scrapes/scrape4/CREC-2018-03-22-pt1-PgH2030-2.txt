           60 YEARS OF THE PIONEER CENTER FOR HUMAN SERVICES

  (Mr. HULTGREN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank and congratulate the 
Pioneer Center for Human Services for 60 years of serving the people of 
McHenry County, Illinois.
  The Pioneer Center was founded in 1958 out of a mother's desire to 
provide greater opportunities for her daughter with Down syndrome. 
Since then, it has provided services for members of the community 
facing developmental disabilities, homelessness, and behavioral health 
issues.
  I am always impressed by the compassion and energy of Pioneer Center 
employees when I visit their facilities, which now include 17 group 
homes, a homeless shelter, a transitional home, and a family and child 
therapy center.
  Mr. Speaker, 4,500 men, women, and children are served every year, 
including 95 who are annually employed in local jobs through the 
Community Employment Services Program. Last year alone, individuals 
logged 8,500 hours of community activity, everything from attending 
classes at the gym to visiting a farmer's market and taking community 
college courses.
  I am proud to celebrate with the Pioneer Center for Human Services as 
they continue to empower individuals to achieve their full potential.
