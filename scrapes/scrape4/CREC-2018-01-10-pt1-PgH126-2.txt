                  HONORING CONGRESSMAN ROBERT WEYGAND

  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a great Rhode Island 
public servant, educator, and dear friend, my predecessor, Congressman 
Robert Weygand.
  During his time in government, Bob served as a Rhode Island State 
legislator from 1985 to 1993, Lieutenant Governor from 1993 to 1997, 
and United States Representative for the Second Congressional District 
of Rhode Island from 1997 to 2001.
  Bob has always fought passionately for the people of the State of 
Rhode Island, and in the decades since, he has shared his wealth of 
knowledge with the students at the University of Rhode Island, 
dedicating himself to preparing the next generation of leaders.
  As he retires from that position, I want to say that Bob served for 
the right reasons: to make a positive difference in his community and 
improve the lives of the people around him.
  I am proud to call him my predecessor in the Halls of Congress, my 
dear friend and mentor to this day, and I happily congratulate him on 
his retirement from URI.
  I know that, in one way or another, Bob will continue to serve his 
community as he always has: with integrity, passion, and wisdom.
