                           LEGAL IMMIGRATION

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to commend and welcome 
President Trump to California, where, amongst other things, he is 
looking at the technology with which to control our borders, an 
obligation we have as a State, but more so as a country whose 
jurisdiction it is.
  We welcome legal immigration to our State and to our country, not 
illegal immigration or the other euphemisms that are used, undocumented 
immigrants, what have you.
  Indeed, if we don't have borders, we don't really have a nation. So 
let's get cracking on controlling our borders and having a legal 
immigration process. It is better for the immigrants, it is better for 
the security of our Nation, and it is better for its people. That is 
all it is about. It is really that simple.
