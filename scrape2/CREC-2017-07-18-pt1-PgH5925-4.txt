                  WELL-DESERVED HALL OF FAME INDUCTEE

  (Mr. EMMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my friend Chris 
Coborn on his recent induction into the Minnesota Business Hall of 
Fame.
  Every year, Twin Cities Business honors successful businessmen and -
women in Minnesota who have displayed strong leadership and a unique 
vision.
  During his time as president and CEO of Coborn's, Chris Coborn has 
helped build this family business, which was established in 1921, to 54 
full-service supermarkets across Minnesota and North Dakota, in 
addition to their 70 convenience and liquor stores.
  Proving himself a true visionary, Chris expanded Coborn's even more 
when he obtained an online grocery delivery business. While, at the 
time, it was seen as a controversial move, Chris had the foresight to 
go where the market was going for his customers. Decisions like this 
are exactly why Chris has been selected to join the Minnesota Business 
Hall of Fame.
  Chris Coborn is a business leader in Minnesota and beyond. He truly 
deserves this recognition and honor.
