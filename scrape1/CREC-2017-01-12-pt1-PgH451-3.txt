                      THEAFFORDABLE CARE ACT WORKS

  (Mr. BROWN of Maryland asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)

  Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the residents 
of Maryland's Fourth Congressional District to saythat the Affordable 
Care Act works. It has improved the health of thousands of men, women, 
and children in my district, and ithas also reduced the level of 
uncompensated care in our community hospitals.
  Repealing the Affordable Care Act will result in more uninsured 
patients, and more uninsured people will drive up costs foreveryone. 
Community hospitals, such as MedStar Health and Anne Arundel Medical 
Center, will be forced to lay off doctors andnurses. Major medical 
centers, like John Hopkins and the University of Maryland, will be 
forced to cut back investments inresearch that we so desperately need 
to fight cancer, to treat diabetes, and to reduce infant mortality.
  In the Fourth Congressional District, we are on the verge of 
establishing a new regional medical center that will bothimprove the 
quality of care throughout the National Capital Region and will create 
thousands of healthcare-related jobs in mydistrict.
  Mr. Speaker, repealing the Affordable Care Act is simply wrong. 
Hospital services will be reduced, local economies will beweakened, and 
job losses will follow. Let's protect our care and protect our jobs.
