                     WELCOMING PASTOR DENNIS JOKELA

  The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. 
Upton) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a proud son of 
Portage, Michigan, Pastor Dennis Jokela of the Kalamazoo County 
Sheriff's Department.
  He has been a pillar of our community through his work as a small-
business owner, a judge for the Michigan Vocational Education Society, 
and as a corporal and chaplain at the Kalamazoo County Sheriff's 
Department as well.
  I know I speak for many as we thank, in particular, our first 
responders all across the country, sheriffs, and police officers, and 
pray to keep them and their families safe.
  Pastor Jokela's dedication to public service runs deep as a seven-
time decorated veteran of Vietnam and Cambodia--overdue medals my team 
was able to help him obtain--a pastor with the Michigan Boot Camp for 
Troubled Teens at Fort Custer, and his work with the homeless. His 
commitment to community and country are unquestionable.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Pastor Jokela for his service here and at home. 
We are all so honored to be with him today. I thank him for his kind 
words.
