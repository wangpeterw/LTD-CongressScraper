                 RECOGNIZING WORLD AUTISM AWARENESS DAY

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the world 
celebrated Autism Awareness Day.
  Each year, Autism Speaks asks people across the Nation and around the 
globe to ``Light It Up Blue'' in an effort to increase understanding 
and acceptance.
  Last night, right here in our Nation's Capital, the White House 
joined hundreds of iconic landmarks as it illuminated the exterior 
blue. Individuals wore blue clothing or turned their online profile 
photos blue.
  Autism spectrum disorders affect an estimated 1 out of every 68 
children in the United States. These families face enormous challenges 
in assisting their loved ones over the course of their lifetimes. Each 
year, an estimated 50,000 youth will turn 18 in the United States, and 
many face a services cliff when school-based programs end.
  Men and women living on the autism spectrum have made incredible 
contributions to our society. We must continue to research the causes 
of autism and work to strengthen opportunities for individuals with 
autism to live full lives.
  Together, we can increase understanding and acceptance as we 
celebrate and support so many Americans who live with autism.
