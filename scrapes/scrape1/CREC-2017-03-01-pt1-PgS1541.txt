SENATE RESOLUTION 74--CONGRATULATING THE STATE OF NEBRASKA ON THE 150TH 
   ANNIVERSARY OF THE ADMISSION OF THAT STATE INTO THE UNITED STATES

  Mrs. FISCHER (for herself and Mr. Sasse) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

                               S. Res. 74

       Whereas the name ``Nebraska'' is derived from a Native 
     American Siouan word that means ``flat water'' and is 
     inspired by the Platte River;
       Whereas early explorers of the Great Plains called the 
     Nebraska region the ``Great American Desert'', mistakenly 
     believing that its vast prairies were incapable of supporting 
     agriculture;

       Whereas the Platte River Valley provided an ideal corridor 
     for settlers traveling westward along the Oregon, Mormon, and 
     California Trails;
       Whereas the Act entitled ``An Act to secure Homesteads to 
     actual Settlers on the Public Domain'', approved May 20, 
     1862, encouraged enterprising individuals to consider 
     settling in the Nebraska Territory;
       Whereas Nebraska was--
       (1) the first State admitted to the United States after the 
     conclusion of the Civil War; and
       (2) the only State the admittance of which the President 
     vetoed because of disagreement with the ``fundamental 
     condition'' imposed by Congress with respect to giving black 
     men the right to vote;
       Whereas, by means of the Act entitled ``An Act for the 
     Admission of the State of Nebraska into the Union'', approved 
     February 9, 1867, Congress overrode the veto of President 
     Andrew Johnson, opening the way for the admission of Nebraska 
     into the United States on March 1, 1867;
       Whereas the admission of Nebraska into the United States 
     led to the further settlement of Nebraska and the 
     construction of the transcontinental railroad westward from 
     the Omaha terminus;
       Whereas, in 1879, a Federal district court in Nebraska was 
     the site where American Indians were first recognized as 
     persons under the laws of the United States after Standing 
     Bear pleaded, ``I am a man'';
       Whereas Nebraska is leading the way for a new innovation 
     frontier where entrepreneurs are engaged in building the 
     economy of the future by establishing and growing great 
     businesses;
       Whereas Nebraska is the only State whose residents, 
     desiring greater government accountability, voted to 
     transition the State legislature from a bicameral system to a 
     unicameral system, thereby reducing the size of the 
     legislature by nearly 70 percent;
       Whereas Nebraska is the home of such national food 
     sensations as the reuben and runzas;
       Whereas Nebraska leads the United States in--
       (1) beef and veal exports;
       (2) commercial red meat production;
       (3) commercial cattle slaughter;
       (4) Great Northern bean production;
       (5) popcorn production; and
       (6) the number of irrigated acres of cropland;
       Whereas Nebraska continues to lead the United States in 
     center-pivot irrigation technology, as Nebraska is home to 
     the 4 largest irrigation companies in the United States;
       Whereas, in 1986, Nebraska was the first State in which 
     women were the 2 major party candidates for governor;
       Whereas Nebraska has played and continues to play a 
     significant and remarkable role in the civic, economic, 
     educational, and cultural life of the United States;
       Whereas, on March 1, 2017, Nebraska marks the 150th 
     anniversary of the admission of that State into the United 
     States; and
       Whereas the sesquicentennial celebration of statehood 
     offers a special opportunity for the people of Nebraska to 
     reflect, remember, celebrate, and plan for an even brighter 
     future that embodies the State motto of Nebraska, ``Equality 
     Before the Law'': Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate congratulates the State of 
     Nebraska on the 150th anniversary of the admission of that 
     State into the United States.
