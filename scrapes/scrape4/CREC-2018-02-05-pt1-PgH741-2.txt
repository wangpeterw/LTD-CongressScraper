                  NORTH CAROLINIANS ON THE WORLD STAGE

  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate the 242 athletes 
who made the 2018 United States Winter Olympic team. This is the 
largest delegation of athletes from any nation attending the Winter 
Olympic Games in history.
  While reviewing the roster, I was pleased to see that the world will 
get to know something I have known for a long time: North Carolinians 
are strong competitors, three of whom I would like to salute.
  I offer my well wishes and congratulations to Heather Bergsma of High 
Point, North Carolina, who will compete in long track speed skating; 
Kimani Griffin from Winston-Salem, North Carolina, who will compete in 
long track speed skating; and Bobby Sanguinetti from Wilmington, North 
Carolina, who will compete in ice hockey.
  The Olympic Games remain one of the only avenues in which the world's 
community may come together despite resounding differences. I wish 
these North Carolinians the very best as they compete on the world 
stage, along with their fellow United States athletes, and will look 
forward to cheering all of them on.

                          ____________________
