                   PRESIDENT TRUMP'S BROKEN PROMISES

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, add job creation and infrastructure to the 
list of President Trump's broken promises. After 102 days in office, 
the so-called ``greatest jobs President that God ever created'' has 
failed to present a single job or infrastructure bill.
  At the same time, his slash-and-burn budget would cut investments in 
job growth and infrastructure, imposing a $2.4 billion cut on the U.S. 
Department of Transportation. Included in those cuts are drastic 
reductions of the Federal support for Amtrak and the outright 
elimination of the TIGER grant program.
  The President's budget proposal also phases out the New Starts grant 
program, making critical infrastructure projects, including New Jersey 
and New York's Gateway Program ineligible for Federal funding needed to 
move forward.
  As I speak, New Jersey rail commuters are probably facing massive 
delays and disruptions to their already nightmarish commute. President 
Trump's proposed cuts to vital Federal infrastructure programs will 
only make the problem worse. It has been an ugly 102 days for President 
Trump, and, unless he tackles jobs and infrastructure, as promised, it 
is going to get uglier.
