                         CHRISTIAN PERSECUTION

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the world's largest religion continues 
to be the world's most persecuted religion. Christians are assaulted, 
murdered, harassed, and their homes and churches increasingly are 
destroyed.
  Recently, in Cairo, while Coptic Christian priest Father Rizkallah 
was collecting humanitarian aid, he was stabbed to death because he was 
a Christian.
  Now persecution has taken a new twist. While Islamic extremism 
continues its genocide on Christians and other different sects of 
Islam, government-sponsored persecution is increasing worldwide. 
According to Open Doors, 9 of the top 10 countries where persecution 
exists have large Islam populations. But North Korea, the number one 
offender, is an atheist nation.
  Ethnic nationalism is also a major driver of persecution. Weak and/or 
totalitarian governments use Christians as scapegoats to keep a grip on 
power.
  Religious freedom is mentioned first in our First Amendment because 
it is the most important of all freedoms. It is a God-given right for 
all people of all religions. Americans should lead the way in worldwide 
religious freedom and in denouncing religious persecution of 
Christians.
  And that is just the way it is.
  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the Open Doors USA Persecution 
of Christians Watch List.
