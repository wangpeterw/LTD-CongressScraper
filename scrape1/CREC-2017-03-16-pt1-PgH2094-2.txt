        IT IS CRUCIAL TO REPEAL AND REPLACE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. YOHO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my concern about how 
crucial it is that we repeal and replace the poorly named Affordable 
Care Act.
  We are working towards a better healthcare plan and doing it in a 
better fashion than the other side did 8 years ago. We are actually 
going through regular order, allowing the committees of jurisdiction to 
do their work in public, and have the text for all to see and debate.
  Mr. Speaker, ObamaCare is failing and will collapse on its own. Many 
more will lose their insurance, and the healthcare system will get 
drastically worse if we simply leave it in place. The worst thing we 
can do is nothing.
  4.7 million Americans were kicked off their healthcare plans by the 
ACA. I was one of them. Under the ACA, there has been a 25 percent 
average increase in premiums for the midlevel plans in 2017 for 
millions of Americans trapped in the healthcare.gov exchanges. Nearly 
one-third of U.S. counties have only one insurer offering an exchange 
plan.
  ObamaCare is unsustainable. Mr. Speaker, it is time for Congress to 
do its job and replace the failed ObamaCare. We guarantee we will read 
this bill before we pass it.
