       HONORING U.S. ARMY COLONEL JOSEPH TOPPIN'S 100TH BIRTHDAY

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Colonel Joseph Toppin 
of Edison, New Jersey, on the occasion of his 100th birthday.
  Colonel Toppin entered the military in 1948, the same year that a 
wavering President named Harry Truman finally prohibited racial 
discrimination in the Armed Forces. Colonel Toppin rose to become the 
first African American to serve as battalion commander for the Army's 
40th Infantry Division.
  The colonel has dedicated his life to improving the quality of our 
democracy and making the world a safer place. He helped with postwar 
planning for the development of Korea. He also was the principal 
planner for the Army's ship-to-shore discharge operations along the 
west coast of France. And Colonel Toppin was the inspector general for 
Fort Dix in New Jersey.
  Upon leaving the Army, he had an illustrious career at Bethlehem 
Steel Corporation.
  Colonel Toppin is now retired, but he has still not stopped inspiring 
those around him, which is why I stand here tonight. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
my colleagues to join me in honoring Colonel Toppin on his 100th 
birthday and for his service to the United States of America.
