                 AFFORDABLE CARE ACT REPEAL AND REPLACE

  (Mr. EVANS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. EVANS. Madam Speaker, last night House Republicans released their 
plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act. House Republicans and the Trump 
administration say that they want a healthcare plan that cuts costs and 
covers more Americans; yet they introduced a plan that takes away from 
millions of Americans and puts the poorest Americans, our seniors, our 
people with preexisting conditions, and working class families at 
greater risk of getting sick.
  According to the Philadelphia Department of Public Health, 
approximately 220,000 Philadelphians would lose their health insurance 
if the Affordable Care Act is repealed without adequate replacement.
  We cannot take this risk. The new plan is an insult to the millions 
of Americans who have fought hard to try to get ahead. Now is the time 
to resist.
