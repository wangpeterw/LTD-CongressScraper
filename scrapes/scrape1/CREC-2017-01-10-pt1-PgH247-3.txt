               NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT APPRECIATION DAY

  (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to our Nation's 
law enforcement men and women.
  I respect and appreciate the important work of our police throughout 
the Nation who are charged with the critical work of protecting the 
people in our States and our local communities. The heartbreaking 
violent targeting of our Nation's police officers, recently, 
demonstrates the dangers these men and women face every day.
  Every American is so proud as our many neighbors and fellow citizens 
get up every morning, put on their local law enforcement uniform and 
badge, kiss their families good-bye, and go out and serve us, keeping 
our cities and towns safe, trying to build trust and faith among all of 
our citizens.
  Monday was National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, and our law 
enforcement men and women in Arkansas and throughout the country 
deserve our gratitude and respect. I proudly displayed a blue light in 
my office window to honor our law enforcement men and women, and I 
thank them for their selfless service.
