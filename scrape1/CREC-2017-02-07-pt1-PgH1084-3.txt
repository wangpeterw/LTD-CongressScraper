           By Mr. MASSIE:
       H.R. 899.
       Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       Article I, Section 1 of the Constitution vests all 
     legislative powers in Congress, not in the Executive Branch 
     or an agency of the Executive Branch. In addition, the Tenth 
     Amendment states that ``the powers not delegated to the 
     United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to 
     the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to 
     the people.'' The Constitution does not give the federal 
     government the authority to control education.
