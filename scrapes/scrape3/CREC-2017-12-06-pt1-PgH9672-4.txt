                 PRESERVING OUR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS

  (Mr. MESSER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, the Second Amendment to the Constitution of 
the United States reads: `` . . . the right of the people to keep and 
bear arms shall not be infringed.''
  That right is a fundamental freedom guaranteed by our Bill of Rights. 
That is why I am proud to cosponsor the Concealed Carry Reciprocity 
Act, which protects the Second Amendment rights of all Americans.
  This legislation says that if you are qualified to carry a gun in 
your own State, then you can carry a gun in any State that has a 
similar law. This bill will eliminate significant obstacles to the 
right to keep and bear arms for millions of Americans in every State.
  Hoosiers get it. Law-abiding gun owners have a right to defend 
themselves, and that right should not end at the State line. I urge 
support for this legislation and I ask my colleagues to join me in 
doing more to uphold our Second Amendment rights.
