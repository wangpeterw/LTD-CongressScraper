             HONORING THE ARKANSAS FARM FAMILY OF THE YEAR

  (Mr. WESTERMAN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is an extreme honor to note the 
accomplishment of a hardworking Arkansas Fourth District family. Mark 
and Shay Morgan and their daughter, Kate, of Clarksville, were named 
last December as the 2016 Arkansas Farm Family of the Year, and will 
compete this coming October among nine other State winners to be the 
2017 Southeastern Farmer of the Year.
  The Morgans' diverse farm is best known for its Peach Pickin' 
Paradise which consists of 3,500 peach and nectarine trees on 17 acres. 
I was fortunate to visit Peach Pickin' Paradise last fall and sample 
some of their produce. With peaches making up 60 percent of the farm's 
operation, it also consists of 600 acres of hay used for their 300 head 
of beef cattle.
  Beyond their hard work on the family farm, the Morgans are a vital 
part of their local community, participating in a number of 
organizations that display the hard work ethic they live by.
  Congratulations to Mark, Shay, and Kate Morgan as they have exhibited 
exemplary testimony to the American Dream and to the Fourth District of 
Arkansas.
