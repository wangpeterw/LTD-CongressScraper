          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS

      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Roberts, Ms. 
        Hirono, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Whitehouse, Mrs. Ernst, Ms. Heitkamp, 
        Mr. Thune, Mr. Udall, Mr. Heinrich, Mrs. Shaheen, Ms. 
        Klobuchar, Mr. Franken, Mr. Donnelly, and Mrs. Murray):
  S. 944. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reform 
and extend the incentives for biodiesel; to the Committee on Finance.

[[Page S2555]]

  

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have long been a champion of domestic 
biofuel production, including ethanol, biodiesel and cellulosic fuels. 
Domestic biodiesel production supports tens of thousands of jobs. 
Replacing traditional diesel with biodiesel reduces emissions and 
creates cleaner air. Homegrown biodiesel improves our energy security 
by diversifying our transportation fuels and reducing our dependence on 
foreign oil. Biodiesel itself is a very diverse fuel. It can be 
produced from a wide array of resources such as recycled cooking oil, 
soybean and other plant oils, and animal fats.
  I am proud of the success of the American biodiesel industry, and I 
am glad to be introducing today the American Renewable Fuel and Job 
Creation Act of 2017, which will ensure the continued success. I 
appreciate Senator Cantwell's leadership in joining this effort. I also 
appreciate the support of Senators Roberts, Hirono, Blunt, Whitehouse, 
Ernst, Heitkamp, Thune, Udall, Heinrich, Shaheen, Klobuchar, Franken, 
Donnelly, and Murray. This bill will modify the biodiesel fuel 
blender's credit to a domestic production credit starting this year and 
extend the credit through 2020.
  Congress created the biodiesel tax incentive in 2005 when I was 
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. As a result of this incentive 
and the Renewable Fuel Standard, biodiesel is providing significant 
benefits to the nation.
  Senator Cantwell and I have been advocating the mixture credit be 
modified to a producer credit since 2009. Converting to a producer 
credit improves the incentive in many ways. The blenders credit can be 
difficult to administer because the blending of the fuel can occur at 
many different stages of the fuel distribution. This can make it 
difficult to ensure that only fuel that qualifies for the credit claims 
the incentive. It has been susceptible to abuse because of this.
  A credit for domestic production will also ensure that we are 
incentivizing the domestic industry and associated American jobs, 
rather than subsidizing imported biofuels. A credit for domestic 
production will also ensure that we are incentivizing the domestic 
industry and associated American jobs, rather than subsidizing imported 
biofuels. Since 2014, we have seen imports increase from 510 million 
gallons to about 1 billion gallons in 2016, and already in the first 
quarter of 2017 imports are 10 percent higher than they were last year 
at this time.
  We should not provide a U.S. taxpayer benefit to imported biofuels. 
By restricting the credit to domestic production, we will also save 
taxpayer money. The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimated a 
similar amendment adopted in the Finance Committee in 2015 would have 
reduced the cost of the extension by $90 million for 2016 alone.
  Importantly, modifying the credit will have little to no impact on 
the consumer. Much of the credit will continue to be passed on to the 
blender and ultimately, the consumer. Additionally, the U.S. biodiesel 
industry is currently operating at approximately 65 percent of 
capacity, which does not even account for idled capacity. The fact is, 
the domestic biodiesel industry has the capacity and access to 
affordable feedstocks to meet the demand of U.S. consumers.
  The current biodiesel credit expired at the end of 2016. Adoption of 
the American Renewable Fuel and Job Creation Act of 2017 should be 
strongly considered as part of tax reform efforts currently underway. 
Absent tax reform, Congress should include it as part of any tax 
legislation extending expired tax provisions.
  Modifying the current blenders credit to a producers credit will 
ensure that the credit is doing what Congress intended--incentivizing 
investment in domestic biodiesel production and promoting American 
jobs. Surely we can agree that we should not be providing a U.S. 
taxpayer subsidy to already heavily subsidized foreign biodiesel 
imports. I therefore urge my colleagues to support the production of 
American biodiesel and this commonsense, cost reduction reform.

      By Mr. FLAKE (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. 
        Lee, Mr. Tillis, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Tester, and Mr. Manchin):
  S. 946. A bill to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to hire 
additional Veterans Justice Outreach Specialists to provide treatment 
court services to justice-involved veterans, and for other purposes; to 
the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.
  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, Arizona is home to more than a half million 
veterans. They have served in every conflict from World War II to 
present-day operations in the Middle East. Nothing makes me prouder 
than to shake the hand of one of these veterans and to call them an 
Arizonan.
  Fortunately, many of these veterans have the support of friends and 
family, as well as their fellow veterans with whom they served, but far 
too many who have served our country lack a support system that can 
help them successfully make the transition back to civilian life.
  For those who have post-traumatic stress or traumatic brain injury, 
this could be particularly difficult. Studies have shown that veterans 
often do not seek out medical health treatment due to concerns about 
stigma, negative career prospects, lack of awareness, or logistical 
challenges in accessing care. For those who go without treatment, it 
can lead to substance abuse and, in some cases, run-ins with the law.
  While there is no justification for criminal behavior, it is 
important to recognize when certain actions may be symptomatic of the 
harrowing experiences a veteran has endured during years of service. 
This is something the criminal justice system often fails to deal with. 
By not providing treatment that actually addresses a veteran's 
underlying service-connected issues, our criminal justice system 
sometimes creates a vicious cycle. It overcriminalizes service-
connected mental illness, undertreats incarcerated veterans, and 
increases recidivism.

  To address the problem, the VA created the Veterans Justice Outreach 
Program in 2009. The program was established to remove veterans from 
the regular criminal justice process and to provide specially tailored 
treatments to address many of these underlying issues. These veterans 
treatment courts have a proven record of preventing initial 
incarceration and reducing recidivism.
  The lifeblood of the program is the veterans justice outreach 
specialists, VJO specialists, who link veterans to available court 
services. These outreach specialists identify veterans in jails and 
local courts, they assess their health status, and they help them 
develop the rehabilitation treatment program specific to each of their 
needs.
  I recently had the opportunity to observe the veterans docket and 
meet with some of these dedicated specialists while visiting the Mesa 
Municipal Court earlier this month. Let me tell you, there is no 
substitute for seeing this firsthand. Even though it is a courtroom 
setting, there is a comradery and collaboration that you don't see in 
traditional courtroom proceedings. I was amazed at how many

[[Page S2556]]

organizations there are to help these veterans--to help them 
successfully transition and help them with treatment.
  The collaboration I am talking about comes from having a judge and 
hard-working staff who have served in the military themselves. They 
understand the hardship of multiple deployments for servicemembers and 
their families. They understand the mental and physical tolls of 
combat. They understand that the transition back to civilian life can 
mark the beginning of a new battle for veterans.
  The program has experienced remarkable success. The unfortunate 
reality is that the VA doesn't have enough outreach specialists to 
ensure access to already available treatment for justice-involved 
veterans. Demand for VJO specialists is outpacing the program's ability 
to serve eligible veterans. This means future veterans treatment courts 
can't be established, existing courts will go understaffed, and 
veterans will go unserved. That is not right.
  That is why today I am introducing the Veterans Treatment Court 
Improvement Act to ensure our veterans receive swift and appropriate 
access to justice. This legislation will provide 50 additional VJO 
specialists for veterans treatment courts nationwide. By increasing the 
number of dedicated specialists at these facilities, Congress can 
ensure that more veterans have access to the treatments they have 
earned with their service. This is bipartisan legislation. I will work 
to inform my colleagues about the need for this program and additional 
VJOs in the coming weeks and months.

       Subject to valid rights existing on the date of enactment 
     of this Act, the Federal land referred to in title I is 
     withdrawn from all forms of--
       (1) entry, appropriation, or disposal under public law;
       (2) location, entry, and patent under mining law; and
       (3) disposition under all laws pertaining to mineral and 
     geothermal leasing or mineral materials.

  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 20 years ago, when I was elected to the 
U.S. Senate, a group of people came to me and asked me to sponsor a 
bill. It was a bill that had been sponsored many times by Senator Bill 
Bradley of New Jersey. He retired shortly before I arrived.
  The bill related to the Utah wilderness. I remember saying to those 
who approached me: This isn't my State. It is the State of Utah.
  They said: This is a bill which we are having some controversy with 
when it

[[Page S2560]]

comes to the Utah congressional delegation.
  Secondly, I said: It is a wilderness bill about a part of the world 
that I have never seen. I don't feel right introducing it.
  They said: Why don't you come out and look at it?
  I did just a few weeks later. My wife and I went and took a look at 
the Red Rocks Wilderness area in Utah. I will tell you, initially, as a 
midwesterner, when I looked at the stark landscape, I looked around 
thinking, what are we trying to preserve here? I took a closer look, 
which everyone should, and found a unique part of America--a wilderness 
area which can't be found anywhere else and a wilderness area which 
boasts archeological and historic and environmental significance way 
beyond what many people in the rest of the lower 48 might appreciate.
  Today, I am reintroducing the America's Red Rock Wilderness Act. It 
would safeguard 9.2 million acres of Park Bureau Land Management land 
in Utah as wilderness--some of the last great wild places in the lower 
48.
  Throughout my time in the Senate, I have worked with the committed 
volunteers of the Utah Wilderness Coalition to protect the stunning, 
fragile desert landscape. These unique lands are rich in archeological 
resources and provide a habitat for rare plants and species. They offer 
unparalleled research, educational, and recreational opportunities for 
scientists, teachers, outdoor enthusiasts, and families.
  The Bureau of Land Management has confirmed that the vast majority of 
the majority of the lands meet the qualifications for a wilderness 
designation. However, despite their pristine condition and their 
historical significance, these lands are threatened by oil and gas 
development, as well as rampant off-road vehicle use.
  Although these activities are appropriate in some places, they don't 
belong in such a fragile landscape. Designating these lands as 
wilderness would safeguard wildlife, protect ancestral lands, help 
mitigate climate change, and provide access to future generations of 
hunters, anglers, hikers, boaters, and lovers of the natural world.
  Last December, President Obama took an important step in protecting 
some of Southern Utah's fragile lands by designating the Bears Ears 
National Monument, which contains some of the lands that would be 
protected by my Red Rocks bill.
  The 1.35 million-acre swath of land covers forested mesas and red 
rock canyons, and the designation protected the region's abundant 
Native American cultural resources. The monument contains well over 
100,000 cultural and archeological sites. Let me say that again. Over 
100,000 cultural and archeological sites, including ancient cliff 
dwellings, granaries, burial sites, and kivas, as well as spectacular 
pictographs and petroglyphs strewn upon rock walls and boulders all 
across the region.
  Artifacts range from 700 to 12,000 years old, providing tribes with 
an incredible insight into the shared history of their ancestral 
homeland, bolstering their deep spiritual connection to the land 
itself.
  The Bears Ears National Monument, designated by President Obama, is 
the first monument of its kind to be proposed and advocated by a united 
coalition of five Tribes who sought its protection because of its 
importance in their respective culture. In total, 30 Native American 
tribes with ancestral, historical, and contemporary ties to the Bears 
Ears region supported the designation.
  The Tribal coalition's original Bears Ears proposal was 1.9 million 
acres. You see them here. It is slightly larger than the 1.35 million-
acre designation by President Obama.
  Many in the Utah delegation, including one of my colleagues in the 
Senate, have raised concerns about President Obama's decision to 
protect this area and even the size of the designation. One of the 
critics of the size of the designation is the chairman of the House 
Natural Resources Committee, Rob Bishop.
  Last Congress, before President Obama designated the Bears Ears 
region a national monument, the same Chairman Bishop introduced a bill 
that would have protected part of the Bears Ears region while opening 
other areas of land for oil and gas development.
  Look at the two here in comparison. Chairman Bishop's proposal 
protected 1.28 million acres--only 17,500 acres smaller than the area 
protected by President Obama.
  As you can see from these maps, the areas protected by Chairman 
Bishop's Public Lands Initiative are not that much different than the 
areas protected by the Bears Ears National Monument. To argue that the 
designation is so much larger than anyone anticipated is to ignore what 
the chairman submitted in his own legislation last year. Both are much 
smaller than what the Tribes originally requested, which is the third 
map here.
  Despite that, Utah's congressional delegation has called the area 
``well beyond the areas in need of protection'' and they pushed 
President Trump to consider shrinking or overturning this wilderness 
monument designation. Yet Utah's Salt Lake Tribune called Utah 
politicians' determination to rescind these designations ``blindness.''
  Let me quote the Salt Lake Tribune:

       That blindness can be sourced to Utah's one-party political 
     system that has given us leaders who are out of touch with 
     their constituents.

  They then continue and say:

       The Bears Ears monument may be with us forever, and there 
     is no bucket of gold waiting if it does go away. The 
     presidential proclamation bent far toward the same boundaries 
     and shared management [Utah Rep. Rob] Bishop pursued with his 
     public lands initiative.

  They saw the same maps and said: Why is this acceptable and this 
objectionable?
  Today, President Trump is planning to sign an Executive order. It is 
going to call on the Department of Interior to review previous national 
monument designations under the Antiquities Act.
  While the President's Executive order will target the Bears Ears 
National Monument first, the order is going to go well beyond Utah and 
consider changes to all of the national monuments that have been 
designated since 1996--more than 50 different sites.
  These are areas designated ``national monument protected areas'' by 
Republican and Democratic Presidents with bipartisan support. Yet 
President Trump is going to insist with his new order that he can 
review and change every single one of them.
  Let me tell you the list of places and sites of great cultural 
significance that could be impacted: A portion of Sequoia National 
Forest in California, Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National 
Historic Park in Maryland, African Burial Ground National Monument in 
New York, and in my home State of Illinois, the Pullman National 
Monument.
  It is rare for any national monument designation to be changed by 
another President. It happened once. The last time a President used the 
Antiquities Act to adjust the borders of a national monument was over a 
century ago, in 1915. Then-President Woodrow Wilson shrunk Washington 
State's Mount Olympus National Monument so they could harvest more 
timber resources from this land.
  A lot has changed since 1915, including our views on conservation. 
Attacks on conservation seem to have remained consistent. One of our 
greatest conservation Presidents, Teddy Roosevelt--a proud Republican, 
I might add--faced a great deal of opposition to his designation of a 
national monument that most of us are familiar with--the Grand Canyon.
  Most Americans can't imagine our country without the iconic Grand 
Canyon because it is truly a national treasure. At the time of its 1908 
designation by President Roosevelt, groups were opposed to protecting 
that area. For years after its designation, oil and gas miners fought 
additional protections for the Grand Canyon.
  The attacks on the Bears Ears designation doesn't seem all that 
different from the attacks on the Grand Canyon, but the attacks on the 
Bears Ears National Monument also attack the Native people who have 
worked so hard to get this area protected.
  Let's be very honest. When we look at how Native Americans were 
treated by our government and the settlers, we certainly look back with 
some shame and some embarrassment. What the Tribes are asking for here 
is a protection of areas that are of special significance to them and 
special significance to the environmental legacy, which we should be 
leaving to future generations.

[[Page S2561]]

  The President's decision to review these national monuments puts the 
future of these resources in jeopardy and threatens our culture, 
history, and heritage. If President Donald Trump decides to use the 
Antiquities Act to reverse one of these monuments, he would treading in 
uncharted water. Never before has a President used the Antiquities Act 
to repeal a national monument. For what purpose? For oil and gas 
exploration? For off-the-road vehicle use?
  These monuments themselves help promote tourism and outdoor 
recreation. Regions with national monuments saw increased employment 
and personal income growth--exactly the opposite of what the critics 
promised. Specifically, rural counties in the West, with protected 
lands, saw jobs increase by 345 percent over areas without protected 
lands--345 percent. Despite the opposition from Utah's elected 
officials, many in the State, including the Tribes, want to protect 
those areas, and I want to help them.
  Teddy Roosevelt once said:

       It is also vandalism wantonly to destroy or to permit the 
     destruction of what is beautiful in nature, whether it be a 
     cliff, a forest, or a species of mammal or bird. Here in the 
     United States we turn our rivers and streams into sewers and 
     dumping-grounds, we pollute the air, we destroy forests, and 
     exterminate fishes, birds, and mammals--not to speak of 
     vulgarizing charming landscapes with hideous advertisements. 
     But at last it looks as if our people were awakened.

  That was said by that Republican President over a century ago. Since 
Teddy Roosevelt's time, we have made progress in protecting our lands 
and waters, but these recent attacks and this recent Executive order by 
President Donald Trump show that we still have a long way to go.
  I urge this administration, this Republican administration, to heed 
the words of Teddy Roosevelt. Carefully consider the legacy they will 
leave to future generations. It would be foolish not to protect Bears 
Ears and other monuments, just as it would have been foolish to listen 
to the critics and refuse to protect the Grand Canyon.
  These monuments are for all of us, and we must ensure that they 
remain in their current natural condition for future generations to 
enjoy.
