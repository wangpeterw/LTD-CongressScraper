3,COURTNEY,proceeding_id,topic-id,825,"Mr.Speaker, perhaps the most powerful moment on Inauguration Day when the President gave his speech was when he reminded his supporters and the people who were assembled there that there were too many in America who were forgotten by the Federal Government; and that it was his promise that he would, in fact, remember them in terms of how he developed policies and programs during his time as It is a message which obviously he used quite effectively on the campaign trail. I think personally it is what propelled him into the White  Fast forward to where we are today, Mr.It is hard to really square that rhetoric with the budget, which was submitted a couple of weeks ago by the Trump administration. The one agency which probably has the closest connection to rural America, that part of the country which he was addressing in his comments on Inauguration Day, the U.Department of Agriculture, was cut by 20 percent in terms of what came over from the White  Again, that was the third largest hit of any Federal agency of the entire Federal Government, the U.Department of It does so much in terms of helping farmers, small town America, and rural America in terms of dealing with the challenges which, again, I think, were just a huge, powerful undercurrent in last November's election.  In particular, the budget proposes eliminating completely the USDA Rural Development for drinking water and wastewater programs, which, again, for so many communities, is desperately needed.  Again, the property tax base of small town and rural towns across the country really cannot, by themselves, pay for sewer plants, pay for drinking water upgrades. I know because I come from one of those districts.  Even in Connecticut, the eastern half of the State, the Second Congressional District is small town, rural America for which the USDA Rural Development programs have been the lifeblood of making sure that community facilities and, again, a decent quality of life are possible.  So, for example, in towns like Vernon, Connecticut, where I am from, the Bolton Lake sewer plant was just finished a couple of years ago through USDA Rural In the town of Putnam, $28 million over just the last couple of years, they just built a new fire station, the north Putnam fire station, with USDA Rural  Stafford, Connecticut, there was a sewer plant upgrade. Windham, Connecticut, there was a new community health facility, which was a community facilities program, through USDA Rural There were projects in Thompson, Connecticut, $2.4 million for water and sewer; Brooklyn, Connecticut, $1.3; Killingly, and the list goes on and on.  This budget, let's be clear, doesn't just give this program a little haircut or tailor it back. It eliminates it. It eviscerates this type of help which, again, rural communities, with their own resources, are incapable of accomplishing on their own.  Mr.Speaker, a budget is more than just a collection of numbers. It is a statement of your priorities. It is about what is important to you as an executive or as a legislator, and this budget fails that test for rural America, for the forgotten Americans which the President addressed on Inauguration  I am confident that, in this Chamber, there is potential for a bipartisan group of Members to push back on this type of really just backwards budgeting and backwards priority.  Again, in terms of what my father told me a long time ago: Talk is cheap. Put your money where your mouth is. Put your budget where your rhetoric is.  On that score, this administration has failed that test. It has also failed it with the Sea Grant program for fishermen in Again, 90 percent of seafood that is consumed in this country is from overseas.  Even though we are a great maritime country, the Sea Grant program helps[[Page H2604]]fishermen deal with all the complexity of the maritime domain in terms of regulations. I have seen it in  Again, my district borders on Long Island We have seen shellfish growers coming back to life because of the Sea Grant program administered through the University of Connecticut Avery Point Campus that has given these really hardworking, inspiring entrepreneurs the tools that they need to again give America a domestic seafood industry. It is just ridiculous when you look at the disproportion of imported seafood that is consumed on the tables of Americans all across the country.  Later today, 100 House Members, on a bipartisan basis, will be releasing a letter of support for the Sea Grant program. Congressman Zeldin, Republican from Long Island, and myself led that letter. Again, this is where our focus ought to be in terms of this country.  If you really care about making America great again, it is about giving people out there in the great heartland and in the coastal sections of this country the tools that they need to grow, thrive, innovate, and succeed. This budget fails that test.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-03-pt1-PgH2603-4.txt

Just this month the regime in Pyongyang released a fake propaganda video showing the imagined destruction of a U.aircraft carrier by its forces.  In addition to the five nuclear weapons North Korea has already tested, Kim Jong-un continues to test ballistic missiles, including submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and is moving toward intercontinental ballistic missiles.

23,CHABOT,proceeding_id,topic-id,338,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of 92, condemning North Korea's development of multiple intercontinental ballistic missiles.  Without question, North Korea's relentless effort to develop ballistic missiles poses a serious threat to the security of the United States, especially to our allies in the region, and possibly all across the globe.  For the past several years, Kim Jong-un has made significant strides in their nuclear missile program. It seems like every few weeks we hear new reports concerning the growing North Korea nuclear threat. North Korea has conducted multiple nuclear tests and demonstrated that it is bound and determined to develop a ballistic missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to the continental United  It has also become abundantly clear that the Kim regime will continue to[[Page H2608]]work toward a nuclear warhead, no matter the cost. Just today, a senior North Korean defector stated that the young, irresponsible dictator will do anything to remain in power and that Kim believes nuclear weapons will help guarantee his rule.  We must condemn these actions and begin taking concrete steps to mitigate the growing North Korean threat. I also believe we must work closer than ever with our South Korean partners and increase our already strong security alliance by assisting with technological developments, carrying out more joint exercises, and quickly making the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense systems, or THAAD, in South Korea operational.  I commend my friend, Mr.Wilson of South California, for his leadership in championing 92. I also want to thank Chairman Royce and the ranking member, Mr.Eliot Engel, for, again, using the format of the Foreign Affairs Committee in a bipartisan manner.  This is one committee in the House--and there are a few others--that works very much in a bipartisan manner. This is one we do need to be united on. The threat from Kim Jong-un is serious. It is dangerous. It is a threat to world peace. We need to take it seriously. 92 goes in the right direction. I, again, want to thank Mr.Wilson for proposing it.  ",CREC-2017-04-03-pt1-PgH2605-5.txt

Most importantly, we received assurances from the Macri administration that they will restart the investigation into the horrific 1994 bombing of the AMIA Jewish center in Buenos Aires, which left 85 dead and hundreds more injured, and the untimely and suspicious death of prosecutor Alberto Nisman, who was found dead on the eve of delivering his explosive report which outlined the connections between the bombing, Iran, and former Argentina President Cristina Kirchner's efforts to cover up these links. Unfortunately, the victims of these attacks and their families still lack answers to what really occurred, and the troubling reports of Iran's role in the bombing deserves thorough investigation that finally brings the perpetrators to justice.

I think it is apparent that that 1994 bombing was conducted by Iran in cooperation with Hezbollah, and we all want to encourage the Argentine Government to find out whether there was foul play in the death of Alberto Nisman and, if so, who was behind what has all the hallmarks of an assassination designed to prevent that report from being submitted to the Argentine people and  I commend the authors of this legislation.

33,SHERMAN,proceeding_id,topic-id,587,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today to support H.479, the North Korea State Sponsor of Terrorism Designation Act of 2017.  I want to associate myself with the chairman's remarks. He summarizes well the need to adopt this legislation. I want to commend Judge Poe for introducing this legislation. I was very pleased to introduce it alongside him.  We earlier considered 92. In that debate, we discussed the nuclear and missile program of North Now it is time to focus for the next few minutes on their use of terrorism.  We need to consider North Korea's obvious state support of terrorism around the world. North Korea has engaged in kidnappings, targeted assassination, cyber attacks, and support to terrorist organizations in various regions.  North Korea was designated as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1988, but it was taken off that list in 2008, following commitments by Pyongyang to dismantle its nuclear weapons program. We dismantled their status as a state sponsor of terrorism. North Korea certainly has not dismantled its nuclear program.  Kim Jong-un has only increased the pace of his nuclear ballistic missile testing and is nowhere near dismantling that program. So now it is time to focus again on North Korea's terrorist actions around the world.  We can go back several decades when the North Korean Government kidnapped Japanese civilians--some because of their talents in making movies; most in order to force them to[[Page H2613]]teach Japanese etiquette to North Korean spies.  Now, you may say: Well, that was decades ago. Why are we designating them as a state sponsor of terrorism now?  Well, those people still have not been released to this day. And, if they have passed on, their bodies have not been returned to their families.  We are all aware of how North Korea engaged in cyberterrorism against Sony Pictures because Sony Pictures made a movie they didn't like.  We know that, just a month or so ago, a North Korean agent killed Kim Jong-nam, the half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. This act of terrorism took place at the airport in Malaysia and was summarized by the chairman.  In the case of Chaim Kaplan v. Hezbollah, a United States District Court found that, in 2014, North Korea materially supported terrorist attacks by Hezbollah, a designated foreign terrorist organization.  And finally--and this list is incomplete but last on my list--is North Korea's assistance in helping Assad try to develop nuclear weapons of his own. We are aware that Assad's nuclear facility, built almost entirely based on North Korean technology and using North Korean equipment, was destroyed in 2007. Assad has murdered hundreds of thousands, it looks like the figure is now half a million, of his own citizens. Imagine the destruction Assad would have engaged in had he been able to develop nuclear weapons with the support and technology of North  H.479, the North Korea State Sponsor of Terrorism Designation Act, expresses the sense of Congress that North Korea likely meets the criteria to be designated as a state sponsor of terrorism and requires a determination by the Secretary of State within 90 days as to whether or not North Korea meets that standard.

During my visit, I met with Border Patrol agents in New Mexico and Texas, as well as ranchers and business leaders on the border.  Border security was a significant issue in the last election, as Americans are concerned about the flow of illegal narcotics and aliens across the border. Although gaps in security remain, I saw an impressive array of assets, including drones and manned aircraft, walls, cameras, and other materiel.  More impressive, however, are the men and women who work for Customs and Border Protection, who, at no small risk to themselves, work to keep America secure. They are very encouraged lately as they see policy changes coming that will allow them to enforce our laws. Mr.Speaker, these individuals are literally on the front line defending our Nation and communities, and I thank them for their service.

Unfortunately, equal pay for equal work has not become a reality. In fact, women are paid between 79 and 80 cents for every dollar that men are paid for doing the exact same job. In fact, it takes women until tomorrow, April 4, to earn what men were paid in the previous year.  For women of color, the gap is even wider. In 2015, African-American women made 65 cents for every dollar earned by their White male counterparts. For Hispanic women, it is even worse. They earn 58 cents for every dollar earned by their White male counterparts.  Women pay a huge price because of the wage gap. Today, families rely increasingly on women's wages to make ends meet; and with less take-home pay, women have less money to cover the everyday needs of their family.

Erik Prince, by the way, is the brother to Betsy DeVos, the Secretary of The UAE's incentive to broker this meeting comes from the deteriorating relationship between them and They wanted to drive a wedge between Russia, Iran, and Agreement on that deal would need a handsome reward, like the easing of U.sanctions on the Russian Federation for its invasion of  Blackwater is the private security firm that became infamous for U.abuses in Iraq after a series of incidents, including one in 2007 in which the company's guards were charged and criminally convicted of killing civilians.  ``Officials said Zayed and his brother, the UAE's national security adviser, coordinated the Seychelles meeting with Russian Government officials with the goal of establishing an unofficial back channel between Trump and Putin.'' The UAE at one point paid Erik Prince's firm a reported half a billion dollars to consult on defensive security.  An independent bipartisan commission to investigate Trump officials and Russian connections is long overdue.                [From the Washington Post, 3, 2017] Blackwater Founder Held Secret Seychelles Meeting to Establish Trump-                           Putin Back Channel      (By Adam Entous, Greg Miller, Kevin Sieff and Karen DeYoung)       The United Arab Emirates arranged a secret meeting in      January between Blackwater founder Erik Prince and a Russian      close to President Vladimir Putin as part of an apparent      effort to establish a back-channel line of communication      between Moscow and President-elect Donald Trump, according to      U.S., European and Arab officials.       The meeting took place around 11--nine days before      Trump's inauguration--in the Seychelles islands in the Indian      Ocean, officials said. Though the full agenda remains      unclear, the UAE agreed to broker the meeting in part to      explore whether Russia could be persuaded to curtail its      relationship with Iran, including in Syria, a Trump      administration objective that would likely require major      concessions to Moscow on U.sanctions.       Though Prince had no formal role with the Trump campaign or      transition team, he presented himself as an unofficial envoy      for Trump to high-ranking Emiratis involved in setting up his      meeting with the Putin confidant, according to the officials,      who did not identify the       Prince was an avid supporter of Trump who gave $250,000      last year to support the GOP nominee's campaign, records      show. He has ties to people in Trump's circle, including      Stephen Bannon, now serving as the president's chief      strategist and senior counselor. Prince's sister Betsy DeVos      serves as education secretary in the Trump administration.      And Prince was seen in the Trump transition offices in New      York in       U.officials said the FBI has been scrutinizing the      Seychelles meeting as part of a broader probe of Russian      interference in the 2016 U.election and alleged contacts      between associates of Putin and The FBI declined to      comment.       The Seychelles encounter, which one official said spanned      two days, adds to an expanding web of connections between      Russia and Americans with ties to Trump--contacts that the      White House has been reluctant to acknowledge or explain      until they have been exposed by news organizations.       ``We are not aware of any meetings and Erik Prince had no      role in the transition,'' said Sean Spicer, the White House      press secretary.       ``Erik had no role on the transition team. This is a      complete fabrication,'' said a spokesman for Prince in a      statement. ``The meeting had nothing to do with President      Why is the so-called underresourced intelligence      community messing around with surveillance of American      citizens when they should be hunting terrorists?''       Prince is best known as the founder of Blackwater, a      security firm that became a symbol of U.abuses in Iraq      after a series of incidents including one in 2007 in which      the company's guards were accused--and later criminally      convicted--of killing civilians in a crowded Iraqi square.      Prince sold the firm, which was subsequently rebranded, but      has continued building a private paramilitary empire with      contracts across the Middle East and       Prince would probably have been seen as too controversial      to serve in any official capacity in the Trump transition or      administration. But his ties to Trump advisers, experience      with clandestine work and relationship with the royal leaders      of the Emirates--where he moved in 2010 amid mounting legal      problems for his American business--would have positioned him      as an ideal go-between.       The Seychelles meeting came after private discussions in      New York involving high-ranking representatives of Trump,      Moscow and the       The White House has acknowledged that Michael Flynn,      Trump's original national security adviser, and Trump adviser      and son-in-law Jared Kushner met with the Russian ambassador      to the United States, Sergey Kislyak, in late November or      early December in New       Flynn and Kushner were joined by Bannon for a separate      meeting with the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohamed      bin Zayed al-Nahyan, who made an undisclosed visit to New      York later in December, according to the U.S., European and      Arab officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to      discuss sensitive matters.       In an unusual breach of protocol, the UAE did not notify      the Obama administration in advance of the visit, though      officials found out because Zayed's name appeared on a flight      manifest.       Officials said Zayed and his brother, the UAE's national      security adviser, coordinated the Seychelles meeting with      Russian government officials with the goal of establishing an      unofficial back channel between Trump and       Officials said Zayed wanted to be helpful to both leaders      who had talked about working more closely together, a policy      objective long advocated by the crown prince. The UAE, which      sees Iran as one of its main enemies, also shared the Trump      team's interest in finding ways to drive a wedge between      Moscow and       Zayed met twice with Putin in 2016, according to Western      officials, and urged the Russian leader to work more closely      with the Emirates and Saudi Arabia--an effort to isolate            At the time of the Seychelles meeting and for weeks      afterward, the UAE believed that Prince had the blessing of      the new administration to act as its unofficial      representative. The Russian participant was a person whom      Zayed knew was close to Putin from his interactions with both      men, the officials said.       When the Seychelles meeting took place, official contacts      between members of the incoming Trump administration and the      Russian government were under intense scrutiny, both from      federal investigators and the press.       Less than a week before the Seychelles meeting, U.     intelligence agencies released a report accusing Russia of      intervening clandestinely during the 2016 election to help      Trump win the White       The FBI was already investigating communications between      Flynn and The Washington Post's David Ignatius first      disclosed those communications on 12, around the time of      the Seychelles meeting. Flynn was subsequently fired by Trump      for misleading Vice President Pence and others about his      discussions with       Yousef Al Otaiba, the UAE's ambassador in Washington,      declined to comment.       Government officials in the Seychelles said they were not      aware of any meetings between Trump and Putin associates in      the country around 11. But they said luxury resorts on      the island are ideal for clandestine gatherings like the one      described by the U.S., European and Arab officials.       ``I wouldn't be surprised at all,'' said Barry Faure, the      Seychelles secretary of state for foreign affairs. ``The      Seychelles is the kind of place where you can have a good      time away from the eyes of the media. That's even[[Page H2620]]     printed in our tourism marketing. But I guess this time you      smelled something.''       Trump has dismissed the investigations of Russia's role in      the election as ``fake news'' and a ``witch hunt.''       The level of discretion surrounding the Seychelles meeting      seems extraordinary given the frequency with which senior      Trump advisers, including Flynn and Kushner, had interacted      with Russian officials in the United States, including at the      high-profile Trump Tower in New       Steven Simon, a National Security Council senior director      for the Middle East and North Africa in the Obama White      House, said: ``The idea of using business cutouts, or      individuals perceived to be close political leaders, as a      tool of diplomacy is as old as the hills. These unofficial      channels are desirable precisely because they are deniable;      ideas can be tested without the risk of failure.''       Current and former U.officials said that while Prince      refrained from playing a direct role in the Trump transition,      his name surfaced so frequently in internal discussions that      he seemed to function as an outside adviser whose opinoins      were valued on a range of issues, including plans for      overhauling the U.intelligence community.       He appears to have particularly close ties to Bannon,      appearing multiple times as a guest on Bannon's satellite      radio program over the past year as well as in articles on      the Breitbart Web site that Bannon ran before joining the      Trump campaign.       In a July interview with Bannon, Prince said those seeking      forceful U.leadership should ``wait till January and hope      Mr.Trump is elected.'' And he lashed out at President Barack      Obama, saying that because of his policies ``the terrorists,      the fascists, are winning.''       Days before the November election, Prince appeared on      Bannon's program again, saying that he had ``well-placed      sources'' in the New York City Police Department telling him      they were preparing to make arrests in the investigation of      former congressman Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.) over allegations      he exchanged sexually explicit texts with a minor. Flynn      tweeted a link to the Breitbart report on the claim. No      arrests occurred.       Prince went on to make a series of unfounded assertions      that damaging material recovered from Weiner's computers      would implicate Hillary Clinton and her close adviser, Huma      Abedin, who was married to He also called Abedin an      ``agent of influence very sympathetic to the Muslim      Brotherhood.''       Prince and his family were major GOP donors in 2016. After      the Republican convention, he contributed $250,000 to Trump's      campaign, the national party and a pro-Trump super PAC led by      GOP mega-donor Rebekah The Center for Responsive      Politics reported that the family gave more than $2.7 million      to GOP candidates and super PACs, including about $2.7      million from his sister, DeVos, and her husband.       Prince's father, Edgar Prince, built his fortune through an      auto-parts company. Betsy married Richard DeVos Jr., heir to      the Amway fortune.       Erik Prince has had lucrative contracts with the UAE      government, which at one point paid his firm a reported $529      million to help bring in foreign fighters to help assemble an      internal paramilitary force capable of carrying out secret      operations and protecting Emirati installations from      terrorist attacks.       The Trump administration and the UAE appear to share a      similar preoccupation with Current and former officials      said that Trump advisers were focused throughout the      transition period on exploring ways to get Moscow to break      ranks with       ``Separating Russia from Iran was a common theme,'' said a      former intelligence official in the Obama administration who      met with Trump transition officials. ``It didn't seem very      well thought out. It seemed a little premature. They clearly      had a very specific policy position, which I found odd given      that they hadn't even taken the reins and explored with      experts in the U.government the pros and cons of that      approach.''       Michael McFaul, former U.ambassador to Russia, said he      also had discussions with people close to the Trump      administration about the prospects of drawing Russia away      from ``When I would hear this, I would think, `Yeah      that's great for you guys, but why would Putin ever do that?'      '' McFaul said. ``There is no interest in Russia ever doing      that. They have a long relationship with They're allied      with Iran in fighting in They sell weapons to      Iran is an important strategic partner for Russia in the      Middle East.''       Following the New York meeting between the Emiratis and      Trump aides, Zayed was approached by Prince, who said he was      authorized to act as an unofficial surrogate for the      president-elect, according to the officials. He wanted Zayed      to set up a meeting with a Putin associate. Zayed agreed and      proposed the Seychelles as the meeting place because of the      privacy it would afford both sides. ``He wanted to be      helpful,'' one official said of       Wealthy Russians and Emirati royalty have a particularly      large footprint on the islands.

The Emiratis have given hundreds of millions of dollars to      the Seychelles in recent years for causes including public      health and affordable housing. But when the Emirati royal      family visits, they are rarely seen.       ``The jeep comes to their private jet on the tarmac and      they disappear,'' said one Seychellois official who spoke on      the condition of anonymity because he did not want to be seen      as criticizing the       Zayed, the crown prince, owns a share of the Seychelles      Four Seasons, a collection of private villas scattered on a      lush hillside on the main island's southern shore,      overlooking the Indian Ocean, according to officials in the      The hotel is tucked away on a private beach, far      from the nearest public road.       Current and former U.officials who have worked closely      with Zayed, who is often referred to as MBZ, say it would be      out of character for him to arrange the 11 meeting      without getting a green light in advance from top aides to      Trump and Putin, if not the leaders themselves. ``MBZ is very      cautious,'' said an American businessman who knows      ``There had to be a nod.''       The Seychelles meeting was deemed productive by the UAE and      Russia but the idea of arranging additional meetings between      Prince and Putin's associates was dropped, officials said.      Even unofficial contacts between Trump and Putin associates      had become too politically risky, officials said.

Now, just as the Congress has been polarized so has the court been polarized, if you look at the liberal and conservative blocks in that way. But, of course, since the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, there has been a 4-4 split. Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is still a Member of the Court is not always a predictable conservative, though he tends to vote with the conservatives.  What has happened in the Senate is entirely predictable, at least today. In an unprecedented move, the Senate refused to hear from or even meet the nominee of President There was almost a full year, yet the Senate refused to take up that nominee.  What happened today was not payback.

But let me focus for a moment on his pre-court service, which seems to have predicted what he would do in the court of appeals.  He was a principal deputy to the principal who had jurisdiction over the Civil Rights We have to pay attention to the fact that the inspector general, during Judge Gorsuch's time in the Justice Department, found that the Civil Rights Division, where he had some oversight, had been politicized in order to stifle civil rights enforcement. As you might imagine, the Congressional Black Caucus had to pay attention to that finding by a neutral investigator.  We also are very concerned about how Gorsuch is a Justice Department Official treated a Georgia election law. As we know, election laws from the South--of course, there has been a historic decision that has made the Voting Rights Act far less effective than it was--but certainly during most of the time of the Act, Southern states had to go through the Justice Department to[[Page H2622]]see if the laws in southern States, that had kept African-Americans from voting for reasons of race, to see if newly enacted laws affecting voting rights, in fact, discriminated against African-Americans and others or not.  A Georgia election law was found by the Civil Rights Division to be discriminatory. Judge Gorsuch was part of the team that overturned the Civil Rights That was, of course, challenged in the courts. And the ruling of the Justice Department that pre-cleared the law--that said it was all right to go ahead with this law that the Civil Rights Division had found discriminated against Blacks--the court overturned that finding of the Justice  It used quite pregnant language. The District Court said that the Georgia election law was reminiscent of Jim Crow laws. Those words have special meaning in our history--and I speak not here about African-Americans alone. But if you have found yourself in the minority on any issue--it could be a First Amendment issue, it could be a criminal justice issue--you want a court that will protect your rights, not only the rights of the majority.  But this nominee has shown a hostility to litigation in the courts that have been the primary ways we have vindicated constitutional rights and the rights of minorities of every kind. In a telling op-ed, this nominee, Mr.Gorsuch, said: ``American liberals have become addicted to the courtroom, relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box, as the primary means of effecting their social agenda.''  What? What else was there? The majority had enforced laws against the minority--in this case, African-He conceded that Brown v. Board of Education the school desegregation decision. But he went on to say that liberals should ``kick their addiction'' to constitutional litigation. This is a man who wants to get on the Court whose most important mission is constitutional litigation.  I submit to you that even the Justice who epitomized conservatism, Justice Scalia, never showed hostility coming to Court to vindicate the rights of people who felt themselves to be offended. So in that respect, I think it is clear that--and this is a very important respect--Judge Gorsuch is more conservative than Justice Scalia was on the  Nothing could be more concerning than a Justice who says: Look, the preferred way to vindicate your rights is the political process.  Who would disagree with that?  It is the failure of the political process that sends people to the court.  It shows, it seems to me, little appreciation for the Bill of Rights itself. The entire Bill of Rights is about the rights of the minority. And again, the word ``minority'' means any of us could be in that minority at any given point. You could be in that minority when it comes to religious rights. You could be in that minority because of a search and seizure case. You could be in that minority because of a free speech case. And, yes, you could be in that minority because you are part of a classic minority group.  That is why the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments were added to the Bill of The Framers, of course, shared Gorsuch's preference for the political process. A Constitution is a, small D, democratic document. But they created a separation of powers government knowing full well that majoritarian democracy sometimes treads on the rights of minorities. That is why we have the Supreme Court of the United States which Mr.Gorsuch seeks a seat.  Mr.Speaker, before I go on to discuss some cases, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey, (Mr.Payne), my good friend from New Jersey's 10th Congressional  ",CREC-2017-04-03-pt1-PgH2621-2.txt
72,PAYNE,proceeding_id,topic-id,635,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia's leadership throughout the years on many of these issues.  Mr.Speaker, confirmation of Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court would be detrimental to the interests of working Americans, particularly African-Americans and other vulnerable communities.  Just as President Trump's agenda prioritizes special interests, Judge Gorsuch's record shows that he favors powerful interests and businesses over regular people. His hostility to class action lawsuits would threaten protections for workers, especially African-Americans and other minorities.  What is particularly of concern to me is Gorsuch's opinion in what is known as the ``frozen trucker'' case. Gorsuch ruled against an African-American truck driver who, after breaking down in freezing weather, ignored his supervisor by unhitching the broken trailer from his truck and driving away in search of assistance.  In freezing cold weather, the truck driver is nearly freezing to death. He has a truck that won't work with frozen brakes. They are telling him to move--to use the truck and drive away. If he takes his truck with frozen brakes, the harm potentially to other citizens is great. An 18-wheeler truck with no brakes, that doesn't seem logical.  Gorsuch believed that the employee should have followed the orders, even though the driver's life was at risk. Gorsuch was the sole vote against the driver, who was put in the position of having to choose between freezing to death, driving an unsafe vehicle and endangering the lives of others, or unhitching his trailer and seeking help.                              {time}  2000  Judge Gorsuch's record is also troubling when it comes to issues around police accountability. Gorsuch believes in granting police qualified immunity, which protects law enforcement from being held liable for any excessive use of force. Now, this is deeply concerning given the widespread use of excessive force against African Americans by police and the increasing number of police shooting deaths of unarmed African  This is particularly concerning to me. I come from Newark, New Jersey, and the police department is being overseen by a Federal monitor following a 2014 review that determined officers repeatedly violated citizens' civil rights.  Additionally, Gorsuch's record on civil rights is deeply troubling. The National Bar Association, our Nation's oldest and largest national association of predominantly African-American lawyers and judges, notes that Gorsuch has shown a strong tendency to be biased in favor of powerful corporate interests and unapologetically biased against workers and victims of civil and human rights violations.  The confirmation of Gorsuch would threaten the protections and the rights of African Gorsuch is in lockstep with the President, favoring the wealthy over ordinary This is why I oppose his confirmation.  Even those who disagree that Gorsuch would bring a biased view to the Court should see the necessity in delaying consideration of Gorsuch, given the ongoing controversy over the Trump-Russia connection. It is inappropriate to rush forward with a lifetime appointment made by a President who is under investigation by the FBI and trapped in scandal. The Senate should delay consideration of Gorsuch until an independent commission investigates Russia's election interference and any ties between Trump and  Let me just say that Judge Gorsuch has put on a very good show in front of the Senate, seeming to be very confident and thoughtful, but never really answering a lot of the questions that were asked of him.  We feel that this jurist should not sit on the highest court in the land because of the bias that he has shown against working people and regular citizens in this country. Justice is supposed to be blind, but it seems that this jurist has a bias against the American working class person, the normal Joe, the minority looking for an equal break, and to have him sit on the highest court in the land would be a grave, grave mistake.

74,NORTON,proceeding_id,topic-id,1385,"I thank my friend for her comments.  Mr.Speaker, I was the chair, before I came to Congress, in another life, of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, dealing with job discrimination in our country. I was interested, in my own research on Judge Gorsuch to find that he has written more opinions in discrimination cases than other cases.  Now, the Rocky Mountain States of the Tenth Circuit do not have large numbers of African Americans, but the way in which the Supreme Court has interpreted antidiscrimination laws doesn't, in fact, basically differ from one group.  The EEOC also has jurisdiction over disability discrimination. For example, the Court has always indicated that anti-discrimination laws should be read broadly in order to capture discrimination. Whether we are talking about the antidiscrimination laws as they affect women or racial or ethnic minorities or religious minorities, the Supreme Court simply will not read these laws narrowly.  But that is not how Judge Gorsuch has operated on the Tenth He has given a cramped interpretation of the antidiscrimination laws, and yet it is interesting to note that, when there is a claim of discrimination based on religion, he gives a very broad interpretation.  He is perhaps best known for his opinion in the so-called Hobby Lobby case. This is the case in which he found that a closely held corporation was within its rights when it refused to adopt the Affordable Health Care Act's mandate that women and men be granted contraceptive protection as a part of health insurance. Judge Gorsuch found that this was a violation of the rights of the closely held corporation, the first time there has been such a holding.  It is very interesting also to note that right after that, there was a case called Little Sisters of the Now, the Little Sisters of the Poor, unlike the closely held corporation, is, in fact, a religious organization, and they too said they do not wish to have contraception be a part of any of the institutions that they govern.  Remember, we had a religious organization there, not a closely held corporation. The Court found that, to accommodate both women and the religious scruples of the Little Sisters, the Little Sisters had only to acknowledge that they did not desire to enforce the contraceptive mandate, and then it would be taken away from them and would be done by a third party, by the government. That was allowed as a way to accommodate the Little Judge Gorsuch opposed that and wrote an opposing opinion.  So to see this difference in the way he treats discrimination, reading antidiscrimination statutes affecting minorities of every kind in a narrow fashion; when he finds religious discrimination by statute, he reads those statutes very broadly.  His technical rulings are of statutes that the Supreme Court has broadly interpreted, would have made these statutes worthless. You simply cannot enforce antidiscrimination statutes by treating them as though they were technical statutes that, for example, govern financial dealings. And yet this nominee has brought that kind of interpretation of antidiscrimination statutes.  I was shocked at his holding in Hwang v. Kansas State University, which illustrates what I am saying. There, a professor brought a case because her university had refused to follow the guidance of the Equal Employment Opportunity She was entitled to a 6-month leave to accommodate her condition. This is a statute involving disability rights. She took that 6-month leave and asked to have it extended until a day certain, not indefinitely, to recover further from cancer and a bone marrow transplant.  Now, the EEOC guidance said that an additional leave beyond 6 months was possible as an accommodation to an employee unless there was an undue hardship. There was no undue hardship.  But this nominee, Judge Gorsuch, found that the ``6 months was more than enough to comply with the law in nearly every case''--yes, in nearly every case--but the EEOC guidance said that there obviously could be extensions. I can think of no case that would call for more of an extension than a professor who said: I will come back on a date certain, but I have a cancer diagnosis, and I have had a bone marrow transplant.  I hope that that case would give some pause to anyone who hears about it. The nominee has been quite consistent in how he has ruled in the Tenth Circuit, which gives every reason to believe that he is going to carry that consistency to the Supreme  I was very interested to see how he ruled on a Planned Parenthood case where the Governor of Utah had seen these notorious false videos that purported to show the sale of fetal tissue.                              {time}  2030  Now, those videos--every court that has considered those videos have found that they had nothing to do with Planned Parenthood and what it actually did. So this matter has been litigated in a number of circuits. It was litigated in the 10th Circuit in a case called Planned Parenthood Association of Utah v. Herbert; and the 10th Circuit found, as the other circuits have, that these videos were not, in fact, associated with Planned Parenthood--the false videos that surfaced.[[Page H2625]]  Interestingly, the court, on rehearing, which Judge Gorsuch had sought, characterized his dissenting opinion as ``mischaracterization of this litigation and the panel opinion at several turns.''  Here again, we see Judge Gorsuch going out of his way to rule in a fashion that he sees as necessary to sustain his broad views of religious claims. I am trying to give you an overview of Judge Gorsuch's opinions in a number of different areas, and I am mystified by how he would reach the conclusions he has reached in discrimination cases.  Here is one that is very revealing: A.ex rel Christine v. Espanola Public Schools, where a student was found by Judge Gorsuch not to be able to sue for violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act because she had earlier settled a suit for violations of another act, the so-called IDEA  Well, she has a right under both laws. She would have obviously raised perhaps different claims, but his view was that she should not be in court. This closing of the courts must be taken seriously in evaluating Judge Because if you can't get into court in the first place, particularly if you are a member of a minority group, or for the moment find yourself in the minority on a particular issue, then you are out of court before you are in court. You have lost before you cross the threshold.  I can't imagine why Judge Gorsuch didn't allow a student to continue when she had, in frustration, left her school because of violations of her disability rights. That frustration, as far as he was concerned, closed the courthouse door to her.  Why would we want to interpret discrimination laws in a fashion that you can't get into court to make your case?  A particularly cruel case, Compass Environmental v. OSHRC, a case where Gorsuch wrote the dissent, involved a worker who was electrocuted and died as a result. The corporation had trained its workers. This worker happened to be hired after the training had taken place; therefore, was not aware of all of the safeguards.  The Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission found that the electrocution of the worker could have been avoided if the corporation, Compass Environmental, had provided the necessary training. So it cited Compass and it fined Gorsuch dissented. He found that the company had not violated the law. The company hadn't provided the requisite training. The man was electrocuted, and it is very instructive what Judge Gorsuch said:       ``Administrative agencies enjoy remarkable powers in our      legal order. Their interpretations of ambiguous statutes      control even when everyone thinks Congress really meant      something else.''  He didn't like the administrative ruling, so he dissented and would have ruled against the family of a man who was electrocuted.  That is not a man I want on the Supreme This is not a man who knows how to interpret the discrimination statutes which have always been interpreted broadly by the Federal courts. This is not a man who should sit on the Supreme Court of the United  Mr.Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (",CREC-2017-04-03-pt1-PgH2621-2.txt

Wild-crafted refers to plants collected from their natural or indigenous habitat. The Smiths handpicked these botanicals fresh from the trail with minimal environmental impact to ensure long-term sustainability.  Well, that first batch turned into a second batch and a third batch, and so on. As they continued to make soap, they bought better equipment and invested in larger orders of supplies. Word spread about their soap, and before they knew it, the Smiths were receiving invitations to attend craft and artisan shows. They were invited to put their soap in several local galleries, and it wasn't long before they were filling their first wholesale order.  Today their business includes a retail location that also functions as their studio as well as several small satellite locations and an online store. Chad works for Mountain Electric Cooperative full time, and Lisa has a master's degree in organic chemistry and biology. She has been making soap for more than 20 years.  The Smiths adopted Jamil when he was 18 months old. They were told he would never be able to speak and may never be able to walk. Today he does both and is attending school and thriving with their loving care. He even helps out with the business, where he loves to mix oils and wild-craft herbs. Their older children help with deliveries and during special events, while their grandchildren like to come on weekends to help stock shelves and run the cash register. It is truly a family affair.  Lisa likes to say she and Chad built their business one bar of soap at a time. They didn't take out business loans or expect to be an overnight success. Instead, they started small and grew a little bit at a time, working long, hard hours, and eventually reinvesting in their business.

His past opinions demonstrate that he will honor constitutional protections afforded through due process, the right to bear arms, equal protection under the law, and religious freedom.  Legal experts from across the political spectrum are very much in agreement with the Gorsuch nomination. The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously gave Judge Gorsuch the highest possible rating of ``well qualified'' for the Supreme I couldn't agree more.  One of Judge Gorsuch's associates, the chief judge of the Tenth Circuit who served with Judge Gorsuch, has said about him:       Judge Gorsuch brings to the bench a powerful intellect      combined with a probing and analytical approach to every      issue. He brings to each case a strong commitment to limit      his analysis to that case--its facts, the record, and the law      cited and applicable. He does not use his judicial role as a      vehicle for anything other than deciding the case before him.  President Obama's former Solicitor General Neal Katyal penned an op-ed in the New York Times supporting Judge Gorsuch and wrote:       I have no doubt that if confirmed, Judge Gorsuch would help      restore confidence in the rule of law.       His years on the bench reveal a commitment to judicial      independence--a record that should give the American people      confidence[[Page S2160]]     that he will not compromise principle to favor the president      who appointed him.  Those are the words of the Solicitor General who argued on behalf of President Obama's administration in front of the Supreme  Judge Gorsuch has been through the confirmation process before--as we have heard many times on this floor--when Senators, some of them in this body today, approved his nomination to the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit without opposition.  I was privileged to meet with Judge Gorsuch several weeks ago, and it was clear to me through our conversation, a thorough examination of his record, and watching last week's hearing in the Judiciary Committee that Judge Gorsuch will decide cases fairly, based on our Constitution and laws. Isn't that the way it should be? This is what West Virginians expect from a Supreme Court  Newspapers in my State have recognized this nominee's strong qualifications of independence and respect for the rule of law. The Charleston Daily Mail editorialized:       Gorsuch has strong legal credentials and deserves to be      confirmed.       He is the kind of pick that any president should make,      Democrat or Republican, because of his proven qualities      necessary for any justice: a strong understanding and respect      for the nation's founding document, the U. The Wheeling Intelligencer and News Register wrote:       During hearings last week, Gorsuch's suitability for a high      court post was made abundantly clear.       He is precisely the type of judge--faithful to the      Constitution not ideology on specific issues--the nation      needs.  And the Martinsburg Journal said:       Gorsuch seems to believe in using the plain language of the      Constitution to decide cases, regardless of his own      preferences.       That--someone who believes only the people not the courts      can change the Constitution--is precisely the type of Supreme      Court justice we Americans need.  The American people benefited from an open and transparent Supreme Court process that led to Judge Gorsuch being nominated.  During the 2016 Presidential election, both candidates were transparent about the type of Supreme Court Justice they would appoint if elected. President Trump released a list of 21 names, a list that included Judge Gorsuch, and promised voters that he would fill this Supreme Court vacancy with someone from that list. Voters paid attention.  According to an NBC News exit poll, 70 percent of voters said the selection of a Supreme Court Justice was either the most important factor in their vote for President or an important factor. Let me state that again--70 percent.  The American people weighed in, and President Trump acted wisely in selecting Judge He is a mainstream judge who is well qualified for the U.Supreme  Unfortunately, the Democratic leader has indicated that his party intends to engage in an unprecedented partisan filibuster of this nomination. A filibuster of a nominee of this caliber would be a tremendous mistake, I believe, that would harm the Senate as an institution. There has never been a Supreme Court nomination that has been defeated by a partisan filibuster of the type that the Senate Democrats are telegraphing. It is one thing to vote against a nominee on whatever grounds a Senator may wish, but it is quite another to filibuster in an effort to block a nomination that has been submitted by a duly elected President who has the support of the majority of the  Senators have always enjoyed the ability to filibuster nominations. That ability has remained available because Senators have shown restraint in applying the power that comes along with requiring unlimited debate. The clear tradition of the Senate--and this is a body of tradition, I have learned--over the course of its 230 years of history is a confirmation by a majority vote. That tradition has been demonstrated in recent Supreme Court nominations.  President Obama nominated both Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan to the Supreme Neither Justice Sotomayor nor Justice Kagan faced a filibuster in the  President George Bush nominated John Roberts as Chief There was no filibuster attempt against that nomination.  President Bill Clinton nominated Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer to the Supreme Neither faced a filibuster.  President George H.Bush nominated David Souter and Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Neither Justice faced a filibuster even though 48 Senators voted against the Thomas nomination.  One recent Supreme Court nomination did require a cloture vote when a group of Democrat Senators attempted to block a vote on the nomination of Justice Alito's nomination, but a large majority of Senators--72, in fact--invoked cloture, which preserved the bipartisan practice of rejecting filibusters against Supreme Court nominees. Among those who rejected the Alito filibuster in 2006 were the two Democratic Senators from my State--Senator Robert Byrd and Senator Jay There were 72 Senators who voted to invoke cloture on Justice Alito's nomination, but only 58 ended up voting for the final confirmation.  The Senate has a very clear history of rejecting the use of the filibuster on Supreme Court nominations, but there is no justification for a filibuster on the Gorsuch nomination. Neil Gorsuch is a mainstream judge with the highest possible rating from the American Bar He was confirmed by the Senate, without objection, in the year 2006. His service on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals has earned him the respect of his judicial colleagues, and he has demonstrated the independence and respect for the law that the American people expect from a Supreme Court I hope that at least eight of my Democratic colleagues will join us regardless of how they, ultimately, will vote on Judge Gorsuch's confirmation. I hope they will recognize the need to invoke cloture on this nomination.

Explosion in Saint Petersburg, Russia  Before I begin, Mr.President, I want to express our concern here in the United States for our friends in Saint Petersburg, Russia, in the wake of an explosion on their subway system this morning.

We wish a swift recovery to the injured and hope the perpetrators are soon brought to justice.                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Mr.President, I rise this afternoon on the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, which was just advanced by the Judiciary  This afternoon, it has become clear that Judge Gorsuch does not have the 60 votes that are necessary to end debate on his nomination. So now the focus is shifting away from the issue of whether Judge Gorsuch will get 60 votes on the cloture motion and toward the fundamental question before us: Will the majority leader break the rules of the Senate in order to get Judge Gorsuch on the bench?  My friend, the majority leader, has said several times that Judge Gorsuch will be confirmed by the end of this week one way or another. What he really means when he says that is, if Judge Gorsuch does not earn 60 votes in the Senate, which is now the likely outcome, the Republicans must--underline ``must''--exercise the nuclear option to pass Judge Gorsuch on a simple majority vote.  I think the majority leader reasons that if he says it enough times, folks[[Page S2161]]will start believing it--that he has no choice--but they should not. It is a premise no one should swallow. The majority leader is setting up a false choice of supporting Judge Gorsuch or he will have no choice but to break the rules. Maybe, to the majority leader, the nuclear option is the only option, but there are many alternatives. The majority leader makes up his mind independent of what Democrats do on issue after issue, but on this one, he says he has no choice. Maybe he has no choice because the rightwing of the Republican Party--organizations like the Heritage Foundation--will go after him if he does not, but he certainly has a choice to do the right and courageous thing.  Instead, Republicans are playing the game of ``they started it.'' They say Democrats started this process by changing the rules for lower court nominees in 2013. They fail to mention the history that led to that change. The reason that Majority Leader Reid changed the rules was that Republicans had ramped up the use of the filibuster to historic proportions.  They filibustered 79 nominees in the first 4 years of President Obama's To put that in perspective, prior to President Obama, there were 68 filibusters on nominations under all other Presidents--from George Washington to George Under President Obama, exclusively, in the first 4 years of his administration, Republicans filibustered 79 nominees. They deliberately kept open the DC Court of Appeals because it has such influence over decisions that are made by the government.  We all know the hard-right Federalist Society and the hard-right Heritage Foundation want to limit what government can do. The deal we made in 2005--a group of Senators, the so-called Gang of 14--allowed several of the most conservative jurists in the land to become judges and be confirmed to that circuit court. Yet, when President Obama came in, our Republican colleagues insisted on holding three seats of that court open. They, literally, said that they would not allow the seats to be filled at all by President  Sound familiar? Merrick Garland knows it is.  At the time, I pleaded several times with Senator Alexander, my dear friend from Tennessee, to let us vote on some of the judges for the DC I asked him to go to Senator McConnell and say that the pressure on our side to change the rules after all of these filibusters was going to be large. Let's avoid it, I said. But Senator McConnell said no.  Republicans had refused all of our overtures to break the deadlock that they had imposed. So if the majority leader wants to conduct this partisan ``they started it'' exercise, I am sure we could trace it all the way back to the Burr-Hamilton duel.  The fact is that the Republicans blocked Merrick Garland by using the most unprecedented maneuvers. Now we are likely to block Judge Gorsuch, and that means neither party has gotten its party's choice in the last 2 years.  We can go back and forth and blame each other, but in the recent history of the vacancy caused by Justice Scalia's death, we have both lost. We lost Merrick Garland because of the majority leader's unprecedented blockade, and Republicans will lose on Judge Gorsuch because we are doing something we think is reasonable in asking that he be able to earn 60 votes as so many others have. We think the two are not equivalent, but in either case, we have both lost.  We are back to square one, and Republicans have total freedom of choice in this situation. No one is forcing them to break the rules. They don't have to treat the nuclear option as if it were their first and only option. It is a false choice.  To my friends on the other side, the answer isn't to change the rules; the answer is to change the nominee. Presidents of both parties have done so in the past when Supreme Court picks failed to merit confirmation. Again, the answer isn't to change the rules; the answer is to change the nominee.  The majority leader should have the vision and courage to see past this impasse, and I believe he should seriously consider a different option. The President, Senate Republicans, and Democrats should sit down together to come up with a mainstream nominee who can earn bipartisan support. We are willing to meet with them anywhere, anytime to discuss a consensus nominee.  Now, I know my colleagues on the other side will say Judge Gorsuch was a mainstream nominee and Democrats would never support any judge nominated by President We disagree. We probably can't support any nominee whose sole vetting is by the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist They were the sole gatekeepers for the Scalia vacancy, and each is well known to be a rightwing, wealthy special interest group dedicated to moving the bench way to the right. Their selection of Judge Gorsuch shows it. Both the New York Times and the Washington Post did analyses done by experts that showed that Judge Gorsuch would be a very, very conservative--many would say rightwing--Justice on the bench. The New York Times said he would be the second most conservative Justice on the bench--second only to Justice Thomas--and more conservative than the late Justice The Washington Post actually said he would be the most conservative Justice on the bench, based on his record--even more conservative than the very, very conservative Justice  In fact, we Democrats have never let special interest groups be the gatekeeper. We have never said to any special interest group, as President Trump did: Give us a list, and we will choose from that list. That is what Republicans did. We have never done it.  In the past, Presidents have done just what we are suggesting for selecting Supreme Court President Bill Clinton sought and took the advice of Republican Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch in nominating Justices Ginsburg and Breyer instead of Bruce President Obama took the advice of Republican Senators when he picked Merrick Garland--a consensus, mainstream nominee.  President Trump, on the other hand, ignored the Senate and only sought the advice and consent of rightwing special interest groups when making Supreme Court picks. He was running. He had to shore up his support on the hard right. So he said: I am outsourcing the entire selection process to two groups--which, again, are not consensus groups. They would admit that themselves--the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Lo and behold, the process didn't produce a nominee who could earn 60 votes. By contrast, Justice Ginsburg earned 93 votes and Justice Breyer earned 87.  So we are offering President Trump and our friends on the other side a way forward. They don't have to break the rules to get a Justice on the bench. They don't have to break the Senate confirmation process, fundamentally weakening the constitutional principle of advice and consent, to get a Justice on the bench. President Trump could simply consult with Members of both parties to try and come up with a consensus nominee who could get approved and meet a 60-vote threshold.  The answer, again, isn't to change the rules. It is to change the nominee.  We Democrats are not going to oppose every Republican nominee. Of course, we realize a nominee selected this way would not completely agree with our views, but Judge Gorsuch is so far out of the mainstream that he isn't able to earn votes to pass the Even Justices Roberts and Alito--two very conservative judges--earned a bunch of Democratic votes, and each got more than 60--one, in his nomination, and the other, 72 votes in the cloture process.  So the Republicans are free actors. They can choose to go nuclear or they can sit down with Democrats and find a way forward that preserves the grand traditions of this body.  The majority leader himself has said the one thing the two leaders have always agreed upon is to protect the integrity of this institution. He continued, and this is a direct quote: ``I think we can stipulate . . . that in the Senate, it takes 60 votes on controversial matters.''  Mitch McConnell: In the Senate, it takes 60 votes on controversial matters. He has long stood for that proposition for the many years I have been here.  A Supreme Court seat, I believe, meets the majority leader's standard[[Page S2162]]for 60 votes. I hope that instead of crippling the Senate in a partisan way--removing that 60-vote threshold for controversial matters like the Supreme Court--my Republican friends consider the option of working together to find a solution we can both accept. It may seem like a novel concept around here, but that option is always on the table.  I yield the floor.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Women today are managers, entrepreneurs, public servants, and CEOs, and our country is stronger for it. But despite these great strides, there is more work to do to encourage prosperity for America's families.  For nearly 4 years in this body, I have led discussions about equal pay. I am encouraged by the interest from the White House on addressing the workplace challenges that women face today. To that end, I have reintroduced a proposal I believe will make a real difference for families. It is called the Workplace Advancement  The idea behind it is fairly universal and straightforward: equal pay through empowerment. The bill aims to empower employees--especially women--with information about wages so they can be informed advocates for their compensation. When it comes to discussing wages in the workplace, sometimes it can hurt to ask. A culture of silence and fear of retaliation can keep people in the dark about how their compensation compares to others. The Workplace Advancement Act would lift that fear, free up information, and create a more transparent workplace.  A simple principle is at play here. When workers, especially women, have more information, they can more confidently pursue favorable work and wage arrangements. Knowledge is power. With this flexibility, women can better negotiate arrangements that make sense for them. For example, they might be willing to accept less pay if they can have Fridays free for doctors' appointments or family time or simply as a day for self-care.  The Workplace Advancement Act contains language similar to an Executive order that President Obama issued in 2014. Many congressional Democrats requested this action, which is actually more limited in scope than my legislation. Some even praised it. Senator Heinrich called the action ``a critical step to ensure that every woman has a fair shot at fairness and economic success.'' Congresswoman Susan Davis of California said the action was a ``historic step forward.''  Importantly, for employers, the Workplace Advancement Act would not impose new Federal regulations, and no employer would be compelled to disclose salary information. It simply prevents retaliatory action against employees who ask after it.  Fifty-three Republicans and five Democrats in the Senate supported a version of the Workplace Advancement Act last With bipartisan support like this, this bill is possible.  Let's take advantage of this rare moment when we have common ground on a commonsense and straightforward solution. Let's come together so we can look families in the eye and say: We heard you. We have heard you on this issue, and we are going to take action on it.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.  Mr.Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Mr.Mr.President, this week is an important one for the American people, for the Supreme Court, and for the The Judiciary Committee just reported out Judge Neil Gorsuch's nomination--the next step in considering the Supreme Court nominee before the full It was unfortunate to see our Democratic colleagues on the committee break with recent precedent and not support this clearly well-qualified and widely respected Supreme Court nominee.  I would remind colleagues that in addition to simply agreeing to an up-or-down vote on their nominations on the Senate floor, Republicans offered each of the last four first-term Supreme Court nominees of Democratic Presidents Clinton and Obama at least some bipartisan support in the committee votes. Judge Gorsuch is no less qualified than those four nominees of Presidents Clinton and Obama, and it is disappointing he didn't get the same bipartisan support in the committee today.  It now seems apparent that this well-qualified and widely respected judge will be subject to the first successful partisan filibuster in the history of the Senate--the first successful partisan filibuster in the history of the This is a new low but not entirely surprising given that the Democratic leader announced before the nomination was even made that it was hard for him to imagine a nominee this President would nominate whom he could support. He even went so far as to say that he would be willing to fight the nomination ``tooth and nail'' and might even ``keep the seat open'' in perpetuity. It is not too late for our Democratic colleagues to make the right choice.  This week, the Senate will continue to debate Judge Gorsuch's nomination here on the floor. This is a matter of great importance, which is why we are planning to dedicate this week's floor time almost entirely to continued robust debate of this nomination rather than double-tracking it with legislative items, as has been done in the past. Already, several Members from both sides of the aisle have come to the floor day after day to offer their viewpoints on Judge I would encourage Members to take advantage of this time to continue discussing his excellent credentials, judicial background, and broad support from across the political spectrum in our country.  Let me remind colleagues the many ways in which Judge Gorsuch has shown himself to be an outstanding nominee to serve on the High  Judge Gorsuch was unanimously confirmed to his current position as a Federal judge. Not a single Democrat opposed him then, including Senators Obama, Clinton, Biden, Leahy, and He has participated in more than 2,700 cases since then. He has been in the majority 99 percent of the time. He has enjoyed the unanimous support of his fellow judges 97 percent of the time.  The American Bar Association--a group the Democratic leader called the ``gold standard'' for evaluating judicial nominations--awarded him its highest possible rating, unanimously ``well qualified.''  He has amassed a wide array of supporters, including Democrats and Republicans, current and former colleagues, the legal community, and editorial boards all across our country. They say Gorsuch is eminently well-qualified. As Judge John Kane, a Carter appointee, put it, ``I'm not sure we could expect better [than Judge Gorsuch], or that better presently exists.''  They say that Gorsuch is independent. Neal Katyal, President Obama's former Acting Solicitor General, said he has ``no doubt that if confirmed, Judge Gorsuch would help to restore confidence in the rule of law'' because Gorsuch's ``years on the bench reveal a commitment''--a commitment--``to judicial independence.''  They say Gorsuch is fair and impartial. The Denver Post editorial board noted that ``Gorsuch is a brilliant legal mind and talented writer whom observers praise for his ability to apply the law fairly and consistently.'' They went on: ``[W]e appreciate his desire to strictly interpret the Constitution,'' the paper continued, ``based on the intent of our nation's founders, even when those rulings might contradict his personal beliefs.''[[Page S2163]]  They say Gorsuch is highly revered by Democrats and As USA TODAY noted in its editorial endorsing Gorsuch's confirmation just today, ``He has gotten an array of glowing references, including from some Democrats and liberals.'' I mentioned some this morning; there are many more.  Here is just one additional example of how praise for Judge Gorsuch has bridged the political divide: Despite their ideological differences, former Colorado Governor Bill Ritter, a Democrat, and former Colorado attorney general John Suthers, a Republican, agree that Judge Gorsuch should be confirmed. They said:       Gorsuch's temperament, personal decency and qualifications      are beyond dispute.       It is time to use this confirmation process to examine and      exalt the characteristics of a judge who demonstrates that he      or she is scholarly, compassionate, committed to the law, and      will function as part of a truly independent, apolitical      judiciary. Judge Gorsuch fits that bill.  It reminds us of what David Frederick, a board member of the left-leaning American Constitution Society and longtime Democrat, recently said: ``The Senate should confirm [Gorsuch] because there is no principled reason to vote no.''  ``There is no principled reason to vote no.'' He is absolutely right. So it goes without saying that there is no principled reason to block an up-or-down vote on this supremely qualified nominee, either.  I look forward to joining my Senate colleagues in supporting Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court later this week.  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

This Veterans Choice Program Improvement Act is an important piece of legislation that is going to really ensure that veterans can access care in their communities. It is a critically important piece of legislation that we should get done and get done now.  I think this body could learn from the work that was done on the Veterans' Affairs Committee under the leadership of Chairman Isakson for the veterans of this country. I don't think my home State of Montana is any exception. Veterans have been waiting far too long for an appointment at the VA and oftentimes had to drive 100 miles for an appointment. That is why we set up the Choice It was supposed to allow these veterans to get their healthcare closer to home. Unfortunately, it did not work the way it should have. And we were inundated with redtape and a government contractor that struggled to schedule appointments with providers on time.  This Veterans Choice Program Improvement Act is not the end all.

In addition to the Senator from Montana, I thank Mr.McCain, the Senator from Arizona, who is joining us on the floor. I also thank Senator Isakson in particular, the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, for his leadership in seeing that we are here today to bring this legislation across the finish line.  The House passed legislation similar to this, so this is an opportunity for us to get an accomplishment--not for a pat on our backs but for the improvement in the care of those who served[[Page S2164]]our I asked this question on the Senate floor before: Of all the people in the United States, who would you expect to get the best care possible? While we want every American to have high-quality care and access to medical treatment, we certainly want to make certain those who served our country and to whom a commitment was made that they would receive care--we want that commitment fulfilled, and we want it done in a way that is advantageous and easy for our veterans.  The Senator from Montana is correct. The Choice Act is a significant improvement, in my mind, for accessing care. Kansas is not quite as large as the State of Montana, but we are a large rural State, and it is a long distance to a VA hospital. So Choice was brought into play to try to alleviate the backlog, the lack of providers within the VA, and the wait times that veterans faced, but also to try to satisfy the needs of veterans who live long distances from a VA facility.  So Choice is in place, but it still has been a difficult time for many veterans across the country and certainly at home. It is the most common conversation I have when I am back in In fact, I had a townhall meeting in southwest Kansas, in Dodge City, and it is veterans who, in the public forum, will tell me about the problems with the VA and particularly with Choice, or they will line up after or before that meeting to tell me in person that they need help.  This legislation does three significant things. More is to come. We need a permanent act. This is an extension of the Choice Act that expires on August 7, so continuing the program is the first step while we work out the desired outcome of a long-term permanent program.  Secondly, it provides the money through that period of time. It allows the expenditure of dollars to pay for  Third, it eliminates the intermediary--somebody separate from the VA in paying the bills--and that reduces the bureaucracy and burden on our veterans.  I was just looking through what we call casework, things Kansans bring to our office to try to get solved. Front and center is the number of veterans who are being harassed by collection agencies for bills they thought would be paid by the VA through the Choice Program, and they are not being paid in a timely fashion. This eliminates the intermediary--the manager of the program--from paying the bills and restores that authority to the VA to write out the checks with the goal of reducing the bureaucracy and paperwork for the veterans. It also increases the timeliness for the payment that is due the healthcare provider--the doctor, the pharmacy, and the hospital.  Again, as a rural American, many of our providers are struggling. Hospital doors are a challenge to remain open in rural communities across my And that long wait for a reimbursement check for services provided months ago also creates a burden on that hospital, that healthcare provider. So timely payment certainly will benefit the veterans, but it also increases the chances of the stability of healthcare providers in rural communities across my State and around the country.  Finally, it increases the ability for the sharing of medical records between the VA and that community healthcare provider.  Choice is in place to help those veterans who need to have care more quickly and who need to have care closer to home. This bill improves that program and extends it, and that is a significant development. I appreciate the opportunity I have had to work with the Senators from Arizona, Montana, and Georgia to make sure we got to the point we are today. I appreciate my colleagues' unanimous support for the passage of this legislation.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  Mr.Madam President, I want to thank the Senator from Kansas for all the hard work he has done, and the Senator from On the rare occasion I come to praise him, I would like to give him my deep and heartfelt appreciation for his work in a bipartisan fashion on this issue. I mean that with all sincerity. I also thank our distinguished chairman, Senator I also think I share with my colleagues an appreciation for Shulkin, the new Secretary of the Veterans' Administration, who has been an active and helpful participant in this effort.  Most everything has been said except that I would like to remind my colleagues that we now have--since the enactment in 2014, over 7 million appointments have been made using the Choice Now, over 30,000 appointments are successfully made each week under the Choice  The programs are set to expire in a few months, and, as pointed out by my colleagues, the VA has already begun to limit care for pregnant mothers, as well as cancer patients, because their treatment would extend beyond Soon all veterans will be kicked off the Choice  I would just like to point out to my colleagues, if I could, that this crisis started in Phoenix, AZ, where 15,000 veterans were put on a wait list and over 40 veterans died while awaiting care. That is not acceptable in this  I believe the Choice Program is a major step forward. The truth is, the VA has a lot more to do to provide for the care we have obligated this Nation to on behalf of those who have fought and sacrificed for our The Choice Card has made a major step forward. I hope we can consider removing any geographic or other limitations associated with it. But what the Senators from Kansas and Montana have done today is to make sure this program continues and why it is important to pass it today--not one dollar Congress authorized to care for veterans under the Choice Program should go unused.  Let me mention what we have done. There are 7 million additional appointments for veterans in their communities, and over 1.5 million veterans have benefited from using the Choice Card that they would not have had otherwise. Some 350,000 more doctors, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants are available to treat veterans. There are 235,000 appointments per month through Veterans Choice--more than 10,000 per workday. The Veterans Choice Program more than doubles the number of medical providers nationwide that treat veterans. In Arizona, 11,700 medical providers in veterans communities have treated over 100,000 disabled veterans.  The Veterans Choice Card is being used at 700 hospitals and nearly 10,000 clinics nationwide. The Western Region is paying more than 90 percent of Veterans Choice doctors in less than 30 days and answering 900,000 phone calls per month, with an average time to answer of under 25 seconds. Over 3,000 veterans received hepatitis C treatments due to Veterans Choice funding.  There are still kinks in the operation. There are still bottlenecks. There are still times when veterans' payments, particularly, have not been done in a timely fashion, as the Senator from Kansas mentioned. Hopefully, that will change now. As with any program, it had its difficulties in its beginning. But I want to tell my colleagues that we should make the Choice Card available for any veteran, no matter where they happen to reside. It should be, I believe, the basis of our next effort. But in the meantime, I want to thank again the Senator from Kansas for his hard work.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

But I wanted, first, to extend my deepest condolences to the families and friends of those tragically killed in an automobile crash near New Valley, TX, last week.  A bus carrying a group of 14 members of the First Baptist Church in New[[Page S2165]]Braunfels collided with a pickup truck on Highway 83. Thirteen people were killed and two others, including the driver of the other vehicle, were injured. You can imagine how heartbreaking this has been to everyone involved. I can't begin to imagine the pain and the grief felt by their loved ones, their church family, and their entire close-knit community of New Braunfels, TX, just north of San  I had the opportunity to speak with the pastor of First Baptist of New Braunfels, Pastor McLean, the day after the accident. He is leading his congregation and that community during this very difficult time. He is shepherding his flock, though, with grace and strength. There is a phrase I am reminded off in times like this. After the terrible explosion in West Texas, I had a county commissioner from that area tell me: Being a Texan doesn't describe where you are from, it describes who your family is.  Today, our family is mourning. But I know Pastor McLean and all of my fellow Texans and all Americans really lift up this community in prayer, along with the families and friends of those we lost.

Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Separately, Madam President, as I have indicated, this is an important week for the American people. Earlier today, the Judiciary Committee voted to send Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Senate floor for full consideration. Later this week, he will be confirmed as the next Associate Justice of the U.Supreme For the past several weeks and through 20 grueling hours of questioning before the Judiciary Committee, Judge Gorsuch has proven to be one of the most qualified nominees to the Court in modern history.  Republicans in the Senate said we would give the American people a voice in who would select the next Supreme Court In a sense, we had a referendum of whether it would be a nominee selected by Donald Trump or by Hillary On November 8, we saw the outcome of that election. This week, that referendum will be answered when the country will have its ninth Justice on the Supreme  Unfortunately, our Democratic colleagues are doing their very best to decide that they should mount the first partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee in American history. This is truly unprecedented. I know sometimes people want to talk about 1968 and the Abe Fortas nomination, but not even then was there a partisan filibuster that successfully blocked the confirmation of a Supreme Court  What I am talking about is blocking the ability to have an up-or-down vote. I am not talking about how people vote on the confirmation vote. I am talking about allowing us to have a vote--that up-or-down vote--or denying it by virtue of the filibuster. I, for one, have been encouraged to see people from across the country speaking out and urging our colleagues to drop their obstruction and to allow such an up-or-down vote on an incredibly qualified, upstanding, and brilliant judge.  Editorials from all over the country have registered their opposition to the idea of a filibuster and have done so rather bluntly. The Chicago Tribune, for example, said: ``Neil Gorsuch earns his Supreme Court seat.'' The Boston Herald says: ``Shame on Senate Dems.'' The Boston Herald specifically said that those going along with the strategy were ``blindly partisan for whom any nomination made by President Trump would never be qualified.''  The Denver Post, in the home State of Judge Gorsuch, urged Senators to confirm Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court and specifically urged the senior Senator from Colorado, Senator Bennet, not to cooperate with this blind partisanship and this filibuster but rather to allow the judge an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor.  Their editorial title made that much clearer. They said: ``Michael Bennet should buck Democrats and speak up for Neil Gorsuch.''  The Billings Gazette in Montana had this to say: ``Democrats refuse to rise above petty partisan politics.''  The Richmond Times-Dispatch took the junior Senator from Virginia to task and said: His opposition to Judge Gorsuch, ``suggests he can't come up with a defensible reason to oppose the nomination.''  Finally in New Hampshire, the New Hampshire Union Leader editorial last week was titled: ``Confirm Gorsuch: Dems plan pointless filibuster.'' ``Pointless'' about sums it up. There is no doubt that Judge Gorsuch is qualified. He has received the highest rating from the American Bar Association, which reportedly interviewed 500 leading lawyers and practitioners in the country, and the ratings system of the American Bar Association has been called by many of our Senate Democratic colleagues the ``gold standard'' when it comes to confirmations.  Among the legal and local communities, Judge Gorsuch enjoys broad bipartisan support, but that seems to make no difference to our friends across the aisle who voted on a party-line vote not to send his nomination from the Judiciary Of course, their minority position lost when the majority of the committee voted today to send that nomination to the floor.  I can't help but think that they are in an unenviable position, torn by their desire to do what they know is the right thing when it comes to confirming a good judge, and, on the other hand, being attacked by their own party's political base, telling them that if they vote to confirm this judge, they are somehow going to suffer some political damage.  Of these newspapers I mentioned, not one of them endorsed Donald Trump for President--not one. But unlike some of our Senate colleagues, they are able to distinguish between President Trump and Judge Neil Gorsuch, instead of using Donald Trump as a proxy not to vote to confirm Neil  These newspapers are urging Senate Democrats to drop this pointless filibuster because they understand that it will not be President Trump we will be voting on next week. It is Judge Neil Now, after repeatedly moving the goalposts for this nominee, my Democratic friends are saying that he has to pass the ``traditional'' threshold of 60 votes. Well, that is a made-up standard.  Throughout our Nation's history, the Senate has not had a tradition of filibustering judges. It was a strategy cooked up by Senator Schumer, Laurence Tribe from Harvard Law School, and other liberal activists to try to block President George Bush's judges when he was President of the United So there is no 60-vote threshold in Senate tradition. Actually, there have only been four cloture votes for a Supreme Court nominee--only four--and none of them for a partisan filibuster that actually succeeded in blocking an up-or-down vote for a nominee.  One of the newspaper fact checks concluded with this. They said: ``There is no traditional 60-vote `standard' or `rule' for Supreme Court nominations, no matter how much or how often Democrats claim otherwise.'' This should be a time when the Senate should come together in a bipartisan fashion and do what it is supposed to do when we receive the nomination of such a highly qualified person.  Judge Gorsuch has won bipartisan approval. People across the country understand that, as do a number of independent Democrats here in the Senate, and they understand the dangerous path the minority leader is setting us and them on. Unfortunately, the Democratic leader wants to mount the first successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee in our history.  But I would point out that no Republican Senator in the Senate has ever voted to filibuster a Supreme Court nominee, including those nominated by Democratic As a matter of fact, Justice Clarence Thomas was confirmed with 52 votes. If the threshold were really 60, then he would not currently be serving on the Supreme Court of the United Even such polar opposites as Justice Scalia and Justice Ginsburg were confirmed by virtually unanimous votes because people understood that once the President was elected, that the President's choice should matter, and the Senate should not artificially try to lift up a 60-vote threshold in order to block, effectively, the will of the voters in choosing the president.  A few years ago, when we considered the nominations of Justice Sotomayor[[Page S2166]]and Justice Kagan, we gave both nominees a simple up-or-down vote. So our friends across the aisle have a simple but very important decision to make. They can listen to the extremist groups on the left that are urging them to resist at all costs or they can assert some of their independence.  As of today, several of our Democratic colleagues have done exactly that. I congratulate them. I am glad Senator Heitkamp, Senator Manchin, and Senator Donnelly have said they will assert their prerogative, as Senators, to allow an up-or-down vote for this nominee and actually vote for them.

132,CARDIN,proceeding_id,topic-id,581,"Madam President, I wish to express my opposition to 89 because it exempts certain vessels--actually one specific vessel called the Delta Queen--from current fire retardant construction standards and, according to the U.Coast Guard, represents ``an unacceptable degree of fire safety risk. . . . ''  Maritime history has numerous examples of catastrophic on-board fires followed by the passage--or attempted passage--of laws designed to improve safety and protect passengers and crew.  In response to the sinking of the RMS Titanic, in 1914, the International Maritime Organization, IMO, prescribed emergency equipment and safety procedures IMO-flagged ships were required to have in place.  The 1934 fire on the SS Morro Castle prompted the adoption of multiple Federal safety regulations, including the use of fire retardant construction materials.  A series of fires aboard international passenger ships in the early 1960s prompted the U.to enact the Safety of Life at Sea Act, SOLAS, which mandated that ``no passenger vessel of the United States shall be granted a certificate of inspection [. . .] unless the vessel is constructed of fire-retardant materials.''  Congress delayed the implementation of the SOLAS mandate first until 1968, then until 1970, then again until 1973, but only for U.passenger vessels operating on inland rivers.  In 1973, Congress again delayed the effect of the mandate, but this time EXPRESSLY for one ship--the Delta Queen--and only for one 5-year period ``while a new [overnight passenger] riverboat is being constructed.''  Despite the clear intent of Congress in 1973, the various owners of the Delta Queen successfully secured exemptions from SOLAS for the Delta Queen in 1986, 1991, and 1996.  Their attempts to seek a 10-year extension in 2007 and a 15-year extension in 2013 were unsuccessful, so they made another run in the 114th Congress and now in the 115th Congress with 89.  Current law requires passenger vessels with overnight accommodations for 50 or more passengers to be constructed of fire-retardant materials, unless an exemption is made, but in the case of the Delta Queen, the U.Coast Guard has consistently opposed legislation to provide the Delta Queen an exemption to remain in service as an overnight passenger cruise vessel.  A Coast Guard Special Inspection Report on the Delta Queen in 2008 found ``an unnecessary and unacceptable accumulation of combustible fire load.'' In a January 8, 2016, letter to Senator Bill Nelson, the Coast Guard's then-Assistant Secretary of Legislative Affairs wrote ``the Department of Homeland Security is resigned to oppose continuously any legislation that would provide any form of statutory relief for the steamer Delta Queen.''  89 is contrary to public safety. It is contrary to the Safety of Life at Sea Act regulations which have been in full force in the U.since 1966, and it is contrary to the guidance of the U.Coast  The Delta Queen is an old ship made of wood. The boilers are original and open to the wood superstructure. There are no structural boundaries to contain a fire and only one means of egress.  I understand that supporters of 89 are concerned about the historic preservation of this ship and the economic opportunities that operation of the ship could bring to its homeport.  We should first and foremost be concerned with the safety of the people who will work on the ship and vacation on the ship and that they can have the same opportunities and experiences on a ship that is compliant with the reasonable safety standards that have been in place in this country for more than 50 years.

I look forward to helping make sure he can receive a vote here on the Senate floor.  In the weeks since his nomination, I have spoken at length about his qualifications to serve on the Supreme I have recognized him as a conservative champion of religious liberty, a defender of the separation of powers, and a westerner who will bring some much needed geographic diversity and a regional perspective to the  During his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Judge Gorsuch showed the country what it means to be a judge.  Big or small, popular or unpopular, powerful or powerless, Judge Gorsuch promised to render judgments based on the facts of the case, nothing else. He also has a remarkable record of respectful cooperation with judges appointed by Presidents of both parties.  During his decade-long tenure on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Gorsuch participated in more than 2,700 appeals. These comprised some of the most difficult cases across six Of those cases, 97 percent of them were decided unanimously--97 percent.  Judge Gorsuch was in the majority 99 percent of the time. He was in the majority on those cases 99 percent of the time. This is a testament to Judge Gorsuch's ability to consider other points of view and to seek out consensus, where possible. To try to paint Judge Gorsuch as an ideologue simply doesn't work. Those are essential qualities for any prospective Supreme Court  Now that we have reported Judge Gorsuch out of committee as of today, I would like to say a few words on the obstacles that stand in the way of his being considered here on the Senate floor.  As we proceed with Judge Gorsuch's confirmation, I would like to explain my support for confirming him in light of what transpired in the waning months of the previous administration.  For nearly 230 years, Presidents have been making nominations to the Supreme According to the Congressional Research Service: ``From the appointment of the first Justices in 1789 through its consideration of Nominee Elena Kagan in 2010, the Senate has confirmed 124 Supreme Court nominations out of 160 received.''  I would like to reiterate that number. Out of 160 Supreme Court nominations in our Nation's history, 124 were confirmed.  The Congressional Research Service goes on to state: ``Of the 36 nominations which were not confirmed, 11 were rejected outright in roll-call votes by the Senate, while nearly all of the rest, in the face of substantial committee or Senate opposition to the nominee or the President, were withdrawn by the President, or were postponed, tabled, or never voted on by the Senate.''  The manner in which the Senate decides to provide its constitutional advice and consent on Presidential nominations has varied over the centuries[[Page S2167]]with respect to nominations. This includes decisions not to take up Supreme Court nominees.  As Jonathan Adler put it in his article in the George Mason Law Review:       Much as the Senate may reject a legislative proposal that      originated in the House of Representatives by voting it down,      killing it in committee, or simply refusing to take up the      measure, the Senate may withhold its consent by voting      against confirmation of a nominee, rejecting the nominee in      committee, or simply refusing to act.  Is refusing to act the preferred outcome? I can certainly see where some would say no, as would  However, the history of the Senate demonstrates that to do otherwise in similar circumstances, as we just experienced is, in fact, a rare exception.  To cite Adler's law review article again, he states: ``The last time a Supreme Court vacancy arose in the calendar year of a Presidential election and was filled prior to [the] election was in 1932.''  President Obama nominated Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in the heat of the 2016 Presidential election. When he was nominated, I understood the frustration of those on the other side of the aisle over the fate of that nomination.  I met Judge He is a good man and a good judge, but the decision by the majority not to take up Judge Garland's nomination was not inconsistent with a longstanding practice of filling Supreme Court vacancies after elections.  This brings us today to why I support confirming Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme There is no question about the appropriateness of confirming Supreme Court nominees during the first years of the President's term, let alone the first 3 months. In fact, there is absolutely no justification for filibustering a highly qualified Supreme Court nominee put forward by the President who was just elected. That is just unprecedented.  There was an attempt to use this tactic in 2006 with Justice Samuel Alito's nomination to the Supreme Court, but he garnered sufficient bipartisan support so that cloture was invoked.  Today, it appears that we will not enjoy that same rational support. My preference would be to change the behavior of Senators rather than change the rules of the But here we are, where a nominee who would have received unanimous or nearly unanimous support just a few years ago is about to be filibustered.  My question is this: If we can't confirm a judge like Judge Gorsuch under contemporary use of Senate rules, who can we confirm?  It looks as if we will move forward later this week and make the rest of the Executive Calendar subject to the same simple majority threshold. Again, a change in Senate rules is not my preferred outcome, but this rule change will simply make de jure what was de facto prior to 2003, when filibusters were virtually never used on the President's Executive  Now, I want to make clear my steadfast support to preserve the legislative filibuster. We need to distinguish between the President's Executive Calendar, which has traditionally never been filibustered or subject to filibuster, and the legislative filibuster, which is used frequently here to ensure that we work across the aisle.  The Framers of our Constitution had the wisdom to create a Senate with a strong minority to serve as a check on runaway power. If we were to eliminate the legislative filibuster, we would cease to be that check, and, indeed, the Senate would cease to be the  We have a qualified mainstream jurist before us. That is Judge I encourage all of my colleagues to give him fair consideration and to advance his nomination to an up-or-down vote.

144,JOHNSON,proceeding_id,topic-id,712,"Mr.President, I would like to use my remaining time to voice my strong support of Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Let me stress that Judge Gorsuch won my vote when I first heard his definition of the role of a judge. Let me quote:       It is the role of a judge to apply, not alter, the work of      the people's representatives. A judge who likes every outcome      he reaches is very likely a bad judge, stretching for results      he prefers rather than those the law demands.  That is the quintessential definition of the role of a judge. I met with Judge Gorsuch last Tuesday morning, and in that meeting he further reinforced my support. I asked Judge Gorsuch and voiced my concern that far too often we have seen judges evolve into superlegislators--judicial activists on the court. I asked the judge: How can I be assured that won't happen with you? To paraphrase his response to me, he said: Senator, I am going to follow the law; you will not like some of my decisions.  That was music to my ears. I realize there is a lot of bad law, and we have a judge who follows the law and applies it. Sometimes I am not going to like those decisions, but that is That is the role of a judge.  He went on to say: I am not itching to be anything other than a good judge. He further said that legislative power cannot be delegated. Judge Gorsuch gave me a great deal of confidence that he is well qualified and that he deserves to fill some pretty big shoes--Justice Scalia's seat on the Supreme  It is not just I who considers Judge Gorsuch well qualified. The ABA has given Judge Gorsuch their ``well qualified'' rating, which is the highest possible rating. Of course, Democratic Leader Schumer, in a Washington Post article from March 18, 2001, said: ``The ABA'S evaluation is the gold standard by which judicial candidates are judged.''  Vice President Biden, back in 1994, talking about the ABA rating system said:       I look at no other recommendation more closely. I value no      recommendation more highly.  So the ABA says Judge Gorsuch is highly qualified, and I agree. Judge Gorsuch also has bipartisan support. I am heartened by the fact that three of our Democratic colleagues in the Senate have already voiced their support for Judge Of course, President Obama's Solicitor General, Neal Katyal, also said:       Judge Gorsuch is one of the most thoughtful and brilliant      judges to have served our Nation over the last century. As a      judge, he has always put aside his personal views to serve      the rule of law. To boot, as those of us who have worked with      him can attest, he is a wonderfully decent and humane person.      I strongly support his nomination to the Supreme  Again, that is a quote from President Obama's Solicitor My final comment has to do with the fact that this is the will of the American people. In my lifetime, I really cannot remember when a Presidential election elevated the issue of Supreme Court nominations to as high a level as it was elevated in this election. As a matter of fact, this election, point blank, elevated this particular vacancy.  So many of my Republican colleagues said exactly what I said: It is so close to the election; so why don't we let the American people decide not only the direction of this country but the composition of the Supreme The American people spoke. The voters in my State of Wisconsin spoke. They voted for the 10 electoral votes in support of President Trump, and they voted to elect me to confirm President Trump's nominee to this Supreme Court vacancy.

146,GARDNER,proceeding_id,topic-id,2651,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague from Wisconsin for his remarks on Judge I look forward to this debate this week as we work to confirm Judge Gorsuch to the U.Supreme Court in a bipartisan fashion.  This evening, though, I come to the floor to talk about another very important issue that is happening in this country this week; that is, the U.S.-China relationship that will be highlighted this week as President Trump prepares to meet with President Xi for the first time later this week.  This summer presents a tremendous opportunity for President Trump to expressly state our hope for the relationship, while also elucidating the valid concerns and questions we have about[[Page S2170]]some of China's policies and its future directions.  I am also leading a bipartisan letter with Senator Schatz, and I hope my colleagues will join me in expressing our thoughts about this important relationship.  The U.S.-China relationship is the most consequential relationship in the world. We must get it right. Beijing must also get it right. So today I will address what I hope President Trump will focus on in his conversation with President Xi and also outline a legislative initiative that I am leading in Congress to strengthen our policies in the Asia-Pacific region.  I believe the most urgent challenge between our two nations is the coming nuclear crisis on the North Korean Last year alone, North Korea conducted two nuclear tests and a staggering 24 ballistic missile launches. Kim Jong Un is committed to developing his nuclear missile program with one goal in mind--to have a reliable capability to deliver a nuclear warhead to Seoul, Tokyo, and, most importantly, to the continental United  President Trump has said that the United States will not allow that to happen. I am encouraged by the President's resolve. However, the road to stopping Pyongyang undoubtedly lies through Beijing is the reason the regime acts so boldly and with relative few consequences.  China is the only country that holds the diplomatic and economic leverage necessary to put the real squeeze on the North Korean regime. So while the United States argues over strategic patience or measured resolve, China must go beyond mere articulation of concern and lay out a transparent path forward on how they will work to denuclearize North  For our part, President Trump must lay out a simple calculus for President Xi: The United States will deploy every economic, diplomatic, and, if necessary, military tool at our disposal to deter Pyongyang and to protect our allies. China has a responsibility globally to do the same. As part of our toolbox, the administration should tell China it will now significantly ramp up the sanctions track. Last Congress, I led the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act, which passed the Senate by a vote of 96 to 0.  This legislation was the first stand-alone legislation in Congress regarding North Korea to impose mandatory sanctions on the regime's proliferation activities, human rights violations, and malicious cyber behavior. The administration must fully enforce this legislation, including imposing secondary sanctions on any Chinese entities that are aiding  In addition, China must faithfully implement all United Nations Security Council resolutions with regard to North Korea, particularly resolutions 2270 and 2321, negotiated last year, which require China to drastically reduce coal imports from North China's record in this has been lackluster so far. China should stop being complicit in the labor abuses of Pyongyang and shut off avenues of cyber attack, as well, that are being perpetrated by North Korea through Chinese channels.  Two weeks ago, China's Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, called on the United States and South Korea to halt their annual joint military exercises in exchange for North Korea's suspending its missile and nuclear activities, a deal that the Trump administration rightfully rejected. We should let Beijing know that the United States will not negotiate with Pyongyang at the expense of the security of our allies.  Moreover, before any talks, we must demand that Pyongyang first meet the denuclearization commitments it had already agreed to and subsequently chose to discard. President Trump should unequivocally condemn the economic pressure exerted by Beijing on Seoul over the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, on South Korean territory. THAAD is a defensive system that in no way threatens China, and Beijing knows this.  Most importantly, President Trump should indicate to President Xi that a denuclearized Korean Peninsula is in both nation's interests. But to achieve this goal, Beijing must be made to choose whether it wants to work with the United States as a responsible leader to stop the madman in Pyongyang or bear and acknowledge the consequences of keeping him in power.  Another looming crisis in U.S.-China relations is the escalation of tension in the East and South China China's recent destabilizing activities and actions in the East China Sea and the South China Sea are contrary to international law, pose an increased risk of future conflict, and necessitate a strong U.and regional response.  Their actions seem at odds with their words. China has declared an illegitimate air defense identification zone in the East China Sea, has dramatically expanded its land reclamation activities in the South China Sea, and has clearly added a military element to it. Since 2013, according to the Department of Defense, China has reclaimed over 3,200 acres of artificial features in the South China  On July 12, 2016, an international tribunal in the Hague ruled that China violated the sovereignty of the Philippines with regard to maritime disputes between the two nations. Since 2015, China has also built facilities with potential military uses on the artificial islands, including three airstrips--two more than 10,000-feet long, and one nearly 9,000-feet long--hangers that can shelter jet fighters, harbors, anti-aircraft batteries, radars, and structures that could house surface-to-air missiles.  This last week, the Center for Strategic and International Studies Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative reported that major construction of military dual-use infrastructure on the ``Big 3''--Subi, Mischief, and Fiery Cross Reefs--is wrapping up, with naval, air, radar, and defensive facilities largely complete.  Beijing can now deploy military assets, according to AMTI, including combat aircraft and mobile missile launchers to the Spratly Islands at any time.  The United States must have consistent and assertive diplomatic engagement with China to reinforce that these rogue activities fall outside of accepted international norms. The U.defense posture in this region should remain exactly what Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter said at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore on May 30, 2015. I quote Secretary Carter:       The United States will fly, sail, and operate wherever      international law allows, as U.forces do all over the      world. America, alongside its allies and partners in the      regional architecture, will not be deterred from exercising      these rights--the rights of all nations.  A consistent, deliberate, and assertive policy to do just that is imperative for the United During the upcoming summit, I hope that President Trump can set an agenda for positive economic engagement with China and recognize that this is a two-way street. As the top two economies in the world, our nations are inextricably linked, and we must continue to build a trade partnership that benefits the United States, our companies, and U.exporters. However, this engagement also means ensuring that China plays fair.  First and foremost, China must stop its state-sponsored and state-endorsed theft of foreign intellectual property. According to a report by the Intellectual Property Commission, chaired by ADM Dennis Blair, the former U.Commander of the Pacific Command, and John Huntsman, the former Ambassador to China, the theft of U.intellectual property is estimated at over $300 billion annually, and China accounts for about 50 to 80 percent of that amount.  China must understand that this behavior with regard to the massive and well documented theft of foreign intellectual property is unacceptable and antithetical to international norms. China also needs significant improvement to its legal system and to further open its economy to foreign and private investment.  China must understand that new regulations that seek to discriminate against American companies, anti-market policies that favor state-owned enterprises, lack of transparency, and other policies that create an uneven playing field for the United States and our enterprises in China are not acceptable, and that those protectionist behaviors will only further isolate China or hurt their global competitiveness, if they are adopted globally, as they seek to engage further in the world's economy.[[Page S2171]]  While many American firms still look to China as a top priority to grow and succeed in the global marketplace, without tangible economic and legal reforms within China, I fear that these opportunities will be more limited in the future and seriously jeopardize the bilateral commercial relations between our two nations. But if Beijing changes course, the upside of these reforms for China and the United States can be enormous.  A pillar of any nation that seeks a prosperous future and a future with a strong relationship with the United States must be international freedoms. As President Kennedy once stated: ``The rights of every man are diminished when the rights of one man are threatened.''  President Trump should heed President Kennedy's wise words and raise China's deplorable human rights record with President Chinese authorities are intensifying human rights abuses and cracking down on civil society. According to the State Department's 2015 Human Rights Report on China: ``Repression and coercion markedly increased during the year against organizations and individuals involved in civil and political rights advocacy and public interest and ethnic minority issues.''  According to the State Department's 2015 International Religious Freedom Report on China: ``Over this past year, there continued to be reports that the government physically abused, detained, arrested, tortured, sentenced to prison, or harassed adherents of both registered and unregistered religious groups for activities related to their beliefs and practices.''  We simply cannot and will not accept this type of behavior from a nation that wants to be thought of as a genuine global partner of the United I believe that China's rise can only be peaceful and balanced with a vigorous U.presence in the Asia-Pacific region that is able to check Beijing's worst impulses.  Last May, while attending the Shangri-La Dialogue, I heard a tremendous amount of concern from the region's top leaders about U.presence in the Asia-Pacific region and our commitment to remaining engaged in this critical part of the world. The Trump administration is inheriting a flawed Asia rebalance policy from the previous administration, which was right in rhetoric but ultimately came up short in meaningful action. The new administration and the new Congress ushers in a new era of opportunities with regard to U.policy toward the Asia  But despite the political changes in Washington, U.policy imperatives will remain the same. The Asia-Pacific region has been and will be crucial and critical to U.economic and national security interests for generations to come. By 2050, experts estimate that Asia will account for over half of the global population and half of the world's gross domestic product.  We cannot ignore the fundamental fact that this region is critical for the U.economy to grow and to create jobs through export opportunities. Last week, I held a committee hearing with Ambassador Bob Gallucci, former Ambassador to South Korea, and Congressman Randy Forbes, from Virginia, who was the chairman of some key committees as they dealt with Asia and our naval forces.  In Congressman Forbes' testimony, he also expressed the importance of this region, the Asia Pacific, in these terms: In the coming decades, this is the region where the largest armies in the world will camp. This is the region where the most powerful navies in the world will gather. This is the region where over one-half of the world's commerce will take place and two-thirds will travel. This is the region where a maritime superhighway--transporting good or bad things--linking the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, Australia, Northeast Asia, and the United States begins. This is the region where five of America's seven defense treaties are located. This is the region where two superpowers will compete to determine which world order will prevail. This is the region where the seeds of conflict that could most engulf the world will probably be planted.  This is why I am pursuing legislation called the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, ARIA, a new approach that will put American interests first by reassuring our allies, deterring our adversaries, and securing U.leadership in the region for future generations.  The ARIA will pursue three broad goals.  First, it will strengthen U.security commitments to our allies and build partner capacity in the Asia Pacific to deter aggression, project power, and combat terrorism. To do so, the ARIA legislation will authorize funds to bolster U.military presence in the region, grow partner nation maritime capabilities to deter aggression in their territorial waters, and build new counterterrorism partner programs in Southeast Asia to combat the growing presence of ISIS and other terrorist organizations.  ARIA will also enshrine a policy of regularly enforcing U.freedom of navigation and overflight rights in the East and South China  We will reaffirm our longstanding treaty alliances with Australia, South Korea, and Japan, and call for building new regional security partnerships. We will unequivocally back our ally Taiwan, including authorizing new arms sales and providing for enhanced diplomatic contacts with  Second, ARIA will promote diplomatic engagement and securing U.market access in the Asia Pacific region as essential elements for the future growth of the U.economy and success of American businesses. To do so, ARIA will also require that the Trump administration find new and innovative ways to economically engage the region. We will require the U.Government to enhance our trade facilitation efforts and increase opportunities for U.businesses to find new export markets in the Asia U.S.-made exports to Asia will mean more good-paying American jobs at home, which is a great situation for this country.  Third, it will enshrine promotion of democracy, human rights, and transparency as key U.policy objectives in the Asia Pacific region, particularly in Southeast From Manila to Rangoon, we should advocate for principled policies that emphasize accountability and transparency as indispensable elements of building any security or economic partnerships with the United  To inform this initiative, I have met with numerous key stakeholders in Congress and the administration. I am also holding a series of hearings in my subcommittee, the first of which took place last week.  I look forward to working with the Congress and all of our colleagues as we work to advance this initiative. I welcome the input of my colleagues as well.  There is no doubt that the rise of China over the last 30-plus years has been remarkable. China has lifted 500 million people from poverty since Premier Deng Xiaoping began his economic reforms in 1979, and it is now the second largest economy in the world. In that time, our relationship with China has emerged as perhaps the world's most important bilateral relationship, both from an economic and security perspective.  I believe that a mature, productive, and peaceful relationship with Beijing is in the national security and economic interests of the United For both nations, the importance of this relationship can make a significant difference for the world.  While the United States can and should seek to engage China, we must do so with a clear vision of what we want from Beijing, not just over the next 4 years but also over the next 40 years. So it is my sincere hope that President Trump leads with this sense of strategy and purpose when he meets President Xi later this week.  I know my colleague from Ohio has joined us, so I again want to express my appreciation to my colleague from Ohio for his leadership on a number of issues, including the opiate epidemic that has struck so many of our communities and It is so terrifying.

In Denver, CO, or in Columbus, OH, we have through the mail system these poisons coming in, synthetic heroin coming through the mail from  We are told by law enforcement officials that most of these laboratories are in These are evil scientists in China who are making this incredibly potent, dangerous drug. It is 30 to 50 times more powerful than heroin. Three flakes of it can kill you. They are putting it into packages and sending it into our communities through the mail.  It is a topic that I hope comes up--in addition to the very important ones that my colleague has raised and we talked about in the hearing last week--which is: How do you get China to actually crack down on these laboratories? And how do you get them to schedule these drugs so that they are illegal in China, to ensure the inputs into the laboratories and the final drug itself?  By the way, the Chinese should have a strong interest in this because, I will guarantee you, there are people in China who are also becoming addicted to opioids because of this inexpensive, incredibly dangerous synthetic heroin that is being promoted by these Chinese scientists.  My hope is that this will be a successful summit and among the very important issues raised is this opioid issue, which is so important to our communities.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-03-pt1-PgS2169-4.txt

151,PORTMAN,proceeding_id,topic-id,618,"Mr.President, I want to talk briefly about a nomination that is coming before us this week. This is for Elaine Duke to be the Deputy Homeland Security  This is an incredibly important job. Some of you remember the Homeland Security Department was made up of about 23 different departments and agencies coming together. It is a huge management challenge. The key job of the Deputy Secretary is to try to manage all of that.  We are very fortunate that Elaine Duke is willing to step forward and take on this responsibility. My hope is that we will have a bipartisan vote here on the floor of the Senate for her confirmation and that we do it quickly this week because they need her there.  She came before our Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs last month. We had a very productive hearing. I had the honor of introducing her to the committee because she has Ohio roots. We are very proud of those Ohio roots.  She has had a long, distinguished career all across the country in the Federal Government, but she still calls Ohio home, and much of her family continues to reside in Her dad, Frank Costanzo, is a first-generation American who still lives in Cleveland, I have also known her uncle, Dominick Costanzo, for over 25 years. He is a friend and a neighbor. Boy, he is very proud of his niece, as is her whole family.  This family has instilled in her a midwestern work ethic that you see in the great work she has done for the Federal Government over the past 28 years. She has worked as a senior member of various administrations. We are really fortunate that she is willing to now continue to serve.  She started her career as a GS-7 contract specialist for the U.Air Over the next 28 years, she assumed bigger and bigger responsibilities in the Air Force, the Navy, the Federal Railroad Administration, the Smithsonian, and finally, the Department of Homeland  In 2008, she was confirmed unanimously by this Senate to serve as the Under Secretary for Management at In this latest role, she, of course, was a key member of the DHS leadership team for both Secretary Chertoff and Secretary Napolitano, and they strongly support her.  She has earned a reputation for being an expert on issues of contracting, on acquisitions, on procurement, on property management, on organizational change, and on human resources. All of these, as I said earlier, are key issues right now at the Department of Homeland Security, so she will help it to be managed better, which will protect all of us.  Serving in these administrations--both Republican and Democrat--she did earn the respect of folks from both sides of the aisle. I find it interesting that all five previously confirmed DHS Deputy Secretaries have unanimously and strongly recommended her confirmation--all five of the previously confirmed ones. They said in their letter:       Elaine is extraordinarily well-qualified to serve in the      position for which she has now been nominated. . . . Elaine      knows She has been a senior leader at DHS under two      presidents. She sets an unwavering standard of excellence for      all who consider themselves committed to public service.  I look forward to having this vote. I hope we will have resounding support on a bipartisan basis for the nomination.  Secretary Kelly is doing a good job. General Kelly has an incredibly distinguished career. We are fortunate that he has stepped up as Secretary also. He needs her. He needs his deputy in place to help him run the Department, and the men and women serving in DHS today need her on the job.

153,COLLINS,proceeding_id,topic-id,835,"Mr.President, I wish to speak in support of the Main Street Fairness Act, which will help to create tax parity for passthrough companies, the significant majority of which are small businesses. I was very pleased to be joined by my friend and colleague from Florida, Senator Nelson, in introducing this bipartisan bill.[[Page S2173]]  Small businesses are our Nation's job creators. According to the Small Business Administration, small businesses employ more than half of all workers and have generated two-out-of-three net new jobs since the 1970s.  Small businesses also make an outsized contribution to our Nation's economy, generating half of our Nation's GDP, 54 percent of all U.sales, 41 percent of private sector payroll, and one-third of our Nation's export value. Their success is critical to the health of our economy.  Unfortunately, our Nation's small businesses face a higher tax burden that affects their ability to compete with large firms in the marketplace. In fact, a recent survey by the National Federation of Independent Business, NFIB, found that concerns about Federal taxes on business income ranked third on the list of the top 10 problems facing small businesses.  Nearly all of our Nation's small businesses are organized as passthroughs, meaning that their profits are passed on to their owners and reported on individual income tax returns. This means that small business income is subject to taxation at individual rates, which can be as high as 39.6 percent at the Federal level and can exceed 50 percent in some If we want our small businesses to grow and create jobs, we must reduce these high marginal rates.  I believe Congress should undertake comprehensive tax reform to make our Tax Code simpler, fairer, and more progrowth. As we do so, we must make sure American businesses of every size are given the opportunity to compete. Aligning the tax rate for passthroughs with our corporate tax rate will ensure small businesses are not left behind. That is why Senator Nelson and I introduced the Main Street Fairness Act, which will link the tax rates of passthrough entities and large corporations, to ensure that small businesses never pay a higher tax rate than large companies.  This simple change will help make sure that small businesses remain healthy and strong, so they can continue to serve as our Nation's job creators, as they have for so many years. I would note that the Main Street Fairness Act has been endorsed by the NFIB, the leading voice for America's small businesses, and I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting it.  I ask unanimous consent to have a letter of endorsement from the NFIB printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                            National Federation of                                         Independent Business,                                    Washington, DC, April 3, 2017.

The vast majority of small businesses are organized as      pass-through entities, which pay tax on business income at      the individual tax rates, which are currently as high as 39.6      percent, and not at the corporate tax rate, which is      currently as high as 35 percent. Such entities include any      company organized as a sole proprietorship, partnership, LLC,      or S-The Main Street Fairness Act would ensure      that those pass-through businesses never pay a higher tax      rate than businesses organized as C-Corporations, and      immediately reduce the tax rate on pass-through businesses      currently paying more than 35 percent.       Small businesses are the major source of growth and job      creation in our economy. In fact, according to the Small      Business Administration (SBA), small businesses account for      64 percent of the net new private sector jobs created in      America and make up 99.7 percent of U.employer firms. The      high tax burden currently facing small businesses holds back      investments, growth, hiring, and entrepreneurship. One in      five small businesses struggles with cash-flow, which is      needed to not only run their businesses but also support      their families. Specifically, after-tax income is an      especially important source of capital for small businesses.      High tax rates mean less money that small business owners      have to reinvest back into their business.       Because of this, small businesses strongly support tax      reform that simplifies the tax code, lowers tax rates on      businesses, and promotes economic growth. The Main Street      Fairness Act will help ensure that all businesses, regardless      of how they organize, enjoy the benefits of any reduction in      tax rates that would be included in tax reform. We appreciate      your continued leadership on this key issue and look forward      to working with you as Congress considers tax reform.

154,NELSON,proceeding_id,topic-id,457,"Mr.President, today I want to join my friend Susan Collins and talk about why I support the Main Street Fairness I am glad to partner on this bill with the Senator from  The bill does one simple thing: It ensures small businesses don't have to pay higher taxes than the largest corporations. This is the type of common sense that we need more of in  There are 2.3 million small businesses in Florida, employing around 43.2 percent of the State's workforce. They are the primary engine of job growth in the country, and are a proven means for economic mobility.  Under most circumstances, small businesses are subject to the same rules as large corporations but are treated differently under the Tax They already have a hard enough time competing with large multinational corporations, which can hire an endless stream of high-priced tax lawyers to shift their income abroad and avoid U.taxes.  We should be doing all we can to put small businesses on a more level playing field. Part of that starts with this bill, but it doesn't end here. We need to do comprehensive tax reform.  This bill should be part of that conversation, as one way we could help small businesses. It is not the only way, and I am certainly open to other ideas, but we need to have a serious talk about how we are going to freshen up the Tax Code and help the economy grow.  I know a lot of my colleagues have different ideas about what tax reform should look like, but I think we should all be able to agree that it needs to be real reform, not just a temporary tax cut. It needs to support a technology-driven economy and help us transition to a greener, fairer economy--with a lot less disparity.  Tax reform should also generate enough added revenue to pay for the infrastructure we desperately need. That includes the crumbling roads and bridges that threaten the safety of millions of Americans and are a tax on small businesses. We also need to invest in our water infrastructure, energy infrastructure, ports, railways, public schools, and affordable housing infrastructure.  At the same time, tax reform needs to be deficit neutral. You might ask, how are we going to pay for all this? Well, we can start by getting rid of outdated special interest tax breaks that are no longer needed or don't make sense in the 21st century.  We can also eliminate tax loopholes that allow companies to shift profits abroad and lead to corporate inversions.  This bill, the Main Street Fairness Act, is a good start, but it shouldn't end here. We need to have a serious, deliberative effort to develop a bipartisan tax reform package.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-03-pt1-PgS2172-3.txt

158,WYDEN,proceeding_id,topic-id,813,"Mr.President, today I wish to commemorate the retirement of my friend Wayne  Wayne is retiring as my central Oregon field representative after more than two decades of outstanding service to our State--and more specifically serving at one point or another the residents of Baker, Crook, Deschutes, Gilliam, Grant, Harney, Hood River, Jefferson, Klamath, Lake, Malheur, Morrow, Sherman, Umatilla, Union, Wallowa, Wheeler, and Wasco  Suffice to say, Wayne knows everyone, and most of those folks could spend hours recounting their own tales of this quintessential public servant.  Simply put, he will be deeply missed.  But before Wayne takes his well-deserved retirement to his native New England--where he can be nearer to family and maintain closer supervision of his beloved Boston Red Sox and New England Patriots--I want to share my personal appreciation for this exemplary public servant, all-around good guy, and wonderfully avuncular curmudgeon.[[Page S2174]]  Wayne can forever lay claim to a significant piece of Oregon history. He opened Oregon's first Senate field office east of the Cascades shortly after I first took office in 1996.  Wayne opened and ran my eastern Oregon office in La Grande before moving to  In his service to Oregonians, he has put more miles than anybody I know on Oregon roads, at all hours, in all kinds of weather, to towns where there often are more cows than people.  Wayne's fierce sense of loyalty and commitment to public service has driven him to cover all the ground he has over the years from Wasco to Wagontire, Ontario to Olene, Joseph to John Day, Bend to Burns, Madras to Mitchell, and all points in between.  That loyalty extends to the rural communities he serves and the Oregonians in those communities who might not otherwise have a voice.  Wayne always keeps the door open for cattlemen, farmers, and countless others who often feel the government is removed from their struggles.  It is Wayne's ability to reach out and make connections with all of those folks that played such a large part in ensuring ``every nook and cranny'' in Oregon gets a voice.  Wayne is not just a champion in general for rural Oregon communities. He has also proven to be an able advocate for creating opportunities for rural women that allows them to bring their voices into statewide discussions.  Let me tell a couple of anecdotes about Wayne to provide a glimpse into this wonderful character--and all that he has meant to  For my colleagues who have not been to central and eastern Oregon, I would only note that the distances between towns can be great, but Wayne never let those long drives be a roadblock.  In fact, his goal was to be anywhere and everywhere. He achieved that goal by--I believe in his words--making sure that, if anybody was so much as dedicating a new soda machine, he would be there to put in the first dollar.  Just as great at times as the challenges of distance in his area are the weather challenges. Again, Wayne never let that be a roadblock.  I remember well flying into rural Condon, OR, for a townhall in the snow, and who should I see with the local police chief sweeping the runway of snow?  It has been said by some that there is an unbridgeable urban-rural divide in I know from more than 800 townhalls in every part of Oregon, that is untrue.  In fact, I have come to use the term ``the Oregon way'' to describe how it is in our State's DNA to put aside partisanship in favor of civil conversations to find the best solutions.  Among the many tributes in recent days in Oregon to my friend, I was struck by something I read about Wayne that captures how he ``lived and breathed'' the Oregon way.  On Wayne's Facebook page recently, a Republican posted this powerful praise: ``Had lunch today with a good friend. Politically, Wayne and I are polar opposites. He is a Democrat, an officer with the Oregon Democratic Party and staff member with Senator Wyden, and I have served on the Executive Committee of the Oregon Republican Party, as well as County Central Committee Over the years, we have had some great discussions, even disagreements about some very important issues, but we have handled our disagreements respectfully and remained friends. Wayne has announced his retirement and is also leaving our great state to move back east so he can be near family. The Oregon Democrats, and Senator Wyden are losing a tremendous asset, and a great leader of their Party.''  Oregon truly is losing a tremendous asset, and so am  I will miss Wayne tremendously, but I take heart that his work will live on in the issues he has resolved for Oregon and the relationships he has deepened among  As Wayne begins his well-earned retirement, he has my eternal gratitude, and he has Oregon's.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-03-pt1-PgS2173.txt
167,REED,proceeding_id,topic-id,428,"Mr.President, today I am reintroducing, along with Senator Grassley, the Government Settlement Transparency and Reform This bill closes a loophole in the Tax Code that allows corporations to claim tax writeoffs for payments made at the direction of the government to settle investigations into illegal and abusive corporate behavior.  Corporations accused of illegal activity routinely settle out of court with government agencies because it allows all parties to avoid the time, expense, and uncertainty of going to trial. While there is nothing wrong with settlements that correct wrongful corporate practices and compensate for the resulting harm caused by a corporation, the Tax Code often permits offending companies to claim a business tax deduction for any portion of a settlement that is not paid directly to the government as a penalty or fine for a violation of the law. The Tax Code on this point is vague, and big businesses exploit this by characterizing settlement penalties as tax-deductible business expenses.  Illegal corporate behavior is not an ordinary business activity, and it shouldn't be subsidized by taxpayers. Yet, according to a 2015 study by U.Public Interest Research Group, PIRG, corporate settlements over a single 3-year period totaled nearly $80 billion, and corporations could claim business deductions for at least $48 billion of that amount. Moreover, there is no consistent, transparent way to track how these settlements can and will be treated by businesses for tax purposes.  The Reed-Grassley bill addresses these problems by amending the Tax[[Page S2177]]Code to require the government and the settling party to reach clear agreements on how settlement payments should be treated for tax purposes. It also clarifies which settlement payments are punitive and therefore nondeductible. It increases transparency by requiring the government to file a return at the time of settlement that accurately states the tax treatment of amounts to be paid by offending businesses. Last Congress, it was estimated that this legislation would raise $218 million in revenue over a ten-year budget window.  When a major corporate scandal breaks national news, Rhode Islanders and all Americans deserve to know that Federal regulators are protecting their interests by handing down punishments that deter future illegal and abusive business practices. That deterrent effect is undermined if corporations can claim a deduction for any penalty and build the cost of breaking the law into their business models.  I want to thank Senator Grassley for working with me again on this legislation and for being a champion for reform in this area. I urge our colleagues to join us by cosponsoring this legislation and seeking its passage.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-03-pt1-PgS2176.txt

178,QUIGLEY,proceeding_id,topic-id,724,"Mr.Speaker, there has been a lot going on around here lately. We have been conducting investigations, holding hearings, and some of us have even tried and failed to fundamentally change the way we provide health care in this country.  It has been easy to get distracted by the dozens of different headlines and breaking news stories we see each week. But no matter what else is going on here in Washington, one thing continues unabated: each day, the United States, like every other country on Earth, continues to release tons and tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and now we are starting to see the effects.  Over the last couple of years, the U.has joined 20 other countries from around the world in growing its economy while reducing its annual emissions into the atmosphere. This is not a small feat, and decoupling emissions from growth is the first step toward the substantive action needed to address the growing climate crisis. But I find this concept of reducing emissions can sometimes be a little misleading.  In the last few years, the U.has reduced the rate that it emits greenhouse gases. But even if we are doing it more slowly, we are still emitting harmful pollution into our air.  Imagine, Mr.Speaker, standing at the edge of an empty swimming pool with a garden hose. For a while, water was spewing out of that hose at a torrent; and each year, the volume got greater and greater. Now, the water is still running, but we have begun to turn the speed down. However, even if we manage to slow the rate of water going in, the pool still has more water than when we started and is still filling up.  Our atmosphere is that pool. For nearly 100 years, it has been filling up with greenhouse gases. And they don't just go away when the calendar flips. Reducing the annual emissions is vital, but we can't lose track of all the gases that have been accumulated year after year.  If we are going to hit the international goal of limiting climate warming to 2 degrees Celsius, we need to start acting now. Yet, this august body has been behind the curve on this issue for years.  Our colleagues seem content to ignore the climate crisis, to hold hearings with discredited, crank pseudoscientists bought and paid for by corporate interests, or to deny the value of scientific thinking altogether, an approach that is all too familiar given the post-research, post-intelligence, post-truth mindset that we have seen from this administration. They have adopted a ``hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil'' approach to climate change, hoping they can ignore it until it goes away. Sadly, that is not the way the world works.  We can't unfill the pool by pretending there is no such thing as water. This form of denial has been evolving over time. First, we heard that there was no way that climate is changing at all.  Now that the changes in the atmosphere are beyond doubt, we are starting to hear that climate is changing but there is nothing we can do about it. In addition to being flat out false, that type of thinking is unbecoming of a nation that put the first man on the Moon, pioneered instantaneous communication, and has led the world in the fight against countless deadly diseases.  Last month, we heard the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency question the very fundamentals of atmospheric science, a particularly dismaying thing from the man charged with leading the fight against climate change. This type of willful scientific ignorance has serious consequences. It will cost lives.  Children will be exposed to harmful, asthma-inducing pollution because we didn't act fast enough to clean our air. They will die because crops that could be counted on for generations will no longer grow. They will be forced from their homes because melting polar ice is driving sea levels higher and higher.  We cannot deny these impacts. We cannot continue to hear no evil and see no evil when these changes are happening all around us, resulting in devastating consequences that affect every aspect of our life.[[Page H2634]]  Instead, the time has come to speak up and speak loudly like our lives and the world depend on it, as it truly does.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgH2633-5.txt
180,COHEN,proceeding_id,topic-id,671,"Mr.Speaker, this is the 49th anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King,  King, Jr., was, sadly, struck down in Memphis, Tennessee, by an aberrant individual who wanted to kill him and chased him all over the country. It so happened that Memphis was the spot that he had that final opportunity.  In Memphis, there will be activities today celebrating the life of King and commitments to community service in his spirit.  Ironically, today, while it is the 49th anniversary of his assassination, it is also the 50th anniversary of his greatest speech, in my opinion. Not the ``I've Been to the Mountaintop'' speech that he made the night before in Memphis, the great speech where he said: I have been to the mountaintop, and I may not get there with you; but I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land.  His greatest speech, in my opinion, was the speech at the Riverside Church in New York, in Manhattan, on April 4 of 1967, when he spoke of the three isms that bother this country and are the enemies of this country: militarism, materialism, and racism.  The speech was called ``Beyond Vietnam.'' A prescient King saw the need to get out of Vietnam, to make a unilateral step, cease the bombing, save lives. He was indeed right about that. We should have gotten out of Vietnam then, but we didn't.  It was months later that Richard Nixon interfered with the peace process for political reasons and got word to Vietnam not to participate; that they might get a better deal from Nixon; and that stopped President Johnson from possibly concluding the war in 1968.  The racism, the militarism, and the materialism are still pervasive. King wouldn't like what he sees today. We have a budget giving 56 or $57 billion extra to the military and cutting away from diplomacy efforts, foreign aid efforts that militate against war. And it takes away from funding for people, African Americans and poor people in America, who need government assistance.  That is part of what King was concerned about in this ``Beyond Vietnam'' speech. And here it is 50 years later and we still suffer with the same tight budget and the same misguided priorities.  We have an Attorney General who is looking at ending consent decrees on police violence against African Americans in Baltimore, Maryland, and also in Ferguson, a suburb of Louis,  We are going the wrong direction, and it is sad that one of our greatest prophets and one of our greatest leaders told us about it 50 years ago.  Have we learned.  The disparity in wealth is greater than ever in this country. The rich are getting richer and richer and richer. It is incomprehensible that there are billionaires--and there are lots of them out there--and that the tax breaks that we offer in the Tax Code are going to give millionaires and billionaires hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars of tax breaks at the expense of[[Page H2635]]government programs for people who don't have enough.  There is no consideration of a minimum wage.

We need to reflect on King's Riverside speech and understand that it is still a guide for us, and we need to look at a more understanding budget that cares about people first and not the military industrial complex that President Eisenhower warned us about; that we try to avoid wars through diplomacy and foreign aid and goodwill; and that we support our people with WIC programs and LIHEAP programs and Meals on Wheels and health care and public education; and that we try to give tax breaks to the middle class--large tax breaks, and not tax breaks to those who already have enough.

They call into question his ability to serve impartially in the interests of the American people. Both he and his administration remain closely linked to private companies and foreign entities whose interests are often in direct opposition to those of the United  For example, we are well aware of the increasing boldness of the Chinese regime and its efforts to extend their economic and military influence. Despite portraying China publicly as a threat to economic growth of the United States, the President has selected Goldman Sachs' executive, Gary Cohn, to be his director of the National Economic That is about one of seven individuals from Goldman Sachs who have been brought into this administration. Mr.Cohn has just sold his $16 million holding in a Chinese bank. This same state-owned Chinese bank also happens to be the largest tenant in Trump Tower in Isn't that a coincidence?  Wilbur Ross, President Trump's choice for Commerce Secretary, presents similar conflicts of interest. As a man who will play a major role in shaping U.trade policy, Mr.Ross continues to hold a stake worth tens of millions of dollars in the international shipping company, Diamond S Shipping Group, a company that not only operates ships that fly the Chinese flag, but those ships also call on ports in countries, such as Iran and Sudan, that are under U.sanctions for being state sponsors of terrorism.  We also know that The Trump Organization was recently awarded sole rights to the President's name for products sold in He had waited 10 years to get those rights. The case was settled just mere days after President Trump's phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, when the President reversed his prior stance on Chinese unification and gave a full-throated endorsement to what he termed ``One China'' policy. That was a reversal from what he had done just after the election.  Meanwhile, according to The New York Times, President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, was recently negotiating a real estate deal worth hundreds of millions of dollars with a Chinese company closely tied to its government. And while it has been reported that the deal was called off, the fact that Mr.Kushner is continuing to negotiate private real estate deals while serving as a White House employee is deeply troubling.  It was announced last week that Ivanka Trump will now be joining her husband in the White House as an adviser to the President with top secret security clearance. While she has stepped down from her former role at her fashion licensing company that uses the Trump name, her decision to transfer her brand's assets into a trust run by her own brother-in-law--and her arrangement to continue to receive fixed payments from the company--is a matter of serious concern given her role in the administration.  The ever-growing list of valid concerns about the Trump administration's conflicting entanglements are taking place at the same time that the President is proposing $18 billion in reductions for the 2017 appropriations process--while he himself, his daughter, son-in-law, and his Cabinet members continue to benefit off the American taxpayer.  While the President spends millions of tax dollars on securing his residences in New York and in Florida and flying to his so-called southern White House almost every weekend, he is slashing to zero the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative--an absolutely critical program that directly impacts my district and many others responsible for preserving the world's largest body of fresh water from serious and growing environmental threats. What is right about that?  President Trump also wants to eliminate TIGER grants, a highly successful transportation program that provides[[Page H2636]]funding for communities across America with backlogged infrastructure projects that create jobs and produce robust economic benefits. Everyone agrees on that.  He has also called for a nearly $3 billion draconian reduction to foreign operations endangering our national security. We are the leader of the free world the last time I looked, and, meanwhile, he and his family spend millions of American taxpayer dollars on travel and security costs for themselves.  With an investigation into President Trump's possible entanglements with Putin's Russia already underway, and members of the President's family and administration engaging in increasingly brazen conflicts of interest, this Congress should pass legislation to prevent these increasingly apparent conflicts of interest from endangering our Nation and the American people. It is only a matter of time before his conflicts of interest harm our country.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

186,LEE,proceeding_id,topic-id,744,"Mr.Speaker, each year during Women's History Month, we pause to commemorate the contributions women have made to this country, but we should really commemorate women every day. So I am here today in April to amplify the contributions of women of color, particularly African-American women. Far too often, the blood, sweat, and tears sown by women of color goes unrecognized. So many are truly hidden figures.  Mr.Speaker, this morning, I want to honor the sacrifices African-American women made for this country during World War Sadly, to this day, their sacrifices have gone unacknowledged, and as the daughter of a World War II veteran and a Korean veteran, I am honored to shed light on a few of the tremendous contributions of African-American women during World War I want to rise to highlight the courageous efforts of more than 800 African-American women from the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, which was the first all-women, all-Black unit deployed in World War  The 6888th, its nickname ``Six Triple Eight'', was an all-women, all-Black unit that helped boost morale among Allied troops by working through major mail backlogs in Europe during World War                              {time}  1030  To sort through the major backlog of mail in Europe, the women were divided into three subunits that allowed them to run the postal service 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, processing 65,000 pieces of mail per 8-hour shift.  The battalion endured the harsh winter of Europe, dimly lit rooms, and rat-infested headquarters to carry out their mission. Adding insult to injury, these courageous women also faced segregation and discrimination from the very country they were working to defend. The women were forced to run their own mess halls, hair salon, refreshment bar, and other facilities because of segregationist Department of Defense policies.  Yet despite the harsh conditions of war and unequal treatment, the women of the 6888th Battalion cleared a 6-month backlog of mail in just 3 months while posted in In France, they cleared a 3-year mail backlog in just 6 months. Thanks to their tireless efforts, United States soldiers were finally able to receive lost letters from loved ones during the war.  The courage exhibited by the 6888th proved once again that senseless acts of cruelty are no match for the will and determination of African-American women.  But in July 1945, tragedy struck Private First Class Mary Barlow, Private First Class Mary Bankston, and Sergeant Dolores Browne, who lost their lives in a Jeep accident. Recognizing their fellow comrades' sacrifices, the women of the 6888th pooled their personal resources to properly bury these women. These women who tragically lost their lives while serving in Europe are buried at the Normandy American Cemetery, which I was privileged to visit a couple of years ago.  Their contributions and sacrifices deserve to be celebrated. These Black women proudly sacrificed their lives for a country that did not value them due to racial discrimination and bigotry. So it is with great pride that I speak their names today, hoping that more people will come to acknowledge their sacrifice and the sacrifices of their fellow sisters during World War  I want to thank our Military Construction, Veteran Affairs Appropriations Chair Congressman Charlie Dent, then-Ranking Member Sanford Bishop, as well as our full committee Chair Rogers and Ranking Member Lowey for their support in the Appropriations Committee to help us uncover this great history, and also the American Battle Monuments  These great sheroes need to be brought to the attention of the American people so that they can properly be recognized for their sacrifices and their legacies.  It is my hope that the United States will no longer be shy about recognizing the value, accomplishments, and sacrifices of Black women in history. I am hopeful that we will come to know the many nameless sheroes of the Black community. These hidden figures have fought many battles, have sacrificed so much, and have paved the way for Black women to move forward in spite of the barriers which we are still trying to break.  On today, Equal Pay Day, I am reminded that African-American women earn 63 cents on the dollar. We are still at the bottom of the economic ladder. I urge my colleagues to fight for pay[[Page H2637]]equality and gender equality as we continue to honor the lives and legacies of so many African-American women who truly are hidden figures but who have done so much to make this a better country.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgH2636-2.txt
188,WAGNER,proceeding_id,topic-id,359,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in honor of life and in respect for the conscience rights of all citizens of this free  I was proud to preside over the floor of the U.House of Representatives a few short weeks ago as we voted in favor of No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act to strike down an Obama administration policy that forces Americans to fund abortion providers.  We also passed H.43, which is another step closer to restoring the rights of States to decide how to distribute title X funding for women's health care. The measures ensure that States are not forced to fund abortion providers like Planned  Based on its own annual report, Planned Parenthood performs the most abortions in the United It commits more than 320,000 abortions every year, 887 each day. Mr.Speaker, that is one abortion every 97 seconds. Three unborn children's lives will be taken by Planned Parenthood as I stand here this morning.  Recently, Planned Parenthood has begun attacking me as a supposed enemy of women's health care. Nothing could be further from the truth. All Missourians deserve quality health care, which is one reason I oppose taxpayer funding of Planned This organization does not provide general women's health or mammogram screenings. That is a fallacy.  In the State of Missouri, there are 12 Planned Parenthood facilities scattered across our 114 counties. However, Mr.Speaker, we are grateful to have 588 healthcare clinics that prioritize women's health and wellness. That is 49 healthcare clinics for every 1 Planned Parenthood health center. So instead of driving 100 miles or more to a Planned Parenthood in Missouri, women can receive the quality care they need within their own communities.  Last Congress, I voted to increase funding to those very clinics by hundreds of millions of dollars. Congress has a sincere duty to not only defund big abortion but to radically change the conversation around life issues.  Members of Congress and this administration understand that life is beautiful, that children are a blessing, that abortion is not healthcare. It kills children, and it hurts women.  Rest assured that our work to protect life, all life, has only just begun.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgH2636.txt
191,YODER,proceeding_id,topic-id,774,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the life and legacy of a Kansas pioneer woman. Last week I joined my family in Yoder, Kansas, to celebrate the life and legacy of my grandma, Edna Yoder, who recently passed at the age of 105 years old.  I was very close to my grandma, as many of us are to our grandparents. She was a sweet and kind woman who could tell a good story, never met a stranger, and had an infectious laugh. I spent much of my childhood listening to her hum church hymns while cooking a country meal or quilting another masterpiece.  As one of 14 children, born in 1911, she grew up in another era, attending school in a one-room schoolhouse, a time without cell phones or television or even electricity and the other modern conveniences we take for granted today. Yet somehow she survived and had a remarkable life. She saw hard times from the Dust Bowl to the Great Depression to countless world events over the past century.  When she was born, women didn't have the right to vote in America; but even well past turning 100 years old, she was voting in local elections, even for President of the United She saw a lot of Presidents come and go--19, as a matter of fact.  She saw America progress from a country really still recovering from the deep wounds of our Civil War to the world's most indispensable, vital, and vibrant nation. She saw us defeat Hitler in Nazi She saw us bring freedom and peace around the globe to men, women, and children who had never experienced it before.  She was born less than 10 years after Orville and Wilbur Wright took off on their first flight at Kitty Hawk, and yet she would watch Neil Armstrong set foot on the Moon while she was just in her fifties. But as the world changed around her, she quietly lived her entire life near Yoder, Kansas, where she raised her children on the same farm that I grew up on.  She worked tirelessly on that farm, milking cows at dawn and bringing in the Kansas wheat harvest in the hot sun. She didn't ask for much: food on the table, a roof over her head, and a better life for her children and grandchildren.  Mr.Speaker, we like to call them the Greatest She was a living embodiment of the values that help make America the greatest country in the world. She was guided every day by her faith in God, and she was truly blessed with more than a century of good health and good spirits in return. She loved her family and deeply believed in hard work and self-determination.  She and her husband, Orie, were married for 49 years, and together they raised their four children and nine grandchildren, and they even watched one of them make it all the way from that farm in Yoder, Kansas, to the United States House of Representatives here in Washington, D.Family always came first for her.  In her later years, she passed the time reading her Bible, playing in the bell choir, and, of course, quilting and playing lots of games. In fact, the last time I saw her recently, we played bingo together, and we wiped out the competition at her retirement home one last time. She was sharp into her final hours.  She was born into a home that did not have a telephone, but in her final days, we were also able to communicate from Kansas to Washington via FaceTime so I would have a chance to speak with her.  We recently had her services at the Yoder Mennonite Church, built just[[Page H2638]]after she born. This was the church she was raised in, was baptized in, was married in, and the church in which we laid her to eternal rest.  From 1911 to 2017, what a ride, what a remarkable life and unforgettable woman. Through it all, she stayed true to what was important to her and what makes America such a strong nation: her faith, her family, and her Kansas prairie values.  Grandma, we were so blessed to have so many years with you. You lived an amazing 105 years. I think if we look closely and we listen closely, you gave us a roadmap for a long and happy life. As you pass on to eternal life, please know that you are an inspiration to all of us every day. May you rest in peace,  Mr.Speaker, may you and my colleagues in this body join me in keeping her in your prayers.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgH2637-3.txt

The VA's Gordian knot is its repeated manipulation of key data and overall lack of accountability.

231,BUCK,proceeding_id,topic-id,685,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation. Americans have always been a people known for taking ownership. We take ownership of our lives and livelihoods, working hard to provide for our families. We take ownership in our communities, setting standards of conduct. We take ownership in all our political process, voting for the right candidates. We have even taken ownership in our world, fighting evil actors and regimes to maintain peace.                              {time}  1230  H.1343, the bill we are discussing today, allows employees to take ownership in their companies. This is the American way.  Under SEC rule 701, private companies can offer their own securities to employees, enabling those employees to take a stake in the company. This is a great deal for both businessowners and employees. I doubt either side of the aisle would disagree.  Rule 701 allows employers to better recruit talented employees and pay them without having to borrow money or sell securities. For some companies, especially younger ones, compensating employees through equity is vital for survival.  These younger companies need the top talent but often can't pay the top salaries. Rule 701 allows them to offer potential recruits a tradeoff: accept a lower salary now for more equity in the company later.  By giving the employees a stake in the company, businessowners reward the employees for their continued hard[[Page H2642]]work and innovation. Workers have an opportunity to buy into the mission and future of the company. They have the opportunity to reap what they sow, making their work more meaningful and fulfilling.  Mr.Speaker, H.1343 simply raises the reporting threshold for companies who issue securities to their employees as compensatory benefits. Right now, any company that issues more than $5 million of securities in a yearlong period faces significant reporting requirements, including financial statements and disclosure of risk factors. These requirements cost small businesses time and money, making them less likely to issue stock as compensation for their employees. That is why this legislation moves the threshold up to $10 million.  The original $5 million threshold was added to rule 701 in 1999 and hasn't been updated since. By easing the threshold and indexing it to inflation every 5 years, we allow companies to increase the amount of stock they offer to employees. Additionally, raising the threshold will prevent private companies from having to disclose confidential financial information.  America is known for taking ownership, but we are also known for innovation. Our technology industry, especially, has propelled our economy and quality of life forward. But so many great tech companies started as small startups, struggling along from month to month before the financial rewards of their hard work could be achieved.  Thinking about the young companies right now that have grand innovative visions for improving our quality of life, this legislation will help them thrive. The employees already pour so much of their livelihoods into the venture. This bill will reward those workers with equity so that their perseverance and investment will pay off.  Mr.Speaker, before I close, I would like to discuss the broad support for this bill. I indicated earlier that both sides of the aisle can support this legislation, and I want to highlight that bipartisan support for the bill.  H.1343 has equal numbers of Republican and Democratic sponsors. Further, the bill passed out of the Financial Services Committee 48-11. A majority of the Democrats on the committee supported the bill. A similar bill passed with a bipartisan vote last Congress, with more than two dozen Democrats joining Republicans to pass the bill. And in the Senate, this same basic proposal passed the Senate Banking Committee by a voice vote just a few weeks ago.  Mr.Speaker, it is clear to see why this proposal is generating so much bipartisan support. With a higher threshold, companies can focus their time on innovating and creating jobs instead of filling out paperwork. Employees, meanwhile, can take a stake in their company and their own future. I urge my colleagues to vote for this important rule and the underlying legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgH2641-4.txt
232,POLIS,proceeding_id,topic-id,1912,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule, one that provides for consideration of H.1343, the Encouraging Employee Ownership  I strongly support the underlying legislation. I wish it had been brought forward to the floor under an open rule that allowed Democrats and Republicans to freely offer amendments that could be adopted by a simple majority vote.  Before we get to the specifics of the bill, I want to talk about the importance of employee ownership. I join my friend and colleague from my neighboring district in Colorado in extolling the virtues of employee stock ownership, of ensuring that employees in the company are stakeholders and able to benefit from the value that is being created.  You know, we have different stakeholders in our economy, and when you look at a company, you have different stakeholders that that company is responsible to and caters to: You have the shareholders, you have the employees, and you have the customers. In running a company, as I have done, it is always a constant balancing act to make sure that you are able to satisfy the legitimate demands of all those various stakeholders.  Now, one of the things that has been out of whack in our economy the last few decades is that a disproportionate share of the value creation has gone to the shareholders and the customers, often to the detriment of the employees.  Now, everybody has benefited as consumers and as customers with revolutions in prices and consumer technology. It is so exciting to see people, you know, where a flat screen television used to be out of reach, you now see them in nearly every home; and, in many cases, they cost less than a television would have cost that was significantly smaller 10 years ago--not to mention the remarkable mobile computing devices that middle class families and working families carry in their pockets with them that contains more processing power than a $3,000 computer did just a decade ago.  Consumers have benefited and shareholders have benefited. There has been an unprecedented increase in private equity markets, in stocks, a huge amount of value creation in the American economy, both on the balance sheet as well as in the market valuation of companies.  Now, the issue is that, while all of this has happened, wages have largely stagnated. A lot of the increases in efficiency and economic growth have gone to benefit consumers and shareholders. Employees and workers have felt, legitimately so, that they haven't seen their share of value creation.  Now, there are a number of reasons for that. One of those has been the weakening of the union movement that gave workers a collective voice. But if you look at what some of the remedies are, really none can make a bigger impact than employee stock ownership. This bill doesn't change the ball on that. It is a positive step.  There are a lot of other ideas that I hope we can talk about in a bipartisan way. Fundamentally, we need to create an economy that works for everyone, one in which employees and workers can directly benefit from the increase in value of the firm that they helped create. And what better way to do that than employee stock ownership in a variety of models and options for that. This bill deals with one; but we have ESOPs, we have co-ops, we have employee stock option plans, to name a few.  Companies find that it is in their interest to help improve morale and maintain a stable employee base to align the incentives of employees with shareholders and, of course, to help align the success of our economy with the success of all the stakeholders in our economy.  H.1343 is a bipartisan bill. It was passed last year; it will pass again overwhelmingly this year. It sends a strong statement that Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives want to make employee stock ownership easier. Hopefully, this is a starting point rather than an ending point.  The two other bills the Chamber is considering are also bipartisan, and I am hopeful that they can move forward expeditiously.  Now, that stands in stark contrast to some of the other actions of this Chamber, for instance, the 15 Congressional Review Act resolutions which simply sought to undo some of the positive steps that President Obama took rather than put forward a proactive agenda of where Republicans actually want to lead the  We also spent countless hours debating healthcare legislation that, thankfully, didn't go anywhere because it would have left 24 million Americans without health insurance and increased premiums by 15 to 20 percent for those who were lucky enough not to lose their insurance altogether.  I am glad that we have been able to move past that towards a more bipartisan discussion here that will fundamentally help American innovators and entrepreneurs and help lead to a fair economy that works better for everybody, that shows that Democrats and Republicans can work together to create a real solution that addresses a real problem and takes a first step towards creating an economy that works for workers, consumers, and shareholders.  I am hopeful that we can continue this trend after the district work period and move forward on bipartisan legislation that will simplify our complex Tax Code and realign incentives in[[Page H2643]]a positive way, fix our broken immigration system, and make sure that we have the infrastructure we need for our country to succeed in the 21st century. I hope that my colleagues are encouraged by the strong bipartisan show of support for H.1343 and we can work together to bring more bipartisan legislation to the floor instead of divisive bills that make problems even larger.  This bill, very simply, updates an SEC rule from 1999 that will allow private companies to offer employees a greater stake in the place they work without requiring additional paperwork or regulation--a simple and good idea.  Currently, a private company that offers over $5 million in securities through compensation for employees is required to provide additional disclosures which can, A, often serve as a detriment to going over the $5 million in compensatory stock for their employees, and, B, take up costs, administrative overhead, should they choose to proceed. H.1343 simply raises that threshold from $5 million to $10 million, and this legislation gives a private company more flexibility to reward and retain employees of all levels.  Employee ownership of various structures has benefits to both the company, the employees, and the overall economy. It helps align the interests. It results in more productivity, higher employee retention. It can help make a business more profitable and more sustainable. It helps make the American economy and the amazing value that is created work for everybody rather than just one of the stakeholder groups.  For many startups and small businesses, giving employees a stake in the business is a great way to provide an additional benefit, an incentive. It gives companies flexibility to attract new employees when they are starting up, to retain talent as a company grows and matures.  Providing workers stakes in their company helps strengthen their retirement savings. Employee stock ownership plans, or ESOPs, are a type of retirement plan that offers employees an ownership stake without upfront costs. In Colorado, there are 118 businesses that use employee-owned ESOPs as a way to promote employee ownership.  A good example of an ESOP is Fire Safety The owner, Jeff, wanted to offer his employees a stake in the business. He converted his business to an ESOP, an employee-owned company, that allowed him to create a succession plan so the business can stay locally owned by the people who worked to create the value. Jeff noted that, after the conversion, employee morale was up and sales were up.  One of our most famous examples of employee-owned companies is in my district in Fort Collins, Colorado: New Belgium From the perspective of the employees, New Belgium has a very strong corporate culture of personal and collective growth. The employee owners are concerned about their own professional development and that of their colleagues. They have a vested stake in the management, economic health, and stability of the company.  This bill is a commonsense approach and makes it easier for companies to give their employees ownership opportunities. It is a small first step towards encouraging an economy that works for everybody.  Now, I want to make sure that this legislation helps employees at all income levels have access to ownership opportunities and that workers' retirement savings are not put in jeopardy by an overconcentration in company stock. That is why I offered an amendment requiring GAO to do a study on the impact of this legislation on employee participation and ownership and the effect this legislation has on securities held by retirement plans that are governed by  I very much look forward and am grateful that the rule has made in order my amendment. This study will give us important information on how these changes impacting employee ownership also affect retirement. It will give this body information that we need to move forward.  The example of my amendment is an example of the many great ideas that Democrats and Republicans could have brought forward had this been brought forward under an open rule. What better bill to bring forward under an open rule than this kind of bipartisan bill where there is nobody in this body who is trying to undermine or sabotage this bill?  There may be some Members who vote against it on both sides, I don't know, but the overwhelming majority are for it. I think there are Democrats and Republicans with great ideas who would love the opportunity to take 10 or 15 minutes--10 minutes as I am afforded under this rule. How many other Republicans and Democrats would love that same opportunity to offer amendments to improve this bill to make it even better?  The good news is employee ownership is not a partisan issue. Employee ownership strengthens our economy, helps small and medium-sized and large businesses across our entire economic spectrum create and retain jobs, and promotes an increased retirement savings for the middle class. These companies are often anchor businesses in our communities that go beyond offering jobs but are involved with sponsoring Little League or being involved with community nonprofits by giving back, by helping local charities and helping support an ecosystem of entrepreneurship by helping other entrepreneurs get off the ground through mentorship networks and angel funding networks.  I am a strong supporter of this bill and, of course, want to point out that it is simply a starting place. We have a long way to go with encouraging employee ownership in all of its forms--ESOPs, co-ops, stock options, outright stock grants--and any other ways that we can come up with or that the private sector can come up with that allow a stake in the company and in the value being created to reside with the employees, aligning their incentive, making our economy work for everybody, and ensuring that stakeholders have balanced benefits from our overall growth.  I support this bill. I wish it had been brought to the floor under an open rule. I oppose the rule.

I rise today to speak in support of the rule providing for consideration of H.1343, the Encouraging Employee Ownership Act of 2017. I am proud to be a sponsor of this legislation, and I am grateful for the consideration it has been given by the House, and I am encouraged by its strong record of bipartisan support. The bill has passed the House in prior Congresses as part of larger capital markets packages, but this is the first time the legislation will be considered on its own.  We have had very constructive debate on the bill in the Financial Services Committee over the last few years. This debate has allowed us to build a strong consensus around this uniting principle: What is good for the company should also be good for the employee, and vice versa.  We want it to be easy for companies to offer stock compensation to their employees. This is a company issue, and this is a jobs issue, but this is also a workforce issue. The title of this legislation does not betray its intent. We believe encouraging employee ownership is important.  Agreement on the benefits of employee ownership has contributed to the strong bipartisan support enjoyed by this legislation. It has three Republican and three Democratic original cosponsors. Furthermore, the majority of Republicans and Democrats voted in favor of the Encouraging Employee Ownership Act when it was considered in the House Financial Services Committee just last month. We are simply expanding on something that is working.  The Securities and Exchange Commission, the investor protection regulator, has never raised issue with reduced disclosures available under rule 701, so we are simply saying this tool[[Page H2644]]should be made available to more companies and to their employees. We do this by adjusting for inflation the threshold for the amount of securities that can be issued each year under rule 701.  Again, I want to thank my colleagues from I want to thank all for the work in the Financial Services Committee, and I look forward to the House's consideration and, hopefully, passage of this important legislation.

235,POLIS,proceeding_id,topic-id,484,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  You know, the beauty of an open rule, which we did see when the Democrats had the majority and we have not seen since the Republicans took the majority, is it allows the floor debate to inspire good ideas. It allows Democrats and Republicans to bring forward amendments, subject to germaneness, that can be considered and voted upon.  Frankly, it seems like the Republicans didn't have much for us to do this week. This would have been a perfect week to try an open rule; and I know that Democrats and Republicans would have, consistent with the spirit of an open rule, brought forth good ideas and offered them. Good ideas would have been included in the bill.  But most importantly, we could have set a precedent that open rules work and an open process that values our contributions as legislators and as representatives of 750,000 Americans who would be able to work to improve legislation. So I think that we need to move in that direction. Let the debate on the floor and the back-and-forth inspire new collaboration between Democrats and Republicans, new ideas, new ways of working together.  Here you have a concept that Democrats and Republicans join together in support of. How can we reduce the costs or the red tape around administering employee ownership? We would love to remove barriers to employee ownership that exist across all forms of employee ownership.  We would love to see an economy that works for everybody, one that values employees and workers as stakeholders that share in the economic growth that they helped create. That is a big part of the answer to the discrepancies in our economy and the simple fact--yes, fact--that the majority of the benefit of our economic growth has resided with a few and, generally, with shareholders and executives rather than workers.  So at the same time we can continue to move forward with conveying value to consumers, I think we can also find a way to make sure that workers are able to participate in the value that is created in our economy. But to be able to do so, we should have an open process that allows Democrats and Republicans to bring forward germane amendments that improve the bill, to create an even better and more comprehensive effort to encourage employee ownership.  Employee ownership ultimately touches a number of different committees. There are issues around employee ownership that affect government procurement. There are issues that would reside in the Ways and Means Committee under taxes. There are issues that reside in the Judiciary Committee, and, yes, Financial Services and regulator issues as well.  I am hopeful that Democrats and Republicans can work together to create a comprehensive omnibus approach to improving access to employee ownership for firms across our country.

237,HUIZENGA,proceeding_id,topic-id,675,"Mr.Speaker, small businesses and entrepreneurs are what drive the American economy. I meet with these folks all the time when I am back home in the Second District, as I know my colleagues do when they are back in their districts, and we see firsthand the benefits that these people's dreams, their innovations, their hard work, and as they provide to our communities that inspiration.  These innovators, entrepreneurs, and risk-takers are critical to our country's economic growth and prosperity. In fact, small businesses are responsible for more than 60 percent of all of the net new jobs. Let me repeat that. Small businesses are responsible for more than 60 percent of all the net new jobs over the past two decades. This isn't just a one-time blip. This is over the last two decades.  So if our Nation is going to have an economy that provides opportunities for every American, then we must promote and encourage success and growth for our small businesses, our startups, and our entrepreneurs. It is this notion that I think brings us to this legislation we are discussing here today.  H.1343, the Encouraging Employee Ownership Act, would simply level the playing field for small companies by updating Federal rules that allow small businesses to better compensate their employees with ownership in those businesses.  Currently, the SEC rule 701 permits private companies to offer their own securities as part of written compensation agreements with employees, directors, general partners, trustees, officers, or other certain consultants without having to comply with rigid Federal securities registration requirements. The SEC rule 701, therefore, allows small companies to reward their employees.  Despite the SEC having the authority to increase the $5 million threshold via a rulemaking, the SEC has once again chosen to prioritize what, I would argue, are highly politicized regulatory undertakings instead of focusing on its core mission, which includes the facilitation of capital formation. That is one of the key core jobs of the Securities and Exchange Well, if the SEC isn't going to focus its priorities, then Congress will help them do that. So that is why we are here today on this bill.  I believe it is imperative that small businesses not only in West Michigan, but across America, have the ability to compete. A critical element of competition and success is, first, that small businesses be able to offer compensation packages that attract and retain top-tier talent in their fields. In today's world, that includes rewarding employees with stock options. To me, this is common sense. Small-business employees have a clear and vested interest in the success of their employers, and oftentimes they are attracted to it.  I know, having some younger children myself that are coming into adulthood, they are looking for that excitement. They are looking for that opportunity. They are looking to be builders themselves.  Well, by increasing the rule 701 threshold to $10 million, it will give these private companies more flexibility to attract, reward, and retain those employees. This simple change would allow companies to offer twice as much stock to their employees annually without having to trigger additional disclosure information to investors about those compensation packages that include securities offerings.  By reforming this regulatory burden, Mr.Speaker, startups, small businesses, and emerging growth companies will be better equipped to attract highly talented individuals from companies that are better capitalized and able to provide cash compensation. By incentivizing employees with stock options, small businesses will now be able to compete on a more level playing field in order to retain those valuable employees rather than seeing them flee to cash, frankly.  This bill is an example, I believe, of positive, bipartisan results that can be achieved when Republicans and Democrats reach across the aisle. I commend our sponsors of the bills, Representative Hultgren, who spoke a little earlier; Representatives Delaney, Higgins, MacArthur, Sinema, and Stivers, for their leadership on this issue; and my friend from Colorado, as well, and what he is doing.  I encourage all my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying bill.  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgH2641-4.txt
238,POLIS,proceeding_id,topic-id,612,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I have had the opportunity to convene several roundtables in my district featuring employee-owned businesses, and it has been great to hear their stories, whether it is New Belgium Brewing, talking to employee owners who are excited to spend their time building value for themselves and creating stability in their own job and bringing a wonderful craft brew product to people in all the States in which they distribute, or medical care companies and so many others that have different variations of employee ownership.[[Page H2645]]  As a private sector entrepreneur before I came to Congress, I founded several companies in the technology sector. My companies used stock options for every employee, ranging from entry-level front desk and telephone all the way to executive positions; and, frankly, Mr.Speaker, that has become the standard in the tech industry.  So many venture-backed companies and technology companies provide stock options across the board such that people who participate in building that value are able to also participate in sharing the value that is created. That is one of the great aspects of the technology sector, in particular, and the startup sector that I hope can export to other sectors.  On the margins, this bill will make it a little bit easier for small and mid-sized companies to provide equity compensation to employees. But again, we need to do a lot more. We need to do a lot more culturally to make this the norm. We need to do a lot more from a tax perspective and from a regulatory perspective to make it easier for companies to share ownership with employees so that employees can benefit from the value that is being created.  It is considered the cultural norm and the best practice within the technology entrepreneurship sector, and I hope that that can carry across to other sectors as well. It is very important to have an economy that works for everybody, and employee ownership is a critical linchpin of that effort.  Mr.Speaker, we are debating on a rule and a bill that makes it easier for companies to offer employee stock as part of their compensation; but, unfortunately, the backdrop to this discussion is that there continues to be an enduring wage gap in which women are simply not paid the same as men for doing the same job. Any efforts by us to strengthen compensation packages continue to remain hollow for 51 percent of the country--women.  Today is Equal Pay I wish you, Mr.Speaker, a happy Equal Pay Day, and it is time that we do something to address pay and equity in our country.  If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative DeLauro's Paycheck Fairness Act in addition to the legislation we have been debating, H.1343. So what that means is I will still bring forward this legislation. I will just also bring forward the Paycheck Fairness Act, which I am a proud cosponsor of.  Sometimes when we move the previous question, we bring forward a piece of legislation in lieu of the legislation that we bring to the floor under the rule. In this case, once we defeat the previous question, I will offer both of those bills: this employee stock ownership bill and the bill to address paycheck inequity, the Paycheck Fairness  Mr.Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.

We all have friends on both sides of the aisle, and we routinely promise to work together on issues upon which we agree. Most of us speak in front of our constituents about our desire to work with the other party. However, we all know that Americans perceive us to be constantly engaged in partisan conflict.  It is unfortunate that we are not able to work together on good legislation more often. It is understandable that Americans feel disappointed by Washington's partisan sniping. But here before us today is a bill with wide bipartisan support. Not only has it already received numerous bipartisan votes, there were only two amendments offered to the bill. One amendment was withdrawn because it was not germane. The other amendment from my good friend from Colorado and the Rules Committee, Mr.Polis, is simply requiring a report.  Why is this bill so noncontroversial?  I believe it has to do with the process by which we received this legislation. The Committee on Financial Services held hearings as far back as 2015 in which problems with the SEC rule were raised by small-business owners.  The sponsor of this bill, Mr.Hultgren, worked with his Democratic[[Page H2647]]colleagues on the committee and introduced a proposal to reform the SEC rule. Chairman Hensarling held a full committee markup last month which allowed for full debate and amendment, and now we have the bill on the floor this week. Good process produces good policy. But perhaps equally as important, good process helps instill faith in this institution. When Americans see us take up an issue, hear their concerns, and work together to find a commonsense solution, they will trust us to tackle even bigger problems.  This may not be the largest legislative product that Chairman Hensarling and the Financial Services Committee produce in this Congress, but, nevertheless, it is an important work that is helping us solve problems faced by American small businesses. This legislation ensures that the employees of America's small businesses can take ownership in their companies and their jobs. It reduces regulatory encroachment on America's job creators and helps our small businesses expand and grow.  I thank Representative Hultgren for bringing this bill before us. I commend Chairman Hensarling for working with both sides of the aisle and for following a good process on this legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the rule and vote ``yes'' on the bill.  The material previously referred to by Mr.Polis is as follows:            An Amendment to 240 Offered by Mr.Polis       At the end of the resolution, add the following new      sections:       2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the      Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare      the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on      the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.     1869) to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to      provide more effective remedies to victims of discrimination      in the payment of wages on the basis of sex, and for other      purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed      with. All points of order against consideration of the bill      are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and      shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by      the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on      Education and the After general debate the bill      shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule.      All points of order against provisions in the bill are      waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for      amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the      House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The      previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill      and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening      motion except one motion to recommit with or without      instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports      that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the      next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the      third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,      resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further      consideration of the bill.       3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.1869.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an altemative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . .  [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with altemative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

254,BYRNE,proceeding_id,topic-id,821,"Mr.Speaker, in 2010, then-President Obama said: ``If you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it.''  Unfortunately, at least 4.7 million Americans now know that was simply not true. ObamaCare was a takeover of the American healthcare system. The law's mandates have been burdensome, destroying 300,000 small-business jobs and forcing an estimated 10,000 small businesses to close. Premiums are skyrocketing, and choices are dwindling.[[Page H2648]]  House Resolution 241 provides for the consideration of H.1304, the Self-Insurance Protection Act, an important part of the Republican effort to repair the damage ObamaCare has done to insurance markets. More than 150 million Americans--62 percent of workers--receive their health insurance from their employer. In fact, almost all firms with at least 200 or more employees offer health benefits, and just over half of smaller firms with 3 to 199 employees offer health insurance.  Overwhelmingly, Americans and their employers like this system of employer-sponsored health care; and for many years, employer health plans have been successfully regulated by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or                              {time}  1315  Typically, small and large employers offer healthcare coverage to employees either in self-funded arrangements or purchase fully insured plans from an insurer.  Under self-insurance plans, employers cover the costs of their employees' medical expenses. Employers can either process claims in-house or work with a third-party administrator to oversee and implement the plans.  ERISA regulates both fully insured and self-insured plans, but only self-insured plans are exempt from the patchwork of mandates imposed under State insurance law. Furthermore, employer-sponsored self-insured plans are not subject to the same requirements under ObamaCare, as are fully insured plans.  Thus, self-insurance plans are desirable and successful because they are free from many government restrictions and regulations and allow employers to tailor their plans to meet the unique needs of their employees and to innovate.  For example, these plans do not require employees to purchase government-mandated coverage options that their employees do not want or need. This helps lower costs for working families while ensuring access to high-quality health care.  In hearings before the Education and the Workforce Committee, on which I sit, we heard testimony that today self-insurance is often the only way employers can afford coverage, thanks to the burdens of  Mr.Speaker, in Alabama, we like to say: if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Prior to ObamaCare, there were problems in our Nation's healthcare system, but the successful model of employer self-insurance wasn't one of them. Today, self-insurance remains perhaps the best way for employers to provide health care to their workers.  Unfortunately, the prior administration seemed intent on disrupting this successful healthcare model. Rather than leave self-insurance plans alone, they repeatedly explored ways to impose new regulations that would negatively impact self-insurance. Specifically, the Obama administration wanted to disrupt the model by regulating stop-loss insurance and treating it as if it were health insurance.  Employers who self-insure often purchase stop-loss insurance to cover large medical claims and to protect against the financial risks such claims can pose. Despite decades of Federal regulation on employer health plans under ERISA, stop-loss insurance has never been regulated by the Federal That is because stop-loss insurance is actually a financial risk management tool designed to protect employers from catastrophic claim expenses. Remarkably, in a regulatory grab, the Obama administration tried to reclassify it as ``group health insurance.''  Mr.Speaker, if the last 7 years have taught us anything, it is that more Federal control over health insurance does not make health care more affordable for the American people. Stop-loss insurance is not health insurance, and it should not be regulated like it is.  The Self-Insurance Protection Act simply updates the law to make clear that Federal bureaucrats cannot redefine stop-loss insurance as group health insurance. This is about reaffirming longstanding policies and ensuring workers continue to have access to a health insurance model that is proven to lower costs and provide flexibility to consumers.  This bill will provide workers and employers alike with the regulatory certainty that they have desperately wanted and needed. They shouldn't have to worry about unelected Federal bureaucrats stepping in and destroying their healthcare system.  To put it simply, this bill is necessary in order to prevent future bureaucratic overreach that would destroy the self-insurance model that has been so successful for so many working families.  I also think this bill is an area where we should have some bipartisan cooperation. It passed out of the Education and the Workforce Committee earlier this year on a voice vote, and I hope it earns bipartisan support here in the full  As we continue our efforts to increase choices, lower costs, and provide better healthcare options for working families, let us not forget to shore up and protect the health insurance programs that are actually working and getting the job done.

Mr.Speaker, I rise today to debate a rule for a piece of legislation that many on this side of the aisle do not necessarily have a serious issue with. The attempt here today is to ensure that a thing that is already happening continues to happen.  I suppose that, the next time we meet, we will take up a bill that declares that the Moon is not the Doing so is a complete waste of time, but that does not seem to necessarily be dispositive when deciding whether we should legislate on an issue these days.  Look, I get it. My friends across the aisle took one on the chin the other week when their Affordable Care Act repeal bill--a bill they spent 17 days working on, even though they had 7 long years to prepare for it--went down in flames in a most public and spectacular fashion, and now they need some time to dust themselves off and become reoriented.  The problem is, while they are doing that, while they are recovering from the miserable failure that was their attempt to strip 24 million Americans of their health care, they are burning valuable time--time that should be used to tackle more pressing issues like addressing the debt ceiling and fixing our crumbling infrastructure.  Let me also take this opportunity to remind my Republican colleagues that, while we spend our time here today debating these filler bills, there are only 7 legislative days, including today, remaining before the government runs out of funding. But are we tackling any of these importance issues or ensuring the government remains open?  Instead, we have before us a bill that addresses an issue that is not an issue. On top of that, this legislation was actually supposed to be the third bucket of their three-bucket strategy to end health care for millions of  We saw how sturdy the first bucket was a couple of weeks ago. In fact, the bucket we are talking about today was actually referred to as the ``sucker's bucket'' by Senator That is not exactly a glowing endorsement.  Indeed, some, like Senator Cotton, have referred to all this bucket talk as simply a bunch of political spin. Whatever it is, it is certainly a bucket that has a hole in it.  In all of the uncertainty facing my Republican friends, one thing becomes crystal clear: they have no plan whatsoever to help working Americans achieve the American They are adrift, in general, and most particularly when it comes to health care.  What do they really want? At first, it was repeal, then it was repeal and replace, then it was repeal and delay, followed finally by access to coverage, and would you believe another one: patient-centered.  That is repeal, repeal and replace, repeal and delay, access to coverage, and patient-centered. We still don't have a plan. Then it turned toward a three-bucket strategy that makes little to any sense, let alone to the American people but even to powerful elected leaders in the Republican  At the end of the day, Mr.Speaker, do you know what all this talk was?[[Page H2649]]Exactly what Senator Cotton said: nothing but political spin.

So I guess they are going to pass something, even if it is just this bill that does absolutely nothing, just so our Republican friends can say they did something. I am sure Donald John Trump will tweet about this great victory.

Before my time in Congress, I started my career as a systems analyst. I have firsthand experience writing code, and I can tell you that the first thing to protect vulnerable and sensitive data is to make sure it is kept private.  S.34, which the House passed last Tuesday, unraveled those vital protections for sensitive information belonging to millions of Americans nationwide.                              {time}  1330  The resolution negating essential protections for private citizens was signed by President Trump last night. The October 2016 FCC rule was the only rule that required internet service providers to obtain consumers' permission before selling their private internet browsing history and other sensitive information.  I am simply shocked that my colleagues across the aisle would vote for a measure that violates American privacy by selling your most personal and intimate information, including your email content and your app usage, all without your consent. Not only is this wrong and a blatant violation of policy, but it jeopardizes Americans' personal data and puts them at risk of hacking.  Repealing the FCC rule with S.34 allows broadband providers to turn over your info to the highest bidder or anyone else they want, including the government, without a warrant, without ever telling you. That is right. I will repeat it. Repealing the FCC rule with S.34 allows broadband providers to turn over your private information to the highest bidder or anyone else they want, including the government, without a warrant, without ever telling you.  Even worse, S.34 also tells providers they no longer have to use reasonable measures to protect consumers' personal information. This is absolutely unacceptable. We are living in a time where identity theft and internet hacking has become the new norm. We must provide consumers with these protections. No American wants their most personal information to be up for grabs.  Eliminating this rule prevents the FCC from publishing rules that are substantially the same absent additional legislation, establishing a very dangerous precedent for private citizens. Americans should have the right to decide how their internet providers use their personal information.  What this bill does, Mr.Speaker, is simple. This bill makes clear that the American people's browser histories are not for sale. The American people's health information: not for sale. The American people's financial information: not for sale. And the American people's location data: not for sale.  It is a simple concept and one I hope my colleagues across the aisle will recognize and support. The American people don't want the legislation that was signed last night. In overwhelming numbers, they are calling Congress and letting it be known that they want to keep their private information private.  I am proud to stand up for the American people by introducing the Restoring American Privacy Act of 2017, which reverses this misguided resolution and says, once and for all, that ISPs cannot sell customers' personal information without their knowledge, without their permission.

Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution .. . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.353, the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act, which also includes the Tsunami Warning, Education, and Research  The Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act is a product of hard work and negotiation over the past two I want to thank[[Page H2664]]Congressman Frank Lucas, Chairman Lamar Smith, and former Environment Subcommittee Chairs Jim Bridenstine and Chris Stewart, who were great partners in getting us here today.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is responsible for important work at the cutting edge of science and public service. Weather forecasting is one of the most critical tasks for our country. At a time when budget uncertainty jeopardizes some of the most fundamental services NOAA provides to our Nation, it is imperative that we support legislation like H.353 to give the agency the resources and flexibility needed to fulfill its mission.  The northwest Oregon communities I represent and communities across the country rely on timely and accurate weather forecasts to decide when to harvest their crops, when to go to sea to fish, how to navigate the roads safely when there is freezing rain or snow and to prepare for possible flood conditions.  The National Weather Service provides excellent forecasting products to support our economy, but with the increasing frequency and severity of severe weather events, there can be and should be improvements in our forecasting capabilities and delivery. Improvements in forecasts can provide more lead time to allow communities to prepare, especially in severe weather events. More effective communication of forecast information to the public and those in harm's way can reduce the loss of life and property.  This bill connects the research side of NOAA--the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research--more effectively to the forecasting needs of the National Weather Service, cultivating a research-to-operations pipeline that is essential for the continued improvement of our weather forecasting enterprise. The bill contains several provisions that will improve interactions and information sharing between NOAA's researchers and the National Weather It improves communication between NOAA and the broader research and private weather communities. The bill also formally establishes the pilot program currently operating at NOAA to engage in contracts with the commercial sector for weather forecasting data.  Even the best forecasts will not adequately serve the public's needs unless there are effective communication systems in place. H.353 directs NOAA to do more research, listen to experts, and improve its risk communication techniques.  The bill also establishes interagency coordination through the Office of Science and Technology Policy across multiple agencies outside NOAA that share responsibilities for weather research and forecast communications. This is essential, and it highlights the important role the Office of Science and Technology Policy and NOAA share to help speed the adoption of best tools and practices across the various agencies of the Federal  The legislation before us today also includes the Tsunami Warning, Education, and Research Act, legislation I have introduced over the past three The Tsunami Warning, Education, and Research Act seeks to improve our country's understanding of the threat posed by tsunami events by improving forecasting and notification systems, developing supportive technologies, and supporting local community outreach preparedness and response plans. This bill helps to address the risk faced by communities on both coasts and in the Gulf of Mexico by improving our mitigation and research program and enhancing community outreach and planning.  Many, if not most, of my colleagues represent districts that have experienced some kind of natural disaster. The threat of a catastrophic earthquake and tsunami is real because of the Cascadia Subduction West Coast Members take this threat very seriously.  I have heard from coastal communities, people who fish, the tourism and maritime industries, marine and public safety officials, sheriffs, emergency managers, small-business owners, older Americans, and students who are concerned that their communities are not prepared for a tsunami.  Students at Seaside High School, a coastal community in my district, engaged in a year-long project to educate Oregonians about the threat a tsunami has on lives and property. Three of the four public schools in Seaside are still located inside the tsunami inundation zone. The high school students have practiced their evacuation route, and they know that, in the projected time between a major earthquake and the devastating wave of a tsunami, they couldn't make it to higher ground. That is unacceptable.  The University of Oregon and Oregon State University are working on seismic warning systems and tsunami preparedness to help make sure that our communities are prepared and have the best research available to give the most warning time possible, and this bill compliments their work.  I am proud to have worked on this legislation which is so important to the people of northwest Oregon and all coastal communities, but I do remain very concerned that the funding level is below current spending. This cut would have serious consequences. The operation and maintenance funding for the buoy network we rely on to detect tsunami could decrease, adding hours of delay in appropriately warning coastal communities.  Tsunami warning centers in Alaska and Hawaii are likely to see a reduction in staff, resulting in gaps in coverage and creating greater risks because of time delays in sending out accurate warnings and, in some instances, not being able to provide adequate warning at all.  Tsunami are among the most deadly natural disasters. In the past two decades, tsunami have caused the deaths of roughly a quarter million people around the world. These disasters also have profound economic consequences. The 2001 tsunami in Japan caused more than $200 billion in economic losses.  We are fortunate, in the United States, to have been spared these catastrophes so far.                              {time}  1445  But our coastlines, from the Gulf of Mexico to Alaska, are very susceptible to the same kind of disasters we have seen in Indonesia and in It is not a matter of if, it is a matter of when.  Tsunami program activities protect coastal Oregonians just as hurricane forecasting protects coastal Floridians, Carolinians, and others up and down the East Coast of the United It is important that we reauthorize these lifesaving activities, and just as important to provide the necessary funding to support them.  I will work tirelessly with my colleagues to make sure this program receives the full funding it needs to serve our communities and save lives and property.  Although there are always areas where we can do more, this underlying bill, the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act, with the tsunami bill, is a good bipartisan agreement and one that I am proud to support while continuing to ask for current levels of funding.  I ask my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes'' on H.353.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgH2653-2.txt
271,LUCAS,proceeding_id,topic-id,551,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Texas, Chairman Smith, for his continued leadership on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, and for bringing forward this important legislation.  H.353, the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017, prioritizes improving weather forecasting for the protection of lives and property at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric This is a core program of the agency that has been in need of improved direction and investment for years.  The bill directs NOAA to develop plans to restore our country's leadership in weather forecasting. It is no secret that many people in our weather community are distraught that our forecasting capacities have deteriorated in recent years. Some even say that America no longer has the best weather prediction system in the world. In fact, we routinely rely on forecasts of other countries to predict what will happen in this country. This[[Page H2665]]is unacceptable, but I am glad we are here today to pass legislation that will dramatically improve our weather forecasting system.  The bill before us today enhances our ability to predict severe weather by focusing research and computing resources on improved weather forecasting, quantitative observing data planning, next generation modeling, and an emphasis on research-to-operations technology transfer.  As a Representative from Oklahoma, I understand the need for accurate and timely weather predictions firsthand. Every year, the loss of life from deadly tornadoes in my home State are a stark reminder that we can do better to predict severe weather events and provide longer lead times to protect Americans in harm's way.  I am proud that this legislation has a dedicated tornado warning improvement program. The goal of this program is to reduce the loss of life from tornadoes by advancing the understanding of fundamental meteorological science. This will allow detection and notifications of severe weather that are more accurate, effective, and timely. Constituents in my home State will benefit greatly from longer tornado warning lead times, which will save lives and better protect property.  Being better prepared for severe weather events is of the utmost important. The bill will improve our forecasting by encouraging innovations and new technologies through a joint technology transfer fund at NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric This transfer is essential to get new forecasting, models, and technologies out of the research side of NOAA and into the operational forecasts to better protect our country.  Furthermore, the legislation will enhance our forecasting by directing NOAA to engage new commercial data and private sector solutions. This legislation includes a pilot project, which will provide NOAA a clear demonstration of the valuable data from commercial technologies. The private sector has the potential to aid our forecasting skill while reducing government cost with innovative solutions. In order to increase our weather skills, we must not limit ourselves by solely relying on government data.  This legislation packs in multiple efforts to protect lives and property from severe weather. From encouraging new technologies both inside and outside of NOAA to the careful planning and prioritization of weather research, this legislation will put our country back on track to be a world leader in weather prediction.  The time has come for Americans to have the most accurate and timely weather predictions. They deserve nothing less.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for the bill.

It has become increasingly apparent with every major weather event that our forecasting services are desperately in need of a major overhaul. I am happy to support legislation that will do just that.  H.353, the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act, will put our country's weather forecasting back on track to provide citizens with lifesaving predictions and warnings.  I specifically point to this bill's innovative language on weather technology planning. H.353 calls on NOAA to evaluate the combination of observing systems it needs to meet weather forecasting requirements. It also requires the agency to conduct experiments on different observing systems to evaluate their costs and benefits.  Such reforms will grant NOAA more flexibility to develop new technologies while scrapping older approaches that do not bring enough value to our forecasts. We need to better assess our observing system resources instead of continuing to rely on outdated methods.  This bill will help push NOAA to consider new approaches, including those from the private sector. For its part, the growing private sector has signaled it is ready and willing to work with NOAA to bring better weather forecasting to our citizens, and we should welcome this development.  I am confident that H.353 will create the kind of meaningful change that we want to see at This bill will better protect American lives and property with more accurate weather forecasting.

Americans across the country rely on the National Weather Service to detect and provide warning for severe weather such as thunderstorms and tornadoes. But Charlotte is currently the largest metropolitan area without an adequate radar coverage. Addressing this shortcoming is an important step for public safety.

284,KILDEE,proceeding_id,topic-id,369,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  H.1343, Encouraging Employee Ownership Act of 2017, eliminates important disclosures that private companies must provide to their employees in the event they are compensating those employees with stock.  This bill would limit transparency. If companies want to pay their employees in stocks, they should have to simply disclose to their workers the risks associated with those investments.  Currently, private companies can provide up to $5 million worth of stock compensation annually to their employees and are not required to provide any financial disclosure. This bill would lift that cap to $10 million.  If companies choose to provide an employee with stock compensation, they should be required to inform that employee of the appropriate financial information, benefits, and the risks associated with that investment, including 2 years of company financial statements. All of this information is commonly available to typical investors.  Let's be clear: this stock is compensation for their work. Employees deserve to understand the value of their compensation prior to accepting it. They deserve the same protections that other investors would get.  I agree with Professor Mercer Bullard, who is a professor of law at the University of Mississippi School of Law, who testified before the Capital Markets, Securities, and Investments Subcommittee voicing his concerns about the bill. In his testimony, he noted that to take advantage of the terms of this legislation, an issuer would have to have at least $34 million in total assets. Surely, such minimal disclosures are not too burdensome for those sort of companies.  I do also understand that some proponents of this legislation argue that such an exemption is needed because disclosure of company information to employees runs the risk that confidential information could be leaked to competitors.  Employees with access to such information could simply be subject to nondisclosure agreements, which are typical today. Indeed, nondisclosure agreements are a simple solution that protects the company, but does not deny the employees the right to understand the worth of, or the risks associated with, the compensation they are receiving. Unfortunately, this bill would limit that transparency and those protections.  Mr.Speaker, I oppose this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgH2667.txt

Mr.Speaker, small businesses and entrepreneurs are what drive the American economy. I meet with them in my district, the Second District of Michigan, all the time. I know my colleagues do as well back in their districts.  We see them firsthand. We see firsthand the benefits that their dreams, their innovations, their inspiration, and their hard work provide to our communities.  These innovators, entrepreneurs, and risk-takers are critical for our country's economic growth and prosperity. In fact, small businesses are responsible for 60 percent of the Nation's net new jobs over the past two decades. Not 2 years, not 10 years, but over the last 20 years, the last two decades.  If our Nation is going to have an economy that provides opportunity for every American, then we must promote and encourage success and growth in our small businesses and our startups. It is this notion that brings us this legislation we are discussing today.  H.1343, Encouraging Employee Ownership Act, would simply level the playing field for small companies by updating Federal rules that allow small businesses to better compensate their employees with ownership in their own businesses.  Currently, Securities and Exchange Commission rule 701 permits private companies to offer their securities as part of written compensation agreements to employees, directors, general partners, trustees, officers, or certain consultants without having to comply with rigid Federal securities registration requirements. SEC rule 701, therefore, allows small companies to reward its employees.  Despite the SEC having the authority to increase the $5 million threshold disclosure via rulemaking, the SEC has once again chosen to prioritize highly politicized regulatory undertakings instead of focusing on its core mission. That mission includes facilitating capital formation. If the SEC cannot or will not focus its priorities, Congress will.  It is imperative that small businesses in west Michigan, all of Michigan, and across America have the ability to compete. A critical element of competition and success is for those small businesses to be able to offer compensation packages that attract and retain top-tier talent.  In today's world, that includes rewarding employees in stock options. To me, this just makes common sense. Small-business employees have a clear and vested interest in the success of their employer.  By increasing the rule 701 threshold to $10 million, it will give private companies more flexibility to attract, reward, and retain those highly valuable employees. This simple change will allow companies to offer twice as much stock to their employers annually, as they currently can, without having to trigger additional disclosure information to investors about compensation packages that include these security offerings.  By reforming this regulatory burden, startups, small businesses, and emerging growth companies will be better equipped to attract highly talented individuals from companies that are better capitalized and able to maybe provide some additional cash compensation.  By incentivizing employees with stock options, small businesses will now be able to compete on a more level playing field with older, larger, and maybe more established companies. They are going to be able to retain their invaluable employees as well.  This bill is an example of the positive bipartisan results that can be achieved when Republicans and Democrats reach across the aisle. I commend the sponsors of the bill, Representatives Hultgren, Delaney, Higgins, MacArthur, Sinema, and Stivers for their leadership on this issue. I encourage my colleagues to support H.1343.

288,ELLISON,proceeding_id,topic-id,958,"Mr.Speaker, the value of companies doesn't always go up. It is not true that the stock market always goes up and only goes up. It would be nice if Methuselahs at Google and every other company in America could get stock options and end up millionaires, but the truth is the world doesn't work that way. That is why disclosure is very important. That is why there is nothing wrong and no one objects to employees being compensated with stock options, but those employees ought to at least know the value of those stock options.  If you give me a check and it has a monetary value, I can read it and I know how much it is. If you give me stock options and you don't tell me because you don't have to disclose how much they are worth, then that is not fair, and that is what we object to.  This bill simply allows companies to avoid disclosure to employees of what those stock options are worth. That is wrong, and that is why we oppose it.  Let me just start in terms of the context, Mr.Today we consider yet another bill in favor of the moneyed interests. Today we consider another bill that basically helps out people who have a lot while so many Americans are struggling to get by and problems abound almost everywhere.  I have got to wonder, of all the things the American public want, why is a revision to the SEC's rule--section 701, to be precise--the priority for this week?  We have been here for about 3 months now. The Republicans have set[[Page H2669]]the agenda. They are in the majority. They get to decide which bills come up. Why do they keep on bringing up bills that only the moneyed interests want?  Mr.Speaker, in the past few months, congressional Republicans--I almost called them corporate Republicans--who decide which bills are the priority, have brought forth a hodgepodge of pieces of legislation. I will just review a few.  Republicans made it easier to drug test people receiving unemployment compensation.  Do you think the unemployed want that?  I doubt it.  Republicans have passed and the President even signed a law to protect corporate firms from having to disclose labor violations like wage theft before winning government contracts. I have got a feeling the employees were not calling for that.  House and Senate Republicans passed laws that allow internet service providers to sell your browser history. I don't think most folks on the internet today were clamoring for that gem, which I was proud to vote ``no'' on.  Republicans enacted a new law making it easier to dump coal debris near rivers and streams.  Republicans stopped efforts to help governments around the world avoid corruption.  H.41 removed the requirement that corporations disclose resource payments to foreign governments, which is a crushing blow to democracy activists working in fragile nations.  Mr.Speaker, this particular piece of legislation comes within a certain kind of context--a context where we are not talking about increase in pay, making people safer, making water cleaner, making foreign governments more honest. It is quite the opposite.  In the 3 months that we have been back in Congress, these laws removing competition, removing disclosure, and removing consumer privacy are all priorities of Republicans, who set the agenda.  Mr.Speaker, people who might be clued into this broadcast today need to know what the majority has been up to. It has not been up to business.  These are all multinational corporate interests that don't punish people for polluting, allow them to sell your internet browser's history, allow them to make money off of testing laid-off workers receiving employment compensation that is due them, and don't make corporate interests disclose payments to foreign governments when they drill for oil and minerals.  I just want the American people and Members to understand what is going on here, what is the larger context of this piece of legislation that we look at today.  When I talk to my constituents, they don't bring up any of this stuff. Mr.Speaker, they want to know: Where is the jobs bill? When are we going to get back to work? Somebody said we were going to work on real infrastructure, real fair trade. When is that going to happen?  Well, the people who are in charge around here, I guess they are going to get around to it at some point.  My constituents say: Can't we raise the minimum wage from something higher than $7.25 an hour, which is the Federal minimum wage? When is that bill coming up? Or, what about reconstructing our roads and our bridges and allowing us to raise a gas tax to invest in our Nation's infrastructure?  They say they want to increase skills. Let's invest in preschool, Pell grants, and community college. Let's put the people, not the corporate wish list, first.  Today we are asked to vote on a bill that basically makes it easier for private companies to provide options, like stocks, rather than compensation to their employees. As I have said, fundamentally, this may not be a bad thing if disclosure is made. This bill makes it not required. This bill makes it easier for firms to offload some of their options to employees without disclosing financial information to them.  While I am glad to see employers reward employees with stock and other compensation in addition to salaries, workers should be told the value of the compensation they receive. I don't think that is asking too much, Mr. With this bill, H.1343, it is possible that employees would be promised stock options which could be worth less than promised or even completely worthless.

In the past few months, Congressional Republicans, who decide which bills are priorities have brought forward a hodgepodge of corporate requests.  Here are some of the bills that are now law.  Republicans made it easier to drug test people receiving unemployment compensation (H.42).  Republicans passed--and the President signed--a law to protect corporate firms from having to disclose labor violations--like wage theft--before winning government contracts (H.37).  House and Senate Republicans passed laws that allow internet services providers to sell your browser history.

H.41 removed the requirement that corporations disclose resource payments to foreign governments.[[Page H2670]]  Which is a crushing blow to democracy activists working in fragile nations.  And, a law preventing State governments from setting up retirement plans for residents who do not have a work-based plan.  So, in the three months we've been back, these laws--removing competition, disclosure, and consumer privacy--are the priorities of Republicans who set the agenda.  These are all asks of corporate America--don't punish us for polluting streams; let us sell your internet browser history; let us make money drug testing laid off workers receiving unemployment due them, and; don't make us disclose our payments to foreign governments when we drill for oil or minerals.  When I talk to my constituents, they don't ask for any of these.  They say, ``Where's the jobs bill?''  My constituents say, can't we raise the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour?  They say, our roads and bridges need work. Let's raise the gas tax a skoch and invest in infrastructure?  They say, we want to increase our skills; let's invest in pre-school, Pell grants and community colleges.  Let's put people, not corporate wish lists--first.  But, nope, today we are asked to vote on a bill that makes it easier for private companies to provide options--like stocks--rather than compensation to their employees.  This bill makes it easier for firms to offload some of their options to their employees without disclosing financial information to them.  While I'm glad to see companies reward employees with stock and other compensation in addition to salaries, workers should be told the value of the compensation they receive.

I don't think the supporters of this bill are doing this for nefarious reasons.  I'm sure they find my reference to Enron hyperbolic.  They might also say that it's irrelevant since Enron was a public company and we are talking about private companies.  So, let's talk about Palantir  This $20 billion company convinced top-tier engineers to accept below-market salaries by promising them generous stock options.  But some employees who accepted this bargain, hoping to make money on selling their shares, cannot sell them.  The only buyer of their stocks is Palantir Technologies themselves--or a buyer approved by Palantir  Palantir is not a small firm.  Palantir is the third biggest American tech startup, behind only Uber and AIR B-N- It was also founded in 2004, which makes Palantir as old as Facebook--which is a long time to wait to cash in your options.  Pushing employees to own more of employer's stock exposes workers--like George Maddox--to put all their retirement eggs in one basket--what we call ``concentration risk.''  I ask this Congress to stop doing the bidding of corporate America until we address the priorities of American families and workers.  We should increase wages and access to affordable housing, provide clean air and clean water, and protect our privacy.  We should not make it easier for employers to pressure workers to choose options over salary without adequate disclosures. Vote no on H.1343.  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgH2667.txt

I also want to thank the distinguished gentleman from Illinois (Mr.Hultgren) for his work on this legislation and, more broadly, issues surrounding American entrepreneurship. He has been a tireless advocate.  Mr.Speaker, over the last 2 weeks, the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit, which I chair, has held hearings to examine the impact regulations have had on financial institutions, small businesses, and American consumers. What we have seen is that the burdens stemming from Dodd-Frank and associated Obama era policies continue to harm consumers and small businesses.  We have what some have referred to as a two-speed economy. Large banks and their large customers are thriving, but the story isn't as bright for small businesses. That is why H.1343 is so important. Small businesses and startups don't necessarily have the same opportunities to access the capital markets as their larger competitors, but from a regulatory standpoint, the small guys are treated the same as the big guys.  Mr.Hultgren's legislation takes an important step in addressing some of the disparities that exist. H.1343 will allow small businesses to attract and retain employees through incentives similar to those that may be offered by large businesses. Unlike the gentleman who just got done speaking, this is not about It is about small businesses that we are talking about.  It will also ease some of the reporting burden on small and emerging businesses. The bill does so simply by increasing the SEC rule 701 threshold, taking the existing rule and simply expanding it, a figure that hasn't been touched since 1999.  It is essential that Washington take steps to level the playing field for small businesses and eliminate this two-speed economy. The bill the House will consider today is another step toward job creation and a more reasonable regulatory environment.  I again want to thank and commend Mr.Hultgren for his leadership and ask that my colleagues join me in supporting H.1343.  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgH2667.txt

294,DELANEY,proceeding_id,topic-id,746,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank my good friend from Michigan for yielding me this time, the vice ranking member of our committee, and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.Hultgren), my good friend, for cosponsoring this legislation with me.  I do rise in support of H.1343, Mr.Speaker, and I think it is a very simple piece of legislation. The chairman of the committee said it was a simple piece of legislation. It is very straightforward. It simply raises the threshold as to the amount of stock a private corporation can give its employees, from $5 million to $10 million, without triggering additional disclosure.  What this bill is not about is rolling back disclosure because, as a practical matter, it simply defines the threshold as to when additional disclosure is required. That threshold was originally[[Page H2671]]established in 1988 at $5 million. Five million dollars was good in 1988; it is no longer good in 2017. We have simply escalated that amount by inflation, and we have come up with the number $10 million, which is proposed in the legislation.  One of the reasons this legislation does not roll back disclosures, which is a myth that I intend to debunk here this afternoon, is because, as a practical matter, what corporations will do is, in fact, not give additional stock to their employees if, in fact, it triggers additional disclosures. That is what actually happens in the private market is this threshold defines the amount of stock that a company will, in fact, give to its employees in any given year; and, if we don't raise the cap from $5 million to $10 million, we are effectively preventing companies from allowing their employees to share in stock ownership.  Private companies make decisions, Mr.Speaker, to stay private for many reasons: either because they are too small and they don't want to go public; or they don't want to, in fact, disclose their confidential information; or they don't want the costs or burdens of being a public company; or because they don't want to give up control. Whatever reason they have, it is a very important decision for a private company to stay private and not go public. The current threshold of $5 million effectively forces a company to make the kind of disclosures it would have to make as a public company if it elects to give more than $5 million of stock to its employees.  We, as policymakers, should encourage more employee ownership in the markets because it is good for both the corporations and the employees. It is good for the corporations because it creates a better culture. It allows the management team and the employees of the company to have a more long-term perspective, and it reduces turnover, which is one of the highest costs that companies have. So it is very good for the companies.  But, in fact, Mr.Speaker, it is even better for the employees. The data suggest that companies that have high employee ownership are much less likely to lay off their employees during a recession. So it creates, effectively, better retention, which is obviously in the interest of employees.  But the other thing it does--and I think this is the most important point--is it encourages kind of an inclusive capitalism whereby workers actually own more of the U.economy. This is something, as Democrats, we should care about, in particular, because we have talked for many years about how the growth in the U.economy and the increases in productivity have disproportionately gone to capital and not to workers.  We believe there are many reasons this has occurred, but one of the things we should be advocating for, strongly, is increasing workers' ownership of capital. It will inevitably lead to more savings among workers, and it will start balancing out the distribution of profits in society. One of the ways we do that is to eliminate the barriers for companies to issue stock to their employees, which is effectively what this bill does.  So if we care about this concept of inclusive capitalism, if we believe American workers should own a greater percentage of the economy and, therefore, benefit from the productivity enhancements that are occurring in the economy and the economic growth that is occurring in the economy, we should put policies in place specifically to make it easier for corporations to engage in shared employee ownership, which is exactly what this bill does.

It is such an honor to serve with all of my colleagues.  I do think some who have spoken opposed to this legislation really don't understand the impact. There is nothing in this legislation that takes away any disclosures. Disclosures still remain. The same disclosures that have been in place for 30 years remain exactly there. This does not have anything to do with Enron, a publicly traded company. It is completely different. This is private sector. This is opening up opportunity. I think, by arguing against this, ultimately, it is taking away opportunity from employees to benefit.  It is such a privilege to serve with people like the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.Delaney), who was part of this, opening up opportunities to hundreds of families. Congressman MacArthur, similarly, opened up opportunities that changed lives, as well as Congressman Trott, who is going to be speaking as well. They opened up opportunities to people who would never have had opportunity to own a company, to own that and to have it completely change their family and their future.  I rise to support H.1343, the Encouraging Employee Ownership Act of 2017.  My legislation is based on a simple principle: Employees who own a stake in the company they work for every day want to see it do well and will do their best to make sure that that business succeeds. Their sense of ownership over details, large and small, makes a real difference to the bottom line and, just as importantly, to the quality of life of the employers and employees. When the company succeeds, the employee succeeds. The business, in turn, receives a large boost in productivity, enabling it to expand its reach and invest in new technology and equipment.  EEOA would make it easier for companies in Illinois and nationwide to let hardworking employees own a stake in the business they pour their sweat into every single day. This benefit also helps companies attract top talent, even if the company is just starting out.  Warren Ribley of the Illinois Biotechnology Industry Organization, which represents companies that employ thousands of residents in the 14th Congressional District, believes: `` . . . offering an ownership stake to employees is a critical tool in recruiting top talent to job-generating companies. And there is no doubt that an equity stake encourages employees to drive hard for success of that enterprise.''  Unfortunately, some companies are shying away from offering employee ownership because of regulations that limit how much ownership they can safely offer. SEC rule 701 mandates various disclosures for certain privately held companies that use more than $5 million worth of securities for employee compensation per year.  This threshold was arbitrarily set by the SEC in 1999. For businesses that want to offer more stock to more employees, this rule forces those businesses to make confidential disclosures that could greatly damage future innovation if they fell into the wrong hands; this includes business-sensitive information, including the financials and corresponding materials like future plans and capital expenditures. The SEC's original rulemaking acknowledged these concerns.  And these disclosures aren't just risky, they are costly. As the Chamber of Commerce has explained, the Encouraging Employee Ownership Act would instead ``help give employees of American businesses a greater chance to participate in the success of their company.''  EEOA builds off the JOBS Act reform to rule 12(g), which increased the number of shareholders of record that a company could have without SEC registration from 500 to 2,000 and exempted employee compensation securities from the registration requirements. This idea championed in the JOBS Act,[[Page H2672]]that the law should treat employee compensation securities differently than traditional securities, has not been extended to the SEC rule 701.  My bill is simple. It is a bipartisan fix. EEOA raises the outdated threshold for enhanced disclosure from $5 million to $10 million, keeping pace with inflation every 5 years. We are taking something that is already working and making it available for even more companies and, more importantly, more employees.  To be clear, issuers who are exempt from enhanced disclosure would still have to comply with all pertinent antifraud civil liability requirements. Furthermore, the employees purchasing these securities observe the business they work for every day and have a closer perspective on its operation that is not available to the traditional investor, thus negating the need for additional disclosure. We should applaud the employee ownership from the board room to the shop floor.  I thank the bipartisan cosponsors of this EEOA legislation, especially Congressman Delaney for his hard work and Congressmen Stivers, Sinema, Higgins of New York, MacArthur, Gottheimer, and I thank Speaker Ryan and Chairman Hensarling for their support in advancing this critical legislation.

I do, however, disagree that the question here derives from a lack of understanding of the legislation. I think it is entirely possible--in fact, I would suggest that it is likely--that members of a body such as this, from 435 distinct districts and different experiences, can look at the same information, fully understand it, and come to different conclusions as to what sort of policy ought to be in place, and that is where I have landed on this particular subject. I fully understand.                              {time}  1545  I also think it is important to note that we can't on one hand say that this is not about disclosure and on the other hand mention that these disclosure requirements could have a negative impact and encourage or discourage companies from engaging in the practice of awarding employees with stock as a part of their compensation.  It is a question of disclosure. This legislation is about the disclosure requirements that should be applied in this case. That is really what we have heard from both sides of this argument: where should that disclosure requirement be, and at what level should it be incurred?  What I would say is--and I think this is important to note, speaking for myself--I know many other members of the Financial Services Committee and Members of this body that may oppose this legislation feel strongly that the direction toward awarding employees with stock ownership is a positive direction. It is something that my friend, Mr.Delaney, has not only advocated for, but has practiced in his own private sector experience. It is a positive thing for a company and it is a positive thing for the employees.  The only point that I continue to drive home and that others have reiterated is that it is important that employees understand the nature of the stock that is being awarded to them and that the disclosure requirements make clear employees are aware of the compensation and its true value. That is really the point of my objection.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter I received from Public Citizen, which articulates some of these same arguments.                                               PUBLIC CITIZEN,                                    Washington, DC, March 8, 2017.     Member,     House Committee on Financial Services,     Washington,       Dear Representative: On behalf of more than 400,000 members      and supporters of Public Citizen, we offer the following      comments on bills facing a committee vote March 9, 2017.       In securities lawmaking, we believe the committee's compass      should always point to investor protection. Well informed      investors who can trust disclosures form the bedrock of      capital formation. We are concerned that a few of these      measures point in a different direction.       HR 910: The ``Fair Access to Investor Research Act of      2017'' directs the SEC to eliminate restrictions on research      reports that cover Exchange Traded Funds (ETEs). The result      of this measure means that firms promoting ETFs can      simultaneously publish reports that appear to be impartial      analysis. This may lead investors to take unwarranted comfort      in the security. In the last decade, ETFs have grown from      about 100 funds with $100 billion in assets to more than 1300      funds with $1.8 trillion in assets,That makes the playing      field for mischief immense.       Puffery parading as research led to the dot-com bubble in      the late 1990s, where analysts disregarded fundamental      metrics such as a revenue and income when recommending the      purchase of new internet-based firms. This measure improves      on a previous iteration of the legislation by allowing      fundamental fraud oversight by the But the bill ignores      the basic hazard that a firm's motivation in funding research      may be sales promotion and not bona fide education for its      clients. We also note that ETFs represent the securities of      active firms. That is, an ETF holds assets such as stocks or      bonds. That means this has little to do with capital      formation. Now, research reports insulated from government      scrutiny may too often serve to promote more turnover and      commissions, not sound guidance. For these reasons, we oppose      this bill and encourage members to vote no.       HR 1343: The ``Encouraging Employee Ownership Act of 2017''      increases from $5 million to $10 million the amount of      securities a firm may sell annually to its employees without      providing certain basic financial information. We believe      this is misguided for a number of reasons. First, defenders      of this measure reference the potential for leakage of      propriety information. There's little evidence of this      problem. It's simply not in the self-interest of an employee-     owner to divulge critical information to a rival, especially      if it would undermine the value of the stock. Second,      employees who are compensated in stock (instead of additional      cash) should be entitled to be informed about the financial      condition of their company, the same as any other investor.      Other company creditors, such as the firm's bank or major      supplier, receive this information, however this measure      reduces stock-compensated employees to a class below these      other creditors. Young firms may be struggling with cash-flow      problems and choose to use stock rather than cash for      compensation. But those employees should be informed about      such risks. Third, the basic thrust of this measure is to      lead employees to hold a greater share of their savings in      the firm. An employee invested in his or her own firm may be      more productive and lead to greater profits at the firm that      the employee then shares; but there is a point beyond which      this dynamic dissipates. Any prudent investor should      diversify. Overconcentration in one asset, especially where      the firm's prospects are less than stellar, compounds the      employee-investor's risk. We oppose this bill, and encourage      members to do the same.       HR 1366: The ``U.Territories Investor Protection Act''      extends basic U.securities law oversight to investment      firms operating in Puerto Rico and other U.territories. To      date, these firms have escaped oversight, disclosure and      conflict-of-interest requirements that mainland firms face.      We support this common sense reform.

Mr.Speaker, what we are here talking about today is opportunity. We are not talking about the money interests. We are not talking about waving the bloody shirt of the Enron debacle. What we are talking about here today, Mr.Speaker, is in the interest of innovators. It is in the interest of talented Millennials who have huge student loans, who have a great idea to benefit themselves, their community, their economy. We are here to be in the interest of hardworking workers who have no big investment dollars, but have an abundance of sweat equity. We are here in the interest, Mr.Speaker, of building businesses and growing this economy. If we do that, we are growing jobs and opportunity for our citizens. And we are in the interest, Mr.Speaker, again, not of the money interest, but of efforts all over this country, led by people like John Delaney of Maryland and Stephen Case of Virginia, to build out venture capital and entrepreneurship in places other than Boston, Massachusetts; Menlo Park; places like Detroit; Flint; Little Rock; Louis; and That is why we are here today. This bill is a simple, commonsense, small step in that effort.  For many years, in my private sector life, I helped young companies form and raise capital for them. In my own business, I extended stock options and[[Page H2673]]opportunities to buy stock to those very people who did not have the excess cash to invest. Many companies issue stock to compensate their employees, but it is especially important to startup businesses and private businesses. It is especially important to those businesses that are trying to compete with big private enterprises that have a public stock to offer as an incentive. And structuring competitive compensation in private businesses is very challenging.  Further, for employees, this stock ownership is a huge source of pride, allowing individuals to participate in the growth and prosperity that their hard work and sweat equity have helped build.  Through rule 701, the SEC allows private companies to offer up to $5 million in their own securities without additional regulatory bureaucracy. My friend from Illinois (Mr.Hultgren) and my friend from Maryland (Mr.Delaney) have simply made a small change, Mr.Speaker; and that is to raise that commensurate with inflation to $10 million to reflect the world we live in today. This is not rocket science; this is something we need to do for building our economy.  As we celebrate the fifth anniversary of the signing of the JOBS Act by President Obama and the successes this legislation has yielded in capital formation for small and emerging growth companies, I urge my colleagues to support this effort by my friend from Illinois in this bipartisan, commonsense job-creating proposal.

304,POLIS,proceeding_id,topic-id,383,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding the time.  Various measurements of the economy have shown economic growth and an increase in the stock market. The frustration that I hear from so many of my constituents is that: With all of this economic growth, why haven't my prospects improved? Why has there been wage stagnation? Why aren't my family and I earning any more than I was?  It is true, because a lot of the benefits of this economic growth have gone to shareholders and consumers rather than workers. We are all consumers, and we have all benefited from that. And do you know what? We are all shareholders through pensions and through retirement accounts, public and private. Many people also put food on their table and pay their rent, wearing their hat as an employee or a worker.  One of the things that we can do not just by passing this bill, but by passing a whole host of legal changes both in the tax framework and in the regulatory framework to make it easier for employees to own companies, is allow employees and workers to share in the value that is being created on the shareholder side of the ledger. Then, and only then, can we have an economy that works for more people rather than just a few.  This bill is a small step in that direction. It can reduce the cost and remove a detriment that small to midsize companies have from aggressively pursuing employee stock ownership. But it is just a first step.  There is a lot of work that we need to do to reorient the economy around a shareholder economy that aligns the incentives of workers with those of shareholders. It is good for sustainable profits, it is good for long-term economic growth, it is good for stability. It is a better way to make sure that of this vast value that is being created, we all can partake in it on both sides of the ledger, as shareholders and as workers.  That is why I rise today in support of the bill, and that is why I call upon my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to see this as but a modest first step towards a shareholder economy that works for every worker.

Mr.Speaker, over the last 8 years, our Nation has experienced sluggish economic growth. Americans have suffered through stagnant paychecks and a lack of new opportunities. Last year, the economy grew at a meager 1.6 percent, which is half of the historic average.  However, there has been one job filled that has grown at a faster rate than any other; and that job is those who specialize in regulatory compliance. This is a testament to the crushing onslaught of new regulations under the previous administration, where compliance with regulation and red tape was emphasized more than growing businesses and creating jobs.  We in Congress must do our part to foster economic growth and relieve our job creators of the excessive burden of complying with unnecessary regulation. The bill before us today will do exactly that.  Currently, businesses that offer more than $5 million in stock to their own employees are required by law to comply with costly financial disclosures. This number was set nearly 20 years ago. It is time to update the law and raise this threshold to encourage small-business startups and give them the resources they need to expand and create jobs.  The Encouraging Employee Ownership Act would raise this threshold to $10 million and give private businesses more flexibility to reward their employees with ownership of a company. This bill passed the Financial Services Committee last month with strong bipartisan support.  This is just one of the many steps that we must take to foster innovation and encourage capital formation, to provide every American with opportunities that they deserve. We must build an economy that is open and accessible to every single American, not one that is closed off to those who can't afford to comply with the high cost of bureaucratic red tape and endless government paperwork.  As a former small-business owner for 20 years, I know the employees benefit tremendously from any opportunity to participate in a company's success. I support this bill because I know from personal experience this model works and helps startup companies to retain their best employees over the long term.  Americans are not satisfied with the stagnant economy that has become the new norm in our It is unacceptable for government to stand in the way of prosperity and make it harder for Americans to succeed. Small businesses employ half of U.workers, and we must promote, not hinder, small business growth.

I just want to reiterate that because it is important that the position not be mischaracterized as one that wants to dampen the ability of companies to reward their employees with stock or use that as a form of compensation.

This is a commonsense, simple bill that makes it easier for employees to obtain ownership in the companies[[Page H2674]]they work for. When I was in the private sector, I gave dozens of employees an ownership interest. It worked out great for them, it worked out great for the company, and it worked out great for our customers. Ownership interest gave them an upside that could not be realized through a salary. The stock instilled loyalty and dedication. More importantly, it created a family atmosphere. We were all in it together. Our opportunities would rise and fall, depending on our collective success.  To have a career where someday, through your hard work, you can end up owning a piece of action is what the American Dream is all about. The outdated cap is keeping this dream, for no good reason, from many  I suspect that those who oppose the bill, while they may understand the legislation, probably have never worked in the private sector and have no clue how meaningful incentives and opportunities, such as stock ownership, are to individuals. I found it was the best way to motivate and reward employees. In fact, it worked so well, no one ever left the company except to retire.  My friends from Michigan and Minnesota oppose the bill because of a lack of transparency. The argument is flawed because it assumes stock ownership opportunities comprise all or a significant portion of the individual's compensation. This is not correct. A stock ownership benefit is typically over and above salary and bonuses.  To require the owner of a small business or a startup to make disclosures will cause many employers not to give employees this opportunity. Implicit in their argument is an assumption, like in so many other areas of life, that individuals cannot be trusted to make decisions on their own, that they need the help of all of the smart politicians and bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., to tell them what to do and what they need to see, and, of course, we cannot trust people to make decisions and discern for themselves whether stock ownership is a fair opportunity.

This is bipartisan legislation that will remove outdated barriers to capital formation and job creation imposed on the small businesses and startups that are driving America's innovation economy.  The SEC still hasn't updated a rule from 17 years ago that imposed an undue burden on entrepreneurs when they want to attract and retain talent through employee compensation plans. Startup ventures, by offering their employees a stake in the company through equity and other forms of deferred compensation, can reward hardworking employees by giving them direct ownership while their business continues to grow.  SEC rules governing these compensation plans haven't been updated since 1999, and they are imposing burdensome compliance and reporting requirements on the very entrepreneurs we should be encouraging to expand and create more good-paying, private sector jobs. We see the effects of this compliance tax placing a drain on our economy because it diverts the resources and human capital of entrepreneurs away from expansion and job creation.  In my district on Long Island and nationwide, entrepreneurs who have the next great invention or idea are struggling to gain access to capital. By regulating small startup ventures as if they are large, publicly traded companies, the SEC is imposing an unnecessary mound of paperwork on startups. A large corporation may have the lawyers and accountants to fill out the mountain of paperwork imposed on them by the SEC, but a small business can't compete, and that is why they need relief.  This Congress we have an opportunity through bipartisan reforms like this legislation to reverse that troubling trend by removing the regulatory burdens that harm the economy, consumers, and prospects for job growth.

I have heard a number of my colleagues point to the red tape and the unnecessary burdens that are placed on a company that wishes to provide stock compensation.  Let me be clear about what it is that we would require. This is what is required for a company that exceeds the threshold: That they provide a copy of the compensation plan or a contract, if they disclose that; a copy of a summary plan description, if it is an ERISA retirement plan or, if not, a summary of the plan's material terms; risk factors associated with the stock; and the company's most recent financial statements from the last 2 years, which don't need to be audited.  This is important information for anyone receiving stock as compensation in order to understand the value of that stock and not a burdensome requirement on a company, particularly a company of the size that would be required under the increased threshold that is being proposed by this law.  If there is any aspect of this debate which is common sense, it is common sense that a person receiving compensation ought to have information that tells them the value of that compensation.  Mr.Speaker, I think this is an important debate and discussion. It is one that this body is well-served by taking on.  I do agree, as I said, that this is an important direction for us to take as a nation. And it certainly makes sense that, in order for us to fully all participate in the economy, employee ownership is a value. It creates more productive companies, more competitive companies. It provides better compensation, and, as has been pointed out, it creates more stable organizations less likely to lay people off, more likely to be sustainable companies. That is all good, and that is important.  It comes down to the question of transparency. Employees deserve to know the state of their employer's finances, if they are to accept stock in lieu of monetary compensation. They deserve no less protection than other investors in the company.  We shouldn't fear that kind of transparency. A company that wants its employees to accept stock instead of monetary compensation should embrace this sort of compensation. If they want to empower those employees and they want to make them a part of the company, they should provide them with[[Page H2675]]the information that helps them understand the value of that ownership.  Transparency is important for individuals to make informed choices, not informed choices coming from a dictate from Washington but information that they have the right to have. It empowers them with knowledge that allows them to make choices about the form of compensation that they would accept.

We heard some rhetoric earlier on the floor here which, I think, shows why many on both sides of the aisle scratch their heads in opposition to this bill. We heard about monied interests. We heard about corporate wish lists. We heard about Enron which is, by the way, a publicly traded company which has absolutely nothing to do with this bill. Now, that all might play really well on a leftwing political base, but that is detached from the realities of what our economy is about.  As we have talked, 60 percent of all new job creation happens in small businesses. These are not corporations. These are LLCs, limited liability corporations. These are subchapter S sole proprietorships. These are small entrepreneurs and innovators.  By the way, I looked up the definition of innovator. It is a person who introduces new methods, ideas, or products. Those are the kind of dynamic elements that we are seeing here. And I think this confusion between corporations and Enron and what we are trying to do here is really a disservice to the American people.  This is about making sure that we update basically an inflation escalator from 1988. We update a rule that the SEC could have the power to do, which it has not done, that benefits employees and benefits those owner-employer's workers who oftentimes, more often than not, work alongside their employees. So they are the ones who are seeing this on a daily basis.  I can just say to you that, as was pointed out by my colleague from across the aisle from Maryland, if we don't do this, what most of those small businesses are going to do is say: You know what, it is just not worth the effort; I am not going to do it. And we will see that lack of upside going to those employees.  As was pointed out by my fellow colleague from Michigan, this is beyond their salary, this is beyond bonuses. This is an additional way to make sure that those relationships get cemented in.  So, at a minimum, all you would be doing is voting to confirm the inflation escalator from 1988.

The focus tonight really is on jobs and trade, an issue on the mind of millions and millions of We have been joined by Congressman Brendan Boyle of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as well.  I will place this up for the Nation to see. It is a chart showing just U.trade relations with Mexico and Canada and what has happened since the deal was negotiated back in the early 1990s. It was also prepared before that, during the 1980s, when the United States actually had some trade surpluses on this continent with both Canada and  This shows, in 1994, when NAFTA was actually enacted. You could see the United States begin to kind of fall into deficit. Then we had just a precipitous trade deficit, including the collapse of the peso after the NAFTA trade agreement was signed.[[Page H2681]]  This is serious business for our country because this red ink represents lost jobs, lost productive power, and communities in disrepair across this country, where production units were just picked up and put either north or south of the border.  Tonight, we want to focus on President Trump's Manufacturing Jobs Initiative, which he announced during the campaign and afterwards. Here were his words:       Everything is going to be based on bringing our jobs back,      the good jobs, the real jobs. They have to come back.  Well, after all we have lost, we certainly do need job creation in this country.                              {time}  1730  We are now into the third month of Mr.Trump's Presidency and closing in on his first 100 days in office, a period when most Presidents are able to pass something through this Congress that really matters to the American people. I remember when we were able to save Social Security back during the 1980s and when a Congress was elected in response to Ronald Reagan's excesses, and it was in the first quarter of the year that that was done. So we are waiting. It is 100 days now, and nothing significant has been done on the jobs and trade front.  Candidate Donald Trump's campaign for President in my region of America was actually founded on the principle of fixing jobs and trade. People listened. But if we look at this first 100 days, we see that he has really taken a back seat to his billionaire donors and their interests and a staff that seems to be more and more peopled with individuals who spent a whole lot of time at Goldman Sachs, which is a company that has been notorious in helping to outsource jobs.  Throughout the campaign, Mr.Trump touted his trade policies, assuring voters he would renegotiate Well, we have been waiting. During a debate, he said: ``NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country.''  I would say that that agreement is the foundational agreement, the precepts on which all subsequent trade deals have been negotiated that have placed America in a red ink position: many more imports coming into this country, many more of our jobs being outsourced elsewhere than our exports going out.  So I ask: Are the strong planks for a new NAFTA part of what the Trump administration is proposing?  Well, no. A leaked draft notice last week revealed a tepid agenda on trade that is little more than a rehash of what the President said in his campaign rhetoric. It is not a real plan. The one action item identified in the Trump trade agenda is the announcement of a study to find out why the United States is losing in global trade. It actually doesn't focus completely on NAFTA itself, and we need healing in this hemisphere before we start looking around the world.  The reality is we know why the deficit is so bad. Bad trade deals have led to a loss of nearly 4 million American jobs and a deficit just last month of $43.6 billion. President Trump promised a trade deal that would get Americans back to work and reduce our deficit. Instead, our deficit with NAFTA and Mexico and Canada is 31 percent higher. It got worse than a year ago. So I hope the President understands the real urgency of stopping U.job outsourcing, especially in the manufacturing sector. He should do more than pay lipservice. He should really take a look at how thin his administration proposals have been on renegotiating this agreement. He should establish real goals and timetables for U.trade to drive policy that will fix these job-killing trade agreements and deliver real benefits for the American people.

356,KAPTUR,proceeding_id,topic-id,675,"If we look at this chart, just for those who are listening to us this evening, if you go back to the mid-1970s, as Congressman Cicilline pointed out, you will see the United States was pretty buoyant. We were actually exporting more than we were importing.  But then when China Most Favored Nation passed in 1979, 1994 NAFTA passed, and all of a sudden what was happening is the reverse flow started. We started importing more than we were exporting, and every time you get a billion dollars of red ink, you lose 5,000 more jobs in this country.  Well, my gosh, as NAFTA actually took full bore and then China permanent normal trade relations took effect here, CAFTA, which was the Central American Free Trade Agreement, here was the Colombian Free Trade Agreement, here was the Korean Free Trade Agreement, every single agreement that happened, we ended up getting more imports into our country than exports out, and promises were not kept.  Our focus tonight is mainly on NAFTA, but if we look at Korea, they were supposed to be taking 50,000 cars from us. We were supposed to have more balanced trade. Well, guess what, they didn't keep up their end of the bargain. Other markets around the world, such as Japan, remain closed to this day to cars from other places in the world.  You say: Congresswoman, that can't be possible.  I have seen it with my own eyes. I have visited there many times. When I first began my career, Japan had about--oh, 3 percent of the cars on their streets were from anyplace else in the world. Today maybe it is 4 percent, maybe it is 3.5 percent, but there are all kinds of nontariff barriers where they keep cars out. Yet you look at our country, they have put manufacturing plants here, they send product over here. It simply isn't a two-way street, and Japan is the second largest market in the world for automobiles. So the trade isn't fair. The American people know this. They are trying to fix this. It really requires the President's leadership to do it.  Congressman Cicilline talked about steel trade--I just want to put on the Record--with China, and we see what a big player she is in the market and doesn't play fair. I just want to put some numbers on the China's expansion of steel since 2000 has grown to over 2,300 million metric tons. That is a big number to imagine. But only 1,500 million metric tons are needed to actually serve the global marketplace. So what you have got is over 800 million metric tons of steel just floating around the world in warehouses and stored up in provinces in China, and they are dumping the steel.  Why does that matter?  Because in places like I represent, Lorain, Ohio, U.Steel just pink-slipped hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of more workers. Republic Steel, which sits next door to U.Steel, has shuttered their plant because of imported steel.  The President could do something about that. He could have done something about that the second day he was in office. Nothing has been done. All these workers, some of whom have worked in these plants for 28 years, in modernized plants where hundreds of millions of dollars of investment have been made to upgrade the capacity of these plants, rather than save that capacity for our country for the years ahead and to try to deal with this Chinese dumping, they are allowing more workers and more companies to go belly up in this country. It is wrong. It is wrong. This needs to be fixed. This is big time for jobs and economic growth in our country.  I want to thank Congressman Brendan Boyle, who understands this problem full well. As a younger Member of Congress and one who really speaks on behalf of working men and women in Pennsylvania and coast to coast, I thank him so much for taking time and joining us tonight. I yield to the gentleman.  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgH2680.txt
357,KAPTUR,proceeding_id,topic-id,1530,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Congressman He has raised so many important issues tonight on jobs and trade and how we fix this problem for the people of our country and, frankly, the world.  One of the issues is which banks are actually financing this outsourcing. I can tell you, they are not banks in the communities that I represent. They are not big enough to put all that money, to actually take these big companies and move them out of the United States and plunk them down in a Third World environment. It is largely Wall Street banks that do that. So they fly over the heads of people that live in communities across this country.  The gentleman talked about Nabisco moving. I had an experience. I went out to Newton, Iowa, a few years ago when Maytag was closing. I felt so bad as an American that a gold star label company that had manufactured reliable, high-quality products in our country was closing. I learned what was happening. What I didn't realize was that the production that closed in Newton, Iowa, large parts of it were moved south of the border.  I was traveling down to Monterrey, I was going down there, actually, to find out what had happened to someone who was murdered, who had been a student in our community and was murdered in Monterrey, We went by this big complex that said Maytag, Amana, all of these American companies that had been outsourced to I said: Stop the cab. I am taking a picture. This is exactly what I am talking about.  I said: Let me ask a question to some of the people that were walking by and living in the area. I said: Can the people who work in that Maytag plant in Monterrey, can they afford to buy the washers they make?  Guess what? In fact, where they lived, there was no running water. There was no decent water to drink.  I thought: This is what we stand for as a country? What is wrong with this picture? For our country, in districts like mine, the results of all this lopsided trade are that citizens in northern Ohio, on average, are earning $7,000 less than they did when this century began, because of this. The playing field is simply not level.  Several years ago, I was visited by a group of United Automobile Workers from Milwaukee, They told me--and I just love these wonderful, generous human beings. They had all been pink-slipped. They had just lost their jobs. They came to see me to tell me their stories on trade and what it had done to them.  They said: Marcy, we are training those who are going to replace us in But we went down to Mexico, and we felt so sorry to see where the people lived and the conditions under which they were working that we are collecting medical items, and we are doing humanitarian shipments to that town.  I thought: Oh, my goodness, what a generous group of Americans who are facing such horror in their own lives and yet they were doing that for people who live on this continent--and were, by the way, going to be earning, like, one-twentieth of what the workers in Milwaukee earned. So it was all about cheap labor.  I really felt bad for the cheapening of the Maytag product. I am probably going to get in trouble for saying that, but it is the truth. I certainly learned a lesson by traveling to Newton,  Now, another story, this is on plastic seals. I happened to visit a plant in the Tijuana area, and I walked through the plant in This company had been moved from Ohio and its equipment shipped down to  I walked through this plant. It was about 100 degrees that particular day. I turned the corner. There were no fans taking out the exhaust. It was bloody hot, and it had to be 110 degrees. These men were working. They had T-shirts on. It was very hot that summer. They were pulling down these large levers because they were melting plastic and rubber. I witnessed this.  I thought: Boy, that really looks dangerous with that thing that they are pulling down because it was moving like this. I thought: Boy, they have got to really pay attention every time they move that steam press down so they don't catch their arm in there.  I took pictures, and I sent them back to I got a letter from one of my constituents. This constituent said: Congresswoman, did you really take a look at the picture you took?  I thought: Well, yeah, I was looking at the workers.  He said: Look at the machine, the machine, up in the right-hand corner, the button with the tape over it.  I said: Oh, yeah.  He said: I used to do that job. Do you know what that button is?  I said:  He said: That is the safety button.  In other words, when the equipment was shipped and the machine started, life wasn't worth as much in Mexico, so these workers were working with much greater risk of injury to themselves because the equipment had been tinkered with in a way that told me a lot about health and safety standards and how they are really not enforced in places like  I finally want to end with a story that relates to trade. It doesn't just have to do with goods. It has to do with human beings, with people, and why renegotiating trade deals is so important for what our Constitution says we stand for: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. This is a country that believes in liberty and justice for all. It has to do with the undocumented workers in our country who are coming from south of our border.  We hear all kinds of rhetoric about that, but the truth is that I face the reality of what happened in the agricultural sector with What happened is we wanted two-way trade with Mexico, but what the trade agreement did is it caused great problems in Mexico in that over 2 million small farmers in Mexico were displaced by the NAFTA agreement because our country was 18 times more efficient in corn agriculture than the Mexican people. These workers and owners of these little ejidos, these little, tiny farms that were subsistence farms, they were just completely obliterated--2 million or more people.  Well, guess what? When you lose your livelihood and the trade agreement doesn't provide for readjustment, what do you think desperate people do? They run anywhere to eat, and north of the border looks pretty attractive.  As I heard all of these speeches during the campaign about what we are going to do on trade and how we are going to fix everything, I have never heard any of the major candidates talk[[Page H2684]]about: How are you going to fix the problem for the people in Mexico who lost their livelihoods, their ability to produce for themselves?  The undocumented worker problem has a big, big root in It was an uncaring set of governments that negotiated these agreements that caused that hemorrhage that creates an endless flow of people who are desperate, who will do anything to survive. You wouldn't want this to happen to your family.  I am all for yellow corn from the United I eat corn. I just served it the other night to our family. But when a trade agreement wipes out the livelihoods of millions of people, it upsets an entire continent. So now the solution is not to figure out a way to have readjustment in agriculture in Mexico as part of a renegotiated NAFTA agreement; the answer is supposed to be a wall.  Do you know what? Walls don't feed people. Proper trade agreements feed people when they are done the right way and you don't obliterate people's lives. That is what really matters.  When I see what the White House is producing, I haven't seen anything yet that really gets us to balanced trade accounts in a way that people matter and the communities in which they live matter. And it isn't always a default to what Wall Street wants and cheap labor and substandard working conditions and substandard living conditions.  We have to do better than that. We have to aspire to a system where people are invited into a trade union in which we have rising standards of living, where we have balanced trade accounts again, and where people's incomes and living standards rise. If we don't get there, we are going to have even greater social problems on this continent.  Today, I met with El Salvadoran workers, talking about the conditions in that country, what has happened there with the maquiladoras and the situations that people face in their daily lives. This race to the bottom is not working. It is not working in our country. It is not working in the Latin American countries or in We simply have to aspire to the highest values that founded this country.

There is a glut in the steel market globally. We have about 800 million metric tons of steel that are out there.  What China has been doing is building a steel company in every province to put people to work. Then, what do they do with the steel? They have been storing it because there is so much that the global market can't absorb 800 million more metric tons.  So companies like those I represent get hurt because they are trying to play by the rules; but the rules aren't being enforced properly, so they end up with the short end of the deal that is absolutely backwards.

As we complete our work here this evening, I wanted to reissue our invitation to Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross to travel to Ohio to come to U.Steel in Lorain to really see what is happening there to the workers; and not just Lorain--we are not selfish--but all over this country where steel companies are being harmed because of imports and the fact that China, Korea, and Russia are dumping on the international market.  We need to have an embargo. We need to let our industry survive and get over this hump of overcapacity.  We are going to need that production in the years ahead, for example, in the natural gas industry for piping and so forth. These are modern plants. America should not lose them. We have lost so many steel plants. We can't afford to lose many more for the sake of the Nation's defense.  I also wanted to invite the President to I hope that somebody is listening. He campaigned a great deal in I know he likes meeting people, and it certainly would be a good way to see the immediate challenge on the trade front where real lives and livelihoods are at stake in this country.                              {time}  1815  I also just wanted to end by saying this: When you create a system of trade where people are exploited in our country, or in other countries, that really isn't the best face that America can put forward. And unfortunately, what happens too often in our country now, for example, in trade with Mexico, when you have undocumented workers who come here, many in desperation, many of them are being trafficked across the continent. You say: Oh, Congresswoman, what do you mean trafficked? I mean, some of them come here because they are desperate, and they end up paying sometimes as much as $8,000 to come here and work at a very low-wage job. They never get out of debt.  We have to take that system and move it into the sunlight out of the doldrums, because we can't treat people like chattel. There are millions of agricultural workers, for example, who come to this country with no contract. They are completely indentured to whatever coyote brings them across the border. That is not the system I want for this country. That is not fair to those families. It is not fair to their children. It is not fair to the places to which they come in our country.  They always feel uncomfortable. What kind of a system, what kind of a trade system would subject them to that? We are a different kind of country. We aspire to higher values. We aspire to treating people and elevating their worth, not diminishing their worth as human beings.  We have a lot to fix in these trade agreements, and I hope that President Trump will join us. I would like to tell him about what coyotes do. I would like to tell him how they behave, how some of them have been involved in murder of individuals from my district who fight for labor rights so that no one is afraid, that people feel that they have a legal system that will defend them.  We need to get to that world. Our Constitution intends it for all of the people of our country. We should behave no differently internationally.[[Page H2686]]  So in closing tonight, I agree with the We need good jobs. We need real jobs. They have to come back to this country, and we have to treat people in other countries with worth, with their worth as human beings. We need to get back to trade balances, not trade deficits.

364,SIRES,proceeding_id,topic-id,406,"Mr.Speaker, as the ranking member of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, I am very concerned about these cuts. This undermines our leadership around the world and makes Americans less safe. When you consider that foreign aid is only 1 percent of our entire budget and helps keep Americans safe, it is an investment in our security.  Fully funding our State Department and ensuring our diplomats have the resources they need prevents conflicts, diffuses crises, and works to keep American soldiers out of harm's way.  U.foreign aid helps protect some of the world's poorest people from disease, starvation, and death. President Trump's own Secretary of Defense, General James Mattis, said: ``If you don't fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition. . . .''  I signed onto a letter led by Ranking Member Engel, along with my Democratic colleagues on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, urging the Speaker to oppose these draconian cuts.  We are already hearing from our allies all over the Western Hemisphere how dangerous these cuts could be to the stability of the region. Countries like Colombia fought a 52-year-long war with the FARC guerrillas, and now, when they need us the most to implement the peace deal, the Trump administration has signaled it is ready to abandon one of our strongest partners in the world. The President claims to care about protecting our sovereign border, but this budget says otherwise.

In Central America, we risk seeing a repeat of the 2014 crisis when nearly 70,000 children made the dangerous journeys from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador after being threatened with violence, assault, and forced gang recruitment. Our engagement in Central America is helping to bring calm to the region, and abandoning our friends in their time of need puts America at risk. Retreating from the world will allow other countries like China and Russia to take our place as a global leader.

I want to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Castro), who is a valued member of our committee, for his leadership on this critical issue, and also the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.Sires). I agree with everything that they have said heretofore about these draconian cuts.  I am here because I am rising to strongly reject the Trump Administration's draconian cuts to the International Affairs Now 2\1/2\ months into the Trump Administration, I find myself deeply troubled by the direction American foreign policy is heading on many fronts. I was particularly shocked when the White House released its fiscal year 2018 budget calling for a 31 percent cut to American diplomacy and development efforts.  In my view, cutting the International Affairs Budget by even a fraction of that amount would be devastating. We haven't seen many details, but a cut that drastic would surely mean that too many efforts and initiatives that do so much good would wind up on the chopping block.  Here is the bottom line: Slashing diplomacy and development puts American lives at risk. If we no longer have diplomacy and development tools to meet international challenges, what does that leave? It leaves the military.  Now, don't get me wrong. I have always supported a strong national defense, and I do support our military, and I do support giving them more money. But I also support using military force only as a measure of last resort. We should not send American servicemembers into harm's way unless we have exhausted every other option. If we are not investing in diplomacy and development, we aren't even giving these other options a chance.  We rely on diplomacy to resolve conflicts across negotiating tables at multilateral gatherings and in quiet corners so that we don't need to resolve them down the line on the battlefield. Our diplomats work to strengthen old alliances and build new bridges of friendship and shared understanding.  Just last week, the Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing on the[[Page H2688]]Trump Administration's efforts to decimate our International Affairs In his testimony at the hearing, former Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns said that morale at the State Department is ``at its lowest point in my memory.''  It is deeply disturbing to hear that our diplomats, many of whom serve in dangerous places at high risk to themselves and their families, are so disheartened.  Of course it is not just former diplomats who reject these cuts. A recent letter signed by more than 120 retired generals and admirals to House and Senate leadership said: ``We urge you to ensure that resources for the International Affairs Budget keep pace with the growing global threats and opportunities we face. Now is not the time to retreat.''  Mr.Speaker, I include their letter in the Record in its entirety.                                                February 27, 2017.

Dear Speaker Ryan, Minority Leader Pelosi, Majority Leader      McConnell, and Minority Leader Schumer: As you and your      colleagues address the federal budget for Fiscal Year 2018.      we write as retired three and four star flag and general      officers from all branches of the armed services to share our      strong conviction that elevating and strengthening diplomacy      and development alongside defense are critical to keeping      America safe.       We know from our service in uniform that many of the crises      our nation faces do not have military solutions alone--from      confronting violent extremist groups like ISIS in the Middle      East and North Africa to preventing pandemics like Ebola and      stabilizing weak and fragile states that can lead to greater      instability.

As Secretary      James Mattis said while Commander of U.Central Command,      ``If you don't fully fund the State Department, then I need      to buy more ammunition.'' The military will lead the fight      against terrorism on the battlefield, but it needs strong      civilian partners in the battle against the drivers of      extremism--lack of opportunity, insecurity, injustice, and      hopelessness.       We recognize that America's strategic investments in      diplomacy and development--like all of U.investments--must      be effective and accountable. Significant reforms have been      undertaken since 9/11, many of which have been embodied in      recent legislation in Congress with strong bipartisan      support--on human trafficking, the rights of women and girls.      trade and energy in Africa, wildlife trafficking. water. food      security. and transparency and accountability.

367,ENGEL,proceeding_id,topic-id,625,"Mr.Speaker, in 2013, Secretary of Defense Mattis similarly said: ``If you don't fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition ultimately. So I think it's a cost benefit ratio. The more that we put into the State Department's diplomacy, hopefully the less we have to put into a military budget as we deal with the outcome of an apparent American withdrawal from the international scene.''  That is from Secretary of Defense I couldn't agree with him more.  Now, I believe that development helps to lift countries and communities up today so they can become strong partners on the global stage tomorrow. A lot of us think we have a moral obligation to help cure disease, improve access to education, and advance human rights. But even if it were not the right thing to do, it would be the smart thing to do because those efforts lead to greater stability, more responsive governments, and stronger rule of law--populations that share our values and priorities. Poverty and lack of opportunity, on the other hand, provide fertile ground for those who mean us harm.  All these efforts, by the way, cost cents on the dollar compared to military engagement. People think international affairs and foreign aid are a massive chunk of the Federal budget, but the chart right over here next to me shows how it actually stacks up: 1.4 percent. And we make that sliver of the pie even smaller. It will come back on us in spades. 1.4 percent of our Federal budget goes to all these programs.  The diseases we don't combat will reach our shores; the communities on which we turn or backs may be the next generation of people who mean us[[Page H2690]]harm; and the conflicts we fail to defuse may well grow into the wars we need to fight later at a much higher cost in terms of American blood and treasure. Just imagine having to tell the parents of a young American soldier that their son or daughter was killed in battle because we weren't willing to spend the tiny sums needed to prevent the conflict.  Finally, let me say that the American people don't want to see us slash diplomacy and development. In fact, recent data shows that 72 percent of Americans believe the country should play a leading global role. Nearly 6 in 10 believe funding levels at the State Department should stay the same or increase.  Fortunately, the Congress is a coequal branch of government. I want to the remind the executive branch of that. We in Congress decide how much to invest in our international affairs, not the White  For example, regardless of how this administration is playing footsie with Vladimir Putin, Congress will devote resources to push back against the Kremlin's efforts to spread disinformation and destabilize our allies, just like they did to the United States during last year's election campaign.  I am hopeful that, as we move forward with next year's spending bills, we continue to provide our diplomatic and development efforts the support they need and the support they have received under Republican and Democratic Presidents alike.  With the President's proposed cuts, I fear what message we are sending to the world. The United States is the global standard bearer for freedom, justice, and democracy. If we cede our role as a global leader, make no mistake, someone will step into the void. It could very well be another power that doesn't share our values or our interests. Think Russia or some country like that.  We cannot allow that to happen. I am committed to ensuring it doesn't, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to firmly reject President Trump's cuts.  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgH2686-2.txt

In our conversation, they said to me: We need America's support to continue our work. If we stop now, all that we have accomplished until now is going to go for naught.  When you are talking about a small amount of money, the strong impact that it has on countries that, for decades, have experienced a great deal of corruption, and we finally have people that have stepped forward and want to fight this corruption and put their lives in peril every single day, I think we should support those people.

374,RUSSELL,proceeding_id,topic-id,577,"Mr.Speaker, it is official: the Oakland Raiders are moving to Las Beginning in 2020, they will play in a shiny, new 65,000-seat stadium outfitted with a retractable roof that is expected to cost $1.9 billion.  If you are an American taxpayer, you will help pay for it, even if you live nowhere near About $750 million for the project will be financed through municipal bonds, which are tax exempt. The Federal tax break is projected to amount to some $120 million, according to a study by the Brookings  Congress and President Trump should take the Raiders' bad example as an impetus for reform. As the President considers a $1 trillion plan to restore America's aging roads, rail, bridges, waterways, and airports, lawmakers should ask why so many stadiums are following the Las Vegas model, fleeing one bad economic State and using your tax dollars to go to another.  The alternative is what we did in Oklahoma City in 1993. Our residents passed a temporary 1 percent increase in sales tax to fund, without incurring a debt, a building spree called the Metropolitan Area Projects, or Over 5 years, the plan raised $350 million for nine projects, including a stadium now called the Chesapeake Energy Arena, home to NBA basketball's Oklahoma City This pay-as-you-go approach may sound unremarkable, but it is nothing short of exceptional.  Most professional sports stadiums these days are financed with municipal bonds, something that they were never intended to be used for. But this kind of debt wasn't intended for lavish football stadiums or basketball arenas. Municipal bonds were supposed to give communities a way to build public projects--hospitals, schools, roads--without having to pay Federal taxes on the debt's interest. The point was to ease the financial burden on cities and States that invest in expensive but essential infrastructure.  Over the past 30 years, however, stadium financiers have exploited a loophole in the Tax Code to qualify professional sports arenas for municipal bonds. Because Federal taxes aren't incurred on the interest of this debt, stadiums essentially receive a multimillion-dollar subsidy from  Last year, a Brookings study examined 45 stadiums built or seriously renovated since 2000; 36 were funded at least in part with municipal bonds, resulting in forgone Federal tax revenue of $3.7 billion. That is enough money to employ 88,000 military staff sergeants or give each State a $74 million block grant, or it could help reduce the national debt.  To solve this problem, I have introduced, along with my Democratic colleague, Earl Blumenauer from Oregon, H.811. This bipartisan No Tax Subsidies for Stadiums Act would prohibit arena financiers from using municipal bonds. Instead of building enormous, lavish sports facilities on the backs of unsuspecting taxpayers across the Nation, financiers should ask communities to buy into their vision. If residents want a stadium to be built, fine. They should be willing to pay for it like we did in Oklahoma City; or sports franchises and leagues always have the option to finance construction like most businesses do, privately.  Funding an upgrade to America's core infrastructure will be a challenge. It shouldn't require Congress to use budget gimmicks or run up the national debt.  Closing loopholes, such as requiring stadium financiers to pay Federal taxes on bond interest that was intended to improve our decaying infrastructure, would ensure taxpayers get the best return on their dollars to improve public infrastructure that all Americans use.

428,DURBIN,proceeding_id,topic-id,1157,"Madam President, there is a poem that I recall, and it goes like this:     When I was going up the stair,     I met a man who wasn't there.     He wasn't there again today.     I wish that man would go away.  I thought about that poem when I listened to the majority leader's speech about how cooperative he has been when it comes to Supreme Court nominations. The name he forgot to mention was Merrick Garland--Merrick Garland, who was nominated by President Obama to fill the vacancy of Justice Antonin Scalia; Merrick Garland, the only Presidential nominee to the Supreme Court in the history of the U.Senate to be denied a hearing and a vote; Merrick Garland, about whom Senator McConnell said: I will not only refuse to give him a hearing and a vote, I refuse to even see him; Merrick Garland, who was found unanimously ``well qualified'' by the American Bar Association; Merrick Garland, the person who received bipartisan support for appointment to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, the second highest court in the land.  So when the majority leader comes to the floor to talk about how cooperative he has been with previous Presidents when it comes to Supreme Court nominees, he conveniently omits the most obvious reason for our problems this week: the unilateral decision by the majority leader to preclude any vote on Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy of Justice  I know Judge I have met with him several times. He is a balanced, moderate, experienced jurist who should be on the U.Supreme We should not be entertaining Neil Gorsuch this week; we ought to be celebrating the first anniversary of Merrick Garland's service on the U.Supreme The reason we are not is that Senator McConnell and the Senate Republicans refused us that opportunity. They said: No, you cannot vote on that.  Remember their logic? The logic was: Wait a minute. This is the last year of President Obama's Why should he be able to fill a vacancy on the U.Supreme Court when we have an election coming soon?  That is an interesting argument. There are two things I am troubled with.  I do believe President Obama was elected for 4 years in his second term, not for 3, which meant he had authority in the fourth year, as he did in the third year.  Secondly, the Republican argument ignores history. It ignores the obvious history when we had a situation with President Ronald Reagan, in his last year in office, with regard to a vacancy on the U.Supreme There were Democrats in charge of the Senate and Democrats in charge of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and President Ronald Reagan, a lameduck President in his last year, nominated Anthony Kennedy to serve on the He sent the name to the Democratic Senate, and there was a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee and a vote that sent him to the  You never hear that story from Senator It is because it does not fit into his playbook as to why he would wait for a year and refuse to give Merrick Garland a hearing and a vote. The reasoning is obvious: Clearly he was banking on the possibility that the electorate would choose a Republican President--and that is what happened--so that a Republican President--in this case, Donald Trump--could fill the vacancy, not Barack  So when I hear the speeches on the floor by Senator McConnell about his bipartisan cooperation, he leaves out an important chapter--the last chapter, the one that brought us to this moment in the  I look at the situation before us today, and it is a sad situation for the Senate--sad in that we have reached the point in which a Supreme Court nomination has become so political, more so than at any time in history.  Where did the name ``Neil Gorsuch'' come from for the Supreme Court? It came from a list that was prepared by two organizations: the Federalist Society and the Heritage These are both Republican advocacy groups who represent special interests and are funded by special interests. They came up with the names and gave them to Presidential candidate Donald It was a list of 21 names. He issued them twice--in March and in September of the last campaign year--and Neil Gorsuch's name was on the list.  The Federalist Society was created in 1982. Nominally, it is an organization that is committed to originalism.[[Page S2181]]In other words, it looks to the clear meaning of the Constitution, what the Founding Fathers meant. They say that over and over again: Just look to the Constitution and read it, and then we will know what we should do. That was in a speech that was given by Edwin Meese, the then-Attorney General in 1985, who explained the Federalist Society's credo.  On its face, it sounds at least arguably defensible that there would be an organization that is so committed to the Constitution that it wants Supreme Court nominees who will follow it as literally as possible. Yet, as Justice William Brennan on the Supreme Court said, if they think they can find in those musty volumes from back in the 18th century all of the answers to all of the questions on the issues we face today--here is what he called it--that is arrogance posing as humility.  Yet that is what they said the Federalist Society was all about. If that were all the Federalist Society were about, then I guess one could argue that they ought to have their day in court, their day in choosing someone for the Supreme Court, but it is more than that. When you look at those who finance the Federalist Society--and it is a short list because they refuse to disclose all their donors--you see the classic names of Republican support: the Koch brothers, the Mercer family, the Richard Mellon Scaife family foundation, the ones who pop up over and over again. Why would these organizations be so determined to pick the next nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court? It is because there is so much at stake.  In a Judiciary Committee hearing, my colleague Sheldon Whitehouse went through the box score when it came to the Supreme Court and how they ruled when given a choice between special interests and corporate elites versus average workers and consumers and families. As Senator Whitehouse pointed out graphically, in detail, overwhelmingly, this Court has ruled for the special interests. Sixty-nine percent of the Roberts' Court's rulings are in favor of the U.Chamber of Commerce's position on issues, according to one study.  Why would a special interest organization like the Federalist Society care? It wants to keep a good thing going, from its point of view. That is why this is a different Supreme Court nominee.

429,SCHUMER,proceeding_id,topic-id,2168,"Mr.President, first, I sat at the back of the room to listen to my colleague from I know he got up because he wanted very much to respond to the majority leader, and I thought he did a great job. It was a pleasure to listen, as always, to one of the most articulate Members with whom I have ever served in any legislative body, as well as his having many other good traits.                             Equal Pay Day  Mr.President, today is Equal Pay Unlike many holidays on our calendar, Equal Pay Day is not actually a commemoration of some achievement. Equal pay for women is still not close to a reality. Women still make 79 cents for every dollar a man makes in the same position. African-American women are making 64 cents on the dollar. Latina women are making 54 cents on the dollar. That is not right. It is holding the American dream out of reach for too many women in this country. So Equal Pay Day is not a commemoration; it is a reminder that glass ceilings are everywhere and that there are hugely consequential and tangible barriers that women face every single day that men do not.  In 2007, the Supreme Court, in a 5-to-4 decision by the conservative majority in Ledbetter v. Goodyear, ruled that Lilly Ledbetter could not pursue her claim that she was entitled to equal pay. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which reversed this unfair Supreme Court decision, was the first bill President Obama signed into law in 2009.                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Mr.President, this leads me to the Supreme It is just one of so many examples of what is at stake in the nomination of Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, which we now debate here on the floor of the  I was listening to the majority leader earlier this morning, and I cannot believe he can stand here on the floor of the U.Senate and with a straight face say that Democrats are launching the first partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. What the majority leader did to Merrick Garland by denying him even a hearing and a vote is even worse than a filibuster. For him to accuse Democrats of the first partisan filibuster on the Supreme Court belies the facts, belies the history, belies the basic truth.  My friend Representative Adam Schiff said: ``When McConnell deprived President Obama of a vote on Garland, it was a nuclear option. The rest is fallout.'' Let me repeat that. Adam Schiff put it better than I ever could. ``When McConnell deprived President Obama of a vote on Garland, it was a nuclear option. The rest is fallout.''  Even though my friend the majority leader keeps insisting that there is no principled reason to vote against Judge Gorsuch, we Democrats disagree. First, he has instinctively favored corporate interests over average Second, he has not shown a scintilla of independence from President Third, as my colleague from Illinois elaborated, he was handpicked by hard-right special interest groups, not because he called balls and strikes. They would not put all of that effort and money into a caller of balls and strikes. These are ideologues who want to move America far to the right. He was picked by hard-right special interest groups because his views are outside the mainstream.  According to analyses of his record on the Tenth Circuit, which were conducted by the New York Times and the Washington Post, by experts on the Court, Judge Gorsuch would be one of the most conservative voices ever on the Supreme Court should he achieve that.  The Washington Post:       Gorsuch's actual voting behavior suggests he is to the      right of both Alito and Thomas and by a substantial margin.      That would make him the most conservative Justice on the      Court in recent memory.  That is why the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society put Judge Gorsuch on their list for President  As Emily Bazelon of the New York Times put it in a brilliant article that I would urge all of my colleagues to read:       The reality is that Judge Gorsuch embraces a judicial      philosophy that would do nothing less than undermine the      structure of modern government--including the rules that keep      our water clean, regulate the financial markets and protect      workers and consumers.  I ask unanimous consent to have that article printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, 1, 2017]                  The Government Gorsuch Wants To Undo                   (By Emily Bazelon and Eric Posner)       At recent Senate hearings to fill the Supreme Court's open      seat, Judge Neil Gorsuch came across as a thoroughly bland      and nonthreatening nominee. The idea was to give as little      ammunition as possible to opponents when his nomination comes      up this week for a vote, one that Senate Democrats may try to      upend with a filibuster.       But the reality is that Judge Gorsuch embraces a judicial      philosophy that would do nothing less than undermine the      structure of modern government--including the rules that keep      our water clean, regulate the financial markets and protect      workers and consumers. In strongly opposing the      administrative state, Judge Gorsuch is in the company of      incendiary figures like the White House adviser Steve Bannon,      who has called for its ``deconstruction.'' The Republican-     dominated House, too, has passed a bill designed to severely      curtail the power of federal agencies.       Businesses have always complained that government      regulations increase their costs, and no doubt some      regulations are ill-conceived. But a small group of      conservative intellectuals have gone much further to argue      that the rules that safeguard our welfare and the orderly      functioning of the market have been fashioned in a way that's      not constitutionally legitimate. This once-fringe cause of      the right asserts, as Judge Gorsuch put it in a speech last      year, that the administrative state ``poses a grave threat to      our values of personal liberty.''       The 80 years of law that are at stake began with the New      President Franklin Roosevelt believed that the Great      Depression was caused in part by ruinous competition among      companies. In 1933, Congress passed the National Industrial      Recovery Act, which[[Page S2182]]     allowed the president to approve ``fair competition''      standards for different trades and industries. The next year,      Roosevelt approved a code for the poultry industry, which,      among other things, set a minimum wage and maximum hours for      workers, and hygiene requirements for slaughterhouses. Such      basic workplace protections and constraints on the free      market are now taken for granted.       But in 1935, after a New York City slaughterhouse operator      was convicted of violating the poultry code, the Supreme      Court called into question the whole approach of the New      Deal, by holding that the N.I.R.was an ``unconstitutional      delegation by Congress of a legislative power.'' Only      Congress can create rules like the poultry code, the justices      said. Because Congress did not define ``fair competition,''      leaving the rule-making to the president, the N.I.R.     violated the Constitution's separation of powers.       The court's ruling in Schechter Poultry v. the United      States, along with another case decided the same year, are      the only instances in which the Supreme Court has ever struck      down a federal statute based on this rationale, known as the      ``nondelegation doctrine.'' Schechter Poultry's stand against      executive-branch rule-making proved to be a legal dead end,      and for good reason. As the court has recognized over and      over, before and since 1935, Congress is a cumbersome body      that moves slowly in the best of times, while the economy is      an incredibly dynamic system. For the sake of business as      well as labor, the updating of regulations can't wait for      Congress to give highly specific and detailed directions.       The New Deal filled the gap by giving policy-making      authority to agencies, including the Securities and Exchange      Commission, which protects investors, and the National Labor      Relations Board, which oversees collective bargaining between      unions and employers. Later came other agencies, including      the Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety      and Health Administration (which regulates workplace safety)      and the Department of Homeland Still other agencies      regulate the broadcast spectrum, keep the national parks      open, help farmers and assist Americans who are overseas.      Administrative agencies coordinated the response to 11,      kept the Ebola outbreak in check and were instrumental to      ending the last financial crisis. They regulate the safety of      food, drugs, airplanes and nuclear power plants. The      administrative state isn't optional in our complex society.      It's indispensable.       But if the regulatory power of this arm of government is      necessary, it also poses a risk that federal agencies, with      their large bureaucracies and potential ties to lobbyists,      could abuse their power. Congress sought to address that      concern in 1946, by passing the Administrative Procedure Act,      which ensured a role for the judiciary in overseeing rule-     making by agencies.       The system worked well enough for decades, but questions      arose when Ronald Reagan came to power promising to      deregulate. His E.P.sought to weaken a rule, issue by the      Carter administration, which called for regulating      ``stationary sources'' of air pollution--a broad wording that      is open to interpretation. When President Reagan's E.P.     narrowed the definition of what counted as a ``stationary      source'' to allow plants to emit more pollutants, an      environmental group challenged the agency. The Supreme Court      held in 1984 in Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council      that the E.P.(and any agency) could determine the meaning      of ambiguous term in the law. The rule came to be known as      Chevron deference: When Congress uses ambiguous language in a      statute, courts must defer to an agency's reasonable      interpretation of what the words mean.       Chevron was not viewed as a left-leaning decision. The      Supreme Court decided in favor of the Reagan administration,      after all, voting 6 to 0 (three justices did not take part),      and spanning the ideological spectrum. After the conservative      icon Justice Antonin Scalia reached the Supreme Court, he      declared himself a Chevron fan. ``In the long run Chevron      will endure,'' Justice Scalia wrote in a 1989 article,      ``because it more accurately reflects the reality of      government, and thus more adequately serves its needs.''       That was then. But the Reagan administration's effort to      cut back on regulation ran out of steam. It turned out that      the public often likes regulation--because it keeps the air      and water clean, the workplace safe and the financial system      in working order. Deregulation of the financial system led to      the savings-and-loans crisis of the 1980s and the financial      crisis a decade ago, costing taxpayers billions.       Businesses, however, have continued to complain that the      federal government regulates too much. In the past 20 years,      conservative legal scholars have bolstered the red-tape      critique with a constitutional one. They argued that only      Congress--not agencies--can create rules. This is Schechter      Poultry all over again.       And Judge Gorsuch has forcefully joined in. Last year, in a      concurring opinion in an immigration case called Gutierrez-     Brizuela v. Lynch, he attacked Chevron deference, writing      that the rule ``certainly seems to have added prodigious new      powers to an already titanic administrative state.''      Remarkably, Judge Gorsuch argued that Chevron--one of the      most frequently cited cases in the legal canon--is      illegitimate in part because it is out of step with (you      guessed it) Schechter Never mind that the Supreme      Court hasn't since relied on its 1935 attempt to scuttle the      New Nonetheless, Judge Gorsuch wrote that in light of      Schechter Poultry, ``you might ask how is it that Chevron--a      rule that invests agencies with pretty unfettered power to      regulate a lot more than chicken--can evade the chopping      block.''       At his confirmation hearings, Judge Gorsuch hinted that he      might vote to overturn Chevron without saying so directly,      noting that the administrative state existed long before      Chevron was decided in 1984. The implication is that little      would change if courts stopped deferring to the E.P.A.'s or      the Department of Labor's reading of a statute. Judges would      interpret the law. Who could object to that?       But here's the thing: Judge Gorsuch is skeptical that      Congress can use broadly written laws to delegate authority      to agencies in the first place. That can mean only that at      least portions of such statutes--the source of so many      regulations that safeguard Americans' welfare--must be sent      back to Congress, to redo or not.       On the current Supreme Court, only Justice Clarence Thomas      seeks to strip power from the administrative state by      undercutting Chevron and even reviving the obsolete and      discredited nondelegation doctrine, as he explains in      opinions approvingly cited by Judge But President      Trump may well appoint additional justices, and the other      conservatives on the court have expressed some uneasiness      with Chevron, though as yet they are not on board for      overturning it. What would happen if agencies could not make      rules for the financial industry and for consumer,      environmental and workplace protection? Decades of experience      in the United States and around the world teach that the      administrative state is a necessary part of the modern market      economy. With Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, we will be      one step closer to testing that premise.  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgS2180-3.txt

The question is no longer whether Judge Gorsuch will get enough votes on the cloture motion; now the question is, Will the majority leader and our friends on the other side break the rules of the Senate to approve Judge Gorsuch on a majority vote? That question should be the focus of the debate here on the floor, and it should weigh heavily on the conscience of every  Ultimately, my Republican friends face a simple choice: They can fundamentally alter the rules and traditions of this great body or they can sit down with us Democrats and the President to come up with a mainstream nominee who can earn bipartisan support and pass the  No one is making our Republican colleagues change the rules. No one is forcing Senator McConnell to change the rules. He is doing it of his own volition, just as he prevented Merrick Garland from getting a vote of his own volition. Senator McConnell and my Republican colleagues are completely free actors in making a choice--a very bad one, in our opinion.  I know my friends on the other side of the aisle are uncomfortable with this choice, so they are scrambling for arguments to justify breaking the rules. Let me go through a few of these justifications and explain why each does not hold up.  First, many of my Republican colleagues will argue that they can break the rules because ``Democrats started it in 2013'' when we lowered the bar for lower court nominees and Cabinet appointments.  Let's talk about that. The reason Majority Leader Reid changed the rules was that Republicans had ramped up the use of the filibuster--the very filibuster they now decry--to historic proportions. They filibustered 79 nominees in the first 5 years of Obama's Let's put that into perspective. Prior to President Obama, there were 68 filibusters on nominations under all of the other Presidents combined, from George Washington to George We had 79. Our colleagues and Leader McConnell, the filibuster is wrong? There were 79--more than all of the other Presidents put together. The shoe was on a different foot.  They deliberately kept open three seats on the second most important court in the land--the DC Court of Appeals--because it had such influence over decisions made by the government. This is the court, other than the U.Supreme Court, that the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation hate the most. The deal that a[[Page S2183]]number of Senators made in 2005 allowed several of the most conservative judges to be confirmed to that court--very conservative people. It left a bad taste in my mouth, and I am sure in my colleagues' and in many others.  But then, when President Obama came in, they insisted on not filling any additional seats on the court--which, of course, would have been Democratic seats--and eventually held open 3 of the 11 seats on that court. They said they would not allow those seats to be filled by President Obama--an eerie precedent, which the majority leader repeated with Merrick He didn't want the DC Circuit to have Obama-appointed, Democratic-appointed nominees; he didn't want that on the Supreme Court, so he blocked Merrick He didn't want it on the DC Circuit, so they wouldn't let any of President Obama's nominees come to the floor.  Merrick Garland's nomination was not the first time the majority leader held open a judicial seat because it wasn't the President of his party, and that was not during an election year.  At the time, I spoke with my good friend from Tennessee, Senator I asked him to go to Senator McConnell and tell him that the pressure on our side to change these rules--after all of these unprecedented numbers of filibusters--was going to be large. I said to Senator Alexander: Let's try to avoid it. But Senator McConnell and Republicans refused all of our overtures to break the deadlock they imposed.  To be clear, Democrats changed the rules after 1,776 days of obstruction on President Obama's nominees. My Republican friends are contemplating changing the rules after barely more than 70 days of President Trump's administration. We moved to change the rules after 79 cloture motions had to be filed. They are talking about changing the rules after 1 nominee fails to meet the 60-vote threshold.  So, yes, Democrats changed the rules in 2013, but only to surmount an unprecedented slowdown that was crippling the Federal judiciary, and we left the 60-vote threshold intact for the Supreme Court deliberately. We could have changed it. We had free will then, just as Senator McConnell has it now. But we left the 60-vote threshold intact for the Supreme Court because we knew and know--just as our Republican friends know--that the highest Court in the land is different.  Unlike with lower courts, Justices on the Supreme Court don't simply apply precedents of a higher court; they set the precedents. They have the ultimate authority under our constitutional government to interpret the law. Justices on the Supreme Court should be mainstream enough to garner substantial bipartisan support; hence, why we didn't change the rules; hence, why we believe in the 60-vote threshold; and hence, why 55 or 60 percent of all Americans agree with the 60-vote threshold, according to the most recent polls. To me, and I think to most of my friends on the Republican side, that is not a good enough reason to escalate the argument and break the rules for the Supreme  Second, as I have mentioned, I have heard my Republican friends complain that Democrats are conducting the first partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee in history, so that is the reason they can justify breaking the rules because Democrats are the ones taking it to a new level. Again, I have just two words for my Republican friends: Merrick The Republican majority conducted the first partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court pick when their members refused to have hearings for Merrick  In fact, what the Republicans did was worse than a filibuster. The fact is, the Republicans blocked Merrick Garland using the most unprecedented of maneuvers. Now we are likely to block Judge Gorsuch because we are insisting on a bar of 60 votes.  We think a 60-vote bar is far more in keeping with tradition than what the Republicans did to Merrick We don't think the two are equivalent. Nonetheless, in the history of the Scalia vacancy, both sides have lost. We didn't get Merrick Garland; they are not getting 60 votes on Judge  So we are back to square one right now, and the Republicans have total freedom of choice in this situation.  Finally, Republicans have started to argue that because Democrats will not confirm Judge Gorsuch, we will not confirm anyone nominated by President Trump, so they have to break the rules right now. That is an easy one. I am the Democratic leader. I can tell you myself that there are mainstream Republican nominees who could earn adequate Democratic support.  And just look at recent history. Justices Roberts and Alito, two conservative judges who many of us on the Democratic side probably don't agree with, both earned over 60 votes. They got Democratic votes. While there was a cloture vote on Justice Alito, he was able to earn enough bipartisan support that cloture was invoked with over 70 votes. He got only 58 when we voted for him, but the key vote was the cloture vote.  Let's have the President consult Members of both parties--he didn't with Gorsuch--and try to come up with a consensus nominee who could meet a 60-vote threshold. That is what President Clinton did with my friend, the Senator from Utah, in selecting Justices Ginsberg and It is what President Obama did with Merrick  Of course, we realize a nominee selected this way would not agree with many of our views. That is true. But President Trump was elected President, and he is entitled by the Constitution to nominate. But Judge Gorsuch is so far out of the mainstream that the Washington Post said his voting record would place him to the right of Justice He was selected by the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society without an iota of input from the  There is a better way to do this. I know it sometimes may seem like a foreign concept in our hyperpolarized politics these days, but there is always the option of actually consulting Democrats on a nominee and discussing a way forward that both parties can live with. We are willing to meet anywhere, anytime.  So my friends on the other side can dredge up these old wounds and shopworn talking points if they choose. If Republicans want to conduct a partisan, ``they started it'' exercise, I am sure we could trace this all the way back to the Hamilton-Burr duel. But at the end of the day, they have to confront a simple choice: Are they willing to break the rules of the Senate or can they work with us on a way forward? I, for one, hope we can find a way to compromise. Judge Gorsuch was not a compromise. He was solely chosen without any consultation. So it is not that there is a Merrick equivalency.  My friend the majority leader said: ``I think we can stipulate that in the Senate it takes 60 votes on controversial matters.'' If anything is a controversial, important matter, it is a selection for the Supreme Court, and Senator McConnell has repeatedly stood for the rightness of 60 votes on important and controversial issues.  If Senator McConnell wants to change his view on the 60 votes all of a sudden and Republicans decide to go along with him, it will not be because Democrats started it, because that is not true. It will not be because Democrats will not confirm any President Trump-nominated Justice, because that is not true. It will be because they choose to do so, and they will have to bear the unfortunate consequences.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgS2180-3.txt

433,CAPITO,proceeding_id,topic-id,553,"Mr.President, I rise today, as I have on a number of occasions in the past, to express the urgent need for action to protect the retirement security of our Nation's coal miners. Because of bankruptcies that have decimated the coal industry, we have lost over 22,000 jobs in our State, but more than 22,000 retired coal miners and their spouses are at risk of losing their healthcare benefits at the end of April.[[Page S2184]]  I have visited with retired miners from all across West Virginia to discuss this situation. During the February congressional recess, I visited the Cabin Creek Health Center in West The Cabin Creek Health Center serves hundreds of coal miners and their families. They provide pulmonary rehabilitation services for miners suffering from black lung. They also provide primary care services for miners and other members of their community. During my visit, I met with several retired miners who would lose their health insurance coverage if Congress fails to act. These individuals are suffering from serious medical conditions and were unsure how they would afford their healthcare if they were to lose their current coverage.  Just 2 weeks ago, I met with about a dozen retired miners from West Virginia who came to Washington to support the Miners Protection Act and to stand up for their hard-earned retirement benefits. Other groups of West Virginia miners have come to Washington over the past few months. All have carried one message to Congress: Keep the promise of our lifetime health benefits. On March 1, thousands of miners received notice that their health insurance would be terminated in 60 days. Most of these same people received that very same message just last As I listen to their stories, it is hard to imagine the worry these notices cause for miners and their families.  In December 2016, Congress included language in the continuing appropriations legislation that preserved health coverage for these retired miners for just 4 months. While that provision kept mining families from losing their health coverage--which is good--at the end of last year, a permanent solution is critically needed.  The 4-month provision from the December CR expires at the end of this month. It is vital--vital--that Congress take action within the next few weeks to provide healthcare and peace of mind for these miners in West Virginia and across coal country. Our retired miners deserve their promised healthcare coverage and should not have to receive another cancellation notice or another Band-Aid solution. We have a bipartisan vehicle for action. I have worked closely with Senator Joe Manchin, Senator Rob Portman, and others to introduce and promote the bipartisan Miners Protection Act, which would preserve healthcare and pension benefits for our miners. Our bill passed the Senate Finance Committee last year by a bipartisan vote of 18 to 8. I also would like to thank the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, because he has introduced legislation that would provide a permanent healthcare solution for our miners.  With all of us pulling together and with us working together, I am confident the Senate will act before the end of this month to continue these critical healthcare benefits for our miners. I ask my colleagues for their support in addressing this important issue for our working families.

434,CORNYN,proceeding_id,topic-id,2636,"Mr.President, yesterday the Senate Judiciary Committee voted out the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court left by the death of Justice During the meeting, as the Presiding Officer knows, our Democratic colleagues trotted out the same old tired arguments we have heard time and again about Judge  In the end, though, none of those arguments hold water, and of course many of them aren't even about him. Instead, these arguments reveal how our colleagues across the aisle are grasping for reasons to justify an unprecedented partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court  Some object to the nomination of Judge Gorsuch because they claim he refuses to answer specific questions. But I ask: How would any of us feel if the judge before whom we might later appear had previously, in order to get a confirmation of his nomination, made certain promises of how he would judge that case when presented at a future date? We would all feel more than a little bit betrayed and even cheated if the judge had prejudged our case before he even heard it. The judge is simply engaging in a common practice for Supreme Court nominees. They steer clear of any questions that may pertain to cases they may have to rule on later. It is a matter, as the Presiding Officer knows, of judicial ethics, and we wouldn't have it any other way.  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg set this precedent early on. During her confirmation hearing in 1993, she said she didn't want to give any hints or previews about how she might vote on an issue before her. So she politely and respectfully declined. Others followed her example, and Judge Gorsuch is, of course, doing precisely the same.  By any fair review, Judge Gorsuch has a history of 10 years as a judge sitting on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals out of Denver, He has a history of interpreting the law fairly, basing his judgments on the law and the facts, without regard to politics and without respect to persons.  That brings me to this argument that somehow he is against the little guy. Clearly, a review of the records demonstrates that this is not so. But, again, how are judges supposed to perform? Are they supposed to see the litigants--the parties to a lawsuit--in their court and say: Well, you have a big guy and you have a little guy, and I am always going to vote or render a judgment for the little guy without regard to the law or the facts?  I realize that sometimes our colleagues can weave a story that seems somewhat sympathetic when it comes to the fact that not everybody is guaranteed a win in court. As a matter of fact, when there are two parties to a lawsuit, one of those parties is likely to be disappointed in the outcome. But that is what judges are there for. That is what they are supposed to do. They are supposed to render judgments, without regard to personal preferences or politics or without regard to their sympathies, let's say, for one of the parties to the lawsuit.  Judge Gorsuch even said this during his hearing: No one will capture me. No one will capture me--meaning that no special interest group or faction would derail him from following the law, wherever it may lead. That is why Judge Gorsuch is universally respected. That is why he was confirmed by voice vote 10 years ago to the Tenth Circuit Court of No one objected to Judge Gorsuch's confirmation to a lifetime appointment on the Tenth Circuit Court of  Again, as the Presiding Officer knows, the Supreme Court of the United States only hears about 80 cases, give or take, a year. Most of the hard work gets done in our judicial system at the district court level and at the circuit court level, and almost all of the cases end in circuit courts, like the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, on which Judge Gorsuch serves. That is not to say that the Supreme Court is not important--it is--in resolving conflicts between the circuits or ruling on important questions of law to guide all of the judiciary and to settle these issues for our country, at least for a time, and maybe even permanently when it comes to constitutional interpretation.  Judge Gorsuch enjoys broad support from across the political spectrum, especially from his colleagues and members of the bar.  For 13 years, I served on the State judiciary in Texas, with 6 years as a trial judge and 7 years as a member of the Texas Supreme When I heard that Judge Gorsuch had participated in 2,700 cases on a three-judge panel and 97 percent of them were unanimous, that told me something special about this judge. It takes hard work to build consensus on a multijudge panel, whether it is three judges or nine judges, like the Supreme I think what we are going to see out of this judge is not somebody who is going to decide cases in a knee-jerk fashion but somebody who is going to work really hard to try to build consensus on the Supreme Court of the United  That is really important to the Supreme Court's respect as an institution of our government. What causes disrespect for our judiciary is when judges act like politicians, when they make pledges of how they will decide cases ahead of time or they campaign, in essence, for votes based on ideological positions.  Judge Gorsuch is the opposite of that, and that is the kind of judge America needs right now in the Supreme That is why later on this[[Page S2185]]week, on Friday, Judge Gorsuch will be confirmed.  In spite of all the evidence in support of the nominee's intellect and qualifications, without regard to the bipartisan chorus urging his confirmation, the Democratic leader has decided to do everything he can to prevent us from even having an up-or-down vote on his nomination. Unfortunately, he will be making history in urging his Democratic colleagues to engage in a partisan filibuster against a Supreme Court justice. In our Nation's long, rich history, there has never been a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. Now, some people want to talk about Abe Fortas back in 1968, which was totally different. But there has never been a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court justice until, apparently, this week on Thursday--not one of them.  Not one of my Republican colleagues mounted a filibuster when President Obama nominated Justice Sotomayor or Justice Both received an up-or-down vote. That is because that has been the customary way this Chamber has treated Supreme Court nominees in the past. Only four times in our Nation's history has a cloture motion actually even been filed. But cloture was always achieved because, on a bipartisan basis, enough votes were cast to allow the debate to end and then to allow an up-or-down vote on the nominee.  To show how new this weaponization of the filibuster has become, back when Clarence Thomas was confirmed to the Supreme Court of the United States, he got 52 votes--52 votes--and was confirmed and now serves on the Supreme Back when he was confirmed, no one even dreamed of its use. It was theoretically possible, but no one dreamed of the idea that someone would raise the threshold for confirmation from a 51-majority vote to 60.  Our colleagues have made it quite clear that they don't want to support any nominee from this So it is not even just about Judge It is about any nominee this President might propose to the Supreme And I think what it boils down to is this: Our Democratic colleagues haven't gotten over the fact that they lost the election. I think it really isn't much more complicated than that. They adamantly resisted participating in the legislative process. They dug their feet on every Cabinet nomination and now on the Supreme Court nomination. All they know is to obstruct because they haven't gotten over the fact that Hillary Clinton isn't President of the United  They keep bringing up Merrick Garland's name. Judge Garland is a fine man, a good judge who serves on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, but you would have to go back to 1888 to find a time when someone was nominated in a Presidential election year with divided government and where that person was confirmed.  What we decided to do upon the death of Justice Scalia is to say that the Supreme Court is so important that we are going to have a referendum on who gets to nominate the next Justice on the Supreme Our Democratic friends thought for sure it would be Hillary When it turned out to be Donald Trump, well, all bets were off, and they were in full opposition mode. But we would have respected the right of a President Hillary Clinton to fill that nomination because that is what we said was at stake in the election. I think it had a big impact on whom got elected on November 8 as President of the United States and who would fill that vacant seat and any future vacant seats on the Supreme  So here is the problem. If Judge Gorsuch is an unacceptable nominee, can you imagine any nominee by this President being acceptable to our Democratic colleagues? I can't, because Judge Gorsuch is about as good as you get when it comes to a nominee. He is exactly the type of person we should hope to see nominated to the Supreme  So it is time for our Democratic colleagues to accept reality and not to live in some sort of fantasy land and not to try to punish good people like Judge Gorsuch, who has done an outstanding job, because they are disappointed in the outcome of the election.  So here is the bottom line. Our Democratic friends will determine how we get to an up-or-down vote on Judge If they are genuinely concerned about the institution of the Senate, they will provide eight votes to get cloture to close off debate, they will decline to filibuster the judge, and they will allow an up-and-down vote on this imminently qualified nominee.  I am holding out hope that more thoughtful and independent Democrats will think better of the Democratic leader's strategy. Several already have, and I commend them for it. I hope more will come around to that idea, but as I and others have said before, regardless of whether they do, Judge Gorsuch will be confirmed. But it is up to the Democrats to determine just how we get that done.  I see a friend from Vermont here. I won't take much longer. I want to take about 3 or 4 minutes, maybe 5 minutes, to debunk some of the myths about how we got here.  I have in front of me an article written by Neil Lewis dated May 1, 2001. The title of this New York Times story is ``Washington Talk; Democrats Readying for Judicial Fight.'' It is dated May 1, 2001. That was, of course, in the early days of the George Bush administration. What it says is that 42 of the Senate's 50 Democrats attended a private retreat in Farmington, PA, where the principal topic was forging a unified party strategy to combat the White House on judicial nominees.  Mr.Lewis goes on to quote one of the people there who said: ``They said it was important for the Senate to change the ground rules'' by which judicial nominees were confirmed. And they did as a result of that meeting, which was led by Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School, Cass Sunstein of the University of Chicago, and Marcia Greenberger, codirector of the National Women's Law Senator Schumer, the present Democratic leader, and others, cooked up a new procedural hurdle for President George Bush's judicial nominees, and we remember what happened after that. It became almost routine for our Democratic colleagues to filibuster President Bush's nominees.  Ultimately, there came a meeting of a group called the Gang of 14, where there was a deal worked out that some of President Bush's judicial nominees were confirmed and others were returned and not confirmed. There was a decision made at that time by the Gang of 14, a bipartisan group, that there would be no filibuster of judicial nominees, absent exceptional circumstances. That was the language that they used--``absent exceptional circumstances''--that let us get by that obstacle and those filibusters for a time.  The next major development occurred in 2013, when President Obama really wanted to see on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals--the primary circuit court that reviewed administrative decisions--more of his Democratic nominees on that court. So in a new and unprecedented fashion, Senator Harry Reid changed the cloture rules once again--so-called the Reid For what purpose? It was a naked power grab. It was to pack the DC Circuit Court of Appeals--one of the least busy circuit courts in the country--in order to have judges confirmed by 51 Democratic votes that would rubberstamp President Obama's administrative actions during his administration. And sadly, it worked. They did just that.  So in a way, we are coming full circle, back to what the tradition in the Senate was before the year 2000, before Democrats went to this retreat led by liberal legal activists who cooked up this idea that you could filibuster judges, and they tried to impose a requirement of 60 votes for confirmation when, in fact, the Constitution contemplates a majority vote, or 51 votes for confirmation.  Some have said this represents the end of comity in the I don't believe that. Some have said this threatens the end of the legislative filibuster or cloture requirement. I don't believe that either. There is a big difference between a nominee by a President that is an up-or-down vote--confirm or don't confirm. There is a big difference between that and legislation, which by definition is a consensus-building process by offering an amendment, by offering other suggestions to build that consensus and get it passed.  You can't amend a nominee. All you can do is vote up or down. So I don't[[Page S2186]]believe restoring the status quo ante--going back before 2000 and restoring the 200-year-plus tradition of the Senate where you don't filibuster judges--I don't see that as a bad thing. I don't see it as the end of the legislative filibuster. It is completely apples and oranges.  It is true that 51 Senators will be able to close off debate and confirm Judge Gorsuch, and we will see that happen later this week. It also means that the next Democratic President can nominate a Supreme Court nominee, and that person will be confirmed by 51 votes. Again, this has been the 200-plus-year tradition of the I don't see that as the end of the I don't see this as somehow damaging our country--the restoration of the status quo before 2000, when our Democratic colleagues decided to weaponize the filibuster and use it to block judges based on this trumped-up idea that 60 votes would be required rather than 51.  I look forward to confirming Judge Gorsuch later this week. He is a fine man and a very good judge. He has exactly the sort of record we would want to serve on the No, he is not a liberal activist. Clearly, Hillary Clinton, if she had been elected, would have nominated somebody different. That is one reason why we choose whom we choose for our President, because of the kinds of nominations they will make, and I must say President Trump has chosen well in Neil  I yield the floor.

435,SANDERS,proceeding_id,topic-id,1401,"Mr.President, I rise today to oppose the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court of the United After meeting with Judge Gorsuch and having a long and pleasant conversation, after hearing his testimony before the Judiciary Committee, and after carefully reviewing his record, I have concluded that I cannot support a man with his views for a lifetime seat on the Supreme  The Supreme Court is the most important judicial body in this country. The decisions that it reaches, even on a 5-to-4 vote, have a profound impact on all Americans, on our environment, and on our way of life. As we decide this week as to how we are going to cast our votes regarding Judge Gorsuch, it is important to understand how that vote for Judge Gorsuch--for or against him--will impact the lives of the people of our country.  Let me give you just a few examples as to what is at stake. Seven years ago, in a 5-to-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled in a case called Citizens United, and in that case, by a 5-to-4 decision, the Court said that billionaires and corporations could spend as much money as they wanted on the political process. This decision, as all Americans know, opened the floodgates of corporate money, of money from the billionaire class, such that the wealthiest people in our country today can now elect candidates who represent their interests and not the interests of ordinary  That decision, Citizens United, is undermining American democracy, and in my view, it is moving us toward an oligarchic form of society in which a handful of the wealthiest people in this country--the Koch brothers and others--now have the power not only to control our economy but our political life as well. In my view, Citizens United must be overturned, and we must move back to a nation where our political system is based on one person, one vote, not on the ability of billionaires to buy elections.  Based on my conversation with Judge Gorsuch and a review of his record, do I believe that he will vote to overturn Citizens United? Absolutely not. Further, I suspect that he will vote to undermine our democracy even further by supporting the elimination of all restrictions on campaign finance, something which the Republican leadership in this body wants.  What the Republican leadership is striving toward is eliminating all campaign finance restrictions, such that billionaires can say to somebody: I am going to give you $500 million to run for the U.Senate from California, and you work for me--no independent expenditures. I will select your campaign manager, your speech writer, your media adviser, your pollster. You are my employee.  That is what the Republican leadership here wants. They want to undermine all campaign finance laws, and I believe that Judge Gorsuch will move this country in that way, a more and more undemocratic way.  Further, when we talk about the political process, it is important to point out that in 2013, again by a 5-to-4 vote, the Supreme Court gutted the 1965 historic Voting Rights Act, a law which was passed to combat racial discrimination in voting in a number of What the Court said, finally, is that in the United States, you have the right to vote no matter what the color of your skin is, a historic step forward in making this country the kind of country that it must become.  Well, as a result of that 5-to-4 Supreme Court decision in 2013 gutting the Voting Rights Act, literally days after, we had Republican Governors and Republican legislatures all over this country, under the guise of fighting voter fraud, passing laws--everybody knows this--intentionally designed to make it harder for people of color, for poor people, for young people, for older people to vote in elections.  In America in the year 2017, it is not too much to ask that all of our people who are eligible to vote be able to vote without harassment, without roadblocks, without barriers being placed in front of them.  I know it is a radical idea, but it is called democracy. It is called democracy. It says that if you are eligible to vote, we want you to vote. We want you to participate. It says that in America, where we have one of the lowest voter turnout rates of any major country on Earth, we want more people to be participating in the political process, not fewer people. There is nothing I have seen in Judge Gorsuch's record or in his recent statements to suggest to me that he is prepared to overturn this disastrous decision on the Voting Rights  In 1973, we all know, the Supreme Court decided Rowe v. Wade and declared that women have a constitutional right to control their own bodies. That decision has been subsequently affirmed by multiple cases as recently as last  In his confirmation hearings, Judge Gorsuch refused to state if he believed Roe v. Wade was good law and should be upheld. Based on his statements and general philosophy, I believe there is a strong likelihood that Judge Gorsuch would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade and deny the women of this country the constitutional right to control their own bodies. This would be an outrage. I do not want to be a party to allowing that to happen.  In addition, under Chief Justice John Roberts, the Supreme Court has time and again voted in support of corporate interests and against the needs of the working people of our country. After reviewing Judge Gorsuch's record, I believe he will continue that trend.  In a case called TransAm Trucking, Judge Gorsuch argued that a trucker was properly fired by his employer for abandoning his cargo at the side of the road after his truck broke down and he nearly froze to death waiting for help. Judge Gorsuch literally believed that this man should have had to choose between his life and his job, and by choosing his life--not freezing to death--he deserved to lose his job.  In another case, Judge Gorsuch ruled that a university was correct to fire a professor battling cancer rather than grant her request to extend her sick leave. I find these decisions troubling.  At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, when so many working people throughout this country feel powerless at the hands of the wealthy and the powerful and their employers, we need a Supreme Court Justice who will protect workers' rights and not just worry about corporate profits. I fear very much that Judge Gorsuch is not that person.  I listened carefully to what my friend, Senator Cornyn of Texas, had to say about this entire process. I have to say that in his remarks there was a whole lot of obfuscation because there is a simple reality that we are going to have to deal with in the Senate this week. Everybody knows, and Senator Cornyn made the point, that under Harry Reid, the former Democratic leader, the rules, in fact, were changed. They were changed because of an unprecedented level of Republican obstructionism, making it impossible for President Obama to get almost any of his nominees appointed.[[Page S2187]]  Let's not forget that in the midst of that controversial decision--and it was a controversial decision--the Democratic leader had the power also to say that we will waive the 60-vote rule regarding Supreme Court nominees. Democrats had the power, and they chose not to exercise that power in ending that rule--although, of course, they could have done that. I think the reason was that the Democratic leadership appropriately and correctly believed that on an issue of such magnitude, the appointment of a Supreme Court Justice, it is important that there be bipartisan support. But right now, it appears that the Republican leadership is going to do what the Democratic leadership did not do; that is, waive that rule and get their judge appointed with 51 votes.  So I would suggest to the Republican leader that instead of trying to push this nominee through with 50-some-odd votes, it might make more sense that, rather than changing the rule, change the nominee, and bring forth someone who, in fact, can get 60 votes.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgS2180-3.txt

It is absolutely appropriate today for us to take a look at what Russia and other countries may be doing to our news.  RT America, which broadcasts from studios here in Washington and is available on cable TV across the United States and across the world, for that matter, is one of the most high-profile assets in Vladimir Putin's vast $1.4 billion propaganda machine. According to the U.intelligence community, the Kremlin selects the staff for RT and closely supervises RT's coverage, including disinformation and false news stories designed to undermine our democracy.  Here we have a photo that shows exactly what I believe seems to be happening with This photo was taken from a declassified U.intelligence report, and it shows RT's editor-in-chief--and former Putin campaign staffer, by the way--Margarita Simonyan briefing Putin on RT's facilities. So clearly he is interested.  Well, I believe the American people have a right to know if a Russian Government entity is exploiting our first amendment freedoms to harm our country. It is galling that RT news has publicly--publicly--boasted that it can dodge our laws by claiming to be financed by a nonprofit organization and not the Russian  Well, what my bill--our bill--would do is strengthen the Foreign Agents Registration Act by giving the Department of Justice authority to compel foreign organizations to produce documentation to confirm funding sources and foreign connections. This is investigative authority that has been recommended by the Department of Justice inspector general, the Government Accountability Office, and the Project on Government Our bill would create transparency by giving Justice the authority it needs to investigate RT America and publicly expose its ties to the  The audacity of Russia's interference in Western democracies, including extensive meddling in our 2016 Presidential election, is deeply alarming, and we have learned that Russia's influence campaign reaches tens of millions of unsuspecting False news stories can end up on our Facebook timelines and our Twitter feeds. They shape the political conversations that we have with our friends at the supermarket and our colleagues at work.  These are just a few of the headlines from This one is actually from Sputnik, which is another Russian news outlet. They show the extent to which these false news stories are being spread around. This one talks about how ``1,000s Turkish forces surround NATO's Incirlik air base for `inspection' amid rumors of coup attempt,'' which suggests that we were involved in that coup attempt.  ``FBI wiretapped Trump Tower in search of `Russian mobster.' ''  ``Spying on Trump: CIA Whistleblower Points Finger at Clapper, Brennan, Comey.''  ``Ukrainian Su-25 fighter detected in close approach to MH17 before crash.'' You will remember that this was the plane crash over Ukraine--that the Russians shot down.  During our Presidential campaign in 2016, dozens of narratives and false news stories originated in Russia--for instance, this one, the baseless story that the Obama administration launched a coup against the Turkish Government from the U.airbase in that country.  Earlier, RT News ran numerous reports on supposed U.election fraud and voting machine vulnerabilities, claiming that the results of the U.elections could not be trusted and did not reflect the people's will.  Well, researchers have traced these and other stories to a common source: the Kremlin's sophisticated, multifaceted propaganda empire, which reaches some 600 million people across 130 countries and in 30 languages.  If you watch RT News, you will agree that it is not clear whether you are watching a U.news station or a Russian station because it has slick production values. It is arguably the jewel in the crown of this propaganda empire.  According to the U.intelligence community report declassified in January:       The Kremlin has committed significant resources to      expanding the [RT News'] reach, particularly its social media      footprint. . . . RT America has positioned itself as a      domestic US channel and has deliberately sought to obscure      any legal ties to the Russian government.  A prime objective of this propaganda barrage is to influence U.and European public opinion, create confusion, and shape election outcomes.  The Associated Press has identified a building in Moscow where an estimated 400 internet trolls--fluent in English and well-versed in American politics--work 12-hour shifts, creating false narratives and fake news stories. These stories are then seeded on the internet, they get validated, and they get passed on by popular websites and eventually end up on our radios, TVs, and smartphone screens.  In an incident earlier this month, a discredited former CIA employee went on RT News to charge that President Obama had asked British intelligence to spy on Donald Well, this false news story was then spread by legal commentator Anthony Napolitano on the FOX News show ``Fox and Friends,'' which is regularly watched by the The claims were then cited by President Trump and White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer to defend the President's claims that his predecessor had wiretapped Trump  Well, we know that during testimony before Congress 2 weeks ago, the NSA Director, ADM Michael Rogers, agreed with our British allies that the original RT News story was utterly ridiculous.  At an Armed Services Committee hearing last month, Philip Breedlove, Retired, the former Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, told us that when Russian-backed forces shot down Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine in 2014, the Russians put out four stories within two news cycles placing the blame on the Ukrainian Government and others. This is the headline that we see from The general said it took 2 years for[[Page S2188]]the West to finally debunk these false news stories.  We know that Russia interfered in our 2016 Presidential election. We know that a Russian influence campaign was one aspect of that interference. Our intelligence community has concluded that RT America is an arm of the Russian propaganda juggernaut, operating openly in our country and taking full advantage of our First Amendment freedoms.  I am sure we would all agree that everyone in the United States, in every organization, has a right to speak, write, and broadcast freely. That is what our First Amendment says. We are a resilient democracy. We are confident that our values and institutions will prevail in the free marketplace of ideas. Our Constitution protects the right of individuals and organizations to spread those Russian viewpoints, disinformation, and even outright lies, but the American people have a right to know if RT America is a Russian propaganda organ that takes its direction from the They have a right to know who is funding their operations.  RT has publicly boasted that it uses a shell nonprofit corporation to dodge U.laws. This legislation, the Foreign Agents Registration Modernization and Enforcement Act, would put an end to that charade. The legislation Senator Young and I recently introduced would give the Department of Justice the authority it needs to request documentation from RT News on funding sources and foreign connections.  As we see here, clearly the legislation has hit a nerve because Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov defended RT News, and Russia's State Duma is considering measures to retaliate.  What RT says about our legislation is that ``US senator wants to probe RT as a `foreign agent' . . . What's next, public executions''? Well, that is ridiculous. The editor-in-chief at RT News has said that my legislation is a ``persecution of dissenting voices.'' As I said, that is just nonsense. I welcome dissenting voices. That is what our First Amendment and the United States are all about. But it is not reasonable or acceptable for an individual or organization working in the United States on behalf of a hostile foreign government to conceal funding and direction that it receives from that government.  Vladimir Putin is not going to stop us from enforcing our laws and protecting our country. We have a responsibility to expose RT News, RT America, and the entire panoply of tactics that Russia has used to interfere in our 2016 election and that they continue to currently use to sow confusion and distrust and spread around stories which pretend to be news but which are not accurate.  Make no mistake, the Kremlin's influence campaign is an ongoing enterprise, and to the extent that it is successful, that it can operate under the radar screen, it will become even more brazen and more aggressive in the future.  In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee last December, Robert Kagan of the Brookings Institution said that Russia's broader objective is to subvert Western democracies, and we see that going on now in He said: ``For the United States to ignore this Russian tactic, and particularly now that it has been deployed against the United States, is to cede to Moscow a powerful tool of modern geopolitical warfare.'' That was a direct quote.  This is a profound test for our country. Our democracy has been attacked and continues to be under attack from this kind of news that is being put out by a Kremlin-funded organization which is a hostile foreign power. We need to understand the Kremlin's tactics, and we need to expose this propaganda here in the United States, including RT To that end, I urge my colleagues to support the Foreign Agents Registration Modernization and Enforcement Let's give the Department of Justice the tools it needs to investigate and expose RT  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

438,DAINES,proceeding_id,topic-id,1160,"Mr.President, today I am joining my colleagues on the floor with a bit of confusion, a bit of disappointment, and, frankly, a lot of questions. I am referring to the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch as the next Supreme Court  As a Senator, one of the most consequential votes I will cast is a vote to confirm a U.Supreme Court nominee. It is a lifetime appointment to our Nation's highest  I recently spoke with some students back in Montana, some FFA students. The average age 17, 18 years old. God willing, Neil Gorsuch may serve on the Court for 30 or more years. These FFA students' children and perhaps even grandchildren will be part of Neil Gorsuch's time on the Court, given that he likely will serve for three decades or more.  As it stands today, the Senate is on the precipice of confirming Neil Gorsuch to be our next U.Supreme Court Associate However, as the news has been reporting, as our Twitter feeds are overflowing with information, it looks as though my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are caving to the pressures of the far left, and they are set to unleash an unprecedented filibuster.  I have met with Judge I watched his confirmation hearings. What I have seen and what most Americans agree--Judge Neil Gorsuch has been incredibly transparent, he has been accessible, and he is the right man for the position. He is mainstream. He is a westerner. He is committed to judicial independence. He has a brilliant legal mind--that is without dispute. He is exceptionally qualified. In fact, the American Bar Association unanimously rated Judge Gorsuch as ``well qualified.'' That is its highest rating.  He has met with nearly 80 Prior to his hearing, he provided the Judiciary Committee over 70 pages of written answers about his personal record. He provided 75,000-plus pages of documents, including speeches, case briefs, opinions, and written works going as far back as his college days. The White House archives produced over 180,000 pages of email and paper records related to Judge Gorsuch's time at the Department of  Judge Gorsuch sat for three rounds of questioning, totaling nearly 20 hours, in committee. As the American people watched Judge Gorsuch before that committee, they saw an exceptionally qualified nominee for the highest Court in the land, someone who was bright, who was kind. I would argue that Judge Gorsuch's mind, his intellectual capacity, is only exceeded by his heart. This is a kind and independent jurist.  When he came before the Judiciary Committee, this was the longest hearing of any 21st-century nominee. He answered nearly 1,200 questions during his hearing, which is nearly twice as many questions posed to Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, or He was given 299 questions for the record by Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee--the most in recent history of any Supreme Court nominee. Judge Gorsuch did all of this with the utmost integrity and with transparency and humility. Yet here we are, with Democrats engaged in unprecedented obstruction, refusing to give Neil Gorsuch an up-or-down vote.  The Senate has only ever employed a cloture motion for a Supreme Court nominee four times in modern history. We voted on cloture when Justice Alito was nominated in 2006. We did the same in 1968, 1971, and 1986. In 1991, Clarence Thomas was confirmed on a 52-to-48 vote, and in 2006, Samuel Alito was confirmed on a 58-to-42 vote. In fact, when President Obama was in the White House, Republicans did not filibuster a nominee. This body confirmed Sonya Sotomayor in 2009 by a vote of 68-to-31 and confirmed Justice Kagan by a rollcall vote of 63-to-37 in 2010. We did not filibuster.  Let me remind folks that cloture is in place to stop debate, not to stop a vote. Cloture was put in place to speed the Senate up, end debate, and move to a vote, not to stop a vote. It was never intended to be a stall tactic or something to obstruct this body.  This bears repeating. Cloture was put in place to speed up the process, to prevent obstruction.  This Chamber has never had a partisan filibuster to a Supreme Court nominee. Let me say that again. This Chamber has never had a partisan filibuster to a Supreme Court nominee.[[Page S2189]]  So here we are today, with no other option but to invoke this so-called nuclear option to put an eminently qualified individual on the U.Supreme Judge Gorsuch is the definition of a mainstream judge. In more than 2,700 cases in which he has participated in the Tenth Circuit, 97 percent of them have been decided unanimously; in fact, he was in the majority 99 percent of the time. Yet Senate Democrats would rather play politics and place the demands of extreme liberal interests over ensuring regular order.  Let's talk about what we are and what we are not doing. We are in the Senate, a Chamber I am honored to serve in, representing more than 1 million We operate on a set of Parliamentary criteria based on things that have happened before. Therefore, we are going to establish a new precedent; we aren't changing the rules. This isn't happening for the first time. Let us remember that in November of 2013, Senate majority leader Harry Reid established a new precedent of how many votes are necessary on executive branch nominees, with the exclusion of Supreme Court picks.  What is even more shocking to me is that over the past few weeks, through the hearing process, through the debate and discussions about Judge Gorsuch on the floor, and with support from across my State of Montana--let me just name some of those organizations and people in support of Judge Gorsuch: the Montana Chamber of Commerce; four of Montana's Tribes--the CSKT, the Crow Tribe, Fort Belknap and Fort Peck; the Montana Farm Bureau, Judge Russell Fagg of the 13th judicial district, Judge Jeffrey Langton of the 21st judicial district, Judge John Larson of the 4th judicial district, State senator Nels Swandal, retired judge of the 6th Judicial District; the Montana NRA members; the Montana Grain Growers Association and the Montana Wool Growers Association; the Montana Stockgrowers Association; our attorney general in Montana, our auditor in Montana, our speaker of the Montana This is a very mainstream group of Montanans, leaders back home who are in support of Judge Yet my colleagues are rejecting the will of the American people, rejecting the will of Montanans, filibustering this nomination, and not even allowing for an up-or-down vote.

This measure undermines the privacy of all Montanans and all It is a measure I strongly oppose because it takes the refs off the field, leaving consumers at the whim of internet service providers. It allows these companies to sell our data--to sell my data--and to snoop through your search history and to track the sites we visit. In other words, it allows internet companies to make a profit by invading your privacy. It gives them the ability to collect and sell your physical location, information about your children, your health, finances, Social Security number, and web browsing history. In fact, this legislation even extends to apps and your social media accounts.  Following the vote that we had here on this floor, a Republican State senator from Buffalo, MT, proposed an amendment to our State budget to push back against this irresponsible resolution. In my home State of Montana, folks on both sides of the aisle are deeply concerned about their right to privacy. Now folks you don't even know can have access to the websites you visit, and they can have this access without your consent.  This is another troubling step that folks in Congress have taken this year to violate the rights of privacy of law-abiding citizens. We already have a CIA Director who has advocated for the most intrusive acts of the PATRIOT We have a Supreme Court nominee before us who supports the government's ability to reach into the private lives of law-abiding Now Congress is rolling out the red carpet for major corporations to collect and sell our personal online information.  Enough is enough. I am here today to provide a voice for all Montanans and all Americans who value their right to privacy, who expect their elected officials to defend civil liberties, to stand up for constitutional rights, and who do not want private information collected and shopped around like a used book on  When the President decided to sign this resolution last night, he ushered in the latest significant threat to our right to privacy. Now it is the responsibility of service providers to protect our personal information online.  I think folks in Montana and across this country have the right to question the priorities of those who supported this resolution. Everyone has a fundamental right to privacy, and the government shouldn't be in the business of violating those individual rights, especially when doing the bidding of big companies looking to make more profits at the expense of people's privacy.  I want it to be known in this body that Montanans don't want anyone snooping around in their private lives, neither the government nor corporations. It is fundamental to our Montana values.

451,GRASSLEY,proceeding_id,topic-id,2374,"Mr.President, today we will continue to debate the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United  The Judiciary Committee held four full days of hearings last month. The judge testified for more than 20 hours. He answered more than 1,000 questions during his testimony and hundreds more questions for the record. We have had the opportunity to review the 2,700 cases he has heard, and we have had the opportunity to review the more than 180,000 pages of documents produced by the Bush Library and the Department of Now, after all of this, my Democratic colleagues unfortunately appear to remain committed to what they have been talking about for a long period of time: filibustering the nomination of this very well qualified jurist.  Even after all of this process, there is no attack against the judge that sticks. In fact, it has been clear since before the judge was nominated that some Members in the Democratic leadership would search desperately for a reason to oppose him.  As the minority leader said before the nomination: ``It's hard for me to imagine a nominee that Donald Trump would choose that would get Republican support that we could support.'' That is the end of the quote from the minority leader.  He said later, and I will continue to quote him: ``If the nominee is out of the mainstream, we'll do our best to hold the seat open.''  Then the President nominated Judge This judge is eminently qualified to fill Justice Scalia's seat on the Supreme Court, and there is no denying that whatsoever.  Let me tell you some things about him. He is a graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Law He earned a doctorate in philosophy from Oxford University and served as a law clerk for two Supreme Court  During a decade in private practice, he earned a reputation as a distinguished trial and appellate lawyer. He served with distinction in the Department of He was confirmed to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals by a unanimous voice vote in this body.  The record he has built during his decade on the bench has earned him the universal respect of his colleagues both on the bench and the bar. This judge is eminently qualified to do what the President appointed him to do.  Faced with an unquestionably qualified nominee, my friends on the other side of the aisle, my Democratic colleagues, have continually moved the goalpost, setting test after test for this judge to meet. But do you know what? This judge has passed all of those tests, all with flying colors, so the people on the other side of the aisle--the Democrats in the minority--are left with a ``no'' vote in search of a reason.  Let's go through some of their arguments. First, the minority leader announced that the nominee must prove himself to be a mainstream judge. Is he a mainstream judge or not? Well, consider his record: Judge Gorsuch has heard 2,700 cases and written 240 published opinions. He has voted with the majority in 99 percent of the cases, and 97 percent of the cases he has heard have been decided unanimously. Only one of those 2,700 cases was ever reversed by the Supreme Court, and it happens that Judge Gorsuch did not write the opinion.  Then consider what others say about him. He has been endorsed by prominent Democratic members of the Supreme Court bar, including Neal Katyal, President Obama's Acting Solicitor This Acting Solicitor General wrote a New York Times op-ed entitled ``Why Liberals Should Back Neil Gorsuch.'' Mr.Katyal wrote: ``I have no doubt that if confirmed, Judge Gorsuch would help to restore confidence in the rule of law.''  He went on to write that the judge's record ``should give the American people confidence that he will not compromise principle to favor the President who appointed him.''  Likewise, another well-known person, David Frederick, a board member[[Page S2191]]of the liberal American Constitution Society, says we should ``applaud such independence of mind and spirit in Supreme Court nominees.''  So after hearing what people on both the right and the left have said about the judge, it is clear that he is ``mainstream,'' but the goalpost seems to move. Next we hear that the judge doesn't care about the ``little guy'' and, instead, rules for the ``big guy.''  First of all, that is a goofy argument. Just ask liberal law professor Noah If you ask Professor Feldman, he says this criticism is a ``truly terrible idea'' because ``the rule of law isn't liberal or conservative--and it shouldn't be.''  The strategy on this point became clear during our hearing: Pore through 2,700 cases, cherry-pick a couple where sympathetic plaintiffs were on the losing end of the legal argument, then find a reason to attack the judge for that result, and then, because of that case or two, label him ``against'' the little guy. As silly as that argument is, the judge himself laid waste to that argument during the hearing when he rattled off a number of cases where the so-called little guy came out on the winning end of the legal argument of a case.  At any rate, as we discussed at length during his hearings, the judge applies the law neutrally to every party before him, and that is what you expect of judges.  I disagree with some of my colleagues who have argued that judging is not just a matter of applying neutral principles. I think that view is inconsistent with the role our judges play in our system and, more importantly, with regard to the oath they take. That oath requires them to do ``equal right to the poor and the rich'' and to apply the law ``without respect to persons.'' Naturally, this is what it means to live under the rule of law, and this is what our nominee has done during his decade on the bench of the Tenth Circuit Court of So the judge applies the law ``without respect to persons,'' as he promised in his first oath he would, and he will repeat the oath when he goes on the Supreme  Then, of course, as they move these goalposts, the judge has been criticized for the work he did on behalf of his former client, the U.Government, when he was at the Justice  Of course, we have had a lot of nominees over many years who have worked as lawyers in the government. Most recently, Justice Kagan worked as Solicitor As we all know, she argued before the Supreme Court that the government could constitutionally ban pamphlet material. That is a fairly radical position for the U.Government to take. When asked about that argument during her hearing, she said that she was a government lawyer making an argument on behalf of her client, the U.Government, and it had nothing to do with her personal views on the subject. Now, there is a whole different standard for some people of this body. That answer is apparently no longer good enough. To hear the other side tell it, government lawyers are responsible for the positions their client, the U.Government, takes and the positions they have to argue. I respect my colleagues who are making this argument, but this argument does not hold water.  What, then, are my colleagues on the other side left with after moving these goalposts many times, after making all of these arguments that don't stick? What are they left with? Because they can't get any of their attacks on the judge to stick, all they are left with are complaints about the so-called dark money being spent by advocacy groups. Yes, that is where the goalpost took them--to dark money.  As I said yesterday, that speaks volumes about the nominee, that after reviewing 2,700 cases, roughly 180,000 pages of documents from the Department of Justice and the George Bush Library, thousands of pages of briefs, and over 20 hours of testimony before our committee and hundreds of questions both during and after the hearing, all his detractors are left with is an attack on the nominee's supporters--people out there whom the nominee probably doesn't even know. They raise money to tell people about him, which they have a constitutional right to do under the First Amendment freedom of speech.  The bottom line is that they don't have any substantive attacks on this nominee that will stick, so they shifted tactics, yet again moving the goalpost, and are now trying to intimidate and silence those who are speaking out and making their voices heard in regard to this nominee.  Here is the most interesting thing about this latest development: There are advocacy groups on every side of this nomination. There are people out there for him, raising money and spending the money for him, and there are people out there against him who are raising and spending money so people know why they disagree with this nominee. Of course, that is nothing new. That has been true of past nominations, and there is nothing wrong with citizens engaging in the First Amendment freedom of speech and in the process of being for or against and encouraging public debate on whether a person ought to be on the Supreme It was certainly true when liberal groups favoring the Garland nomination poured money into Iowa to attack me last year for not holding a hearing. For that reason, I didn't hear a lot of my Democratic colleagues complain about that money that could well be called dark money as well.  There are groups on the left who are running ads in opposition to this nominee and threatening primaries. They are actually threatening primaries against Democrats who might not tow the line and might not help filibuster this nomination. For some reason, I am not hearing a lot of complaints about the money that is being raised to make some Democrats who might support this nominee look bad.  As I have said, there is nothing wrong with citizens engaging in the process and making their voices heard. This is one of the ways we are free to speak our minds in a democracy. It has been true for a long, long time.  As I said yesterday in the committee meeting, if you don't like outside groups getting involved, the remedy is not to intimidate and try to silence that message; the remedy you ought to follow is to support nominees who apply the law as it is written and then, in turn, leave the legislating to a body elected to make laws under our Constitution--the Senate and the House of  Regardless of what you may think about advocacy groups, about their getting involved, there is certainly no reason that they should go to great lengths to talk about this in our committee or talk about it to the nominee because he can't control any of that.  The truth is, the Democrats have no principled reason to oppose this nomination, and those are words from David Frederick that I have quoted before. It is clear instead that much of the opposition to the nominee is pretextual. The merits and qualifications of the nominee apparently no longer matter.  The only conclusion we are left to draw is that the Democrats will refuse to confirm any nominee this Republican President may put forth. There is no reason to think the Democrats would confirm any other judge the President identified as a potential nominee or any judge he would nominate. In fact, we don't even need to speculate on that point because the minority leader has spoken that point and made his point very clear. Before the President made this nomination, he said: ``I can't imagine us supporting anyone from his list.'' So it was very clear from the very beginning that the minority leader was going to lead this unprecedented filibuster. The only question was what excuse he would manufacture to justify it. The nominee enjoys broad bipartisan support from those who know him, and he enjoys bipartisan support in the  I recognize that the minority leader is under very enormous pressure from special interest groups to take this abnormal step of filibustering a judge, because filibustering the Senate is not unusual but filibustering a Supreme Court Justice is very unusual. I know other Members of his caucus are operating under those very same pressures as well. In fact, yesterday, while the committee was debating the nomination, a whole host of liberal and progressive groups held a press conference outside of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, demanding that the campaign arm cut off campaign funds for any incumbent Democrat who[[Page S2192]]doesn't filibuster this nominee. Those groups argue that because the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee had already raised a lot of money off the minority leader's announcement that he was going to lead a filibuster, the committee shouldn't provide that money to any Member who refused to join this misguided effort.  Well, all I can say is that it would be truly unfortunate for Democrats to buckle to that pressure and engage in the first partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court Justice nominee in U.history--another way to say that is, the first partisan filibuster in the 228-year history of our country since 1789. If they regard this nominee as the first in our history worthy of a partisan filibuster, it is clear they would filibuster anyone.  I have stated since long before the election that the new President would nominate the next Justice and the Judiciary Committee would process that nomination. That is just what we have done through the committee, and now we are doing it on the floor. So I urge my colleagues not to engage in this unprecedented partisan demonstration. Everyone knows the nominee is a qualified, mainstream, independent judge of the very highest caliber. Republicans know it, Democrats know it, and the left-leaning editorial boards across the country prove that even the press knows it. I urge my colleagues on the other side to come to their senses and not engage in the first partisan filibuster in U.history and instead join me and vote in favor of Judge Gorsuch's confirmation.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgS2190-4.txt
452,GARDNER,proceeding_id,topic-id,2677,"Thank you, Mr.President, for the opportunity to come to the floor today in support of Judge Neil Gorsuch's confirmation to the Supreme As a Coloradan, it gives me great honor to be here to talk about his nomination, the exceptional qualities of Judge Gorsuch, and how he will make us proud from the bench of the U.Supreme  I also commend my colleague, Chairman Chuck Grassley, for his work on the Judiciary Committee presiding over a very fair series of hearings, giving members on both sides of the aisle time to learn about Judge Gorsuch, to question Judge Gorsuch, and the time to present their side of the argument depending on whatever side that was going to be. Because of the fairness of the hearings, because of the fairness with which Chairman Grassley executed the hearings, it is quite obvious that this Chamber is faced with a very exceptional judge, a very exceptional nominee, and a nominee there is really no excuse to vote against.  Neil Gorsuch really is about the story of the He is a fourth-generation It is nice to stand here and talk about somebody who shares so much of our western experience and western heritage and somebody who serves on the Tenth Circuit Court in Denver--a circuit court that represents 20 percent of the land mass of the United  Neil Gorsuch's background and upbringing in Colorado represent the hard work of westerners. His maternal grandfather, Joseph McGill, began his adult life by working in Union Station, the main railway terminal in downtown McGill put himself through medical school and went on to become a prominent surgeon. His grandmother, Dorothy Jean, raised seven children, all of whom he gave a better life and put through college because of his work in  Neil's paternal grandfather, John Gorsuch, was his legal inspiration. After serving in World War I, John Gorsuch put himself through undergrad and law school at the University of Denver by driving a trolley car back in the trolley car days of John, his grandfather, helped to build a private law practice that focused on real estate law. He made time to help Denver's welfare department and participated in Kiwanis and numerous other civic organizations, building a legendary law firm in Denver known as Gorsuch  This is the kind of upbringing that made Neil Gorsuch who he is. In his younger days, Neil moved furniture, shoveled snow, like so many of us in Colorado, mowed lawns. It was the kind of upbringing that brings grit and determination to any person who knows hard work. It is that work ethic, combined with his family's appreciation of higher education, that helped Neil consistently realize academic excellence. It has been debated on this floor numerous times, his academic credentials that he would bring to the Supreme Court--his background and education at Columbia, law school at Harvard, his Ph.at Oxford, and of course, most importantly, the summer he spent at the University of Colorado and the teaching he carries out at the University of Colorado School of  This week, we are going to see a lot of finger-pointing and hear a lot of accusations. We are going to hear a lot of blame. The one thing we may not hear too much about is the person we are debating--Neil That is because when it comes to Judge Gorsuch, people understand the highly qualified judge that he is. People understand the incredible legal mind he would bring to the Supreme Instead of debating the merits of the nominee, they are going to debate how we got to the place we are today, and by the end of this week, architects of obstruction may force this Chamber to vote along partisan lines on something that should be a bipartisan effort.  In Colorado, if you go to downtown Denver, you will see an area known as Confluence Confluence Park is a great place in Colorado where people go to spend an afternoon and perhaps a weekend on a hot summer's day. It is where two rivers join together. There at Confluence Park, Colorado's poet laureate, Thomas Hornsby Ferril, has a poem inscribed on a plaque, which reads:       I wasn't here. Yet I remember them, the first night long      ago, those wagon people who pushed aside enough of the      cottonwoods to build our city where the blueness rested.  It is a poem that reminds us in Colorado that we are always looking up, that we are always looking toward the mountains and to that great blue sky. That is what Neil Gorsuch has done his entire life. He is somebody who is forward-thinking, somebody who understands the optimistic sense of Colorado, who understands the majesty of our West, and who understands the majesty of our form of government--a system that has three separate but equal branches of power. He has led a life that is dedicated to the majesty of our He is somebody who understands the pillars of our government in that no one branch of government should gain an unfair advantage over the other. That is what we ought to be debating this week. Instead, we are going to live the consequences of decisions that were made over a decade ago.  It is interesting that Judge Gorsuch serves on the Tenth Circuit Court because one of his fellow judges on the Tenth Circuit Court was nominated by President George Bush in the early part of 2001, 2002, 2003. It was Tim Tymkovich who was nominated by President Bush and who was caught up in the very first round of filibusters that changed the way this Chamber worked on nominations.  It was a calculated determination by some in this Chamber to use a tool that had never been used before in such a lethal, partisan fashion that it would bring down judges and ultimately lead to a corrosion of Senate custom--a corrosion of over 200 years of Senate practice--when it comes to judges' confirmations. Ultimately, this week, we will see whether it leads to the disruption of how we confirm Supreme Court  Make no mistake about it, over the past 200 years, we have not seen this moment before--a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court People are going to talk about this around the country as they read the news, as they listen to the radio, as they watch on TV what is happening in the Most will just wonder, is the nominee qualified? If the nominee is qualified, then why are we trying to have an argument about ``he said, she said'' 15 years ago, 16 years ago? Because the nominee is well qualified, he should be confirmed. Why are we going to change 200 years of Senate practice and custom if the nominee is highly qualified, has what it takes to serve on the Supreme Court? That is the choice Members of this Chamber will have to make over the next several days as we work to confirm Judge  In 2006 when Judge Gorsuch was confirmed to serve on the Tenth Circuit[[Page S2193]]Court in Denver, this Chamber did so unanimously by voice vote. There are a dozen Members in this Chamber who served then and did not oppose his nomination, many of whom seem willing today to block his nomination to the Supreme  One thing has changed in the intervening years; that is, who serves in the Presidency, who serves in the White House, who serves as President, and whether that nomination came from a Republican or a The nomination, of course, in 2006 came from a Still, he was confirmed unanimously. Judge Gorsuch, now nominated to serve on the Supreme Court, was appointed by a Yet those very same people who supported him 11 years ago are now objecting to his service on the High Court after his exemplary decade of service on the Tenth Circuit  It was service that showed Judge Gorsuch's joining in over 2,700 opinions, and with the majority the vast number of times. It was service in which he got to know the Colorado legal community. As we have discussed over the past several days and several weeks and the past month, the people who know Judge Gorsuch the best are the people who served with him and who worked with him at the Department of Justice, who practiced law with him, and who serve in the Colorado legal community. I thought it was important that we spend some time in talking about the people who know Judge Gorsuch the best because I think their opinions matter in this--those of the people of Colorado who want Judge Gorsuch confirmed.  Let me start with a series of quotes from Judge Gorsuch's supporters back home in Colorado--again, those people who know him the best.  This particular quote comes not from a Republican, not from a conservative; this quote comes from Steve Farber, who served in 2008 as the Democratic National Convention cochair. Again, he is not a conservative and he is not a Republican; he was the cochair of the 2008 Democratic National       We know Judge Gorsuch to be a person of utmost character.      He is fair, decent, and honest, both as a judge and a person.  Steve Farber continues:       We all agree that Judge Gorsuch is exceptionally well      qualified to join the Supreme He deserves an up-or-     down vote.  This is not Mitch McConnell who is saying this. It is not Cory Gardner, Republican Senator from Colorado, who is saying this. This is a very prominent figure in Colorado's legal community and somebody who served in the 2008 Democratic National  One of those 12 people who supported Judge Gorsuch in 2006 was then-Senator Barack Obama, who was seeking the nomination at Mile High Stadium, at this very convention of which Steve Farber was cochair. Steve Farber says we should confirm Judge Gorsuch with an up-or-down vote.  Norm Brownstein said that Judge Gorsuch deserves a fair shake in the confirmation process. He is another very prominent Democratic lawyer in  We have heard a lot of people talk about the cases--those 2,700 opinions--that he was a part of. We have heard Senator Grassley talk about arguments against Judge Gorsuch, people who have said that Judge Gorsuch was always against the little guy and that he was siding with corporations.  Here is a quote from a Denver lawyer and Democrat on representing underdogs before Judge Gorsuch:       [Judge Gorsuch] issued a decision that, most certainly,      focused on the little guy.  Why did Marcy Glenn say this? Marcy Glenn said this because she knows that Judge Gorsuch voted with the majority of the court in 99 percent of the cases. In those 2,700 opinions, 99 percent of the time, Judge Gorsuch ruled with the majority. That is not trying to look out for the big guy or the little guy. That is about following the law. That is about a court that recognizes it is not in the business of focus groups or policy preferences, popularity contests or poll testing. It is about a judge who recognizes that the rule of law matters and that you take an opinion where the law leads you and takes you, not where your personal opinion takes you. It was 99 percent of the time that Judge Gorsuch voted to side with the majority on the court, and 97 percent of the time, those rulings were unanimous. Those decisions were unanimous. Of those 99 percent in which he sided with the majority, 97 percent of them were unanimously decided.  This is a judge who is as mainstream as we have seen. He is somebody who understands the obligation and the duty he has to the law. He is somebody who understands what it means to be a good judge.  I want to read a letter Senator Bennet and I received from the Colorado legal community:       As members of the Colorado legal community, we are proud to      support the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be our next      Supreme Court We hold a diverse set of political      views as Republicans, Democrats, and  That is bipartisan support back home from those people who know the judge the best.  What does Neil Gorsuch think it takes to be a good and faithful judge? I will just read from Judge Gorsuch:       It seems to me that the separation of legislative and      judicial powers isn't just a formality dictated by the      Neither is it just about ensuring that two      institutions, with basically identical functions, are      balanced one against the other. To the Founders, the      legislative and judicial powers were distinct by nature, and      their separation was among the most important liberty-     protecting devices of the constitutional design--an      independent right of people essential to the preservation of      all of the rights later enumerated in the Constitution and      its amendments.       Now, consider, if we allow the judge to act like a      legislator, unconstrained by the bicameralism and presentment      hurdles of Article I, the judge would need only his own voice      or those of just a few colleagues to revise the law, willy-     nilly, in accordance with his preferences, and the task of      legislating would become a relatively simple thing.       Notice too how hard it would be to revise this so easily      made judicial legislation to account for changes in the world      or to fix mistakes. Being unable to throw judges out of      office in regular elections, you would have to wait for them      to die before you would have any chance of change. Even then,      you would find the change difficult, for courts cannot so      easily undo the errors given the weight that they afford to      precedent.       Notice, finally, how little voice the people would be left      in a government in which life-appointed judges are free to      legislate alongside elected representatives. The very idea of      self-government would seem to wither to the point of      pointlessness. Indeed, it seems that, for reasons just like      these, Hamilton explained, that liberty can have nothing to      fear from the judiciary alone but that it has everything to      fear from the union of the judicial and legislative powers.  That is what Judge Gorsuch said makes a good and faithful judge.  Over the course of the next week or over the course of the next several days, we are going to flesh out in detail some of the decisions people may find they disagree with. We will flesh out in detail Judge Gorsuch's temperament and his performance at the committee hearings. Yet there is no doubt that Judge Gorsuch has the support of the American people, who believe he should be confirmed. There is no doubt that Judge Gorsuch has the support of people who cochaired the Democratic National Convention and of prominent attorneys who know him best from There is no doubt that his is an upbringing from the It is the story of how we built the  I hope that over the course of the next few days, Republicans and Democrats alike will come to the conclusion that we will do this country a service. Instead of having partisan fights, we will have the bipartisanship support for a judge who will truly make this country proud, a judge who will truly represent the law, not personal opinion.  I thank the Presiding Officer for this opportunity today. I look forward to being here for the rest of the week as we talk about Judge Gorsuch's qualifications and as we talk about the nomination.  More than anything, let's make it clear that for 200-plus years, we have allowed judges to come to this floor for the Supreme Court and to be confirmed by a simple majority--no threshold, no 60-vote requirement. We have done so without partisan filibusters. I think that if we can maintain that custom, that practice, this country will be better served. There is no reason to change two centuries of practice in this body simply because they have decided they do not like the person who made the nomination.  I yield the floor.

453,HIRONO,proceeding_id,topic-id,945,"Mr.President, over the next hour, a number of my colleagues and I will join together to speak in opposition to the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be an Associate Justice of the U.Supreme We are joining together today because this nomination is not just about the future of the Supreme It is about the future of our country.  There is no question about Judge Gorsuch's credentials or about his intellect. He is a graduate of Columbia and Harvard and has been a judge on the Tenth Circuit Court for more than a decade. In fact, his credentials are in stark contrast to so many of the dangerously unqualified individuals President Trump appointed to his  Judge Gorsuch should not get a pass simply because we are relieved that President Trump didn't nominate a member of his family or a reality television personality for this job. Credentials cannot and should not be the only points we consider when evaluating a lifetime appointment to the Supreme In fact, we should expect that anyone nominated to the Supreme Court will at least have impressive credentials.  By many accounts, Judge Gorsuch would be the most conservative Justice on the Court--even more conservative than Justice Thomas or Justice Rightwing advocacy groups cheered his nomination and have spent over $10 million to support his nomination. They spent this money because they have high confidence that he will rule in their favor on so many of the tough cases that will come before the Supreme These groups, including the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society, selected Judge Gorsuch because he meets their litmus test for how they think a Justice should rule. They selected him because they understood Judge Gorsuch clearly met the litmus test the President outlined during his campaign.  To paraphrase, Donald Trump wanted a judge who would prioritize the religious freedom of a corporation over the rights of its employees, uphold an expansive view of the Second Amendment, making it much tougher to enact sensible gun legislation to protect our communities, and who would overturn Roe v. Wade--as Donald Trump put it--automatically.  Judge Gorsuch's credentials are just a starting point. For the people who need justice most urgently, Judge Gorsuch's view of the law and his judicial philosophy will make a world of difference. The working families, women, differently abled, people of color, the LGBTQ community, immigrants, students, seniors, and our Native peoples are the people who will be impacted by the decisions a Justice Gorsuch would make.  Today, April 4, is Equal Pay Day, which means that it took women until today to make the same amount that men made in 2016. Women have had to work more than 3 months longer to catch up, on average, to men.  This significant pay disparity has existed for centuries, but it has been illegal in the United States since the passage of the Equal Pay Act in 1963. Proving illegal pay disparity under this law has been challenging, as we all know.  Nationally, women are paid only 79 cents for every dollar a man is paid. In Hawaii, women are paid only 82 cents for every dollar a man makes. That is a little better than the rest of the country, but it is in no way good enough.  At the median salary, that 82 cents translates into about $8,000 less per year in wages for a woman in That is a lot of money in my State, where the high cost of living makes it even more difficult for working families to get ahead--not to mention that many working families in Hawaii, as well as in other States, are headed by women. My immigrant family was headed by my mother.  As we mark Equal Pay Day, I am well aware of the tremendous impact a single Justice can have on the lives and rights of millions of  Under Chief Justice John Roberts, the Supreme Court has issued numerous 5-to-4 decisions that have favored corporate interests over the rights of individuals--cases like Shelby County, Citizens United, and Hobby  One of the most deeply flawed of these 5-to-4 decisions was in a 2007 case called Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber That decision had the effect of denying justice to a woman who had suffered pay discrimination for more than a decade. The Court said, in effect, that because Lilly Ledbetter didn't learn of the pay discrimination until it was too late, our justice system could not help her.  Put another way, under the ruling, employers could discriminate against women so long as the employers made sure the women didn't find out about it.  This will not be hard to do, as employers are not likely to announce that they are providing discriminatory pay to their female employees. This is what happened to Lilly She didn't know.  This decision was deeply wrong and surprised many Court watchers. It undid years of judicial precedent.  I remember learning of this decision in I was serving on the House Education and Labor Committee of the U.House of Representatives at that time.  The Supreme Court decision interpreted a Federal law that fell within the jurisdiction of the committee on which I sat. George Miller, then chair of the committee, immediately announced that we would change the law to be interpreted the way it had been before the Court applied their own narrow and wrong interpretation.  We passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act with a Democratic Congress in 2009. Frankly, I doubt a Republican-controlled House and Senate would have done the same. It was the first bill President Obama signed into law. I was there for that bill signing.  Though we could not retroactively help ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgS2190-4.txt
454,DUCKWORTH,proceeding_id,topic-id,876,"Mr.President, today on Equal Pay Day, we are reminded of the fact that women across the country still make less money for the exact same work as their male counterparts, which is especially problematic for women of color, for whom the gap is even wider. We are also reminded of how vital our court system is to the future of equal opportunity for women in America and to the future of our working families.  The next Supreme Court Justice will enter the Court at a critical moment for women's rights--a moment which could change the course of reproductive rights, voting rights, disability rights, and civil liberties in our Nation for generations to come. So naturally, I, much like my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, wanted to know how these critical issues fit in Judge[[Page S2196]]Gorsuch's judicial philosophy. I have serious concerns with his record of failing to protect women's health--granting corporations and healthcare providers leeway to undermine women's access to care. I am also troubled by his rulings on disability rights that would jeopardize access to public education for students with disabilities, which is particularly alarming for the 27 million women in America who live with a disability.  It is personal for me. As an American living with disabilities, my life isn't like those of many of my colleagues in Getting around can be difficult. I can't always get into restaurants or other public spaces, even here in the I have to spend a lot of time planning how to get from one place to another.  I understand that not everyone thinks about these things, and for most of my adult life, I didn't either. But after I became injured in combat in Iraq, I learned how important the protections of laws like the Americans with Disabilities Act and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act are to ensuring that millions of Americans with disabilities can live and thrive with dignity. Without them, Americans like me wouldn't be able to get to work, go to school, hold a job, pay taxes, go shopping, or do any of the things most of us take for granted. That is why I am speaking out today, because it matters deeply to me that our next Supreme Court Justice understand just how vital these protections are for Americans living with a disability. It is not just a disabilities rights issue; it is a civil rights issue.  Similarly, a woman's access to healthcare is also a civil rights issue, and it is an issue that affects every single When a woman can't get the care she needs, her family suffers, and when her family suffers, her community suffers and our Nation suffers. That is why I find it so deeply troubling that Judge Gorsuch has time and again actively worked against reproductive justice. In a dissenting opinion, he argued in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood in Utah based on evidence that other judges deemed as false. In the Hobby Lobby case, he made it clear that he favors the religious beliefs of corporations over the rights of women to make their own choices about their bodies.  What is worse, that isn't the only time Judge Gorsuch ruled to put corporate rights over human rights. You may have heard about a case in my home State of Illinois in which Judge Gorsuch ruled in favor of the rights of a trucking company over the rights of an employee in grave danger through no fault of his own. That is deeply troubling to me. He also dissented from a ruling giving a female UPS driver just the opportunity--the opportunity--to prove sex discrimination, and then again on a decision to fine a company that failed to properly train a worker, resulting in that worker's death.  Judge Gorsuch's record makes it very clear that he is willing to elevate large corporations at the expense of everyday Americans, jeopardizing our civil rights. That is why it is so important to me that he explain his judicial philosophy, that he explain to me his view on so many of these critical issues.  But then, during 4 days of hearings before the Judiciary Committee, Judge Gorsuch had the chance to clarify the philosophy behind his past rulings--to explain how his rulings may reveal his judicial philosophy as a Supreme Court However, instead of addressing these concerns, he dodged these questions--questions on some of the most important issues of our time. He wouldn't even express clearly his views on Roe v. The American people simply deserve better than that.  Earning a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court requires much more than a genial demeanor and an ability to artfully dodge questions. It requires honesty in answering even the toughest questions. That is why I cannot vote to confirm Judge  I take seriously my constitutional responsibility as a U.Senator to offer the President my informed consent, and it is clear that Judge Gorsuch has not provided some of the most essential information needed to grant him a lifetime appointment to our Nation's highest Therefore, I am voting no on his nomination and supporting continued debate on the subject because I can't vote for a nominee when so many questions are left unanswered.

She has been an extraordinary hero of mine, personally, and so many of us look to her leadership. So I thank her--and for her speaking on the nomination of Judge  Across the street from this Chamber stands the U.Supreme Above its doors are the words ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' As Senators, we have a solemn responsibility to ensure that every man and woman who sits on that Court upholds that ideal. As a U.Senator, I take that responsibility extremely seriously.  Almost two decades after the Supreme Court's landmark ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, I was part of only the second class to integrate the Berkeley, CA, public schools. If the Court had ruled differently, I likely would not have become a lawyer or a prosecutor or a district attorney or the Attorney General of California, and I certainly would not be standing here today as a U. I know from personal experience just how profoundly the Court's decisions touch every aspect of Americans' lives, and for that reason, I rise to join my colleagues in strong opposition to the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.Supreme  As we know, Judge Gorsuch went through 4 days of hearings in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and here is what we learned: We learned that Judge Gorsuch refused to answer the most basic of questions. He initially even refused to share his views on Brown v. Board of We learned that Judge Gorsuch has a deeply conservative worldview. And we learned that Judge Gorsuch interprets the law in a theoretical bubble, completely detached from the real world--as he puts it, ``focusing backward, not forward.'' If Judge Gorsuch joins the U.Supreme Court, his narrow approach would do real harm to real people, especially the women of  America deserves a Supreme Court Justice who will protect a woman's right to make her own decisions about her own health. Judge Gorsuch will not. Judge Gorsuch carefully avoided speaking about abortion, but he has clearly demonstrated a hostility to women's access to healthcare.  Last year, when the court he sits on sided with Planned Parenthood, Judge Gorsuch took the highly unusual step of asking the court to hear the case again.  Judge Gorsuch determined that a 13,000-person, for-profit corporation was entitled to exercise the same religious beliefs as a person. That meant the company did not have to provide employees birth control coverage and could impose the company's religious beliefs on all of its female employees. I ask my colleagues, why does Judge Gorsuch seem to believe that corporations deserve full rights and protections but women don't?  As we mark Equal Pay Day today, Americans deserve a Supreme Court Justice who will protect the rights of women in the workplace. Judge Gorsuch won't. In employment discrimination cases, Judge Gorsuch has consistently sided with companies against their employees. These employees include women like Betty The facts of the case were undisputed. Her boss repeatedly asked her about her sexual habits and breast size and invited her to his home--then fired her when she reported his sexual harassment. Judge Gorsuch ruled against Why? Well, part of his justification that he offered was that she waited 2 months before reporting the harassment.  Americans deserve a Supreme Court Justice who upholds the rights of all women, including transgender women. Judge Gorsuch won't. When a transgender inmate claimed that the prison's practice of starting and stopping her hormone treatment was a violation of her rights, Judge Gorsuch disagreed.[[Page S2197]]  As the National Women's Law Center observed, his ``record reveals a troubling pattern of narrowly approaching the legal principles upon which everyday women across the Nation rely.'' They write that his appointment ``would mean a serious setback for women in this country and for generations to come.''  But judging by his record, if Judge Gorsuch becomes Justice Gorsuch, women won't be the only ones facing setbacks. Take Luke, a young boy with autism whose parents sought financial assistance after switching him from public school to a school specializing in autism education. Judge Gorsuch ruled that the minimal support Luke received in public school was good enough. People in the autism community were up in arms. And in the middle of a Senate hearing 2 weeks ago, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Judge Gorsuch was wrong on the law.  Consider Alphonse Maddin was a trucker who got stuck on the road in subzero temperatures--minus 27 degrees, as he recalls--and abandoned his trailer to seek help and save his life. For leaving the trailer, he was fired. Judge Gorsuch wrote that the company was entitled to fire Maddin for not enduring the cold and for not staying in his freezing truck.  Then there is Grace Hwang, a professor diagnosed with cancer. She sued when her university refused to provide the medical leave her doctor recommended. Judge Gorsuch called the university's decision ``reasonable'' and rejected her lawsuit. Sadly, Grace died last summer.  Judge Gorsuch has Ivy League credentials, but his record shows he lacks sound judgment to uphold justice. He ignores the complexities of human beings--the humiliating sting of harassment, the fear of a cancer patient or a worker who feels his life is in danger. In short, his rulings lack a basic sense of empathy. Judge Gorsuch understands the text of the law, to be sure, but he has repeatedly failed to show that he fully understands those important words: ``equal justice under law.''

458,WARREN,proceeding_id,topic-id,1088,"Thank you to the Senator from Hawaii for calling us here together today.  Mr.President, it is clear that President Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch, does not have enough support in the Senate to be confirmed under our rules. When a Supreme Court nominee does not have enough support to be confirmed, the solution is to pick a new nominee, but Republicans in the Senate are threatening to pursue a different path. They are considering breaking the Senate rules to force the nominee onto the Supreme Court anyway.  I will be honest. I think it is crazy that we are considering confirming a lifetime Trump nominee to the Supreme Court at a moment when the President's campaign is under the cloud of an active, ongoing FBI counterintelligence investigation that could result in indictments and appeals, that will go all the way to the Supreme Court, so that Trump's nominee could be the deciding vote on whether Trump or his supporters broke the law and will be held accountable. That is nuts. I believe we should tap the brakes on any nominee until this investigation is concluded.  But even if none of that were happening, I would still oppose the confirmation of Neil My objection is based on Judge Gorsuch's record, which I have reviewed in detail. Judge Gorsuch's nomination is the latest step in a long political campaign by rightwing groups and their billionaire backers to capture our courts.  Over the last 30 years, as the rich have gotten richer and working families have struggled to make ends meet, the scales of justice have been weighted further and further in favor of the wealthy and the powerful. Those powerful interests have invested vast sums of money into reshaping the judiciary, and their investment has paid off in spades. Recent Supreme Court decisions have made it easier for corporate giants that cheat their customers to avoid responsibility. Recent Supreme Court decisions have let those same corporations and their billionaire investors spend unlimited amounts of money to influence elections and manipulate the political process. Recent Supreme Court decisions have made it easier for businesses to abuse and discriminate against their workers.  Giant corporations and rightwing groups have notched a lot of big wins in the Supreme Court lately, but they know their luck depends on two things--first, stacking the courts with their allies, and second, stopping the confirmation of judges who don't sufficiently cater to their interests. That is part of the reason they launched an all-out attack on fair-minded mainstream judges--judges like Merrick Garland, a thoughtful, intelligent, fair judge to fill the open vacancy on the Supreme  These very same corporate and rightwing groups handed Donald Trump a list of acceptable people to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, and as a Presidential candidate, he promised to pick a Justice from their list. Who made it onto that rightwing list? People who, unlike Judge Garland, displayed a sufficient allegiance to their corporate and rightwing interests. Judge Gorsuch was on that list, and his nomination is their reward.  Even before he became a Federal judge, Judge Gorsuch fully embraced rightwing, pro-corporate views. He argued that it should be harder, not easier, for shareholders who got cheated to bring fraud cases to court.  On the bench, Judge Gorsuch's extreme views meant giant corporations could run over their workers. In Hobby Lobby, when he had to choose between the rights of corporations and the rights of women, Judge Gorsuch chose corporations. In consumer protection cases, when he had to choose between the rights of corporations and the rights of the consumers they cheated, Judge Gorsuch chose corporations. In discrimination cases, when he had to choose between the rights of corporations and the rights of employees who had been discriminated against, Judge Gorsuch chose corporations. Time after time, in case after case, Judge Gorsuch showed a remarkable talent for creatively interpreting the law in ways that benefited large corporations and that harmed working Americans, women, children, and consumers.  When it comes to the rules that prevent giant corporations from polluting our air and our water, from poisoning our food, from cheating hard-working families, Judge Gorsuch believes that it should be easier, not harder, for judges to overturn those rules--a view that is even more extreme than that of the late Justice  Republicans assert that Judge Gorsuch is a fair, mainstream judge, but rightwing groups and their wealthy, anonymous funders picked him for one reason: because they know he will be their ally. And that is not how our court system is supposed to work. Judges should be neutral arbiters, dispensing equal justice under law. They should not be people handpicked by wealthy insiders and giant corporations.  For the working families struggling to make ends meet, for people desperately in need of healthcare, for everyone fighting for their right to vote, for disabled students fighting for access to a quality education, for anyone who cares about our justice system, there is only one question that should guide us in evaluating a nominee to sit on any court: whether that person will defend equal justice for every single one of us. Judge Gorsuch's record answers that question with a loud no.  Republicans have a choice. They can tell President Trump to send a new nominee--a mainstream nominee who can earn broad support--or they can jam through this nominee. If they do jam through Judge Gorsuch, the Republicans will own the Gorsuch Court and every extreme 5-to-4 decision that comes out of it. Republicans will own every attack on a woman's right to choose, on voting rights, on LGBTQ rights, on secret spending in our political system, and on freedom of speech and religion. Republicans will be responsible for every 5-to-4 decision that[[Page S2198]]throws millions of Americans under the bus in order to favor the powerful, moneyed few who helped put Judge Gorsuch on the bench.  Right now, the Presidency is in the hands of someone who has shown contempt for our Constitution, contempt for our independent judiciary, contempt for our free press, and contempt for our moral, democratic principles. If ever we needed a strong, independent Supreme Court with broad public support--a Supreme Court that will stand up for the Constitution--it is now.  If ever there were a time to say that our courts should not be handed over to the highest bidder, it is now.

459,HIRONO,proceeding_id,topic-id,753,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for her impassioned, well-reasoned, persuasive remarks.  All too often, Judge Gorsuch fixates on what we call the plain meaning of a word in the law and decides on his own meaning that he would give to that word. Sometimes he will resort to the Dictionary Act or Webster's dictionary to ascertain what he would consider the plain meaning of the law, but what he doesn't do time and again in very important cases that impact lots of lives is that he doesn't look to the context or the purpose of the law, to the point where sometimes his decisions are just bizarre and lack common sense.  There was a reference made to the TransAm Trucking case where the truckdriver was in freezing weather. The brakes on his truck were not working properly, so he faced the choice of freezing to death or doing something about it but then risking being fired. So he did something about it. He got fired.  Judge Gorsuch, in his reading--a very, very narrow reading of a word in the applicable provisions--deemed that his firing was correct. He was asked by Senator Franken at the hearing: What would you have done if you had been in that situation? There you are, you are about to freeze to death, and you have a truck that is not operable in a safe way unless you unhook the attachment to it. What would you have done?  Judge Gorsuch basically said: I don't know what I would have done. I was not in his shoes.  What any of us would have said--of course we would have done what the truck driver did. But in his very narrow reading of the words of the applicable provision, he came to the decision he did. That is why he could not respond to Senator  It is particularly important that Judge Gorsuch explain to us how he would approach these kinds of cases. It is particularly important in what I would describe as remedial legislation, such as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, better known as This is remedial legislation that protects the educational rights of special needs children. That is the population for which this law was enacted.  Judge Gorsuch had a case before him, and it was referred to by my colleague from A young boy was not getting the kind of educational opportunities that he should have gotten under IDEA, but Judge Gorsuch read that remedial legislation, which should be broadly interpreted to protect the class and the group that the law was passed to help--he read it very, very narrowly.  He said that the school needed only to provide ``merely de minimus'' education for this child. He put in the words ``merely de minimus'' effort on the part of the school to provide this young boy with educational opportunities. That was bad enough, but Judge Gorsuch added the word ``merely.'' So during the time of his hearing, the Supreme Court, in a related--basically the same law, IDEA, was at issue--and the Supreme Court, while we were having the hearing on Judge Gorsuch's nomination, unanimously overturned Judge Gorsuch's standard of ``merely de minimus.'' Even the Roberts Court found Judge Gorsuch's standard of review too limiting and too narrow.  So the young boy in question--his father testified at the confirmation hearing. I asked him what he was thinking as the decision of Judge Gorsuch came down. He said he knew that this decision would negatively affect hundreds and hundreds of special needs children all across our country.  This is why I sought assurance from Judge Gorsuch that he would be the kind of Justice who understands, as he told me when I met with him, that the purpose of title III, which are the Federal courts, is to protect the rights of minorities. So I wanted reassurance from Judge Gorsuch during his hearing. I tried time and again to get a sense of his heart, what his judicial philosophy was. I was looking for the reassurance that he was the kind of judge who understands the importance of assuring that victims of discrimination cannot only ask for but can also receive protections from the courts and who demonstrates a commitment to the Constitutional principles that protect the rights of women to make the intimate and personal decisions of what to do with their own bodies.

460,MURRAY,proceeding_id,topic-id,839,"Thank you, Mr. I thank my colleague from Hawaii for her really important statement on this. I come to the floor today to express my serious concerns, along with other women from the Senate, about the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court, particularly about what it would mean for women across the country today and for generations to come.  Like the overwhelming majority of my Democratic colleagues, I have decided to vote against Judge Gorsuch's nomination, and I will be opposing a cloture motion ending debate. Now, I don't take this decision lightly, but with the future of women's health and rights and opportunity at risk, it is a decision I must make.  The Trump administration has broken nearly every one of its promises, but one it has certainly kept is its promise to turn back the clock on women's progress. It is clear that Republicans in Congress are committed to doing the same. Last week, just a few days ago, Senate Republicans, with the help of Vice President Pence, overturned a rule that prevents discrimination against family planning providers based on the kinds of services they provide to women. It was shameful and unprecedented.  Now, not missing a beat, Congressional Republicans are already gearing up to attach riders to our coming budget bills in order to cut off access to critical services at Planned Parenthood for millions of patients. There are similar attempts to undermine women's access to healthcare in cities and States nationwide, and more often than we would like, the Supreme Court is going to be the place of last resort for protecting women's hard-fought gains.  If the buck has to stop with the Supreme Court on women's health and rights, I do not want Judge Gorsuch anywhere near the bench. Time and again, Judge Gorsuch has sided with the extreme rightwing and against tens of millions of women and men who believe that in the 21st century, women should be able to make their own choices about their own bodies.  Let me just give you a few examples. When the Tenth Circuit ruled in the case of Burwell v. Hobby Lobby that a woman's boss could decide whether or not her insurance would include birth control, Judge Gorsuch did not just agree; he thought the ruling should have gone further. Judge Gorsuch has argued that birth control coverage included in the ACA as an essential part of women's healthcare--one that has, by the way, benefited 55 million women--is a ``clear burden'' on employers that would not long survive.  When it comes to Planned Parenthood, he has already weighed in on the side of defunding our Nation's largest provider of women's healthcare. What was his reasoning? Judge Gorsuch thought that in light of completely discredited sting videos taken by extreme conservatives, women in the State of Utah should have a harder time accessing the care they need. I should note that just last week, the makers of those false videos received 15 felony charges.  I also want to be clear, as well, about what Judge Gorsuch's nomination could mean for a woman's constitutionally protected right to safe, legal[[Page S2199]]abortion services under the historic ruling in Rowe v. Wade, which was just reaffirmed last summer by this In his nomination hearings, Judge Gorsuch would not give a clear answer on whether he would uphold that ruling, which has meant so much to so many women and families over the last four decades.  Judge Gorsuch has donated repeatedly to politicians who are dead set on interfering with women's constitutionally protected healthcare decisions. He has even made deeply inaccurate comparisons between abortion and assisted suicide.  I remember the days before Rowe v. Wade very clearly. I have heard the stories of women faced with truly impossible choices during that time. Women from all across the country have shared those deeply personal experiences because they know what it would mean to go backward.  Lastly, attempts to control women's bodies are not always about reproductive rights. Sure enough, Judge Gorsuch is on the wrong side here as well. He concurred in a ruling against a transgender woman who was denied regular access to hormone therapy while she was in prison. This ruling rejected the idea that under our Constitution, denying healthcare services is cruel and unusual punishment. That is not the kind of judgment I want to see on the bench, and I think most families would agree.  Families who have already done so much to lead the resistance against this administration and its damaging, divisive agenda are fighting this nomination as hard as they can. They know the Trump Presidency will be damaging enough for 4 years, but Judge Gorsuch's nomination will roll back progress for women over a lifetime.  I am proud to stand with them and do everything I can to make sure they are heard loud and clear here in the I oppose Judge Gorsuch's nomination in light of everything it would mean for women.

461,HIRONO,proceeding_id,topic-id,736,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague, Senator Murray, our assistant Democratic leader, for her continuing, longstanding leadership on behalf of women and families in our country.  Over the past hour, my colleagues and I have laid out a fair case against confirming Judge Gorsuch to the U.Supreme As we approach a vote on his confirmation, I encourage my colleagues to scrutinize Judge Gorsuch's judicial philosophy, even as he refused to outline for us or describe for us what that philosophy is. But we have come to certain conclusions based on 4 days of hearings. During his hearing, Judge Gorsuch refused, as they say, time and again to answer our questions on his judicial philosophy or his approach to the law. He insisted that he was merely a judge, as if the use of the word ended any discussion or scrutiny of his record.  Judge Gorsuch painted a picture for us of the Court that is really straight out of a Norman Rockwell painting. He said during his hearing: ``One of the beautiful things about our system of justice is that any person can file a lawsuit about anything against anyone at any time . . . and a judge, a neutral and fair judge, will hear it.''  Norman Rockwell painting--it is a wonderful idea that anybody can file a claim to protect their rights or interests. It is also a wonderful idea to assume that those claims will be heard and ruled upon by neutral judges, apparently uninfluenced by their own strongly held and frequently expressed personal views and judicial philosophy.  Many of my Republican colleagues have echoed this view and argued that Judge Gorsuch's credentials should be enough--Columbia, They argue that it is wrong or even unfair to question how Judge Gorsuch might approach the kinds of difficult issues that come before the Supreme  Of course, if judicial philosophy did not matter, then the Republicans would not have engaged in the unprecedented act of blocking President Obama's nominee--as I mentioned, Merrick Garland, a well-credentialed, well-respected moderate nominee--from even having a hearing. In fact, many of the Republican Senators did not even extend the courtesy of meeting with Judge They would not have held the seat open to be filled by the appointee of a Republican President, one selected for him by rightwing organizations.  When my colleagues and I asked Judge Gorsuch about his judicial philosophy, he said that his words, his views, his writings, and his clearly expressed personal views had no relevance to what he would do as a He told us to look at his whole record, so I examined his whole record. I saw in that record too little regard for the real-world impact of his decisions. I saw a refusal to look beyond the words to the meaning and intent of the law, even when his decisions lacked common sense, as in the frozen truck driver case, and far too often, to the benefit of big corporations and against the side of the little guy.  The decisions of judges have real-world impacts for millions of people beyond the parties in a particular case. This is especially true of the Supreme Court, which issues decisions that don't just reach those in the case in front of them--the frozen trucker, the women who work at Hobby Lobby faced with a lack of critical healthcare, the special needs child entitled to educational opportunities under the The Supreme Court does not just interpret laws; the Supreme Court shapes our society.  Will we be just? Will we be fair? Will America be a land of exclusivity for the few or land of opportunity for the many? Will we be the compassionate and tolerant America that embraced my mother, my brothers, and me so many decades ago when we immigrated to this country? These values seem too often absent from Judge Gorsuch's record and from his view of the law and the  The central question for me in looking at Judge Gorsuch and his record and listening carefully through 4 days of hearings was whether he would be a Justice for all of us, not just one for some of us. I came to the conclusion that he would not be a Justice for all of us, so I oppose his nomination.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Johnson).

462,GRASSLEY,proceeding_id,topic-id,585,"Mr.President, I have several of my colleagues on this side of the aisle who want to speak, but I just want to take a minute and a half or so to clarify some things I have heard from the other side that need to be counteracted.  First of all, I don't know whether they mentioned the term ``Ginsburg rule,'' but we do have this Ginsburg rule that was set out a long time ago when Judge Ginsburg came before the Senate for her confirmation. She said that you can't comment on things that might come before the Court because obviously you would be violating judicial ethics. Then I will comment on some things people have said about Brown v. Board of  The very fact that Judge Gorsuch has declined to offer his opinion on legal issues that are likely to come before the Supreme Court demonstrates what we should all expect of him: his judicial independence. That is what we expect of every judge. The judge's decision not to offer his opinion on issues that may come before him is consistent with judicial ethics rules and is consistent with what I have referred to already as the Ginsburg rule or the Ginsburg standard, which all Supreme Court nominees in recent memory have followed. As Justice Ginsburg said, commenting on these issues is not fair to parties who might come before the Court in future years. That is what Judge Gorsuch said as well.  Questions to this end are nothing more than an attempt to compromise the judge's independence, and he showed us that he wasn't going to have his independence compromised because he is going to do what judges should do: look at the facts of a case, look at the law, and make those decisions based only on that and send no signals whatsoever ahead of time of how he might view something.  Along these lines, my colleagues said that the judge should have announced that he agreed with the ruling in Brown v. Board of Education but didn't offer enough information about this opinion in an appropriate discussion of precedent.[[Page S2200]]  I will quote our nominee. He said this: ``Senator, Brown v. Board of Education corrected an erroneous decision, a badly erroneous decision, and vindicated a dissent by the first Justice Harlan in Plessy v. Ferguson, where he correctly identified that separate to advantage one race can never be equal,'' end of the quote of our nominee. So the judge spoke about precedent very appropriately. He answered our questions in a manner consistent with his obligations and with past nominees.  One more point. I keep hearing complaints that the judge won't make a commitment to follow Roe v. Wade, but my colleagues' requests really boil down to a quest for a promise to reach results that they want. They demand adherence to Roe v. Wade on the one hand and a promise to overrule Citizens United on the other hand, as examples. Asking the judge to make commitments about precedent is inappropriate. I have said this so many times, and my colleagues will repeat it many times as well. It compromises the judge's independence.  Instead of being beholden to the President, my colleagues would have the judge be beholden to them. This nominee isn't going to be beholden to a President, and he is not going to be beholden to any Senator because if he did that, he would be compromising his views.  I yield the floor.

463,THUNE,proceeding_id,topic-id,1225,"Mr.President, 2 months ago, the President nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch, a judge on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, to the Supreme This week, we will be voting on his confirmation.  I want to say that I am grateful to my colleague, the senior Senator from Iowa, for his leadership during this process and for getting this nomination to the floor. We are fortunate to have him as chairman of the Judiciary  We have before us a supremely qualified candidate for the Supreme Judge Gorsuch has a distinguished resume. He is widely regarded as a brilliant and thoughtful jurist. Most importantly, however, he is known for his impartiality and his absolute commitment to the rule of law. Judge Gorsuch understands that the job of a judge is to apply the law as it is written--and here is the fundamental thing--even when he disagrees with it.  ``A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge.'' Judge Gorsuch has said that more than once. Why? Because a judge who likes every outcome he reaches is likely making decisions based on something other than the law. That is a problem because there is no such thing as equal protection or equal justice when judges make decisions based on their personal feelings about a case instead of based upon the law. A judge's job is to apply the law as it is written, whether he likes the result or not. Judge Gorsuch understands this.  A lot of people from across the political spectrum have spoken up in favor of Judge Gorsuch's nomination, and one thread that runs through their comments is their confidence that they can trust Judge Gorsuch to apply the law as it is written.  Here is what Neal Katyal, an Acting Solicitor General for President Obama, had to say about Judge Gorsuch:       I have no doubt that if confirmed, Judge Gorsuch would help      to restore confidence in the rule of law. His years on the      bench reveal a commitment to judicial independence--a record      that should give the American people confidence that he will      not compromise principle to favor the president who appointed      him.  A former law partner and a friend of Judge Gorsuch's--a friend who describes himself as ``a longtime supporter of Democratic candidates and progressive causes''--had this to say about Judge Gorsuch:       Gorsuch's approach to resolving legal problems as a lawyer      and a judge embodies a reverence for our country's values and      legal system. . . . I have no doubt that I will disagree with      some decisions that Gorsuch might render as a Supreme Court      justice. Yet, my hope is to have justices on the bench such      as Gorsuch . . . who approach cases with fairness and      intellectual rigor and who care about precedent and the      limits of their roles as judges.''  Again, that is from a self-described ``longtime supporter of Democratic candidates and progressive causes.''  During his years on the bench, Judge Gorsuch has had a number of law clerks. On February 14, every one of Judge Gorsuch's former clerks, except for two who are currently clerking at the Supreme Court, sent a letter on his nomination to the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Here is what they had to say:       Our political views span the spectrum . . . but we are      united in our view that Judge Gorsuch is an extraordinary      judge. . . . Throughout his career, Judge Gorsuch has devoted      himself to the rule of law. . . . As law clerks who have      worked at his side, we know that Judge Gorsuch never resolves      a case by the light of his personal view of what the law      should be. Nor does he ever bend the law to reach a      particular result that he desires.       For Judge Gorsuch, a judge's task is not to usurp the      legislature's role; it is to find and apply the law as      written. That conviction, rooted in his respect for the      separation of powers, makes him an exemplary candidate to      serve on the nation's highest court.  Again, that is the unanimous opinion of 39 of Judge Gorsuch's former law clerks whose political views, in their own words, ``span the spectrum.''  Donald Elliott, an adjunct professor at Yale Law School, had this to say about Judge Gorsuch:       Judge Gorsuch's judicial philosophy isn't mine . . . but      among judicial conservatives, Judge Gorsuch is as good as it      possibly gets. . . . Judge Gorsuch tries very hard to get the      law right. He is not an ideologue, not the kind to always      rule in favor of businesses or against the government.      Instead, he follows the law as best he can wherever it might      lead.  I could go on. The voices raised in support of Judge Gorsuch are numerous.  Unfortunately, no amount of testimony in favor of Judge Gorsuch seems to be enough for Senate Democrats are apparently determined to oppose Judge Gorsuch despite the fact that they are struggling to find any good reason to justify their opposition.  The Senate minority leader came down to the floor on March 23 to announce his determination to vote against Judge Gorsuch, and he urged his colleagues to do the same. Why? Well, apparently the Senate minority leader is not convinced that Judge Gorsuch ``would be a mainstream justice who could rule free from the biases of politics and ideology.'' That is right. Despite the fact that everyone--liberal and conservative--seems to describe fairness as one of Judge Gorsuch's distinguishing characteristics, the Senate minority leader is not convinced the judge will be able to rule without bias. He is worried that Judge Gorsuch won't be a mainstream judge.  Well, over the course of 2,700 cases on the Tenth Circuit, Judge Gorsuch has been in the majority 99 percent of the time--99 percent. In 97 percent of those 2,700 cases, those opinions were unanimous. I would like the minority leader to explain how exactly a judge who is in the majority 99 percent of the time is out of the judicial mainstream. Is the minority leader trying to suggest that all of the judges on the Tenth Circuit, including the ones appointed by Democrats--which, I might add, is a majority on the circuit--are extremists?  The fact is, Democrat opposition to Judge Gorsuch has nothing to do with his qualifications. Let's just get it out there. I doubt that any of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle really think that Judge Gorsuch is out of the mainstream or that he lacks the qualifications of a Supreme Court No, the truth is that Democrats are opposing Judge Gorsuch because they are mad that it is not a Democratic President making the nomination. They can't accept that they lost the election, so they are going to oppose any nominee, no matter how qualified.  It is extremely disappointing that Democrats plan to upend a nearly 230-year tradition of approving Supreme Court nominees by a simple majority vote simply because they can't accept the results of an election.  Democrats have no plausible reason to offer for opposing this supremely qualified nominee. I hope that a sufficient number of Senate Democrats will think better of their opposition and vote--when we have that opportunity later this week--to confirm Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

464,KENNEDY,proceeding_id,topic-id,1751,"Mr.President, there are, of course, two issues before the Senate with respect to Judge Neil The first issue is simply, should or should not Neil Gorsuch be confirmed as an Associate Justice to the U.Supreme Court? There is also a second issue, and the second issue is, Should the Senate even be allowed to vote?  Those two questions are both important and interrelated. I want to talk about the first one first.  I sit on the Judiciary We heard last week--2 weeks ago--about 20 hours of testimony from Judge I think he answered about 200 questions in writing. One of the objections offered by our friends on the other side of the aisle, the Democratic Party, was that Judge Gorsuch refused to answer some of the questions. Now that is just not accurate.  Many of the questions that were asked of the judge by both Republicans and Democrats were fair questions--some of them, not so much.  Judge Gorsuch was asked, in effect: What is your position on abortion? How will you vote?  He was asked: How will you vote on gun control?  He was asked: How would you vote on cruel and unusual punishment, the Eighth Amendment?  He was asked how he would vote on questions dealing with the Tenth He didn't answer those questions, and then he was criticized for not answering those questions. He didn't answer those questions because he couldn't. He is a sitting judge of the U.Court of Appeals for the Tenth Let me read to you canon 3(a)(6) of the Code of Conduct for United States It states: ``A judge should not make public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court.''  Let me read you rule 2.10(B) of the American Bar Association Model Code of Judicial It provides, and I quote: ``A judge shall not, in connection with cases, controversies, or issues that are likely to come before the court, make pledges, promises, or commitments that are inconsistent with the impartial performance of the adjudicative duties of the judicial office.''  Now, say what you want about Mr.Gorsuch, but don't criticize him for not violating the oath of his office and not making promises, pledges, or commitments, like a politician, on how he would vote on the U.Supreme Court, because Justices are supposed to decide the case on the merits.  As I mentioned, I watched Judge Gorsuch answer questions personally for over 20 hours. He was asked some other questions other than the ones I have referenced, and I was intrigued by some of the questions that Judge Gorsuch was asked. My friends in the Democratic Party kept trying to draw distinctions with Judge Gorsuch between the parties in cases that he had decided. My friends kept talking about the ``big guy,'' the ``little guy,'' the corporation, the consumer, the employer, the employee. The suggestion was made that Judge Gorsuch didn't vote enough for the little guy or little gal, for whatever that means. What struck me when he answered those questions was that we were supposed to be talking about the faithful application of justice. Now, I was taught in law school that Lady Justice is supposed to be blind, that neither the wealth nor the power nor the status of the parties should matter. That is why, in the picture that we see so often of Lady Justice, she is blindfolded. She isn't looking at the parties at all to see whether they are wealthy or not so wealthy. She isn't looking at the parties to see whether they are a corporation or a consumer or what race they are or what gender they are or what part of the country they are from. Lady Justice is supposed to be blind because we are a nation of laws, not men.  Of all the places in our country, an American court of law--and I am very proud of this--is supposed to be the place of last resort, where you can come and get a fair shake. That is how good judges operate. They give everybody a fair shake. A good judge is supposed to make his or her decisions based on the law, not the parties. Good judges are supposed to be impartial--to call it like they see it, to call the balls and strikes--and that is exactly what Neil Gorsuch has done throughout his entire career.  I can promise that, as I sit on the Judiciary Committee, if any President, whether he is a Republican or Democrat, ever brings a nomination before the Judiciary Committee when I am on that committee and that nominee starts talking about the wealth or the status or the power of the parties and how it will influence or not influence his decision, suggesting that will make a difference, I will vote against that nominee--I don't care who nominates him--every single time, because that is not American justice.  We talked about two cases in particular, and the Presiding Officer has probably heard them talked about here on the floor. On the surface they don't seem to be related. Judge Gorsuch ruled in both of these cases, but I think they interact in a very important way. They tell us that he doesn't play politics and he doesn't rule for the big guy just because he is a big guy or the little guy just because he is a little guy.  The first case we heard a lot about was a decision by Judge Gorsuch called TransAm You are going to hear a lot about that case. In that case, Judge Gorsuch made a decision that was unfavorable to a trucker, and he ruled in favor of the trucking company--little guy versus big guy. Judge Gorsuch ruled for the big guy, and it is important to know why and to look at the reasoning in that case and not just the result.  During the discussion on the case, Judge Gorsuch made it very clear that he only made that decision because he believed that was what the statute controlling the facts of the case required--a statute that was passed by a legislative body duly authorized by the people that make the law. Unlike our courts, which are supposed to interpret the law, Judge Gorsuch did not decide the case the way he did because he didn't sympathize with the trucker. He decided that case the way he did because he was doing his best to accurately apply the law, as best he understood it, to the facts before him. Once again, that is what is called justice--blind to the parties.  Actually, Judge Gorsuch has explained himself and what he thinks about decisions such as this. He did it in another case that I will talk about in a moment. Judge Gorsuch said:       Often enough the law can be ``a[n] ass--a[n] idiot''--  Quoting, of course, Charles Dickens--     and there is little we judges can do about it, for it is (or      should be) emphatically our job to apply, not rewrite, the      law enacted by the people's representatives. Indeed, every      judge who likes every result he reaches is very likely a bad      judge, reaching for results he prefers rather than those the      law compels.  Now, that statement came from the second case I referenced. It was a case called A.In A.Holmes, a 13-year-old seventh grader was arrested for fake burping repeatedly in class. The majority said it was OK for him to be arrested and that, when his family sued the police officer, the police officer enjoyed qualified immunity.  Judge Gorsuch dissented. This time he ruled for the little guy, literally and figuratively. Judge Gorsuch said: ``In my opinion, reading the statute passed by the legislature, this young man's family can file this lawsuit because disciplining a 13-year-old 7th grader for fake burping in class by arresting him instead of disciplining him is a bridge too far.''  Now, once again, we had a little guy versus the big guy. This time Judge Gorsuch ruled for the little guy. But again, we have to look beyond the result. Even though he ruled for someone we can all sympathize with, Judge Gorsuch didn't base his decision on that. He based his decision on a good-faith application of the statutes of the facts controlling the case. He applied the law as written by the legislature. That is what legislatures do, and that is what Congresses do. They make the law and judges interpret the law. To be blunt, that is what we want in a judge.  I want a judge. I don't want an ideologue. I am not interested in a judge who will use the judiciary to advance his own personal policy goals. I want a judge who will apply the law as written by the legislature or, in the case of the Constitution, as written by the Framers of the Constitution, as best that judge understands the law, not to try to reshape the law as he wishes it to be.  To just comment about the last question that I raised earlier, again, one[[Page S2202]]issue is whether or not we should confirm Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, but the second issue is whether the Senate should even be allowed to vote at all. That is what this is all about when you distill it down to its basic essence.  We are going to hear a lot about cloture, and we are going to hear a lot about the nuclear option. But this is what it boils down to: Should we or should we not even be able to be allowed to vote?  Now I understand that reasonable people can disagree. I also understand that unreasonable people can disagree, and everybody in this body has a vote, and we all represent There are two Senators from every State--big States and little States--and everybody is entitled to be able to vote his or her conscience. But it is very, very important not only for the American judicial system but for American democracy that the Senate be allowed to vote on Judge  So to my friends on the other side of the aisle, I would say: Please allow us to vote. You can vote for or against Judge I will not second-guess your judgment if you act sincerely, and I believe many of my colleagues are sincere. They are wrong, but they are sincere.

The senior Senator from Indiana recently announced his support for Judge Gorsuch, saying:       I believe that he is a qualified jurist who will base his      decisions on his understanding of the law and is well      respected among his peers.  The senior Senator from West Virginia has noted:       [Judge Gorsuch] has been consistently rated as a well-     qualified jurist, the highest rating a jurist can receive,      and I have found him to be an honest and thoughtful man.  The junior Senator from North Dakota also praised Judge Gorsuch for his ``record as a balanced, meticulous, and well-respected jurist who understands the rule of law.''  Remember, these admiring statements all come from Democrats, and all of them support an up-or-down vote on confirming Judge  Even those who oppose Judge Gorsuch used to sing a different tune about the standards for judicial confirmation.  For instance, the senior Senator from California put it best when she said:       I think, when it comes to filibustering a Supreme Court      appointment, you really have to have something out there,      whether it's gross moral turpitude or something that comes to      the surface.  Speaking of a previous Republican President's nominee, she further said:       Now, I mean, this is a man I might disagree with. That      doesn't mean he shouldn't be on the court.  In fact, President Obama filibustered a Supreme Court nomination while he was a Senator, yet later expressed regret over that decision. He said:       I think that, historically, if you look at it, regardless      of what votes particular Senators have taken, there's been a      basic consensus, a basic understanding, that the Supreme      Court is different. And each caucus may decide who's going to      vote where and what but that basically you let the vote come      up, and you make sure that a well-qualified candidate is able      to join the bench even if you don't particularly agree with      him.  Despite all of this, though, it appears that a radical Democratic minority intends to filibuster Judge Gorsuch's nomination. The minority leader is encouraging this extreme fringe, claiming, ``If Judge Gorsuch fails to earn 60 votes and fails to demonstrate he is mainstream enough to sit on the highest court, we should change the nominee, not the rules.''  I will return later to the minority leader's central and ironic role in all of this. For now, let's take a trip down memory lane so as to understand just how radical this partisan filibuster would be.  No Supreme Court nominee has ever failed because of a partisan filibuster--never, not once, ever--in the 228 years of our venerable One nominee, Justice Abe Fortas--to be elevated to Chief Justice--lost one cloture vote in 1968 on a bipartisan basis. He then withdrew under an ethical cloud, but no Supreme Court nominee has ever been defeated by a partisan filibuster.  This historical standard has nothing to do with changes in the Senate rules. The filibuster has been permitted under Senate rules since early in the 19th century. It is not a recent or a novel power. The cloture rule was adopted 100 years ago. In other words, at any point in our history, a Senate minority could have attempted to filibuster a Supreme Court nominee. They had the tools. The rules permitted it. It would have only taken one Senator--just one. Yet it never happened for a simple reason: self-restraint. While written rules are important, sometimes the unwritten rules are even more so. Habits, customs, mores, standards, traditions, practices--these are the things that make the world go round, in the U.Senate no less than in the game of life. Our form of self-government depends critically on this form of self-government. Let's reconsider some recent nominees in light of these facts.  Justice Clarence Thomas was probably the most controversial nomination in my lifetime, perhaps ever. He was the subject of a vicious campaign of lies and partisan smears--a ``high-tech lynching'' in his words. He was confirmed in 1991 by a bare majority of 52-to-48. Yet Justice Thomas did not face a filibuster. Not a single Senator tried to block the up-or-down vote on his nomination--not Joe Biden, not Ted Kennedy, not Robert Byrd, not John Kerry--not one. Why? Any one Senator could have demanded a cloture vote, could have insisted on the so-called 60-vote standard and, perhaps, defeated Justice Thomas's nomination, but they did not because they respected two centuries of Senate tradition and custom.  It was likewise with Justice Sam Alito, whose nomination unquestionably shifted the Court's balance to the right in 2006. He, too, received fewer than 60 votes for confirmation--58 to be exact--but he received 72 votes for cloture. Here again, a large, bipartisan majority upheld the Senate tradition and custom against partisan filibusters of Supreme Court nominees. Even Judge Robert Bork, whose name is now used as a verb to mean the ``unfair partisan treatment of a judicial nominee,'' received an up-or-down vote in 1987. Yes, Judge Bork, who only received 42 votes for confirmation, did not face a partisan filibuster.  But let's not stop with Supreme Court nominations. Let's also consider other kinds of nominations so that we can understand just how radical is the Democratic minority's position.  To this day, there has never been a Cabinet nominee defeated by a partisan filibuster--never, not once, ever--in 228 years of Senate history. To this day, there has never been a trial court nominee defeated by a partisan filibuster--never, not once, ever--in 228 years of Senate history. Until 2003--just 14 years ago--there had never been an appellate court nominee defeated by a partisan filibuster.  That is just how strong the custom against filibusters was. It had never successfully happened in 214 years.[[Page S2203]]From our founding, through secession and civil war, through world wars, no matter how intense the feeling and how momentous the occasion, no matter how partisan the atmosphere, Senators always exercised self-restraint and allowed up-or-down votes on nominees for the Supreme Court, the court of appeals, the trial court, and the  But that changed in 2003, thanks in no small part to the senior Senator from New York, Chuck Schumer, now the minority leader. With the help of leftwing law professors, he convinced extremists and the Democratic caucus to filibuster President Bush's appellate court nominees. For the first time in more than two centuries of the U.Senate, a radical minority defeated nominations with a partisan filibuster.  Why did the Senate start down this path? Some point to racial politics and Miguel Estrada, who was one of the most talented appellate litigators of his generation and President Bush's nominee to the DC That court is often a proving ground for future Supreme Court nominees, and Mr.Estrada's confirmation might have enabled President Bush to nominate him, subsequently, to the Supreme A Republican President appointing the first Hispanic Justice? Surely, the Democrats couldn't allow that.  Whatever the reason, there can be no doubt that the minority leader has set in motion a chain of events over the last 14 years and has brought us to the point he claims to deplore today. So the Democrats can spare me any hand-wringing about Senate traditions and customs.  The minority leader and like-minded extremists in the Democratic caucus can also spare us their exaggerated claims of the Republican obstruction of President Obama's judicial nominees. The Democrats, after all, were the ones who broke a 214-year-old tradition specifically to obstruct 10 of President Bush's nominees. Of course, the Republicans followed suit, though I would note that they have filibustered fewer judges over more years in their having been in the minority.  Put simply, the Democrats broke one of the Senate's oldest customs in 2003 so that they could filibuster Republican judges, and they subsequently filibustered more judges than did the So it should come as no surprise that the Democrats took an even more radical step in 2013 when they used the so-called nuclear option to eliminate the filibuster for executive branch, trial court, and appellate court nominations. They broke the Senate rules by changing the Senate rules with a bare majority, not the effective two-thirds vote required under those rules.  The radical Democrats will accept no constraints on their will to power--when in power. Whatever it takes to pack the courts with liberal extremists or to block eminently qualified Republican nominees is exactly what they will do.  But don't take my word for it. Let's review what the Democrats were saying last year when they all believed they would be in power with Hillary Clinton as President and Democrats controlling the We did not hear much talk about the sacred 60-vote standard back then. On the contrary, the Democrats were promising to use the nuclear option again--this time to confirm a Democratic nominee to the Supreme  Former Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said:       I have set the Senate so, when I leave, we're going to be      able to get judges done with a majority. . . . If the      Republicans try to filibuster another circuit court judge,      but especially a Supreme Court Justice, I've told `em how,      and I've done it . . . in changing the rules of the  The junior Senator from Virginia, who would have been Vice President had Secretary Clinton won, said, quite frankly, about the Supreme Court vacancy:       If these guys think they are going to stonewall the filling      of that vacancy or other vacancies, then a Democratic Senate      majority will say, ``We're not going to let you thwart the      law.''  The junior Senator from Oregon warned ominously:       If there's deep abuse, we're going to have to consider      rules changes.  The senior Senator from New Mexico perhaps summed it up best of all when he said:       The Constitution does not give me the right to block a      qualified nominee no matter who is in the White . . .      A minority in the Senate should not be able to block      qualified nominees.  Do not think for a minute that the radical Democrats would not have made good on these threats. They have exercised little restraint on judicial nominations over the last 14 years. They have betrayed over 200 years of Senate tradition and custom. They would not start respecting those traditions now.  In reality, there were good reasons to respect and uphold the old Senate tradition against the filibusters of nominees before 2003.  First, our responsibility under the Constitution is not to choose but to advise and consent. A partisan filibuster would, essentially, encroach upon the President's power to nominate the person of his choice.  Second, nominations are not susceptible to negotiation. We cannot split someone down the middle, Solomon-like. We can vote yes or no. This is not the case with legislation, where differences can be split, compromises negotiated, and bipartisan consensus reached.  Third, when legislation fails to win 60 votes, it is not the end of the world; it can go back to the drawing board or be enacted through other legislative vehicles. But when nominations are long delayed or defeated, then real work is left undone, cases go unheard, disputes go unresolved, and the law remains unclear.  It would have been better for the Senate if the minority leader and the Democrats had recognized these things in 2003 and not started us down this path, the end of which we reach this week. It is rarely a good thing when an institution ignores or breaks its customs and traditions, its unwritten rules. They should have known better, and they should have acted better. But we have come to this point because the radical Democrats didn't act any better.  Now they propose to create a new standard never known to exist before: The Senate will not confirm a Republican President's nominees to the Supreme Court, because if the Democrats will filibuster Neil Gorsuch, then they will filibuster any Republican nominee. I will never accept this double standard, and neither will my colleagues. Republicans aren't going to be played for suckers and chumps.  After this week, the Senate will be back to where it always was and where it should have remained: Nominees brought to the floor ought to receive an up-or-down, simple-majority vote. And don't expect to hear regret from me about it.  There is no moral equivalence here between the two parties. To suggest any equivalence is to divorce action from its intent and aim. In 2003 and again at this moment, the radical Democrats overturned venerable Senate traditions. The Republicans are acting to restore them. Those who cannot see the difference, to borrow from Bill Buckley, would also see no difference between a man who pushes an old lady into the path of an oncoming bus and a man who pushes the old lady out of the path of the bus, because after all, both men push around old ladies.  So I am not regretful. I am not wracked with guilt. I am not anguished. I am really not even disappointed. There are no school yard taunts of ``you did it first.'' There are no charges of hypocrisy. There is no pox on both our houses. The Republicans are prepared to use a tool the Democrats first abused in 2013 to restore a 214-year-old tradition the Democrats first broke in 2003, and we are supposed to feel guilty? The radical Democrats brought this all on themselves and on the The responsibility rests solely and squarely on their shoulders.  The minority leader is hoist with his own petard, the Senate is restored to a sensible, centuries-old tradition, and Judge Gorsuch is about to become Justice Not a bad outcome. Not bad at all.

466,CRUZ,proceeding_id,topic-id,1425,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to support the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to serve as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the United By any objective measure, Judge Gorsuch is impeccably qualified. He is a graduate of[[Page S2204]]Columbia University and the Harvard Law School and was awarded a doctorate from He is a former law clerk for the legendary Justice Byron White, as well as for Justice He has been a respected Federal appellate judge for a decade. Judge Gorsuch has spent a lifetime in the law, and his record indicates he will make an exemplary  Just 2 weeks ago, Judge Gorsuch testified for 20 hours before the Senate Judiciary His conduct during the hearing only further confirmed what his record demonstrates: that Neil Gorsuch is a principled jurist and a good man. And I was glad for all of us to get that confirmation because Judge Gorsuch bears a heavy responsibility--he is being asked to fill the seat of Justice Antonin In truth, I doubt anyone could truly fill Justice Scalia's shoes. Justice Scalia was one of a kind, and his enormous impact on the law and on the Court will impact this Nation for generations to come.  All of us miss him dearly, but I take solace in the knowledge that one of the ways in which I believe it will be easiest for Judge Gorsuch to imitate Scalia--perhaps the most important way--is judicial humility. Justice Scalia's greatest strength was not his amazing wit, his mighty pen, or his larger-than-life personality, as much as we loved those parts of him; rather, it was his consistent unwillingness to accumulate power to himself and to the courts. He refused to impose his own personal policy preferences on the law but instead understood that his role as a judge was simply to apply the law that the elected representatives of the people had enacted.  This type of judging doesn't take otherworldly talents, although Scalia had that in abundance; instead, it takes character, integrity, and humility. Judge Gorsuch's lengthy record and his hearing testimony demonstrate that he has those attributes as well. He understands that his role as a judge is to apply the words of the Constitution and the laws of the United States to the specific cases that come before him, and nothing more. This is critical in an era when the Supreme Court has come to be seen by many--for good reason--as an activist Court, as a superlegislature that seeks to impose its own will in the place of the written law.  It is this very humility that angers so many on the left. They don't want someone who humbly applies the law; rather, they demand nothing less than a person fully committed to enacting from the Supreme Court bench whatever policies the left is championing at that given moment, because they know their only refuge is the courts because the American people would reject the policies at the voting booth. Judge Gorsuch is clearly not that kind of person, so they have committed to opposing his confirmation by whatever means necessary, legitimate or not.  Indeed, if this were being decided on qualifications and record, Judge Gorsuch would be confirmed unanimously. We don't have to hypothesize about that because Judge Gorsuch has already been confirmed by this body a decade ago by voice vote, without recorded dissent. Not a single Senator objected--not Ted Kennedy, not Hillary Clinton, not Barack Obama, not Joe Biden, and not even Democratic Members who still serve in this Chamber, like Chuck Schumer, Dianne Feinstein, Pat Leahy, or Dick Not one of them spoke out against Gorsuch's nomination to the court of appeals--not one.  So what changed? The only thing that changed is that the radical left has become angry, extremely angry, and my Democratic colleagues are worried they will get opposed from their left in a primary. That is it. Their base demands total war, total obstruction, and they are begrudgingly bowing to this demand.  Unfortunately for them, it has proven difficult to invent attacks against an obviously well-qualified judge like Judge My Democratic colleagues couldn't get any legitimate grievance to stick at the hearings last week, despite their best efforts, but it hasn't stopped them from repeating their outlandish attacks over and over again. If the stakes weren't so high, it might even be humorous, but it isn't really funny because the primary argument the Democrats have made is dangerous. Their attack on Neil Gorsuch is a direct attack on the rule of law itself.  Contrary to the very foundations of our government and legal system, my colleagues from across the aisle are arguing that Judge Gorsuch is unqualified to be a Justice because he allegedly failed to side with the ``little guy'' over the ``big guy.'' In their view, it is now the job of judges to reject equal protection, to take the blindfold off of Lady Justice, and instead judges should put their thumbs on the scales to actively discriminate against parties based on their identity.  This notion of partisan, results-oriented judging is directly contrary to the constitutional system we have in this country. My Democratic colleagues are openly calling for judges to enforce their own political preferences from the bench, and they want to use a person's willingness or unwillingness to do so as a litmus test for who gets on the This isn't even a jurisprudential position, it is a political position. And it is difficult to imagine a more effective way to destroy our judicial system--the best in the world, despite its flaws--than to adopt this results-oriented approach.  Make no mistake, the Democrats' trumpeting of outcome-based judging will have consequences. Judges and potential judges nationwide will now have heard their siren call. You want smooth sailing in a confirmation hearing from the Democrats? Ignore the law, ignore the facts, and pick sides based upon whom you sympathize with--whoever is politically correct at that moment in time. My Democratic colleagues claim to detest attacks on the independent judiciary, but there aren't many attacks more dangerous and chilling of true independence and impartiality than the one they are making now.  The public--the people who appear in court seeking an honest tribunal--have also heard this open call for bias, for prejudice, for discrimination, and I doubt they will soon forget.  Luckily, Judge Gorsuch stood firm in his confirmation hearing. He reaffirmed what was clear from his record--that he will not legislate his own policy preferences from the bench and that he will respect the limited role a judge plays in our constitutional structure. He did all of this in the face of unrelenting opposition from my Democratic colleagues who demanded that he violate his judicial oath and swear to decide certain cases and political questions in a way that they would prefer. No recent nominee to the Supreme Court has ever made such pledges, and Judge Gorsuch rightfully refused to do so last week.  Their demands of Judge Gorsuch were particularly galling given that this was the most transparent process in history for selecting a Supreme Court During the campaign, Donald Trump promised the American people that, if elected, he would choose a Justice in the mold of Justice He laid out a specific list of 21 potential nominees, including Judge The voters were able to see precisely whom President Trump would nominate, and they were able to decide for themselves if that was the future they wanted for the Supreme  Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, promised a very different kind of She promised a liberal judicial activist who would vote to undermine free speech, to undermine religious liberty, and to undermine the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.  In a very real sense, this election was a referendum on the Supreme The American people could decide for themselves between a faithful originalist vision of the Constitution or a progressive, liberal, activist vision, and the voters chose.  Donald Trump is now President Trump, and he has kept his promise to the American people, selecting Judge Neil Gorsuch from that list of 21 judges. Judge Gorsuch is no ordinary nominee. Because of this unique and transparent process, unprecedented in our Nation's history, his nomination carries with it a kind of super-legitimacy in that it has been ratified by the American people at the voting booth. Neil Gorsuch is not simply the President's nominee. It is the direction chosen by the American people, and I urge my colleagues to confirm him.  I yield the floor.

467,BOOKER,proceeding_id,topic-id,4736,"Mr.President, I rise today to voice my opposition to the[[Page S2205]]nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the United  The nomination of an individual to serve on the Supreme Court is a matter of tremendous importance. Supreme Court justices have the opportunity to shape, literally, and even to define American history for decades to come. Even more importantly, they have the opportunity to affect the lives and livelihoods of everyday Americans, now and in generations yet unborn.  Few decisions in the Senate have a more profound consequence than the confirmation of a nominee for a lifetime seat on the highest Court in the land. I recognize that this is one of the most critical votes that I will take or that any Senator will cast.  After reviewing Judge Gorsuch's record, I have decided to uphold my constitutional duty of service to advise and consent by opposing Judge Gorsuch's nomination at all stages of the confirmation process, including a vote on cloture or an up-or-down vote. I didn't come to this decision lightly. I arrived at this conclusion because I believe the next Associate Justice to the Supreme Court must be someone who understands the importance of judicial restraint, someone who will adhere to precedent, someone who will respect and has respect for all coequal branches of government, someone who views the Constitution as a living--not a static--document, someone whose judicial views actually fall within the mainstream of judicial thought and jurisprudence, and someone who has a deep understanding of the law, the Constitution, and its applications. Critically, I believe the next Supreme Court justice must be someone who understands the gravity of their work--that their decisions will affect livelihoods, will affect lives, and will affect the liberties and the rights that we value--not just for those in places of privilege and power but for all American citizens, for all of the people, now and for decades to come.  The American people need the next Justice on the Nation's highest Court to be someone who will protect the rights for all--for everyone--and who will ensure that the words literally inscribed above the Supreme Court--``Equal Justice Under Law''--are made manifest in everyone's life.  After careful consideration of Judge Gorsuch's record, his judicial philosophy, and after meeting with the nominee and examining remarks and answers to questions in his confirmation hearing, I do not believe Judge Gorsuch meets this high standard, and I cannot support his nomination to be a Supreme Court  Judge Gorsuch is truly a well-credentialed jurist, but we must understand that a good resume is the beginning and not the end point of a standard by which we must measure nominees to serve on the Supreme A good resume is necessary, but it is not sufficient to be on the highest Court of the land.  When it comes to the Supreme Court, the Senate's duty to advise and consent means more than merely measuring an aptitude or understanding of the law. It means more than just looking at someone's college and law school. It means more than just admiring: Does this person have an impressive resume? It necessitates an understanding of it. It actually necessitates an empathy for how these decisions will affect the lives of everyday Do they have the capacity to stand for all of us?  I take literally the way the Constitution began. It began with the words in the preamble to the In many ways, it is a direct point at what is at stake when we nominate an individual to the Supreme It is a critical way that we began. It begins by saying: ``We the People.'' The inclusion of these words at the start of one of our Nation's founding documents is actually no accident. It was the subject of consternation and even discussion and debate.  It is worth noting that the original draft of the preamble of the Constitution of the United States, as prepared by a man named Gouverneur Morris, had a different beginning. It said: We the people of the States of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and so forth. But Morris and other drafters of the Constitution made the conclusion--and, really, the conscious decision--to remove references to States, to bring it back to the people--that the power of government is derived by the people and that is the fundamental aspect of our society; that it is ``we the people''--not people of any one State, not people of any one religion, not people of any one race or class, but ``we the people''--all of the people.  In a debate about this change, it was James Madison who argued:       In this particular respect the distinction between the      existing and the proposed governments is very material. The      existing system has been derived from the dependent      derivative authority of the legislatures of the states;      whereas, this is derived from the superior power of the      people.  It is a deference and it is a reverence for the understanding of the power of the people--all people. It is no accident that this is how our Constitution began, and it is the spirit in our Nation which has helped us for centuries to expand upon this ideal of ``we the people.''  Understand this: Some of our greatest leaders fought to make sure that these ideals were far vaster, far more inclusive. I note, for instance, that Susan Anthony said it was ``we the people''--not we the White male citizens, not we the male citizens, but we the whole people who formed the And we formed it not to give the blessings of liberty but to secure them, not to the half of ourselves and to the half of our prosperity but to the whole people--women and men. You see, this fundamental understanding of our Constitution expanded to be more inclusive, to include women and minorities and religious minorities. This conception of ``we the people'' is critical.  It is unfortunate that too often, even with the best intentions, our elected officials, Supreme Court Justices, and even Presidents have forgotten the precision of these words which were chosen. But despite this, because of heroes like Susan Anthony and others, the people of this Nation have remembered them, and our Nation has grown to be who we are now. We often actually take for granted the critical role the Supreme Court has played in focusing on the people--on all the people. This has been the power and majesty of the Supreme Court--this focusing of individual rights, the dignity, the worth, the value of all people.  In the Supreme Court case in Hammer v. Dagenhart, the Supreme Court ruled that Congress has the power to enact labor laws that protect children. They remembered ``we the people''--in this case, citizens against powerful corporations.  In West Coast Hotel v. Parrish, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a State minimum wage law, again, focusing on the people--``we the people.''  In Mapp v. Ohio, when the Supreme Court decided about evidence obtained through the illegal search--the violation of individual privacy--they remembered, again, ``we the people.''  In New York Times v. Sullivan, when the Supreme Court protected the rights of everyday citizens to criticize their government, they remembered that sovereignty, that power, that importance of ``we the people.''  In Baker v. Carr, when the Supreme Court established the principle of one person, one vote, they remembered ``we the people.''  There are so many of the rulings during the 1950s and 1960s governing issues of race in our Nation, to which so many of us in our Nation owe our very success, the opportunity that was expanded because the Supreme Court--against social mores, against laws of States--focused on ``we the people.''  Perhaps most famous of those is Brown v. Board of Education, when the Supreme Court asserted that separate but equal had no place in the education of our children, and they remembered ``we the people.''  In Loving v. Virginia, when the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional the State laws that banned interracial marriage--that ideal of being able to join in union with someone you love, regardless of race--the Supreme Court remembered ``we the people.''  In Olmstead v. L.C., when the Supreme Court reinforced the right of people with developmental disabilities to live in the community and not be institutionalized, they saw a greater inclusion of all They remembered ``we the people.''  I stood on the Supreme Court steps and I sat in on the Supreme Court arguments in Obergefell v. Hodges, when[[Page S2206]]the Supreme Court ultimately ruled that State laws cannot stop you from marrying whom you love. They remembered. They saw the dignity and the worth of all of the people and ensured that equality. They remembered ``we the people.''  In each of these cases, so much was at stake--the rights of workers, the rights of children, the rights of people with disabilities, the rights of minorities, the rights of women, voting rights, civil rights, our rights--American rights. The Supreme Court, with jurists on the right and the left, jurists appointed by Republicans and Democrats, looked to people and affirmed dignity and worth and well-being.  But these are not just issues that were done in the past. The Supreme Court is going to be again confronted by historic and deeply consequential cases. There is still so much at stake, and that is why this decision before the Senate is so consequential. The right to gain access to birth control, the right to criticize your elected officials, the right to marry someone you love--that is still at stake.  I cannot vote in support of a nominee whom I don't trust to protect American individuals, to understand the expansive nature of that idea of ``we the people.'' Judge Gorsuch is someone who, in his own words, has said judges should try to ``apply the law as it is, focusing backward, not forward.'' Based on his record and his writing, it is clear to me that Judge Gorsuch's own judicial philosophy leaves out critically important elements of democratic governance.  Judge Gorsuch's evasive answers to questions during his confirmation hearing didn't do anything to allay my concerns. ``We the People'' are the first words of the These words, I fear based on Judge Gorsuch's record, are not his greatest consideration. In fact, at times, when he issues his judicial opinions, they look as if those individuals that make up our society--``we the people''--are the least of his considerations.  Take for example, Alphonse Maddin, the man who was working through the night in the dead of winter as a truckdriver when his brakes unfortunately froze on him. Knowing the danger of continuing to drive with frozen brakes--the danger to himself and other motorists on the road--Alphonse pulled over to the side of the road and called for help.  As several of my colleagues have noted in Judge Gorsuch's confirmation hearing and on the floor, Alphonse waited over 2 hours in the freezing cold without heat, experiencing systems of hypothermia. After no help arrived, Alphonse feared for his life, and, ultimately, left his trailer to find help.  Less than a week after the incident, Alphonse was fired for abandoning his trailer. He filed a complaint with the Department of Labor and the case was brought to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, where all but one of the judges ruled in favor of Alphonse--a guy who made a practical decision, an urgent decision, to save his own life and not risk the lives of others. But the judge who ruled against this individual, in favor of the corporation, was Judge Neil  He chose to save his own life and protect the lives of others who had been put in harm's way if he chose another option, and he was fired for it. Every judge on the Tenth Circuit supported that decision except for Judge  ``We the people'' includes Luke, a student with a disability. He was diagnosed with autism at the age of 2. When Luke entered kindergarten, he began receiving specialized educational services from a school district as ensured by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or Congress debated and passed, with Republicans and Democrats, an act that says children with disabilities are entitled to receive a free and appropriate public education.  Between kindergarten and the second grade, Luke achieved many of the goals of his individualized education program. But when Luke's family moved to Colorado and he enrolled in a new public school, he had trouble adjusting, and Luke regressed in areas in which he had previously done well. To better suit Luke's needs, his parents, who tried to get him better care, eventually withdrew him from his local school and enrolled him in a private residential school for children with autism. His parents sought reimbursement for the costs of that private school, but the public school district refused to pay. By the time Luke's case reached the Tenth Circuit, a Federal judge and two administrative courts had agreed that the school district should pay because Luke did not receive the free and appropriate education to which he was entitled.  The question for Judge Gorsuch was, What constitutes an appropriate education? In that ruling, Judge Gorsuch wrote the opinion saying that the educational benefits mandated by IDEA must be ``merely more than de minimis.'' That was the standard that he set for one of our American children. Because the school district gave Luke a merely more than de minimis education, Judge Gorsuch ruled that Luke's parents were not entitled to reimbursement.  But just two weeks ago, the Supreme Court unanimously rejected Judge Gorsuch's ``merely more than de minimis'' standard. They unanimously rejected Judge Gorsuch's standard as contrary to the intent of In fact, at the very moment when Judge Gorsuch testified before the Judiciary Committee, Chief Justice Roberts wrote an opinion rejecting Gorsuch's IDEA standard, saying:       When all is said and done, a student offered an educational      program providing ``merely more than de minimis'' progress      from year to year can hardly be said to have been offered an      education at all.  Judge Gorsuch's misinterpretation of the law--depriving a child with a disability of the education he deserves--should be cause for concern to any of my colleagues as they are promoting him to the highest Court in the land. It is this idea that the powerless, who fight against these corporations or big institutions and turn to the court system as their avenue to get the equal justice under the law that will view them--whether it is a corporation, whether it is a government--as an equal under the law and give them their right to be heard.  This is what ``we the people'' is. It means people like Alphonse Maddin and Luke, whom Judge Gorsuch ruled against. It also means female workers who want access to contraceptive coverage but were denied by their employer, denied by a corporation. Judge Gorsuch ruled against the people and for the corporation.  ``We the people'' means those millions of Americans who rely on Planned Parenthood centers for healthcare. Judge Gorsuch ruled against those people seeking what, in some counties, is their only access to contraceptive care. ``We the people'' means the people harmed by a medical device manufacturer's urging of unsafe, off-label uses. Judge Gorsuch ruled against the people injured and for the manufacturers, for the corporation.  ``We the people'' means that a worker fatally electrocuted while on the job due to inadequate training, whose families sought justice--Judge Gorsuch ruled against the individual and for the corporation.  ``We the people'' means the woman prevented from suing for sexual harassment, not because sexual harassment didn't exist but because she didn't report it quickly enough. Judge Gorsuch supported the corporation against the woman.  ``We the people'' means a transgender woman who is denied access to a bathroom at work. Judge Gorsuch ruled against the individual in favor of the corporation.  ``We the people'' means that every single American deserves to have their civil rights, deserves to have their equality protected by the judicial branch, which is often their last avenue toward justice. It is often their last hope against the powerful, against the wealthy. But Judge Gorsuch's record in everything--from workers' rights to women's rights, to civil rights, to the rights of children with disabilities, to the rights of a guy on the side of a highway to save his own life--suggests that he has forgotten perhaps the most important element of the Constitution: It exists to protect and serve the American people, not corporations, not lobbyists, not those rich enough to hire big, fancy law firms. It doesn't exist to serve a political ideology. It exists to serve ``we the people.''  I am not confident in Judge Gorsuch's ability as a Supreme Court[[Page S2207]]Justice to safeguard the rights and liberties of all Americans, to prioritize judicial restraint over judicial ideology, to ensure equal justice under the law, and to understand and act in a way that indicates that the lives of real people who are struggling against often seemingly insurmountable odds--that for them, everything is on the line. I am not sure that Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court can honor this tradition.  ``We the people'' means an independent judiciary that will not close the courthouse doors on people, on our civil rights--that will not look at litigants as just pawns in the larger ideological context of ideas but will see the humanity of every American; that will have a courageous empathy to understand their circumstances and their struggles and put that in accordance with the values of a nation where we all swear an oath for liberty and justice for all the people.  Over 75 years ago, Justice Hugo Black encompassed the basic ideal of the role of Federal courts in protecting citizens' rights when he wrote these words:       No higher duty, or more solemn responsibility, rests upon      this Court, than that of translating into living law and      maintaining this constitutional shield deliberately planned      and inscribed for the benefit of every human being subject to      our Constitution--of whatever race, creed or persuasion.  Yet Judge Gorsuch's own writings demonstrate a failure to grasp this understanding of the role of courts to protect all people--and I quote, again, Justice Black--``whatever race, creed, or persuasion.''  In an opinion article for the National Review, entitled ``Liberals and Lawsuits,'' Judge Gorsuch expressed his skepticism about civil rights litigation as merely a pursuit of a ``social agenda.'' He wrote:       American liberals have become addicted to the courtroom,      relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and      the ballot box, as the primary means for effecting their      social agenda on everything from gay marriage to assisted      suicide to the use of vouchers for private-school education.       This overweening addiction to the courtroom as a place to      debate social policy is bad for the country and bad for the      judiciary.  I wonder what Oliver Brown, plaintiff in the seminal case of Brown v. Board of Education would say to Judge Gorsuch? Was he ``addicted'' to the courtroom to advance his social agenda? Or was the courtroom his avenue to justice against profound oppression?  I wonder what James Obergefell would say to Judge Was he ``addicted'' to the courtroom when he sought to be able to marry the person he loved? Or did Oliver just want to bring the truth to the idea that separate but equal was actually discriminatory, demeaning, and degrading, not just to the individuals who are discriminated against but demeaning to us as a people and a nation?  Judge Gorsuch's actions call into question whether he understands the proper role of the courts. Does he understand that Federal courts are the proper forum for constitutional disputes that protect American's basic rights? This is not about liberal or democrat; this is about individuals who are often fighting battles against powerful interests.  It was the journalist and editor William Allen White who said in 1936:       Liberty . . . must be something more than a man's      conception of his rights, much more than his desire to fight      for his own rights. True liberty is founded upon a lively      sense of the rights of others and a fighting conviction that      the rights of others must be maintained.  I do not believe Judge Gorsuch possesses this ``fighting conviction'' that we need in a Supreme Court Justice to forcefully and fearlessly, without regard to politics or favor or privilege or wealth, protect the rights of others, to protect the rights of all Americans, to protect the rights of ``we the people.'' I do not believe that Judge Gorsuch will work to fiercely defend the rights of all I do not believe he possesses that fighting conviction that ``we the people'' must be committed above all else to one another.  Again, I do not take the decision to oppose Judge Gorsuch's nomination lightly. I understand what is at stake. I am fortunate to represent hard-working New Jerseyans in the U.Senate, and when I took the oath to support and defend the Constitution, I made a promise to my constituents and the American people not to only discharge my duties but at every opportunity to work across the aisle, to protect their rights and interests. That means a lot to me.  So many of my proudest moments in the Senate are from this bipartisan cooperation that I have found with so many of my colleagues. I do not stand here today to question their motives. I do not stand here today to impugn them in any way because when I go home, people are not concerned about the partisan politics. They are concerned about their lives, their livelihoods--about the issues that affect them and their families, their neighborhoods, their community. They want people in this body and in the courts across the street to protect the rights of Americans, protect consumers, protect our kids and our environment, but this is, in fact, what I believe the nominee we are all considering has shown that he will not do.  It is no secret that Judge Gorsuch's nomination comes at a very divisive time for this body and a challenging time for this country. We have experienced great times of turmoil and polarization before in this Nation and in this body. In the Federalist Papers, written over two centuries ago, James Madison warns in Federalist Paper 10 about what he calls the ``mischiefs of faction'' and its inevitability--that citizens of the Nation and their political parties will undoubtedly disagree and will possess competing interests. Madison asserted that the existence of the legislative branch would guard against some of the worst effects of this reality. He wrote that those elected to represent the American people in the legislature would be those ``whose wisdom may best discern the true interests of their country and whose patriotism and love of justice will be least likely to sacrifice it to a temporary or partial consideration.''  When this body is at its best, I believe that is true. I have seen that kind of partnership in this body. But I am afraid that we are indeed at a troubling time--a troubling time in history for the Senate where it seems that the reverse of Madison's hopes have become reflective of the truth we are experiencing because we are now facing a vote on a Supreme Court nominee whose confirmation, I believe, would be a sacrifice to temporary and partial considerations as opposed to the larger interests of our country.  In my short time in the body--just over 3\1/2\ years--I have come to this floor to speak on the nominations of two different Supreme Court Justices to serve here in the United The first was Judge Merrick He was not only well qualified, intelligent, and capable, he was moderate. President Obama even sought input from Republicans about choosing someone who was a mainstream jurist. He was more than qualified to sit on the Supreme Court, but he was actually someone who could bring folks together. His qualifications, his aptitude to serve, and his moderate philosophy were not reflected in how we dealt with that nomination.  I believe he deserved an up-or-down vote. Even if it was a 60-vote threshold, he deserved an up-or-down vote. More than that, he should have had the opportunity to meet with Senators, Republican and Democratic, like Gorsuch has met with Senators, Republican and He deserved to have a committee hearing. He deserved to be voted on up or down in that committee, and he deserved to have his nomination come to the floor. Whether a 60-vote threshold or a 50-vote threshold, he deserved an up-or-down vote, but he did not get one.  The Garland nomination was the bookend to an era we have been experiencing, that I have been witnessing, of obstruction, and there has been finger-pointing on both sides. But let's be clear about what happened during the Obama administration. During President Obama's time in office, we saw historic obstruction like never before. Seventy-nine of President Obama's judicial nominees were blocked by the filibusters. Seventy-nine nominees were blocked at a time when the judiciary, an independent branch of government, was saying: We are in judicial crisis in many jurisdictions. Seventy-nine of Obama's judges were blocked, compared to 68 nominees obstructed under all Presidents combined. All of the obstruction from Democrats and[[Page S2208]]Republicans and other parties, and only 68 nominees were obstructed, compared to President Obama, where there were 79.  I do not possess the same view as those who last year believed this seat should remain vacant and took the obstruction during the Obama Presidency to a much higher level. I believe that seat should have been filled not by an extreme jurist but by someone who could have tempered the partisanship of our time, someone who could have brought us together. It was a wise choice at a divisive time in our country.  President Obama did not choose somebody from further left; he chose a moderate Justice who probably could have--if he had been given an up-or-down vote--commanded 60 votes. At this time, that is what President Trump should have done--put forward a nominee who could have brought this country together, a moderate nominee, someone within the judicial mainstream. But he hasn't.  I believe a 60-vote threshold right now is more than appropriate at this moment in history. There are Republican judicial nominees who could garner 60 votes in this The 60-vote threshold exists because a person confirmed to serve on the Supreme Court at this time should be mainstream and independent enough to garner that two-thirds support.  The 60-vote threshold exists because confirmation of a Justice to the Supreme Court is one of the most important duties we perform, one of the most important positions in all of American It is someone who will have an impact on our society, shaping it and forming it for generations to come.  This President should have sought real advice and consent from the entire Senate, but instead he turned to the judicial extreme.  Now more than ever, we need a threshold that can pull our nominees back to the mainstream, that can begin to heal the divisions. I do not believe it is in the best interests of my constituents or the American people to confirm someone so extreme on a 50-vote margin. It should be 60 votes.  I urge my colleagues to understand that this judge threatens those ideals we hold precious, those words at the very beginning of our Constitution, ``We the People.'' I urge people to understand that this is the time more than ever that we must continue to fight to defend the marginalized, the weak, the people who do not possess wealth, the people who are standing against powerful corporations, that we cannot reverse a tradition where our courts were the main societal avenue in which people could receive equal justice under the law. We cannot put someone in office who has shown throughout their judicial record to be contrary to that.  For the sake of this body, now more than ever, it is my hope that we can see a judicial nominee who will help to heal wounds and not create them, help to elevate the unity of us as a people, who will help to affirm the ideals of our Nation and the very conception that we are one people, we are one Nation, and we hold one destiny.

468,WARNER,proceeding_id,topic-id,1194,"Mr.President, first of all, let me thank my friend the Senator from New Jersey for his statement. I, too, share the belief that there was a better way to go about this judicial nomination process. I think as well that traditions such as a 60-vote margin should be maintained.  I think, frankly, neither party comes to this issue completely with clean hands, with the Democrats' action in 2013. But clearly our colleagues' actions of not even giving someone of such character as Merrick Garland the courtesy of meetings, a hearing, and then an up-or-down vote--for that and for many other reasons, I will be joining my friend from New Jersey in voting against Judge Gorsuch and making sure that we use all of our available tools. So I thank him for those comments.                      Tribute to Federal Employees      Kirk Yeager, Dennis Wagner, Edward Grace, and Mariela Melero  Mr.President, that sense of what we are dealing with now in our politics today is the subject that I want to speak about for a few minutes; that is, the incredibly important efforts made each and every day by our public servants.  We often forget that our public servants, our Federal employees, go to work every day with the sole mission to make the country a better and safer place. Day after day they go to work, receiving little recognition for the great work they do. Since 2010, I have come to the Senate floor to honor exemplary Federal employees--a tradition that was begun by my friend Senator Ted One of those Federal employees is actually sitting at the desk and has helped me and I know so many other Senators as we have tried to learn this job.  The reason I wanted to come back today was because today, in light of a governmentwide hiring freeze, the reinstatement of the so-called Holman rule, a proposed budget that would deeply cut our Federal workforce, and candidly, in these times, the targeting of career civil servants by certain conservative media outlets, this tradition of honoring those who serve, oftentimes without recognition, our Federal employees, feels even more important.  Our Federal employees--over 170,000 of them Virginians--serve their country dutifully regardless of the party in power. Not only do they carry out the mission of the administration they are serving, but they also provide countless benefits to the American public. It is my hope that my colleagues and the current administration will remember these facts and set aside ideology when considering actions that affect our Federal agencies and their workforce.  Today I want to take a couple of moments to recognize a few Virginians who are working behind the scenes to actually make our government more efficient and more effective.  First, I would like to recognize Kirk Kirk is the Chief Explosives Scientist at the In this role, he both responds to crises and oversees the Bureau's efforts to better understand the explosives terrorists use. Having studied bomb-making for more than 20 years, Kirk works with both domestic and foreign law enforcement agencies and has developed and provided crucial training to every bomb squad in the United States and to many of our foreign allies. Through his work, Kirk has made U.civilian law enforcement personnel and those who serve our country in the military much safer.  Next, I would like to recognize Dennis Dennis is the Director of the Quality Improvement and Innovation Group at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid As part of a team at CMS, Dennis contributed to the creation of the Partnership for Patients, a public-private partnership to increase patient safety and reduce readmissions to U.hospitals. Their work has produced outstanding results, including 2.1 million fewer patients harmed and $20 billion saved. That is a remarkable statistic, and obviously the work going on at CMS--an agency that does not get a lot of recognition; candidly, most people don't even know--a person like this gentleman, Dennis, has made our healthcare system better.  Third, I would like to recognize Edward Edward is the Deputy Chief in the Office of Law Enforcement at the U.Fish and Wildlife In that role, Edward has been leading a nationwide law enforcement investigation known as Operation Crash, targeting those who smuggle and trade rhino horns and elephant ivory. In addition to assisting in the Department's efforts to preserve global biodiversity, Operation Crash has led to 41 arrests, 30 convictions, and the seizure of millions of dollars in smuggled goods--results that show that those seeking to engage in this kind of activity--there will be real legal consequences to their actions.  Finally, I would like to recognize Mariela Mariela is the Associate Director for the Customer Service and Public Engagement Directorate at the U.Citizenship and Immigration Mariela and her team have been working to improve the way USCIS interacts with the millions of people who contact their office seeking citizenship, permanent residency, refugee status, or other assistance. Central to that mission are the innovative improvements Mariela has made to the myUSCIS website, as well as the launch of Emma, a virtual assistant that in a typical month answers nearly[[Page S2209]]500,000 questions with a success rate of nearly 90 percent.  To ensure that this resource was available to a wide range of customers, Mariela also oversaw the creation of a Spanish-speaking Emma that came online in 2016. These important improvements have been crucial to driving efficiency for the world's largest immigration system in the world.  Again, I hope my colleagues--as we think about budgets and numbers and when we hear people who oftentimes denigrate our Federal employees--will remember some of these individuals who, not for great reward or recognition, actually get up each and every day and go to work, trying to ensure that our government functions for the hundreds of millions of Americans who oftentimes don't acknowledge or recognize their services enough.  Mr.President, as I mentioned at the outset, I know this is a time when most of my colleagues are speaking on Judge I will simply add, after a careful review of his record and my belief as well, that his unwillingness to really give truly straight answers in terms of comments--whether it was basic, decided legal opinions like Brown v. Board of Education or Roe v. Wade or Citizens United--and his failure to even answer those questions has unfortunately led me to join with so many of my other colleagues in voting against him.  I still hope that there is a way that we can avoid changing the rules of the Senate during this process. I know there are many colleagues who are working on those efforts. If they are successful, I look forward to joining them.  As we think about Judge Gorsuch, as we recognize the challenges we have ahead of us, let us also--those of us who serve in this body--continue to take a moment every day to say thanks to a Federal employee who, in one way or another, works tirelessly day in and day out to make our country a better place.

470,CARPER,proceeding_id,topic-id,1544,"Mr.President, last week on this Senate floor, I made the case for Democrats and Republicans joining together to confirm one of the most qualified individuals ever nominated to the U.Supreme I was referring, of course, to Chief Judge Merrick  I don't wish to belabor the point here this evening, but it bears repeating that Judge Garland brought with him more Federal judicial experience than any Supreme Court nominee in the history of the United  It bears repeating that Judge Garland is an extraordinary man, a good man, a brilliant man, a fair judge, and a consensus builder on the bench in a day and age when we need consensus builders on the Supreme Court and other courts across the country. Frankly, we also need them right here on this floor, in this body.  It bears repeating that the obstruction of Judge Garland's nomination was unprecedented in the history of the United States of America and in the history of the  Since the Senate Judiciary Committee began holding public hearings on Supreme Court nominations in 1916, no Supreme Court nominee had ever been denied a hearing and a vote--until Judge Many of our Republican colleagues refused to meet with him. When his nomination expired at noon on January 3, 2017, 293 days had passed--293 wasted days.  A good man was treated badly. I believe our Constitution was treated badly. I believe that the obstruction of Judge Garland's nomination was unprecedented. I believe it was shameful. From my view, we cannot pretend that this vacant seat on the Supreme Court--what I believe should be Judge Garland's seat--is anything other than blatant partisanship.  I believe that upholding my oath to protect the Constitution means finding agreement on moving Judge Garland's nomination forward at the same time--at the same time as that of Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump's Supreme Court nominee.  I have no choice but to oppose Judge Gorsuch's nomination this week because anything else would be a stamp of approval for what I believe is playing politics with Supreme Court nominees. I cannot support Judge Gorsuch's nomination because we cannot have one set of rules for Democratic Presidents and another set of rules for Republican  Some of my colleagues and maybe some of the Americans listening at home tonight may be asking themselves: Well, Senator Carper, didn't the Democrats change the rules for judges when they were in the majority? That is a fair question. To that, I would say yes. That is true for lower court nominees, nominees to Federal district courts and courts of appeals.  But it wasn't because Senator Harry Reid woke up one morning and decided that was the day to change the rules of the A decision of this magnitude didn't happen on a whim. It was because, by the time November 2013 had arrived, our Republican friends had attempted to block--get this--more nominations in the first 5 years of President Obama's tenure than all other Presidents combined. Let me say that again. It was because, by the time November 2013 had arrived, our Republican friends had attempted to block more nominations in the first 5 years of President Obama's tenure than all other Presidents combined.  It wasn't the unprecedented use of cloture motions--79 cloture motions--during those 5 years that precipitated Democrats' seeking a solution to restore the capability of the Senate to do its job. It was because our Republican friends refused to consider any nominee--any nominee--to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, despite three critical vacancies on our Nation's second highest court.  So, yes, it is true that Democrats supported a change that allowed a vote on those nominees, but it was because our Republican friends took the unheard of position that no nominees--no nominees, no matter their qualifications--were entitled to a vote.  I should note that Democrats were careful to preserve the 60 votes for Supreme Court nominees.  Let me just say that, if there is any position in the Federal Government that should require at least 60 votes, my view is it should be the Supreme Court, and that is the rule under which we operate as of this moment.  One of the reasons why is because Supreme Court vacancies come around quite rarely. When they do, we need to ensure that debate is robust, we need to ensure that the nominee is from the judicial and the political mainstream, and we need to ensure that these lifetime appointments are held to the highest standards. In other words, I believe we need a nominee like Judge Merrick  Despite his own impressive resume, I have concerns with Judge Gorsuch's nomination beyond the treatment of Judge Garland, and I have concerns with the way that our debate has not been, frankly, robust. I have concerns that Judge Gorsuch's views are outside the judicial and political mainstream, and I have concerns about what others have termed ``evasiveness.'' His evasiveness before the Judiciary Committee does not meet the high standards that we should expect for those lifetime appointments.  I would be remiss if I did not mention what I referred to last week as the cloud that lingers still over President Trump's campaign. Like many Americans, I read the news related to Russia and the Trump campaign, and I come to the inescapable conclusion that the cloud is darkening and the forecast is a matter of grave concern for our  FBI Director Jim Comey has testified under oath that there is an ongoing investigation to determine the links between the Trump campaign and Russia, an adversary that attacked our election and undermined a free and fair election to change the outcome of that election. From all appearances, they did.  To hastily move forward with Judge Gorsuch--who is 49 years old, who could serve on the Supreme Court well into the middle of this century--without first getting to the bottom of the suspicious and irregular actions of Trump campaign officials would be, in my view, a mistake.[[Page S2210]]  For many Americans, this Supreme Court seat will always come with an asterisk attached to it. They believe and I believe that it was a stolen seat that belonged to Judge Merrick  Many Americans are wondering why we are rushing to fill a lifetime vacancy while President Trump's campaign remains under investigation and will for at least some while.  I believe we have some time. Judge Garland waited 293 days for a hearing and a vote that never came. Judge Gorsuch has waited 48 days for a hearing and many of our Republican friends would like to see him seated this week.  Again, I would say: Judge Merrick Garland waited 293 days for a hearing and a vote that never, never came.  What we face here today, I think, is a rush to judgment. I would just say that we have time. We ought to hit the pause button on this nomination.  The American people are watching us, and history will judge us. I fear that history may judge us poorly if anyone other than Merrick Garland is confirmed at this time. I fear that history may judge us poorly if we do not insist that the Trump campaign is first cleared of any wrongdoing before we move forward. We need to get this right. We have time to get this right.  The Senate has been through it all. The good men and women of the Senate have always disagreed--sometimes passionately, oftentimes loudly. I understand that this disagreement before us may seem irresolvable, but that is only if we seek to cut off debate and admit defeat. Personally speaking, I am not ready to do that today or this week.  I believe we have time. I believe we have the opportunity to right a historic wrong. We have not just an opportunity to right a historic wrong but also an obligation to get this right.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr.Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING Without objection, it is so ordered.

Rich Rimkunas has had a career filled with outstanding achievement at the Congressional Research Service, After nearly 37 years of service, Rich will be retiring from CRS on Friday, April 28.  When Rich joined CRS in 1980, he was an analyst working on a broad array of social policy issues. Initially, he worked on issues like child nutrition, poverty, Social Security, social services for the aged, and unemployment insurance. Rich cocreated and coauthored a widely circulated CRS report on Federal social welfare spending. He was also a coauthor and contributor to several chapters in the House Ways and Means Committee print ``Children in Poverty,'' which provided a detailed look at the incidence and characteristics of child poverty in the United  Rich ultimately became heavily involved in providing research and analytical support to Congress on many health policy issues, including analyses of aggregate national health expenditures, the Medicare hospital prospective payment system, the Medicare Advantage program, and Medicare catastrophic drug costs. Additionally, he has worked on numerous issues related to He both directed a team of CRS analysts as well as contributed his own analysis to the Medicaid ``Yellow Book,'' a 1988 House Ways and Means Committee print that provided a comprehensive analysis of the Medicaid program as it existed at the time. Rich also managed the 1993 update of the ``Yellow Book.''  Rich's analyses have typically involved quantitative research methodologies, modeling techniques, and the use of complex databases. Rich has excelled at developing approaches for simulating the effects of potential changes to Federal benefits and grant allocation formulas.  In addition to the direct impact his research and analytical work has had on Federal policies, Rich has made equally important contributions within CRS in managerial roles. During his tenure at CRS, he has served as section research manager of the methodology section, the research development section, the research development and income support section, and the hea1th insurance and financing section. During his tenure as an SRM, Rich helped manage CRS work on the 1996 welfare reform law and the 2003 overhaul of Medicare in the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Rich helped manage an interdisciplinary team numbering about 3 dozen CRS analysts that provided legislative support during the passage of the Affordable Care  Throughout his career, Rich has served as a role model for the highest level of CRS service to Congress, upholding the Service's standards of authoritativeness, objectivity, and confidentiality. He is known within CRS for his attention to detail, methodological strength, and creative approaches toward conducting analyses. His input is sought on a great many research efforts spanning virtually all of the major domestic social policy issue areas that Congress deals with.  Rich is renowned for his tremendous work ethic and energizing presence. Those who have worked closely with him appreciate his ability to keep his sense of humor even during the most stressful times.  In recent years, Rich has served as the deputy assistant director of CRS's domestic social policy division. In that role, he has mentored and helped develop many of the division's managers, analysts, and research assistants. He has also played a central role in reviewing written work produced by the division, helping to ensure its accuracy, completeness, and quality.

Unfortunately, world history is replete with examples of strong, messianic leaders who abused their power in ways that caused immense hardship for their people and divisiveness and conflict in their countries.  Despite that, the White House has voiced its strong support for President el-Sisi, and for U.S.-Egyptian relations.  I have been to Egypt many times, and I have voted for billions of dollars in U.aid for Egypt to support economic and security programs in that country. I have recognized positive developments in Egypt when they occur, such as President el-Sisi's decision to undertake economic reforms, including by reducing some subsidies. Far more needs to be done, however, if Egypt's economy is to break free of decades of state control, endemic corruption, and gross mismanagement.  I am also aware of the security threats Egypt faces in Libya and in the Sinai, although I and others have expressed deep concern with the flawed tactics the Egyptian Government is using to combat those threats. The U.has an interest in helping Egypt confront these challenges by addressing the underlying causes in a manner that is effective and consistent with international law.  President Trump has called President el-Sisi a fantastic guy. Ironically, that says a lot more about President Trump than it does about President el- President el-Sisi, a former general who seized power by force, has ruled with an iron fist. He has effectively banned public criticism of his government since the removal of former President Morsi, enforcing what amounts to a prohibition on protests and arresting hundreds of people in connection with the ban, many preemptively.  President el-Sisi's government has engaged in one of the widest arrest campaigns in the country's modern history, targeting a broad spectrum of political opponents. Local civil society organizations estimate that between 40,000 and 60,000 people are detained on political grounds, such as for protesting or calling for a change in government. Police have accused many of having links to the Muslim Brotherhood, usually without evidence that they have advocated or engaged in violence. Many other detainees belong to other political organizations or have no party affiliation.  A systematic crackdown on Egypt's independent civil society has left it on the verge of collapse. According to human rights groups, nearly every prominent Egyptian human rights defender or civil society leader is banned[[Page S2212]]from leaving the country as part of a judicial investigation into the foreign funding of their organizations. A law signed by President el-Sisi in 2014 would allow prosecutors to seek 25-year sentences for illegally receiving foreign funding. Parliament has also proposed a new law regulating civil society organizations which, if adopted, would effectively outlaw independent human rights work in the country.  Despite repeated requests by U.officials, including some Republicans and Democrats in Congress, President el-Sisi's government has refused to release those detained for political reasons for months or years without charge or on trumped up charges like Egyptian-American citizen Aya  The media has also been targeted, with authorities threatening and jailing journalists who reported on political opposition. Some foreign journalists have been barred from the country after writing articles critical of the government. As of December 2016, Egypt was the third-highest jailer of journalists, according to the Committee to Protect This pattern of harassment and arrests is not new. It has been happening for years, and, contrary to the representations of Egyptian officials, it is getting worse.  According to Human Rights Watch, members of the security forces, particularly the Interior Ministry's National Security Agency, routinely torture detainees to elicit confessions. This torture usually occurs during periods of enforced disappearance that can last for weeks or months. The widespread use of torture has also been reported by the State Despite hundreds of reported cases of torture and enforced disappearance, since 2013, only a handful of police officers have reportedly been punished for violating the law.  According to information I have received, prison conditions remain deplorable, and political detainees are beaten, often deprived of contact with relatives and lawyers, and denied access to medical care.  The government's use of U.aircraft and other military equipment in its counterterrorism campaign against a local ISIS affiliate in the northern Sinai has not only resulted in indiscriminate attacks against civilians and other gross violations of human rights, it has made the terrorism situation worse. Requests by myself, as well as State and Defense Department officials and by independent journalists and representatives of human rights groups, for access to conflicted areas, have been denied.  While President Trump and other U.officials unabashedly praise President el-Sisi, I wonder how they reconcile their portrayal of him with his crackdown against civil society and brutal repression of dissent. In fact, it can't be reconciled, and it damages our own credibility as a strong defender of human rights and democratic principles.  I want to reiterate what I said in this Chamber on September 27, 2016, when I spoke about Aya Hijazi, the young Egyptian American social worker currently detained in ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgS2211-2.txt
478,LEAHY,proceeding_id,topic-id,965,"Mr.President, I want to express my serious concerns with the budget for fiscal year 2018 recently proposed by President If adopted, this budget would have severe consequences on many Americans, but I am particularly concerned that it would be low-income families who are impacted the most. As vice chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I will do everything in my power to make sure that does not happen.  Among countless examples within a budget that is out of touch and that will drive more American families into poverty, the President's proposal to eliminate the Community Service Block Grant, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP, and the Weatherization Assistance Program should be concerning to all of us. These are resources that are essential not only to Vermonters, but to millions of families throughout the country.  The Community Service Block Grant ensures that low-income families receive the support they need for basic food and housing assistance, financial planning tools, and fuel in winter months. LIHEAP and weatherization services ensure that families do not have to choose between food and heat. They ensure that families stay safe from harmful asbestos that may be in the walls of their old Vermont farmhouses or their inefficient mobile homes. In States like mine, home heating is a life-and-death matter.  We need to show compassion when drafting our budget and provide support for those programs that help hard-working families in need. We must see the faces behind these proposed budget cuts. Vulnerable people should never be at the whim of politically driven priorities.  We have to do better. I would like to begin by recognizing the crisis so many families will face in this country without the help of our community action agencies. Without them, families will go cold. They will choose not to eat so they can heat their homes. They will deny themselves healthcare and miss rent payments so that they can stay warm, so that they can stay alive.  Last month, I had the pleasure of seeing a longtime friend and fellow Vermonter Jan Demers, who serves as the executive director of the Champlain Valley Office of Economic Opportunity, CVOEO, Vermont's largest community action agency in It was Jan who said it best, noting that, ``President Trump's budget is like one amputation after another. Not bringing health to the community but cut after cut--loss after loss.'' I am proud that CVOEO and the other community action agencies continue to meet the needs of these families and hope all Senators will continue to support them as I have during my time in the  In recognition of their leadership, I ask unanimous consent that a statement by Jan Demers be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Good morning, my name is Jan Demers and I am the Executive      Director of the Champlain Valley Office of Economic      On behalf of the more than 23,000 Vermonters      that CVOEO serves: We are standing in CVOEOs      Weatherization It is a fitting place to talk about      President Trump's recently released budget. Thank you to      Senator Leahy and your staff for organizing this press      conference and for the leadership you provide for Vermont and      the nation. Thank you to Jonathan Bond and our staff and for      all the Community Action Agencies who carry on this good      work. Thank you to Bobby Arnell, Sean Brown, Sarah Phillips      and to our partners in the State of Vermont who uphold the      values of care and wellness for all And thank you      to Mr.Todd Alexander who typifies the strength of those we      serve.       Community Action Agencies exist to support community well-     being. We make sure that everyone can reach their potential      and fully contribute to the total strength of our      communities.       How does Mr.Trump's budget affect CVOEO? It zeros out the      Community Service Block Grant--$990,687. This is the      foundational grant that undergirds the majority of our      programs. It zeros out the Low Income Home Energy Assistance      Program (LIHEAP) that keeps Vermonters warm in the winter. It      zeros out the Department of Energy's Weatherization      Thankfully the State of Vermont is our main source of      Weatherization funding. However, this will mean that 30      Vermont homes will not be weatherized in our area. Just those      3 cuts amount to a total of $2,056,675.       On top of that there are the cuts to Head Start, Fair      Housing, Housing assistance, Mobile Home, and Voices Against      There isn't an area, program, staff person or any      of the 23,000 people we served that won't be touched and      experience devastation of services due to this budget.       We have heard over and over that the war on poverty didn't      work. However, when the programs that created the War on      Poverty in 1964 measured the percent of poverty it was at      20%. Seven years later the percentage of poverty was at 11%.      It worked! Then the years of cutting started, cut after cut      was enacted weakening the effort substantially. In 2012 the      measured percent of poverty was 15%. Currently the percentage      of poverty is 13.5%. To me that signifies that the measured      efforts put into place during the Obama years are working.       There isn't a CVOEO Program that isn't decimated by this      budget bringing great loss for the entire population of over      23,000 people that CVOEO served in FY 16. Community Action      Agencies exist to support community well-being. Instead of      health, this budget is like one amputation after another. Not      bringing health to the community but cut after cut--loss      after loss.       Our vision is bridging gaps and building futures for the      people we serve. This budget widens the chasm and diminishes      life.       This cannot be the last word in the Federal budget for FY      18.       Thank you, Senator Leahy for bringing us a better way.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgS2211.txt

The breadth of its mission is impressive--from ensuring regional stability and combating terrorism to training partner countries and supporting humanitarian aid. While NATO was founded to ensure Western peace and stability in the face of the Cold War, its work has come to encompass all corners and peoples of the globe.  NATO is more important than ever today in deterring regional conflict The U.must stand by its ironclad commitment to NATO's security and solidarity as Russian President Vladimir Putin flouts international law and exerts Russian aggression around the world, from meddling in our own election to the illegal annexation of  Our NATO allies need our support. I applaud Operation Atlantic Resolve, which coordinates the deployment of additional NATO troops to our allies in Eastern I also commend other U.efforts that support our NATO allies, like the European Reassurance These play an essential role in bolstering our force readiness in the region to deter Russian aggression and demonstrate our commitment to the common cause and democratic principles that NATO embodies.  American support for NATO is and must remain steadfast. The nearly unanimous vote in the Senate ratifying Montenegro's accession to be a member state is evidence of this well-established, deeply founded support.[[Page S2213]]Ukraine's stated intention to achieve the criteria for joining NATO, too, is testament to the organization's renewed importance in our deterrence policy in the region.  While the sentiment of NATO's article 5--``an attack on one is an attack on all''--helped guide the U.stably through the Cold War, NATO has remained a relevant source of stength for the international community, beyond regional deterrence. Since 1999, when NATO identified the risk international terrorism posed for member nations, the organization has remained a steadfast resource in the fight against terrorism. In fact, the only instance in which article 5 was invoked was in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Since then, NATO has helped ensure freedom of navigation in waters plagued by piracy, helped train Iraqi security forces counter improvised explosive devices, commanded counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan for more than a decade, provided support for Global Coalition to Counter ISIL, and innumerable other contributions. As threats to member nations evolved in the 21st century, NATO demonstrated its ability to adapt.  NATO showed the power of strength through solidarity, not only for its member nations, but also for its dozens of partner nations around the globe. The power of NATO's partnerships lends strength to the global community as a whole, better equipping regions of the world to respond when disaster strikes. Programs like NATO's Centres of Excellence help partner countries fight corruption, piracy, and terrorism and collaborate to stem the spread of weapons of mass destruction and other arms. By serving as a resource for nonmember countries, NATO not only strengthens the resolve of the international community to strife and instability, but also serves as a beacon for democratic values like gender equality and rule of law.  Finally, NATO has long served as a force for human rights. It was central to ending the genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1995, and it helped bring an end to violence in Kosovo in 1999. NATO has served as a vital resource assisting with the waves of refugees escaping from violence and atrocity in Syria, and the organization has been at the frontlines to combat international human trafficking.  NATO plays a critical role in combatting increased Russian aggression, but its mission is much broader than that. The world is a safer place thanks to NATO, from stemming regional conflicts, to assisting partners around the world. It serves as an indispensable, indisputable resource for the international community. As we celebrate the anniversary of this pivotal organization today, we must remain committed to its successful future.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgS2212-2.txt

501,WYDEN,proceeding_id,topic-id,478,"Mr.President, today I, along with my colleague Senator Paul from Kentucky, am introducing the Protecting Data at the Border Act, a bill that protects Americans and U.Permanent Residents from warrantless searches of their electronic devices at the border.  1n 2014, the Supreme Court established in California v. Riley that law enforcement agencies must obtain a probable cause search warrant before they can search someone's phone or laptop during a ``search incident to arrest.'' Prior to that decision, law enforcement agencies around the country routinely engaged in warrantless searches of phones and other electronic devices. The Supreme Court rightly recognized that we need new, stronger rules to protect digital information.  Although the warrant protections from Riley have been the law of the land for the last three years, a significant loophole has remained: the border. The Riley decision left unresolved the question of whether or not U.Customs can search the smartphones and laptops of U.persons as they leave the country and return home. This is not a theoretical concern. According to recent statistics provided by Customs and Border Protection, searches of cellphones by border agents has exploded, growing fivefold in just one[[Page S2217]]year, from fewer than 5,000 in 2015 to nearly 25,000 in 2016. Five-thousand devices were searched this last February alone, more than in all of 2015.  My colleague, Senator Paul and I intend to close this loophole, ensuring that U.persons crossing the border do not have lesser digital privacy rights than individuals who are arrested inside the United  This bill has four main components.  First, it requires that law enforcement agencies obtain a probable cause warrant before they can search the laptop, smartphone or other electronic device belonging to a U.person at the border. The bill includes an emergency exception to this warrant requirement, modeled after USA Freedom Act section 102, which became law in 2015.  Second, it requires informed, written consent before the government may request and obtain voluntary assistance from a U.person accessing data on a locked device or account, such as by disclosing their password or otherwise providing access. The bill also prohibits the government from delaying or denying entry to a U.person if he or she refuses to provide such assistance.  Third, it requires that the government obtain a warrant before it can copy and retain a U.person's data, even if the data has been collected without a warrant, during an emergency.  Fourth, it requires that the government create and publish statistics on the electronic border searches they conduct.  Passage of this bill would ensure that the important privacy rights recognized by the Supreme Court in Riley also apply at the border, while still enabling law enforcement agencies continue to do the important work of keeping our country safe.  I thank my colleague Senator Paul for his efforts on this bill, and I hope the Senate will consider our proposal quickly.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgS2216.txt

I have introduced this in a bipartisan way as the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, along with Senator Tom Carper, who is the ranking member of that committee, and along with Senator Jim Inhofe, who is a former chairman of that committee.  This legislation is called the Wildlife Innovation and Longevity Driver Act, WILD for short. I am a supporter of both conserving wildlife and technological innovation that we have before us.  My home State of Wyoming is truly one of the most beautiful places in the world. The people of Wyoming have an incredible appreciation for our wildlife. We applaud the efforts of innovators to help us conserve and manage species much more effectively and at a lower cost. Our State wildlife managers grapple with many challenges that innovators can help us solve.  For example, poaching has been a major issue in Hundreds of animals are taken illegally in the That is what I hear from the Wyoming Game & Fish Poaching is a problem across the country. It is not just the case in Wyoming; it has become pandemic overseas. International poachers seeking to cash in on the ivory trade have reduced the population of African elephants by 75 percent over the last 10 years. It is tragic.  Invasive species also present a threat to native wildlife, to water resources, and to our landscape. Invasive species clog pipes and fuel catastrophic fires. In fact, invasive species have a role in 42 percent of the listings under the Endangered Species It is invasive species that are causing other species to become endangered.  We need creative solutions to these threats to our wildlife. Our Nation's innovators are developing cutting-edge technologies to help us more effectively fight poaching, manage wildlife, and control invasive species.  A 2015 National Geographic article outlined a number of innovative technologies that are being used today to promote conservation of many of the world's most endangered species. That includes DNA analysis to identify the origin of illicit ivory supplies, using thermal imaging around protected areas to notify authorities of poachers, and using apps to assist wildlife enforcement in carrying out their duties.  In December, the National Invasive Species Council cohosted a summit, which highlighted innovations that combat invasive species. A few examples are a fish passage that automatically extracts invasive fish from streams, DNA technologies to provide early detection of invasive species, and the use of drones to gain spatially accurate, high resolution images that could be used to detect and monitor specific invasive species. Innovations like these are why we have introduced in a bipartisan way the WILD  This act provides technological and financial assistance to private landowners to improve fish and wildlife habitats. The legislation does this by reauthorizing the Partners for Fish and Wildlife The WILD Act requires Federal agencies to implement strategic programs to control invasive species. It also reauthorizes important laws to protect endangered and valuable species around the world, such as the African elephant, the Asian elephant, the rhinoceros, the great ape, and the marine turtle.  Finally, this act creates incentives for new conservation innovation. The legislation establishes four separate cash prizes for technological innovation in the prevention of wildlife poaching and trafficking, in the promotion of wildlife conservation, in the management of invasive species, and in the protection of endangered species. The Department of the Interior will administer the prizes, and a panel of relevant experts will award each prize.  Innovation is one of the best tools in conserving endangered species and keeping invasive species under control. The WILD Act will help stimulate that innovation.

Some may ask ``Why does America care about that?'' beyond, obviously, our moral calling to defend the rights of all people. It is that it is counterproductive behavior.

They become more vulnerable to those campaigns when they feel they are being mistreated.  The current Government of Egypt, under the leadership of President Elsisi, has cracked down on civil society. On that, there can be no debate. They have jailed thousands of political prisoners, including, sadly, some Americans, and it has responded with brute force to those who oppose that government.  Again, I reiterate that a strong U.S.-Egypt relationship is important to America--to advancing our interests in the Middle I am here to speak on behalf of American interests and why this is so important in our relationship with Egypt and in the stability of the region, but I must do so by describing the situation on the ground.  In the national interest of our country, we cannot turn a blind eye to the ongoing repression of Egyptian citizens by their government. It weakens our moral standing in the world, and, as I have already said numerous times, it makes Egypt less secure. If Egypt is less secure, ultimately America will be less secure. Today, I said that to President  Over the last decades, the American people have provided Egypt with more than $77 billion in foreign aid. This includes what is currently $1.3 billion per year in military aid. But as the human rights situation in Egypt continues to deteriorate and the government refuses to take the serious and necessary steps of reform and respecting the rule of law, then this Congress, on behalf of the American people--who are giving $1.3 billion of their hard-earned taxpayer money--must continue to pursue the reform of our assistance to Egypt to make sure that not only is it allowing them to confront the challenges that are posed by radicalism today but that it also promotes progress in a way that does not leave Egypt unstable and ultimately vulnerable in the future.  It is in the interest of both our country and Egypt and the Egyptian people to implement reforms and to release all of its jailed political prisoners, including all jailed Nations cannot thrive and they cannot prosper if their citizens are oppressed or are unable to express themselves freely without fear of being jailed, tortured, or killed.  Inevitably, if these conditions continue, there will be a street uprising in Egypt once again, and it could very well be led by radical elements who seek to overthrow the government and create a space for terrorism.  Human rights abuses in Egypt take on many forms. An example is the lack of press freedom. In 2016, Egypt joined other nations in rising to the top of the rankings as the world's third highest jailer of journalists. According to the Reporters Without Borders' 2016 World Press Freedom Index, Egypt currently ranks 159th out of 180 countries in terms of press freedom. The media, including journalists, bloggers, and those active on social media, are regularly harassed and arrested. There are currently 24 journalists who are jailed on trumped-up and politically motivated charges. Their ``crimes'' have included publishing false information and inciting terrorism. Censorship has grown as they continue to interfere in the publication and circulation of news--although, by the way, a lot of Egyptian news coverage is very anti-These are just a few examples of the ongoing repression of press freedom in  There are also human rights abuses the Egyptian Government continues to commit with regard to freedom of association and of assembly. In November of 2016, the Egyptian Parliament passed a draconian law that, if signed by President Elsisi, would ban nongovernmental organizations from operating freely in The law would essentially eliminate all independent human rights groups. It would make it nearly impossible for charities to function by imposing strict regulations and registration processes. Individuals who violate this law could face jail time simply for speaking out and fighting to defend human rights. Passing laws like these has a chilling effect on dissent.  Here is the good news: President Elsisi has not signed it over 4 months later, and I truly hope it is because he is having second thoughts about it, because he recognizes the terrible impact it will have on his country's future, on their perception around the world, on their ability to make progress and reform, and ultimately because he also recognizes the impact it will have on free nations, like the United States, which desires to work with Egypt on many issues of common interest. I strongly encourage President Elsisi to reject that anti-NGO law.  There is the issue of political prisoners. According to the Project on Middle East Democracy, since 2013 at least 60,000 political prisoners have been arrested in Egypt and 1,800 people have received death sentences in what many[[Page S2222]]organizations have described as being politically motivated sentences.  In 2014, President Elsisi issued a decree that expanded the jurisdiction of military courts over civilians. According to Human Rights Watch, since the decree was issued, the military courts have tried over 7,400 Egyptian civilians.  Additionally, individuals who have been victims of enforced disappearances in Egypt have claimed that they were tortured and subjected to other forms of abuse when they were taken. There has been little accountability for this excessive use of force.  Egypt's repression is not limited to its own citizens. There are currently a number of Americans who are jailed in There is one American in particular whom I would like to raise: the case of American-Egyptian citizen Aya  Aya was arrested in May of 2014, along with her husband and other members of her organization, which is called the Belady Foundation, which works with abandoned and homeless youth and rescues these young children off the streets. Three years ago, she was arrested and charged with ridiculous allegations, including sexual abuse and paying the children to participate in demonstrations against the government. To date, no evidence has been provided to back these horrible allegations. Almost 3 years later, this American citizen remains in prison.  Throughout that time, I and others here in the Senate have been calling for her release, and it is time that the charges against her be dropped and her husband and the other workers be released immediately because her case and many others like it are an obstacle to better relations.  The Egyptian people deserve better than the brutal treatment they are receiving at the hands of their government. All human beings do. It is incumbent upon us, the elected representatives of the American people, to make clear to friends, allies, partners, and foes alike that no matter what issues we are working with you on, negotiating a resolution to, or dealing with you on in some other way, we are not going to look the other way when human rights are being abused. We are going to encourage you to reform because in the long run, that is in your interest and ours.  We have seen in recent history the consequences when governments do not respect their citizens. It creates instability in those countries. Instability is the breeding ground of terrorists and radical elements around the world. Ultimately, those terrorists train their sights on us.  As I told President Elsisi today, Egypt is a nation rich in culture and history and has made extraordinary contributions to the world. It has played a leading role in fostering peace with But it faces a dangerous future if it does not create the conditions within the country in which its people can live peacefully and securely without fear. Otherwise, Egypt remains vulnerable to the kind of instability we have seen in Syria, Libya, and other countries. That is why it should matter to the American people.  I am disappointed that this issue of human rights did not come up publicly when the President met with the President of I hope that will change in the weeks and days and months to come, for it is in our national interest to further these goals. Otherwise, sadly, we could very well have yet another and perhaps the most important country in the region destabilized and ultimately left vulnerable to becoming a breeding ground for terrorism that ultimately targets our people and our                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgS2221-3.txt

520,MERKLEY,proceeding_id,topic-id,9337,"Mr.President, I rise to address the nomination of Neil I will start by noting that just moments ago the majority leader was on the floor and did something that has never before been done in U.history; that is, on the first day--indeed, in the first hours of debate on a Supreme Court Justice on this floor, the majority leader filed a petition, called a cloture petition, to close debate. So here we are on the first day, just hours into the debate, and the majority leader has said: We do not want to hear any more about this topic. We are going to shut down debate.  The rules provide some protection for this, and that is that it cannot be voted on until So there is time between now and Thursday for us to air our views. Historically, often debates went on for a substantial amount of time--a week, some for many weeks--with no cloture petition being filed, with no closing of the debate. Certainly, never before has the majority leader shut down debate, filed that petition on day one in his trying to ram this nomination through.  This is just a continuation of firsts--first events that do absolutely no credit to this institution, no credit to the Supreme Court, no credit to our In fact, they pose a substantial danger.  It was February 13, a little over a year ago, that Supreme Court Justice Scalia died. Almost immediately, the majority leader indicated that when the nomination came down from President Obama, this Chamber would not exercise its responsibility of advice and consent under the Constitution in that it would not provide an opportunity for Merrick Garland to be able to appear before a committee and answer the questions of the committee members, the questions of Republicans and the questions of Democrats, so that they could assess whether that individual was appropriate to serve in a Supreme Court seat.  The majority leader made it clear that there would be no committee hearing and no committee vote and no opportunity to come here directly to the floor, bypassing the committee. In other words, he closed off every opportunity for the President's nominee to be considered. This is the first time--this is the only time that has happened in our Nation's history when there was a vacancy in an election year.  What is the essence of this extraordinary and unusual action when this Chamber fails to exercise its advice and consent responsibility under the Constitution? Were we at a time of war, like the Civil War, in which the Capitol at times was under assault? Were we at a moment in which the building was aflame and we had to flee or there was some other significant threat to the functioning of this body? Was there some extraordinary set of circumstances--perhaps a massive storm headed for the Nation's Capital--that led the Senate for the first time in U.history to say that it could not take the time to exercise its constitutional advice and consent responsibility? There was no storm. There was no fire. There was no threat. There was no earthquake. There was nothing that would have prevented this Chamber from doing its responsibility.  The President has a responsibility under the Constitution when there is an open seat, and that is to nominate. He proceeded to consult with Members on both sides of the aisle, and he nominated an individual, Merrick Garland, who had an extraordinary reputation and who essentially was considered to come straight down the Main Street of judicial thought, with opinions that were neither labeled ``progressive'' nor ``conservative.'' They were straight down the middle.  The President made that nomination on March 16, which was a month and 3 days after the seat became vacant, but that was the last action to occur, the last action this Chamber took. A few individuals did courtesy interviews, knowing that it would lead to no committee hearing and no committee vote because the majority team in this Chamber decided to steal a Supreme Court seat. Again, such a theft never, ever has happened in the history of our  There have been a substantial number of seats that have come open during an election year--16. There have been a substantial number of individuals who were confirmed to those 16[[Page S2223]]seats, and there were individuals who were turned down by this Yet, in all of the 15 cases that preceded the death of Justice Scalia, the Senate acted. The Senate exercised its responsibility.  But this time was different. This time, the majority said: We intend to pack the Court of the United States of America--not by adding seats to it; that would not work under a Democratic President who could then nominate more individuals--to pack the Court by taking a seat, failing to exercise the responsibility that each of us has under our oath of office of advice and consent, and send it in a time capsule into the next administration, hoping that time capsule would be opened by a conservative President who would nominate someone who was very conservative, indeed, to create a 5-to-4 bias. What was that bias the majority was looking for? It was not a bias toward ``we the people''; it was a bias toward the powerful and the privileged.  If you take a look at our Constitution, that initial opening of our Constitution, it does not say ``we the privileged'' and ``we the powerful.'' It lays out a vision of a form of government with checks and balances to be designed to function of, by, and for the people. The majority was afraid that Merrick Garland would be just that kind of judge, one who would call the balls and strikes under the Constitution in support of the constitutional vision of ``we the people.'' They did not want a judge who would call the balls and strikes under our Constitution; they wanted someone who would find a way to twist a case in favor of the privileged and the powerful.  Tonight, I will lay out a lot of how they knew that was important both from the perspective of the decisions of the 5-to-4 Court that preceded the death of Justice Scalia and also Merrick Garland's writings and decisions, who found every opportunity to take a case and find some word, find some phrase, find some idea--``to operate is not to operate,'' ``to drive is not to drive,'' which is just language from one case--in order to find some way to find in favor of the powerful over the people. Merrick Garland's nomination lasted 293 days. That is the longest time in Supreme Court history.  Now I am going to turn and go through the election-year vacancies because I do not want folks to take my word for the case that the Senate has always done its job. For more than 200 years, it has done its job--until now. Let's take a look at those vacancies.  There were a couple of cases--three cases in which there was an election-year nominee and the vacancy occurred after the general election. This happened when President Adams was in office, when President Grant was in office, and when President Hayes was in office. So there was very little time left in the Presidents' terms. In a number of these cases--all three--the President did not change office until March of the following year, but the Senate did not even need those extra 2 months that it had before we amended the  President Adams nominated John He nominated him 3 days after the vacancy occurred in the year 1800, and the Senate confirmed the nominee. Here is an interesting twist: The nominee then declined the position. You do not see that very often in the history of the Supreme  Then you go to 1872 when President Grant was He had a vacancy occur on November 28, which was just a month before the end of the year and a few months before the Presidency would turn over. It was following the election. He nominated Ward The Senate acted in a little more than a week, and they confirmed him. They vetted him. They exercised their advice and consent responsibility, and they said: Yes, this individual is appropriate to serve on the  Then there was President A vacancy occurred in December 1880, and he nominated William Here we have a nominee being put forward very shortly afterwards and confirmed.  Those were the first three. That is the set of cases in which the vacancies occurred after the November elections in election years.  Let's look at the next set of vacancies. In these cases, the vacancy occurred before the elections, but the nominees were not nominated by the Presidents until after the elections. So, again, the Senate had a relatively short period of time in which to act.  We have the August 25 vacancy of 1828 with President He nominated quite a few months later--almost 4 months later--John In this case, the Senate acted, but they acted to table the nomination, so he was turned down.  Then we have President Buchanan in 1861, who nominated Jeremiah This is a little strange to us because we think of the Presidency as changing in January, but the Presidency did not change until The nomination occurred in February, and the motion to proceed was rejected by the entire body. So that nominee was rejected.  Then we turn to President The vacancy occurred in the month preceding the election. President Lincoln nominated Salmon Chase just after the election, and the Senate said: There is plenty of time. We will review that. And he was confirmed.  Then we can turn to Once again, the vacancy occurred in the month before the election, just 3 weeks before the election. Eisenhower didn't put a nomination to the Senate until January, but the Senate said: We have a responsibility of advice and consent. We will review it, we will vet the nominee, and we will vote. And they voted to confirm.  That is the second set of nominations. Those are 7 of the 16 nominations, so there are still 9 to go. Let's take a look at those.  In this case, the Senate had more time to act. The vacancy occurred before the general election. The nomination occurred before the general election.  Before I go through them, let me just note that of these nine, the Senate acted to confirm in 1804, to table in 1844, to table in 1852, to confirm in 1888, to confirm in 1892, to confirm in 1916, to confirm again 6 months later--still before the election; two in the same year--and then finally, in 1932, the Senate confirmed a nomination made in On February 15, the Senate acted.  Of these nine individuals, we have six who were confirmed and two were tabled. But I have left one out. There is one more nomination that occurred in an election year--just one more--and that happened last year. President Obama--we go back to Antonin Scalia dying on February 13 and Merrick Garland being nominated on March 16. So of those 16 we have looked at, the previous 15, the Senate acted each and every time because they had taken an oath of office to uphold the Constitution that has a requirement that the Senate participate in advice and consent. But this time, no action. No action. No committee hearing, not a set of committee hearings, not even one. No vote in committee. No effort or acceptance of moving the nomination to the committee of the whole, which would be here on the Senate floor. For the first time in U.history, the Senate stole a seat from one President in order to pack the  I have to tell my colleagues that it isn't just a clever new tactic. It isn't just an excessive exercise of partisanship. This is a crime against our Constitution and the responsibilities of this body. This effort to pack the Court is a major assault on the integrity of the  For every 5-to-4 decision that we see in the future, everybody is going to look and say: Five-four. How would that be different? And it will always be different if the stolen seat and the judge who fills it is on the right side because that side would otherwise have lost. The tie goes to the lower court's decision.  So what this does is not only change the trajectory of our Constitution from one where it is designed for ``we the people'' to a different vision of government by and for the people--it doesn't just change that trajectory, but it draws into question everything the Court does in the future.  Wouldn't it have been incredible if President Trump's nominee--knowing the constitutional responsibility for the Senate to act, knowing that the Senate seat had been stolen from a previous President, knowing that it would bias all the outcomes of the Court in the future--had stood up and said ``I will not participate in this crime against the Constitution'' and declined the nomination? Wouldn't that have been an act of integrity? Well, we[[Page S2224]]didn't get that act of integrity from President Trump's nominee, so here we are today, on the first day of the Senate deliberation on this nominee, and just moments ago was the first time in U.history that the majority has exercised a petition to close debate on the first day of a Senate debate on a Supreme Court Why is the majority in such a rush? Why is the Senate majority determined to push this through so quickly, in contravention of the tradition of due deliberation on this floor?  I know that if the circumstances were reversed and the Democrats had participated in stealing a seat from a Republican President, my colleagues would be screaming on this floor, and they would be fully justified. I am proud that my colleagues on this side of the aisle have never participated in such an assault on our Constitution or a failure to exercise our responsibilities under our oath of office or a theft of a Supreme Court seat or an effort to pack the Court, but if we had, my colleagues across the aisle would absolutely be standing and saying what I am saying tonight--that this is wrong, this is destructive, this is damaging, and we should stop and rethink this.  There is really only one nominee who would be a legitimate nominee for President Trump to make--only one way to heal this massive wound, this massive tear and rip in the heart of our Constitution, this massive failure of this Senate body to do its job. There is only one way to heal that, and that is for President Trump to nominate Merrick Garland and for him to get that committee hearing, for him to get that committee vote, for him to get that deliberation here on the floor. Maybe he would be approved and maybe he wouldn't, because that is what we see every time the Senate has acted. It has not always been to confirm a nominee, but it has acted and deliberated and voted and decided, as the Constitution calls upon it to do. That would be a healing of the wound. It would be a healing of the wound if the Senators were to vote the same way they would have voted last year had there been a completely legitimate, ordinary consideration. Then we could go forward without this damage.  So I call upon my colleagues, who I know have--each and every one of them--considered that it is their responsibility to build up and strengthen our institutions of government, not to tear them down. Therefore, I call upon them to reverse this deed before the dark act is completed of stealing a seat and packing the  I wish to turn to consider another piece of this puzzle. If the seat had not been stolen and we were simply considering President Trump's nominee under ordinary circumstances, what would we find? We would find a far-rightwing judge completely outside of the mainstream.  Why is it that throughout its history, this body has honored the rule of having a supermajority needed to close debate on a Supreme Court Justice? It has been to send a message to the President that you must nominate someone who is in the judicial mainstream, not way out in one direction or another, with bizarre findings that would undermine the integrity of the Court, not a pattern of attempting to twist the law so that we the people lose and we the powerful win time after time after time--no, someone in the middle of the judicial mainstream.  Well, that is certainly where Merrick Garland was, but that is not where Neil Gorsuch is. He is a lifelong conservative activist, rewriting the law to make it something that was never intended to be. A Washington Post analysis of his decisions that have been considered by the Supreme Court found that he would be, by far, the most conservative member of the Court--not where Scalia was, not where Justice Thomas is, not where Justice Alito is; he would be the most conservative member of the Court, to the right of Justices Alito, Thomas, and  Quote:       The magnitude of the gap between Gorsuch and Thomas is      roughly the same as the gap between Justice Sotomayor and      Justice In fact, our results suggest that Gorsuch      and Scalia would be as far apart as Justice Breyer and      Justice  That is the Washington It is a pretty big gap, way to the right.  Let's take a look at some of the cases that lead to this conclusion. There is a case known simply as the frozen trucker case. Alphonse Maddin, the trucker, was fired for refusing to freeze to death. After waiting more than 3 hours with a disabled trailer on the side of the road, he unhooked the trailer and he started up the cab and he went to get warm before he could return to meet the repairman for the truck. Now, why couldn't he just carry the trailer with him? The brakes were frozen. Why was he himself freezing? Because the heater on the truck was broken. He fell asleep for some hours, woke up, and his body was numb. He became concerned about his life, so he unhooked the trailer, went to get warm, and came back to meet the repairman.  The Labor Department determined that under the Surface Transportation Assistance Act, he was wrongly fired because that act is designed to say that if you refuse to operate a truck in a fashion that is unsafe for you, the driver, or unsafe for others, you can't be fired for that. Safety comes first. The whole message of the act: Safety comes first. But in this case, Neil Gorsuch dissented. He wasn't writing the majority opinion. He went out of his way to write the minority opinion.  The Tenth Circuit upheld the fact that he was correctly operating the truck, leaving the trailer behind. You could ask, Was he operating the full truck or part of the truck? The point is that the Tenth Circuit said yes; the firing was wrong. They upheld the Labor Department under the surface transportation act, and said: He did exactly what the act had intended. You have to restore his job. The Tenth Circuit said yes, absolutely. But Judge Gorsuch went out of his way to write a dissent, saying no. It is completely taking words out of context and twisting them. I encourage others to read it for themselves because it is truly a bizarre opinion, an effort to find a way--some way, some path--to find for the company instead of the trucker, who was protected by the laws written and passed in this Chamber and the House and signed by the That is how far out of common sense and theory of the law Neil Gorsuch is.  Let's turn to a case often referred to as the autism case, Thompson R2-J School District v. Luke This case says a great deal because in this case Judge Gorsuch tried to rewrite a law referred to as the IDEA law--Individuals with Disabilities Education Act--to effectively invalidate the law. The law written here was to ensure that individuals with disabilities were provided an education by the school district, not babysitting but an education. Neil Gorsuch rewrote that law to say that babysitting is  Despite years of special education in a public school, Luke wasn't showing any progress at home. His parents enrolled him in a private school that specializes in autistic children, where he made advances--because the school district was only babysitting him. They fought to get the school district to reimburse them. Gorsuch ruled in favor of the school district. The standard he put forward was the standard that babysitting is OK, even though the law was written to do the opposite.  This decision that Gorsuch wrote is so far out of the mainstream, it is so far out of common sense, it is so contrary to the law written here in this Chamber that the Supreme Court--yes, our Supreme Court, our eight-member Supreme Court--proceeded to say, 8 to 0: That is absurd and wrong, Neil And they reversed him.  When have we had a nominee reversed 8 to 0? When have we had cases like the frozen trucker case and the autistic child case, where he went to great lengths to find for the powerful over the individual?  We can turn to the Utah en banc request in a case called Planned Parenthood Association of Utah v. ``En banc'' means that the entire bench hears a case. Neil Gorsuch was such an activist, so committed to undermining an organization--Planned Parenthood--that he took the extreme step of initiating, himself, an en banc review of a decision to block a Utah defunding effort. Governor Herbert of that State had used the cover of false and misleading videos to strip Utah's clinics of their funding. The Governor later made clear in testimony that he was in fact punishing Planned Parenthood for its constitutionally protected advocacy and services and that the organization had not done anything wrong.[[Page S2225]]  The Tenth Circuit granted a preliminary injunction against Utah for violating the organization's--Planned Parenthood's--constitutional rights. The Tenth Circuit decided this, but Neil Gorsuch--ever the activist judge, rewriting law to make it say the opposite of what was intended--sought to have a review by the entire bench. Let me explain, that is not normal. Other people may call for an en banc review because they don't like the outcome, but to have a participating judge on the Tenth Circuit initiate it is unusual. It is a message to the world: Everyone, pay attention to me. I am an activist, far-right judge, and if you like that--someone who is going to find for the powerful and the privileged over ordinary people--pay attention. That is who I am. It is kind of like trying out for a future Supreme Court opening.  Gorsuch's entire adult life has been a mission to revoke a lot of the norms we have come to embrace in our pursuit of the transitions in our society and in our government as we pursue that constitutional vision of equality under the law, protections to vulnerable populations, to workers and to kids and to women and to minorities. But Neil Gorsuch doesn't like that arc of seeking to provide the protections our constitutional vision laid out. As far back as college, he was an ideological warrior who championed a severely reactionary worldview.  In a conservative newspaper article, he characterized efforts to fight racism as ``more a demand for the overthrow of American society than a forum for the peaceable and rational discussion of these people and events.'' That is a very strange way to characterize efforts to fight racism. Racism, discrimination, is to slam the door of opportunity on American citizens because of their gender, because of their race, because of their ethnicity, because of their sexual identity--slam the door and disrupt that opportunity for each and every citizen to be treated equally under the law.  He also used the opportunity to advocate for social inequality, saying that ``men . . . of different abilities and talents to distinguish themselves as they wish, without devaluing their innate human worth as members of society,'' and arguing that a responsible system required a governing class of men of exceptional political ability to make the big decisions for society. Well, there is not much equality and opportunity in that statement.  As a judge, in case after case, he finds expansive rights for corporations at the expense of their employees, consumers, and the public interest. We have talked about the frozen trucker case and the autistic child case. There is also the electrocuted mine construction worker case. A worker started at a project a week after it begun and wasn't trained on how this should be done. It was a training that was really required because of the highly dangerous circumstances. When you are operating equipment near power lines, that is just a setting that everyone in the construction industry knows is extraordinarily dangerous. If you connect that equipment to the power line, perhaps somebody has their hand on the side of the equipment, and the next thing you know, they are electrocuted. The worker mistakenly brought a piece of equipment too close to that overhead power line, and it was the worker himself who was electrocuted and killed. The Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission fined the employer for not properly training the worker under these dangerous circumstances. The Tenth Circuit took a look at it and said: Yes, the company failed to do the proper training, and the result was that someone lost their life. But Judge Gorsuch dissented. He said that there was no evidence the company had been negligent. Really? Failure to train in a highly dangerous situation that results in loss of life--there is no problem there. Why should we require companies to train people in dangerous circumstances? Again, there was a complete lack of common sense, a determination to overturn what a review board had found, what the circuit court had found.  We can turn to the Hobby Lobby case. In this case, Neil Gorsuch found that closely held, for-profit corporations have the right to choose the contraception coverage, or lack thereof, for their employees if doing so conflicted with the corporation's religious beliefs. Now, we didn't actually have corporations--in the sense that we have them now--when our Nation was founded. There were some charters, but not the modern corporation in the sense that we have. Yet Neil Gorsuch said: We will just give this corporation personhood, and we will let the corporation exercise religious beliefs that overrule the religious beliefs of the individuals. But it was the individuals the Constitution was written to defend. It was the individuals' religious beliefs the Constitution and the Bill of Rights were laid out to protect--not a corporation. But in a never-ending quest to find for the corporation, to find for the powerful, to find for the privileged, Neil Gorsuch twisted the law, found that path, and laid it out.  In writing a brief as a lawyer in 2005, Neil Gorsuch urged the court to ignore the statutory and legislative history of the Securities Exchange Act, advocating that the court limit the ability of those defrauded by corporations to band together to seek redress. This really goes to the difference between ``we the people'' and ``we the powerful.''  We have a nominee before us right now who doesn't like the idea of individuals being able to operate with a class action suit against the predatory actions of a powerful corporation. In an article about the case, he launched into an attack on the lawyers for providing the ability for individuals to challenge the very powerful corporation, and he said these are frivolous claims--frivolous claims--that take an enormous toll on the economy. They put a burden on every public corporation in I will quote: ``frivolous claims that impose an enormous toll on the economy, affecting virtually every public corporation in America at one time or another and costing business billions of dollars in settlements every year.'' He didn't like this burden on corporations to respond when they were challenged for predatory practices.  Often, the transactions between a company and an individual are quite small. Maybe they involve a monthly fee to access telecommunications services. Maybe they involve a purchase of a single consumer item that costs $50. But the corporation misrepresented what that item was or didn't disclose that it had dangerous paint on it or some other feature. The only way that ordinary people, ``we the people,'' can challenge the predatory practice of a powerful corporation is to put their cases together in a class action suit so that everybody--the thousands of people who bought that $50 item--can say: You are doing something wrong. You are selling something dangerous and not telling us. You are selling something our children will choke on and not telling us. You are defrauding us in any of a whole series of possibilities. Perhaps it is in stock cases or other financial transactions. Perhaps it is the way mortgages are constructed. But the individual couldn't possibly take on the powerful companies' roomful of top-notch lawyers to reclaim that $50 or that small modest sum, so a class action is the tool through which the people, ``we the people,'' proceed to take on the powerful, and Neil Gorsuch doesn't like that.  He doesn't like workers having the chance to confront corporations on the issues of sexual harassment.  In Pinkerton v. Colorado Department of Transportation, Judge Gorsuch joined an opinion discounting Pinkerton's evidence of discrimination and concluding that Pinkerton's performance--not discrimination--resulted in her termination. Judge Gorsuch dissented from an opinion--by its very nature saying dissent--where the majority found a different path, holding that Pinkerton provided ample evidence that she was regularly outperforming her male colleagues yet was treated less favorably than them. The list goes on and on--removing Federal Government protections in a variety of cases.  But there is a third big problem with the fact that we are here tonight considering this nomination. The first big problem was that the seat was stolen by the Republican majority. That is the first time a theft like that has happened in the history of our Nation in an effort to pack the That is a big deal. The second is that Trump nominated somebody completely outside the judicial mainstream. The third is something that should give every American pause, and that is that at this very moment, investigations are taking place into the conversations, into the meetings between the Trump campaign and the  Now, we know it is very public that the Russians conspired to affect the outcome of our Presidential election. We know the tactics they used. They wrote false news stories. They proceeded to have a building with hundreds--I am told a thousand people in a[[Page S2226]]building--doing social media commentating to try to have people in America see those comments and go: Oh, my goodness, isn't that Democratic nominee terrible? Look at what happened. It was an effort to give, in other words, some sort of validation to the false news stories that they were creating and to spread those false news stories via social media.  We know that Russia used a series of bots--basically, computers--around the world designed to reply automatically on social media and Facebook and to do so in order to make it look like there were more than a thousand--millions of people out there--commenting on how terrible the Democratic nominee was.  So they amplified this message with the goal of causing the algorithms used by companies like Facebook--affecting those algorithms so Facebook would start streaming the false news on their Facebook site. You see that and go: Oh, my goodness, it must be true; it is on That was the core strategy the Russians used.  I am not sharing with you anything that is classified. I am also on the Intelligence All of this is in the public realm, the FBI is investigating not whether all that took place--they continue to look to see what else there is and the details of that--but whether there was coordination or collusion with the Trump campaign in how they did this.  Let's be clear. The investigation is not concluded. We don't know the answer. We don't know if the Trump campaign coordinated with the But let's also be clear about this: Anyone on that campaign who collaborated with the Russians to affect the outcome of the U.elections has committed a treasonous act.  So we have this cloud of this investigation over us right now. We find out in a few weeks if there were treasonous acts that completely delegitimize the election that put Donald Trump in the Oval Will we find that? We don't know. We don't know the answer to that.  What we do know is that we have a risk of being in a situation where a swing vote on the Supreme Court is coming from a team that is being investigated. Let's get to the bottom of that and, therefore, know whether there is an issue of illegitimacy before we complete this conversation about filling this Supreme Court seat.  There is an enormous amount of evidence that the Trump campaign was familiar with the efforts of a foreign power to alter the outcome of the election. The names have come up with the press. Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn, Roger Stone, and other figures in the Trump orbit are under scrutiny for that--several of them. The communications have been articulated where and how, and that cloud is very real.  We had the unusual event a week ago Monday in which the Director of the FBI came here to Capitol Hill to talk to the House and to say that it is not normal to confirm that our investigations are under way but that he thought, under this circumstance, it was appropriate that he do so.  So those are the three big issues that we are facing. It is why every Senator who values this institution, each Senator who has pondered their responsibility under advice and consent and the theft of the Supreme Court seat last year recognizes that the administration is under a big cloud and that cloud has not been resolved in terms of the legitimacy of the election or whether there was collusion with a foreign power.  I said that if there was collusion, it was a traitorous act. Here is why. Attacking the integrity of our elections, as Russia did, is an act of war on the United States of It is attacking the fundamental institutions of our democracy, of our democratic We must never let this happen again. We must work with other democratic republics to make sure that Russia isn't able to do it in other countries, which we know they are attempting to do in other elections. But we should absolutely get to the bottom of it before this Chamber takes a vote on whether to close this debate or before it takes a vote on whether to confirm the  So that is the very broad presentation of the three big reasons we should pull the plug on this nomination or at least put it in deep freeze until such a time as the Russia investigation is completed. And we have already considered Merrick That is what we should do.  I am going to spend considerable time going into more detail about these three issues because in my time in the Senate, there has not been an issue that has had such grave consequences for the integrity of our Nation, the integrity of our Senate, the integrity of the Supreme Court, and, quite frankly, the integrity of the Presidency, as well. It affects all three branches because this crime of stealing a seat couldn't be completed without the direct involvement of the executive branch's nominating Neil So I will go back over each of these in much greater detail.  I was pondering why I feel so strongly about this--apart from the reasons I have already laid out--and it is that for generations to come, this Chamber will be compromised. For generations to come, the Supreme Court will be compromised. If we act together, if we hit the pause button, perhaps we can prevent that.  So I feel more compelled to be here, to raise my voice, and to call for those who care about our Nation to stop the insanity of this judicial nomination discussion here on the floor of the That is why I am going to go on for some time exploring this.  I think back to when I came here in 2009. When I came to the Senate, my memories were of the Senate from the 1970's and 1980's, which now makes me really an old guy. I was able to come here as a 19-year-old, as an intern for Senator At that point in time, there wasn't a camera on the floor of the Senate and there wasn't email, and it wasn't easy to get a document across Capitol Hill in a short time. Interns were put to work running paperwork around the But I will tell you that the institution was in a very different place.  So I came here. I was the third of three interns to arrive that summer of 1976, our bicentennial summer. The most recent intern is put to work opening the mail each morning.  So I came in early. We had about 100 letters in envelopes. You would run them through a machine that sliced the envelopes opened. You would stack up all the letters, start going through them, and say: This one is on this topic, and this goes to this legislative correspondent. This one is on this topic, and it goes to that legislative correspondent. I think there were three or four in the office of Senator You would go through those 100 letters and put them on the desk of the legislative correspondent.  Those correspondents had the newly developed electronic memory typewriters. They had written paragraphs to respond to different topics, and they would mark on the letter the different paragraphs that should go here. This is the introductory paragraph we will use. We need to address this issue in this letter and use paragraph 56 from the memory bank, and we use number 84 to address another issue.  Then, those letters, all marked up, would go to the typing team that would run those memory typewriters, and get responses out before the day was over. I saw a lot of it that summer. It was possible to actually get mail to come directly in because we didn't worry about white powder being inside the envelopes.  Now if you write an actual physical letter to a Senator in this Chamber, it goes through a warehouse. It goes through a warehouse where they have to examine it and check it for poisons before it can be delivered to Capitol It will take weeks. People knowing this often choose to write by email. So a lot of the mail--most of the mail--comes in electronically.  But that summer, one of the legislative assistants was leaving for an extended period for a vacation in South He was looking to have someone take over the Tax Reform Act of 1976. I was asked to take over working on that act. So what that involved was that you would look at all the mail that came in on that tax topic. You would research those issues and you would draft responses. Those draft responses would go up and be approved or modified by the legislative director and by the Then you would make sure those got into the database and people got their questions answered.  I learned a lot about taxes that summer of 1976. I must say, when I was[[Page S2227]]first asked to work on taxes, I was kind of disappointed because I thought: Well, it will be really interesting to work on education; it will be really interesting to work on healthcare; it will be really interesting to work on the environment; it will be really interesting to work on jobs policy. Taxes? Not so interesting.  So the next few days, as I threw myself into responding, drafting responses to these issues being raised in letters, I was transformed in my opinion about working on tax issues because the taxes affect everything in our body of law. Taxes have environmental consequences, or they may be an environmental incentive, such as the provisions we have in the Tax Code to encourage people to insulate their homes or to drive a non-fossil-fuel burning car. They affect health, such as the provisions we have in the Tax Code that proceed to say that if your employer provides health insurance, it is not considered taxable income. It affects job incentives. It affects everything.  There were farmers writing in about tax issues that were being raised. There were teachers writing in. The teachers were concerned that there was a home office deduction that was on the chopping block. What this means is if you used a bedroom in your home or a study in your home as your office to work as an elementary teacher or a high school teacher, you could deduct the cost or the value of that portion of your house as a work expense.  Well, often, when there is an opportunity like that, some people expand the definition of the office to a point in which it is ridiculous, and there were some individuals who were saying: Well, now my entire home is my office. I will deduct the entire cost of my home, which was never the intention.  But teachers were concerned that, in the course of correcting that, that they might lose the deduction that was a legitimate work expense. There are dozens and dozens of these things. So the bill happened to come up on the floor of the Senate, in this Chamber right here. Because I was working that bill, I was assigned to come over and follow the debate. I was up in the seats up above. We considered amendment after amendment after amendment. Now, there was no negotiation between the two sides over what amendment would come up next.  Once one amendment was finished, there would be a group of Senators trying to get the attention of the Presiding Whoever got that attention first, whoever was fastest or loudest and was called on, their amendment was next. They presented it, and the staff hovered around following it and tried to get a copy of it and tried to analyze it. Then we would run down when the vote was called and meet our respective Senators coming out of those elevators that are just through those doors right there--those beautiful double doors of the  I would stand there, and out would come Senator Church, and out would come Senator Goldwater, and out would come Senator Humphrey, and out would come Senator Kennedy and Senator Inouye, and then my Senator could come out. I would say: OK, here is the story. Here is the amendment. Here is what it does. Here is what people have said about it. He would come in here and vote.  That was a very lucky set of circumstances that I had, but it allowed me to sit up in the Chamber and watch this You did not have a cloture petition on anything--a cloture petition meaning a petition to close debate. Now, there was mutual respect. There was a determination of this body to give people a chance to say what they wanted to say, but very rarely did people go on at length, and more rare than that would be a case where a petition was filed to shut down debate.  You know, the principle, the idea that originated with our original Senate, was that there is time for everyone to make their views known to each other so we can benefit from their insights, so that we can benefit from their life experience, and then we can make the decision. So it was a mutual courtesy among Senators at the very start of our democratic I saw that courtesy here on the floor as an intern 41 years ago.  What a difference it is today, where today, for the first time in U.history, the majority filed a petition to shut down debate on the first day of a debate over a U.Supreme Court seat, under circumstances that are more complex and more disturbing than virtually any circumstances we have seen in more than 200 years over the nomination of a Supreme Court justice.  It is the first time in U.history that a nominee in an election year was not accorded any consideration, the first time a seat was stolen, perhaps the first time that a cloud hung over a nominating President--President Trump and his team--because of the way the campaign was conducted and the possible collaboration with Certainly, it one of the first times.  Since the analysts have found that the views of Neil Gorsuch are to the extraordinary far right, that too adds a certain change from the tradition of the supermajority of the President nominating from the judicial mainstream.  So we have these complex sets of circumstances that should be thoroughly vetted. This should be a situation where no Member of this Chamber would even think about filing a petition to close debate and would not even consider the possibility of trying to cut off debate.  Debate has gone on for Supreme Court folks for weeks and weeks and weeks without a petition being filed. Sometimes, that nominee was confirmed and sometimes the nomination was withdrawn, and in the course of it, the American people learned a great deal, and they were riveted to that conversation.  But this time, the majority said that 200 years of history--that 200 years of developed comity here in the Senate Chamber, the traditions that were still here when I was an intern 4 decades ago--we are going to wipe that away. Well, that is a great concern. After I was here for a summer, I was very intrigued by the beauty of what we do on Capitol Hill, the profoundness of what we do on Capitol  We can make a policy that can destroy home ownership for literally millions of families, or we can make a policy that creates the opportunity of fair home ownership for millions of families. That is the power of the discussions that take place on this floor of the Senate, of this Chamber, and the Chamber on the other side of Capitol  So, during that summer, I was wrestling with a question, and that question was: My talents are in math and science. But is there a way to pursue a career dedicated to making the world a better place? Is there a way to actually pursue public policy as a career? I didn't know the answer to that question. I went back to college for 1 trimester out in  At the end of that trimester, President Carter was going to be inaugurated in January of 1977. I thought: You know, it will be very interesting to see what a new President does. Let's see what policies he puts forward, how he builds his Executive team, how he delivers his ideas to Capitol Hill, how he works with Capitol  So in January, I took a Greyhound bus across the I arrived here and proceeded to work on a variety of internships while also waiting tables and washing dishes. I worked as a hotel desk clerk up on 14th Street on Thomas I worked washing dishes and waiting tables for a Lums Restaurant, which is kind of a sit-down hamburger joint.  But it was all so I could be here and see the magic of public policy and the work done that could affect millions of lives here in this Chamber, the work done on the far side of Capitol Hill that would affect millions of families--to the better or to the worse. In the course of that year, I interned for a group called New It was an environmental nonprofit working on the Law of the  There was a question on the outside of our territorial boundaries: Will the nations cooperate so that we don't destroy the resources in the international space of the oceans? How far should our national space extend? How do we write those rules so that our Continental Shelf is clearly under our control? These are the sorts of questions considered. That treaty, the Law of the Sea Treaty, has never made it here to Capitol Every time there is a new Presidency coming in, someone says: Hey, remember that treaty[[Page S2228]]from four decades ago? It might really strengthen U.control of our offshore areas, and maybe we should bring it up for discussion. It still hasn't been discussed here.  But I also went door to door for a group called Virginia Consumer They were working to create attention to consumer protection issues in the State capitol in They would go door to door. They would have a team go door to door. You would proceed to explain the issue that you were working on--the bill you were working on, that the organization was working on--and ask ordinary citizens to sign a petition in support of that bill being considered at the State capitol.  You would ask: Would you like to support the work of this organization so we can keep doing it? If they made a donation, that helped strengthen the organization. This was the model that became the Public Interest Research Group model, or the PIRG model.  Specifically, the issue we were working on as we went door to door was to say: We can save consumers a huge amount of money if we can simply implement peak-load pricing.  Now, what is peak-load pricing? What it means is that you have a meter so that when there is a huge demand for electricity, it charges a higher price. By so doing, it alerts the consumer: Hey, don't use electricity now; use it at another time.  Now, why would that save consumers millions of dollars? Well, here is why. The electric power company wanted to build a nuclear powerplant to meet just the peak load. So they wanted to build a very, very expensive nuclear powerplant, which they would then charge all the utility customers for, and a lot of utilities--it is kind of written in the law--receive an automatic 8-percent return on whatever they invest. So there is an incentive for them to invest more. The more they invest, the bigger their revenue stream is. That revenue stream is paid for by the citizens who buy electricity.  So few could convince the utility, instead of building a nuclear powerplant, to put in meters that would tell people: Hey, don't use your dryer now because it is more expensive, and shift that peak load. Then everybody benefitted. You did not have to have the risk of a nuclear powerplant.  At that point we had a lot of concerns. We had had a lot of difficulties in some of our plants with near meltdowns. The idea that you could have a radioactive cloud or a China syndrome occur somewhere near a metropolitan area was a very scary thing. So you simultaneously greatly improved public safety while saving people a huge amount of money.  So that is what we were petitioning people for door to door. It was my first introduction to a legislative process that was happening outside the national legislative process. I must say, when you go to door to door, you have so many interesting experiences. You never know what is going to happen when you walk through that door and start to explain to people what you are fighting for and they start sharing their stories.  The president of the board of VEPCO, Virginia Electric Power Company--I went to his and his wife's house. I did not know it was their house at the time--a huge, huge house in suburban The wife greeted me. She talked with me about these issues. She said: You know, my husband is president of the board of VEPCO, but, as to the issues you are raising, I never hear them raising those issues, and these are good points you are making. So I want to buy the Virginia Consumer Congress newsletter. It was a $15 donation. That was the biggest donation at the door I ever had while I was working there. There were many, many other conversations.  But the reason I came back to be here for those first 9 months of the Carter administration was to continue to see: How does Capitol Hill work? How do nonprofit advocacy groups work? How does a new administration work? How does the Senate work? The Senate was so near and dear to my heart after the internship with Senator  In the course of that year, I came to believe that there was a path to work on public policy. Specifically, I decided to work on third-world economic development. Part of the reason that I choose that area was that, when I was in high school, I had a chance to be an AFS exchange student in Ghana, West There were only six exchange students sent to Africa outside of apartheid South  Of those six, five went to cities and one went to a modest town with a family of very modest means. I was the student who was sent to that very modest town to the family of modest means. The experience was such that I was surrounded by people barely able to afford to eat or sometimes not able to afford to eat.  My host family was middle class. My host father was a schoolteacher, and my host mother was also a schoolteacher. One was in a public school, and one was in a private school. Because of the connection to the public school, my host father, who, if I recall right, had a sixth grade or ninth grade education--that was enough to be a teacher because they didn't have enough people who were high school graduates or college graduates.  He was afforded a government-built house that had three concrete rooms and screens over the windows to keep out the mosquitoes. There was electricity in the house, an outlet. The family had one appliance, and that appliance was an iron to iron clothes. Every night, my host father would take the clothing that had been washed that day and he would iron the clothing. Nobody else could touch that iron because that was an incredibly valued appliance.  They had one other thing that was considered a real amazing thing for a family to have, and that was a bicycle. They had a bicycle. I wanted to borrow the bicycle to go outside this town and visit some very tiny villages. My host father was so afraid that I was going to break this bicycle, that I wasn't going to be careful, that I was going to go through potholes, that I was going to dent the rim, because it was such a valued commodity to the family.  I decided in college, after my time here in 1976 and 1977, that I would work on economic development overseas because I had seen the families who surrounded my host family often earning just a dollar a day and trying to feed a family of six or seven. The children couldn't go to school because they had to go down to the main street, running through town to try to sell things through the windows. The only way for the family to eat was for every child to be working.  (",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgS2222.txt
525,MERKLEY,proceeding_id,topic-id,7082,"Let's turn to Planned Parenthood Association of Utah v. In August of 2015, Gary Herbert, Utah's Republican Governor, ordered the State to strip $272,000 in Federal funding from the Planned Parenthood Association of Utah in response to a series of highly edited videos that alleged that Planned Parenthood clinics were selling fetal tissue, even though Utah's clinics were not in the video then.  By the way, those videos had been found to be completely doctored, completely inaccurate, completely misleading. But despite the fact that the videos were not authentic and despite the fact that they didn't have any bearing in Utah, Governor Herbert stood by his ruling to carve out and take away funding from Planned So Utah's Planned Parenthood Association filed for a restraining order against the State, saying that the State was not acting justly, so they asked the Court to protect them from unjust action.  In spite of his continued claim that stripping the funding was not to punish the organization for its stance on abortion but in response to the videos--the doctored, inauthentic, discredited videos--the Governor eventually admitted, while responding to Planned Parenthood's motion for a preliminary injunction, that defense of the videos involved different affiliates--not the ones in Utah--that there was not even an accusation that Planned Parenthood in Utah had broken the law--not even an accusation. The organization didn't participate in programs that provided fetal tissue for research, so it was completely disconnected from the operation of Planned Parenthood in that  The background of this is that medical institutions have utilized fetal tissue and there have been charges related to the preparation of that tissue. We could have a whole debate, and we should bring in the medical professionals to understand the details. But in this case, it is irrelevant to have that debate because Planned Parenthood in Utah wasn't part of the fetal tissue research organization. So we don't have to argue over whether fees they have charged for repairing the tissue were fair or unfair because they didn't repair anything. This was all about something else, which was the Governor's decision to launch an attack on Planned Parenthood, punish Planned Parenthood for its constitutionally protected advocacy.  This issue is one which I am sure we will be talking about for years to come. But in the context of the law, a three-judge panel of the Tenth Circuit granted a preliminary injunction on Planned Parenthood, concluding that Utah's Planned Parenthood was operating lawfully and that the Governor's personal opposition to abortion as a motivation for blocking Federal funds and targeting the health organization did violate its constitutional rights.  So when this was decided, neither Planned Parenthood nor the State of Utah sought to have the Tenth Circuit rehear the case en banc, which means all the judges that serve on the Tenth So you had a three-judge panel that made a decision. Neither side of the case--they were like, OK, we are done with this. We are done with this. The practice wasn't even relevant to the association in Utah, not just because the videos were from different States, not just because the videos were doctored and basically illegitimate, but also because they were about a fetal research program that the organization in Utah didn't participate in.  So from every possible direction, both sides said: The judge has ruled, and we understand why. We accept their ruling. But did Judge Gorsuch accept the ruling? He dissented from the court's denial and wanted to grant an en banc review, not at the behest of any litigant, just that Judge Gorsuch didn't like the outcome of the case and wanted to have a full panel in hopes of getting the decision that would defer to Governor Herbert, who wasn't seeking any review because he wanted to strip the organization's funding, even though the organization had done nothing wrong and didn't participate in the program at all. In other words, Judge Gorsuch was willing to ignore court practice and custom and a whole set of facts that showed that the whole decision the Governor made was on the wrong basis--wrong basis on the facts because the videos were doctored, wrong basis on the facts because it wasn't even about the State of Utah, wrong basis on the facts because Planned Parenthood of Utah didn't participate in this research program--wrong on every level.  But Judge Gorsuch wanted to ensure that he could show a case backing Utah's Republican Governor that eliminated funding for Planned That is judicial activism. That is rewriting the law. That is not a judge; that is a legislator. A person who wants to rewrite the law in the frozen trucker case, a person who wants to rewrite the law in the autistic child case, a person who wants to rewrite the law in the Planned Parenthood case should run for office and legislate, not use the courts as your personal strategy for judicial activism; that is, to rewrite the law, the opposite of what the law says.  In the majority's opinion, Judge Mary Briscoe wrote separately to highlight the troubling nature of Gorsuch's dissent. She noted first how ``unusual'' and ``extraordinary''--those are words that she put in--it would be for the Tenth Circuit, on its own motion, to order an en banc review when neither[[Page S2258]]party to a litigation sought such a review. And then she went on, and what did she say about Judge Gorsuch's proposal? She said he ``mischaracterized this litigation and the panel decision at several turns.''  Politics should be in this room, not taking your politics and trying to change the law through judicial activism on the court by turning the law upside down and saying it means X when it clearly states  An unidentified judge--we are not sure who--requested that judges be polled. Again, that would be an unusual situation, apparently, in this context. Another judge in the majority pointed out that none of the parties asked for a hearing within the time permitted, and there was no justification for polling the court on that question at all.  These types of cases give you a sense of how Neil Gorsuch has used his judicial position to rewrite laws. The law says protect the trucker. If the trucker is seeking to pursue safety, he says don't protect the trucker. The law says provide the disabled child with an appropriate education; Neil Gorsuch says no appropriate education is required.  The court says that Planned Parenthood's rights were violated because they were singled out. That is not equality before the law, a very important principle in American jurisprudence. Neither side contested the outcome. It was kind of like, yes, OK, the court got it right. Judge Gorsuch wanted to contest it so he could strip Planned Parenthood of funding on a basis that the Court found to be unconstitutional. That is yet another reason that this hearing, this review of the judge be set aside.  You have these three fundamental reasons. First, for the first time in our history, the seat has been stolen from one Presidency and delivered to another in a strategy to pack the Court, causing tremendous damage to the institution, as well as tremendous damage to this institution, because it involved not exercising our advice and consent responsibility.  By the way, one may wonder, why didn't the majority, rather than stealing the seat, putting it in a time capsule and fast-forwarding it into the next administration in hopes of packing the Court--why didn't they just bring Judge Garland up and vote him down? The Senate has acted to not confirm in roughly a quarter of the nominations that have come forward to us for the Supreme In those election year cases that I put up earlier, the Senate acted in all 15 of the cases that preceded the death of Antonin Scalia, but they didn't confirm in every case; they turned several of them down. They tabled a couple of them. They defeated a motion to proceed in another. But the Senate always acted.  Why didn't the majority honor the responsibility under the law for the Senate to do advice and consent, when there was plenty of time to do so, when the entire tradition of the Senate had been to always do so, when the written responsibility under the Constitution was to do so? So why not just bring up the judge and defeat him?  The answer is in the quotation that I read earlier from my colleague from Utah, who anticipated that if only the President would nominate somebody like Merrick Garland, it would be a great thing, and we would see a quick confirmation. Merrick Garland was that acceptable. He was that down the middle. He was without the kinds of issues that raised concerns. That was Merrick  So the majority said: We can't have a debate on him because the Senate will approve him, because he is that qualified. He will get that bipartisan support.  That is the principle of the filibuster; that is, that you don't close debate unless 60 Members say you close debate. So if 41 say we are not ready for whatever reason, you keep debating. That sends a strong message for Presidents to do what President Obama did. He consulted with the Democrats; he consulted with the Republicans and chose somebody who would be acceptable to both sides. That is the way it is supposed to work. And when a President ignores that and says: I am going to support somebody from the extremes, I am going to nominate somebody from the extremes, that is an invitation for the Senate to say no. The reputation, the legitimacy of the Court matters, so we are not going to approve this judge.  That is probably what is going to happen this week. The majority here in the Senate may say they want to close debate, but will they have a supermajority, a bipartisan majority? A few Senators perhaps, but they will not have those 60 votes.  Obama's judges met the 60-vote standard--both of them that they put forward before the third vacancy--and nobody filed a motion to close debate. There wasn't a vote on a motion to close debate. And why was that? Because everyone knew that they would have 60 votes to close debate. So, still, even out of the context of having had a cloture vote, you have the 60-vote standard there guiding the President and guiding the selection of the nominees.  We should not go back in time to a world in which the copper barons ruled Montana, not back to a time where the railroads and the oil companies called all the shots. We need to recognize that we have come a long way in terms of fulfilling the constitutional vision that our Founders set out--this vision of equality under the law, this vision of the pursuit of justice. But with the recent decisions of the 5-to-4 Court, we have gone backward. We have gone backward by allowing gerrymandering, by allowing voter suppression, by striking down the Voting Rights Act, and, most importantly, we have gone backward by allowing this vast infusion of dark money from the very few to drive election results.  I have been sharing the many reasons this debate should be suspended: One, because the seat was stolen; two, because there is an enormous cloud over the legitimacy of the President, and there are investigations under way, and we need to get to the bottom of it before a life-tenured position is filled by this President; and, three, a judge who repeatedly has engaged in rewriting the law to find for the powerful over the people, even when the law was very clear--even to the point that the entire Supreme Court overturned him on his effort to say doing merely more than nothing is acceptable under a law that says you must provide an appropriate education.  But here is one more thing. Breaking news: A POLITICO report has just come out which says that Judge Gorsuch committed plagiarism in a book and in an academic article. Well, that is news I had not heard, so I will read the article, and we can all learn about it at the same time.  This is a report from POLITICO entitled, ``Gorsuch's writings borrow from other authors.'' It came out at 11:19, which would put it an hour ago. Since I am here and since we are talking about Gorsuch, it is probably appropriate to share this breaking news with you.       Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch copied the structure and      language used by several authors and failed to cite source      material in his book and an academic article, according to      documents provided to       The documents show that several passages from the tenth      chapter of his 2006 book, ``The Future of Assisted Suicide      and Euthanasia,'' read nearly verbatim to a 1984 article in      the Indiana Law In several other instances in that      book and an academic article published in 2000, Gorsuch      borrowed from the ideas, quotes, and structures of scholarly      and legal works without citing them.       The findings come as Republicans are on the brink of      changing Senate rules to confirm Gorsuch over the vehement      objections of The documents could raise questions      about the rigor of Gorsuch's scholarship, which Republicans      have portrayed during the confirmation process as      unimpeachable.       The White House on Tuesday pushed back against any      suggestion of impropriety.  Here is what the White House said:       ``This false attack has been strongly refuted by highly-     regarded academic experts, including those who reviewed,      professionally examined, and edited Judge Gorsuch's scholarly      writings, and even the author of the main piece cited in the      false attack,'' said White House spokesman Steven      ``There is only one explanation for this baseless, last-     second smear of Judge Gorsuch: Those desperate to justify the      unprecedented filibuster of a well-qualified and mainstream      nominee to the Supreme Court.''  That was the comment from the White I must do a little bit of editorializing here. Having a lengthy debate on a judge is not unprecedented at all. What is unprecedented is, for the first time in U.history, the majority leader filed a petition to close debate on the first day of debate. That motion under our rules means, in 2 days, we will have a vote to close debate. That[[Page S2259]]is what is unprecedented and never before done in U.history. Quite frankly, when the White House says ``mainstream nominee,'' the analysis by the Washington Post didn't find him to be a mainstream nominee. You can call him that, but read his opinions; read his judicial activism; find how he rewrote the law so that it means the case comes out the opposite of the way the law is written. See how that happened in the frozen trucker case. See how that happened in the autistic child case. See how that happened in his pursuit of the assault on Planned Parenthood, when everyone agreed there was a fair outcome and no one was appealing the outcome, except Judge  If we are going to talk about a filibuster and we want to think about it in the longer sense, we aren't even allowed to continue talking to keep this from being considered because the majority leader filed a petition to close debate, so we have to have a vote on it. But last year, for 290-plus days, the Republicans completely filibustered Merrick If we are talking about the core heart of the meaning of filibuster--piracy, freebooting piracy to take over the system--that is what they did last year. They wouldn't allow even a committee hearing or a vote also for the first time in U.history. That is piracy. That is a violation of our responsibility. So the White House certainly got some of this completely wrong.  The article goes on--after having cited the White House opinion that this was an unfair attack--saying:       However, six experts on academic integrity contacted      independently by POLITICO differed in their assessment of      what Gorsuch did, ranging from calling it a clear impropriety      to mere sloppiness.       ``Each of the individual incidents constitutes a violation      of academic ethics. I've never seen a college plagiarism code      that this would not be in violation of,'' said Rebecca Moore,      a Syracuse University professor who has written extensively      on the issue.       Elizabeth Berenguer, an associate professor of law at      Campbell Law School, said that under legal or academic      standards Gorsuch's similarities to the Indiana Law Journal      would be investigated ``as a potential violation of our      plagiarism policy. It's similar enough to the original      work.''  She continued:       ``I would apply an academic writing standard,'' said      Berenguer, who teaches plagiarism and legal writing. ``Even      if it were a legal opinion, it would be plagiarism under      either.''       The White House provided statements from more than a half-     dozen scholars who have worked with Gorsuch or helped oversee      the dissertation he wrote at Oxford University that was later      turned into his book. They included John Finnis, professor      emeritus at Oxford; John Keown of Georgetown University, one      of the outside supervisors for Gorsuch's dissertation; and      Robert George of Princeton University, the general editor for      Gorsuch's book publisher.       The experts offered by the White House asserted that the      criteria for citing work in dissertations on legal philosophy      is different than for other types of academia or journalism:      While Gorsuch may have borrowed language or facts from others      without attribution, they said, he did not misappropriate      ideas or arguments.       ``Judge Gorsuch did not attempt to steal other people's      intellectual property or pass off ideas or arguments taken      from other writers as his own,'' said ``In no case      did he seek credit for insights or analysis that had been      purloined. In short, not only is there no fire, there isn't      even smoke.''  The article continues:       The examples at issue make up a small fraction of published      works by Gorsuch, which includes hundreds of legal opinions,      academic articles, news articles and his book. POLITICO did      not conduct a full examination of the federal judge's      writings.       Yet a review of the documents provided to POLITICO shows      Gorsuch parroting other writers' prose and sourcing without      citing them. Instead, Gorsuch often acknowledges the primary      sources cited by those writers.       In the most striking example, Gorsuch, in his book, appears      to duplicate sentences from an Indiana Law Journal article      written by Abigail Lawlis Kuzma without attributing her.      Instead, he uses the same sources that Kuzma used: A 1982      Indiana court ruling that was later sealed, a well-known      pediatrics textbook, ``Rudolph's Pediatrics,'' and a 1983      article in the Bloomington Sunday       At one point, Gorsuch's prose mimics Kuzma's almost word      for word in describing a child born with Down syndrome.       Kuzma stated that--  Some medical terms here that I won't get right--       ``Esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula      indicates that the esophageal passage from the mouth to the      stomach ends in a pouch, with an abnormal connection between      the trachea and the esophagus.''  Did everybody follow that?       Gorsuch wrote that ``Esophageal atresia with      tracheoesophageal fistula means that the esophageal passage      from the mouth to the stomach ends in a pouch, with an      abnormal connection between the trachea and esophagus.''  That is pretty close to word for word.       Gorsuch also used similar language as Kuzma in describing      ``Baby Doe's'' first days.       ``Shortly after Baby Doe was born, a hearing was held at      Bloomington Hospital to determine whether the parents had the      right to refuse the surgery on behalf of their child. An      attorney was present at the hearing to represent the parents,      though no one was present to represent Baby Doe's potentially      adverse interests. Six physicians attended, three of whom had      obstetric privileges and three of whom had pediatric      privileges at Bloomington Hospital,'' Gorsuch wrote.  Kuzma, the predecessor from which it is being argued that he has taken this virtually word for word, wrote:       ``Approximately twenty-six hours after Infant Doe was born,      a hearing was held at Bloomington Hospital to determine      whether the parents had the right to choose a course of      treatment for their child that consisted of allowing the      child to die. An attorney was present at the hearing to      represent the child's parents. No attorney was present to      represent Infant Doe's interests. Six physicians attended the      hearing, three of whom had obstetric privileges and three of      whom had pediatric privileges at Bloomington Hospital.''  I believe that last sentence was virtually word for word copied from what Kuzma wrote.       Kuzma, a one-time aide to former Dick Lugar (R-Ind.),      did not respond to an inquiry from POLITICO, but released a      statement through Gorsuch's team. Kuzma said she does ``not      see an issue here, even though the language is similar.''       ``These passages are factual, not analytical in nature,''      Kuzma, now a deputy attorney general in Indiana, said. ``It      would have been awkward and difficult for Judge Gorsuch to      have used different language.''       But a 1983 Notre Dame Law Review article addressing the      same case did, in fact, use different, plainer language to      describe the issue than Kuzma or Gorsuch did. Author John      Maciejczyk wrote that the ``infant needed surgery to correct      a blocked esophagus.''       In several other examples provided to POLITICO, Gorsuch      follows the fact patterns and sourcing without acknowledging      them.  This article goes on for another several pages. I guess we have the time to share it in its entirety. But let's not lose the fundamental point at the start of the article; that is, the title, ``Gorsuch's writings borrow from other authors,'' and an introductory comment here:       Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch copied the structure and      language used by several authors and failed to cite source      material in his book and an academic article, according to      documents provided to  To continue and to share the full text here, the article continues, providing more details. Tomorrow many people will be going through these because this is information that just came out an hour ago. It makes you wonder, is the reason that we had a first-ever motion to close debate on the first day of debate--the first time in U.history this happened--because there is information that people are aware of, and they want to get this nomination vote concluded before this information becomes public? Is that why we are violating all the constitutional norms here? Well, I hadn't thought of that possibility until this article was put in my hands a few moments ago.  The article continues:       In several other examples provided to POLITICO, Gorsuch      follows the fact patterns in sourcing of other writers      without acknowledging them.       In describing euthanasia activist Derek Humphrey, Gorsuch's      book tracks closely with the 2003 book titled ``A Merciful      End: The Euthanasia Movement in Modern America,'' by Ian            ``In 1989 Humphrey left his second wife, Ann Wickett, soon      after she had undergone surgery for breast cancer. During the      divorce, Wickett alleged that when Humphrey purported to help      her mother commit suicide, the resulting death was not fully      consensual,'' Gorsuch wrote.       Dowbiggin wrote--  In a parallel phrasing that preceded Gorsuch's writing--       ``In 1989 he left his second wife, Ann Wickett, shortly      after she had undergone surgery for breast cancer. Their      subsequent divorce was made messier by Wickett's allegations      that her mother had not died willingly when Humphry had      participated in the suicide of her own parent,'' Dowbiggin      wrote.       Gorsuch did not include an attribution to Dowbiggin in the      passage at issue, though he did cite the author at numerous      other points in the book. Dowbiggin listed his sources as      ``Deadly Compassion: The Death of Ann[[Page S2260]]     Humphry and The Truth About Euthanasia,'' by Rita Marker, and      ``Last Rites: The Struggle Over the Right to Die,'' by Sue      The same titles were cited as sources by       In the same chapter, Gorsuch appears to rely heavily on a      2002 article by Paul Lombardo of the University of Virginia      about sterilization techniques used in that state in the      early 20th century. Lombardo writes that a woman named Carrie      Buck was sterilized after having a child and her mother was      institutionalized.       ``Even worse for her, officials at her mother's asylum      claimed that mother and daughter shared heredity traits in      feeblemindedness and sexual promiscuity,'' Gorsuch wrote.       Wrote Lombardo, ``Officials at Virginia Colony said that      Carrie and her mother shared heredity traits of      `feeblemindedness' and sexual promiscuity.''  There is a bit of an echo there.       Gorsuch did not cite Lombardo despite mimicking his      sentences and presenting them in virtually the same order,      according to an electronic search of Gorsuch's book.       Howard, the Syracuse University professor, said Gorsuch      engaged in a passage known as ``patchwriting''--essentially      patching together words, fact sequences and quotes from      another source, but occasionally changing up the phrases and      tenses.  It is a way to copy someone else's work while making it look like it is your own.       In addition to ``heavy patchwriting,'' Howard said, Gorsuch      ``hides his sources, which gives the appearance of a very      deliberate method. I would certainly call it plagiarism.''       In a 2000 article in the Harvard Journal of Law & Public      Policy titled ``The Right to Assisted Suicide and      Euthanasia,'' Gorsuch's writing aligns closely with a 1985      Duquesne Law Review article about euthanasia in colonial      Gorsuch describes laws in colonial Virginia,      Massachusetts, Rhode Island, South Carolina, North Carolina      and Pennsylvania in the same order and with similar      quotations as the Duquesne article. But Gorsuch never cites      the article in that passage, instead only repeating the same      sources that it relied on.       Oxford's academic guidance for plagiarism states that      ``paraphrasing the work of others by altering a few words and      changing their order, or by closely following the structure      of their argument, is plagiarism if you do not give due      acknowledgement to the author whose work you are using.''       Christopher Sprigman, a New York University law professor      involved in building an online standard for citation in legal      scholarship, said he did not believe examples of Gorsuch's      questionable writing reflected ``mendacious'' acts on the      judge's part. Gorsuch's manner in attributing sources is ``a      choice that you might agree or disagree with,'' Sprigman      said. ``It's a little bit risky, but I wouldn't say it rises      to the level of a bad act. I think some people would say it's      sloppy.''  That is the conclusion of the article--again, information that just came out about 1 hour 20 minutes ago. So I recommend that folks take a look at the article. I am sure many people will be analyzing it tomorrow.  Part of the point of the lengthy debates we often had over the Supreme Court is to have a chance for all the facts to come out. And the fact that tonight--well, that is, Tuesday night; it is now Wednesday morning--Tuesday was the first time ever in our entire 200-plus years as a Senate that a cloture motion on a Supreme Court nominee has been filed on the first day of debate. Maybe that motion should be withdrawn given that there is more information now to analyze as of a few minutes ago than we had before.  The challenge this institution faces is, how do we restore it to a functioning legislative body, and how do we repair the deep divide in America? This question goes far beyond just the issue of the nomination of Neil Gorsuch; this issue goes to fundamental changes in how this Senate operates, fundamental changes in how our society receives its information. While I shared some of that previously, I think it is probably now, many hours later, worth going back through a little bit on this set of challenges the Senate faces.  When I was first here as an intern in 1976--41 years ago--the Senate was here all week long, Monday through It had a normal workweek. The Senate families were here, which meant that people had a more normal family life. During the breaks, they returned to their home States to share what they had worked on, what they were going to work on, what the Senate was working on, and generally hold townhalls and meetings and catch up on everything and then come back here after the break. That structure of families living here meant that there were connections not just between Senators but connections between them and their spouses. There were connections between their children. There were relationships formed over many evenings in which people socialized, and they had activities on weekends.  There were a lot of connections that we don't have now, four decades later, because we fly in and vote on Monday night, and then we vote on Thursday afternoon and fly out. So we don't have the reenforcement of our families being here to provide the kind of fabric in which the legislative discussion occurs, and we don't have the time to get to know each other. That is a challenge.  Plus, we have to spend a lot more time fundraising than folks in the Chamber did four decades ago. When you realize that a single individual, under the deeply mistaken decisions of the Supreme Court, can now put as much money into a campaign attack against you through a third party campaign--that they can write a check for more than the total amount you have raised for your entire campaign, it means that you are going to have to work very hard year after year to prepare for the next battle because the opposition doesn't have to prepare for the next battle. They simply have these massive amounts of funds that they can deploy at a moment's notice: Let's put $5 million in that race. Let's put $10 million in that race.  The result is, for example, in the case of the Koch brothers, that when the Koch brothers used front groups to attack various candidates across America, the candidates wrestled with whether to respond by attacking the Koch brothers, and generally, they decided not to because of the old adage ``Don't pick a fight with someone who buys ink by the barrel.'' But the modern version of that is ``Don't pick a fight with someone who has the most deeply funded super pac that exists in the United States.''  So the Koch brothers carried their fight in 2014 into the Senate race in They carried their battle into the Senate race in They carried their battle into the race in North Carolina and in Colorado and certainly in Iowa and in Alaska and my home State of They were funding front groups to attack me with a third-party campaign. This is what people fear. The Koch brothers can write a $5 million check--they and their associates--and counter all the funds you raised.  In addition to the fact that we are here only 3 days, a portion of those 3 days from Monday night to Thursday night is given over to fundraising. So instead of being able to go to dinner with colleagues, you go to a fundraising dinner. Maybe you slip across the street to do an hour of phone calls. If you are not raising for your own campaign, you are raising for your party's Senate group--the Republican Senate campaign committee or the Democratic Senate campaign committee--or maybe you are raising money directly for your colleagues themselves, helping to make calls for an event that is upcoming.  So you have an incredible shrinking of the Senate week, combined with a huge expansion of the time dedicated to fundraising in order to prepare for the attack that may well come from deeply funded super pacs. That is not a good combination in terms of Senators getting to know each other and getting to respect each other, developing projects together.  I know that it not only damages the time people should be working together, but it also delegitimizes what this group of 100 Senators does. The minority feels almost compelled to fight the battle after having been attacked so viciously by the other side in third-party campaigns. To some degree, this probably goes both directions. So we come here brutalized by the groups who are supporting the other side of the aisle. You are not particularly in a mood to help them out.  This is why I keep coming back to this: It is easy to simply become a pure partisan in this world in which deep-funded interests make up all kinds of attacks and put them on television in an effort to elect someone who will do their bidding, but if we do that, if we don't keep coming back together with the philosophy of problem-solving, then problems will never be solved. We will never have a better healthcare system. We will never have a better public education system. We won't have a better transportation system. We won't[[Page S2261]]have better deployment of infrastructure in rural America if all we do is nurture the wounds of elections. But it also means that we need to change the dynamic that creates those wounds. That is why the Supreme Court seat matters, because the 5-to-4 Court has been doing a lot of wound infliction on our system, making it easier to gerrymander, making it easier for voter suppression, making it easier for dark-money campaigns to corrupt the election process. So we have to attack it on all fronts.  That experience of coming here 41 years ago as an intern and seeing this place operate in a very different way gives me the hope that some way, we could find our way back from the brink. I don't think we have been anywhere as deep in the pit of partisanship--to mix metaphors--as at this moment, with this stolen seat; at this moment, with a cloud over our President and, therefore, a cloud over his nomination; at this moment, with a nomination that disrespected the role of a supermajority, the role being to help encourage Presidents to make nominations from the mainstream, not from the ideological extreme. Here we are, deep, deep into the pit.  If we don't solve the dark-money problem which is very related to the Supreme Court, then we aren't going to come together to solve the other problems because we won't have people who have been elected through a ``we the people'' vision of America, where each citizen has an equal voice, Jefferson's mother principle.  So that is the challenge that we face both on the Supreme Court side of this nomination but also in terms of problem solving.  I think that article that just came out is one that should add to this conversation--this article that says there is now yet another issue, an issue that didn't come out in the Judiciary Committee deliberations.  POLITICO has prepared a side-by-side comparison, which I have on this multicolored chart so citizens can look that up and contribute to that. But it is yet another reason we should probably go a different direction.  Now I am going to turn to Gorsuch's views of expansive Executive power.  Given the need for strong judicial oversight of this administration, under the circumstances, this nominee is particularly ill-suited. He has consistently taken the position that Executive power has very few limits.  As a member of the Bush administration, Judge Gorsuch, according to the New York Times, ``was at the center of both litigation and negotiations with Congress'' regarding ``detainee abuses, military commissions, warrantless surveillance and its broad claims of executive power.''  As a lawyer at the Department of Justice, Judge Gorsuch defended President Bush's enhanced interrogation methods.  In 2005 Congress passed the Detainee Treatment Act, which was meant to ensure greater human rights for detainees held at Guantanamo Judge Gorsuch, working as a Department of Justice lawyer at the time, managed to weaken a provision in the Detainee Treatment Act permitting a civilian appeals court to review decisions by military tribunals.  The original draft let judges scrutinize whether the tribunal had applied the correct standards, but the revised language only let them look to see whether the tribunal had applied standards set by the That is quite a change.  After the legislation was passed, Gorsuch sent an email to a colleague in the White House in which he said he needed cheering up. In the email, he discussed successful efforts to weaken the legislation stating: ``The administration's victory is not well known, but its significance shouldn't be understated.''  After the Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling in June 2006 to find that officials involved in the use of interrogations could be vulnerable to prosecution for war crimes, Judge Gorsuch helped draft a legislative proposal to address the issue, though he left before the eventual bill, the Military Tribunal Commissions Act, was enacted.  It is clear that he played a significant role in the case of Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, which former Solicitor General Walter Dellinger called ``the most important decision on Presidential power ever.'' The case was regarding the legal process being accorded to detainees at Guantanamo His central role was made clear by a request from the Department of Justice Office of Public Affairs that he, along with the Solicitor General and his principal deputy, participate in a background media call on the day the decision was to be announced.  The Department of Justice records show that Gorsuch had been very involved in helping support the inclusion of language in the Detainee Treatment Act and the National Defense Authorization Act and bolstered the position that only the DC Circuit should be able to review complaints about the Bush military commissions.  Gorsuch repeatedly asked several DOJ colleagues in November where we stand on the legislative language and if there is anything we can do to help.  In February, a Republican Senate Judiciary Committee staffer sent Gorsuch a drafted amicus brief on behalf of Senators Kyl and Graham for the administration's jurisdiction stripping arguments, a Congressional Record excerpt supporting the claim. Fortunately, the Supreme Court rejected the jurisdiction stripping Hamdan, but it was clear that Gorsuch was trying his best to enact sweeping Bush claims to unilateral authority and severe limits on judicial review.  Let me go back to the central premise here. As a member of the Bush administration, Judge Gorsuch, according to the New York Times, was at the center of both litigation and negotiations with Congress regarding detainee abuses, military commissions, warrantless surveillance, and broad claims of Executive power.  I think all of us should be more than a little disturbed by getting to the bottom line here, which is that Congress sought to ensure greater human rights for detainees held at Guantanamo Bay and Judge Gorsuch was working as a DOJ lawyer to weaken a provision in that regard and these other pieces that I have referred to.  I will turn now to an analysis of ``The Dissents of Judge Neil Gorsuch: Far to the Right and Out of the Mainstream.''  This analysis by People For the American Way goes through a number of cases, setting out the picture, if you will, of just how far out of the mainstream Neil Gorsuch is. I will just read this by Elliot Mincberg, written last month:       Many, if not most, decisions by the Supreme Court and the      court of appeals are unanimous. Reviewing the cases where an      appellate judge has chosen to disagree with and dissent from      his or her colleagues, therefore, can be particularly      revealing. And that is precisely the case with Judge Neil      Judge Gorsuch's dissents from his colleagues on the      Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals are consistently right-wing,      generally seeking to favor big business and other authority      and harm the interests of workers and those who have suffered      abuse by government officials. And this is on a court which,      until recently, consisted primarily of Republican appointees      like For example:       In Compass Environmental, v. Occupational Safety &      Health Review Commission, Gorsuch dissented from a decision      to affirm a Department of Labor fine against a company that      failed to properly train a worker, resulting in his death by      electrocution. Gorsuch claimed that there was no evidence to      show that industry standards would have required more      training. But as the court majority and the agency found,      there was ``clear evidence'' to support the ruling.  Let me say that again. Gorsuch said there was no evidence. The court majority basically found there was ``clear evidence'' to support the ruling.       In particular, the company's own job hazard analysis found      ``fatal danger'' from the high-voltage power lines involved,      and recommended training for employees.  That was the company's own job hazard announcement. The company itself knew: If you are operating a piece of equipment next to a high-powered voltage line and that metal equipment touches that line, you create the possibility of an electrocution.  That training was given to some employees, but the employee who was killed did not get that training because they didn't give it to him. So the court majority said: Yes, you should have provided the training that you knew was necessary for the operation of this equipment in that setting with a high-voltage power line, but you didn't give it. Therefore, you are in the wrong. But Judge Gorsuch saw it differently.       As a result of that negligence, the danger truly did become      fatal, and the fine against[[Page S2262]]     the company was clearly justified. But Gorsuch disagreed with      his own colleagues--including one who, like Gorsuch, was      appointed by President Bush--and argued that the corporation      should pay nothing.  My father was a mechanic. He worked when he was first out of high school for construction companies on highways in Arizona, and he did a whole host of roles but mostly repairing the equipment of the shop.  In a few years, he became a journeyman, a mechanic. In the course of that work on these big machines, you come to be aware that there are a lot of hazards that need to be addressed. You know some of those hazards for the operators, some of the hazards for working on the machines themselves.  Companies know this as well. They know that if they are hiring a new employee to work in a hazardous setting, they need to train the employee so the employee doesn't get hurt.  The company didn't provide the training. The employee died. The company is fined. And Gorsuch says: No, no, no problem here.  Really? Why did the rest of the court majority find otherwise? Why did the Department of Labor find otherwise?

As far as we could bring the judge on this subject, he said: Well, someone should ask about where the money is coming from. That, I guess, is a pretty bold statement because many Republicans don't believe that it is fair to even ask where the money is coming from.

537,DURBIN,proceeding_id,topic-id,542,"I ask the Senator from Oregon if he will further yield.  Neil Gorsuch, the judge from the Tenth Circuit who has been nominated for the Supreme Court, has had some noteworthy opinions. One was the Hobby Lobby case. It is an interesting parallel between Hobby Lobby and Citizens In Citizens United, the Supreme Court said: We believe that money is speech. And we believe that the protections of the First Amendment extend to corporations who should be treated like persons when it comes to their right of free speech.  In the Hobby Lobby case, Neil Gorsuch, who is headed for the Supreme Court, reached a parallel decision, giving good credibility to the argument that the Republicans know why they are pushing for this man to go to the Court because this was a case where the Hobby Lobby company, which has stores across the United States owned by the Green family--the Green family had their own special personal religious beliefs when it came to family planning and birth control. So they refused to provide for their 13,000 employees across the United States any health insurance plan that provided for methods of birth control, which they found personally offensive. They said that this was a corporate position they were taking--a company position.  So it was Neil Gorsuch, with others on the Tenth Circuit Court, who decided to expand the definition of personhood--again to include closely held corporations like Hobby The net result was that the owners--the Green family--were able to say: We are going to stand up for our religious beliefs when it comes to family planning. And to say to 13,000 employees that those employees' personal beliefs--the religious beliefs of each employee--really made no difference from the viewpoint of Judge Once the owners of the company had decided what was good, principled religious conduct, they could impose that on their employees.  So there is a parallel here where Citizens United said a corporation is a person. Judge Gorsuch and Hobby Lobby said that a closely held corporation is a person. And in the Citizens United case, he said this person--corporation person--has the right of free speech. In the case of Hobby Lobby, Judge Gorsuch said this corporation has the right of freedom of religion to exert their sincerely held religious beliefs.  So I say to the Senator from Oregon: It is clear to me that they tested Judge Gorsuch in the Tenth Circuit, and he came out ahead when it came to the basic principle that corporations should somehow be treated as persons when it comes to rights under the That to me is hard to imagine.  I just can't fathom how they could stretch the meaning of person to include corporations when it doesn't say so expressly in any of the statutes that were referenced here. I haven't seen a lot of corporations pleading guilty and being sent to prison. It doesn't happen much.  So my question to the Senator from Oregon is, when it comes to the clearance of Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court seat--this open seat on the Supreme Court--whether they found the Hobby Lobby decision something that said to them: This man would believe in Citizens United had he been on the Court at the same time.

538,MERKLEY,proceeding_id,topic-id,331,"I say to my colleague from Illinois that we will probably never know the full vetting that took place and the conversations that took place, but your observation that Hobby Lobby involves a parallel with Citizens United is absolutely right. In Citizens United, the Court said: The corporation gets these political rights; that is, the ability to spend money in campaigns, unlimited funds. And in Hobby Lobby, the corporation gets religious rights, if you will--the right to overrule, not just express them through the benefits they provide to their employees, but to trump the religious choices of their employees. It is kind of a super religious power, if you will, choosing the corporation over the people. In both cases, there is this element of choosing the corporation, promoting it, exalting it, over the rights of individuals.  Jefferson made a comment in a letter where he talked about the philosophy of the mother principle. The mother principle said that the only way our government will proceed to fulfill the will of the people is if each citizen has an equal voice--not vote, but voice. ``Vote'' was a big piece of that, but he chose the word ``voice,'' as did President Lincoln on another occasion. The point he was making is that you have to have a place where everyone can weigh in, more or less, in equal fashion.  The opposite of that is Citizens United, where an individual who is a multibillionaire can weigh in massively by buying up the air waves, the radio waves, the television waves, the web advertising, the social media, scrolling and so forth--all of these tools that didn't exist at the time they were formed. So there is this ability for the wealthiest to do a citizen sound equivalent of a stadium sound system that drowns out the voice of the people, just as you have this situation in Hobby Lobby where the religious preference of the corporate entity can trump the religious preferences of the employees.

I had never heard of it before. I looked it up. There was a committee that sounds just like this. It is hard to keep track of them. The largest donor by far in terms of money was Sheldon Adelson, a man out of Las Vegas who has become rather celebrated, if not notorious, for putting millions of dollars into those political efforts on behalf of candidates from the right--some say from the extreme right.  I would also ask the Senator from Oregon if, during the course of his review of Judge Gorsuch's record, he came across the TransAm Trucking case, which was really explored at length in the Senate Judiciary Many of us felt this was such a clear definition of the values of Neil Gorsuch, who tends to rule on the side of big business and corporate elites over and over again.[[Page S2288]]  The case involved a truck driver who was driving near Chicago on Interstate 88 in January a few years ago during a bitterly cold period of time. He had trouble with his trailer. He pulled it off to the side of the road and realized the brakes on the trailer were frozen. So he got on his cell phone and he called his dispatcher, and his dispatcher said: Whatever you do, stay with that truck and trailer. The repairman is on the way.  So he waited a while. No one showed up. He fell asleep. By the time he woke up to a phone call from a member of his family, his legs were numb and he was having trouble breathing. It turned out there was no heater in the cab of the truck. So there he was, facing hypothermia and freezing in his truck. Again, the dispatcher told him: Stay there. Don't leave the truck.  He decided that the idea of dragging this trailer down the interstate was dangerous and the idea of staying in this truck could threaten his own life, so he made what I consider to be a reasonable decision: He unhitched the trailer, took the truck to the gas station, filled it with gas, warmed up, and came back to the trailer. For that conduct, he was fired by TransAm Because he was fired, he was blackballed from ever driving another truck.  This man, whom I happened to meet in my office a few weeks ago, Alphonse Maddin, then did not know which way to turn. He couldn't make a living. He was a hard-working fellow out of  Somebody said: You can go to the Department of Labor, and you can file a complaint for unfair dismissal.  I see the Senator has a photograph of Mr.Maddin there.  He told me he went to the Department of They handed him the form. With a ballpoint pen, he filled it in as to what happened to him, protesting this dismissal and firing. He said he was shocked a few months later to get a letter in the mail that said: You win. You are right. They shouldn't have fired you.  Well, he thought that was a pretty good thing and that he would get some backpay out of it. But then the appeals started, and it went in the Federal court system. By the time it got to the Tenth Circuit, where Judge Neil Gorsuch sat, seven different court judges and administrative judges had considered the case of Alphonse Maddin as to whether it was fair to fire him under these circumstances. Only one judge out of the seven said it was the right thing to do--Neil Gorsuch, the man who aspires to be on the Supreme  One of my colleagues--and I think it was Senator Franken--said to Judge Gorsuch: What would you have done if you were sitting in that truck? What would you have done if you faced freezing to death or dragging a disabled trailer out on a busy interstate, endangering the lives of others?  Judge Gorsuch replied: I never really thought about it.  He never really thought about it. To me, that really gets to the heart of what we are talking about here. He thought about it enough to rule against that truck driver who faced that terrible choice in his life, but he did not think for a moment what a reasonable, ordinary man would do under the circumstances. He reduced the situation to the absurd and decided to rule for the trucking company, for the corporation.  When you consider that this Roberts Supreme Court has ruled on the corporate side, the U.Chamber of Commerce side, 69 percent of the time, it is pretty clear why they have this fond feeling for Neil Gorsuch as the next Supreme Court  Does the Senator from Oregon see the linkage here between what the Republicans are looking for in a Supreme Court nominee and what they would find in this TransAm Trucking decision?

540,MERKLEY,proceeding_id,topic-id,294,"My colleague from Illinois brings up the frozen trucker case, as it has often been referred to, and how it demonstrates an effort to really twist the law away from its original purpose in order to find for the powerful over the individual.  In this particular case, when he wrote his viewpoint, Neil Gorsuch revealed a whole lot because here was a law specifically crafted to protect truckers from being fired if they operated for personal safety or the safety of the public.  Clearly, for him to have driven that trailer down the road, a fully loaded trailer without brakes because the brakes were frozen, would have been incredibly dangerous to all kinds of people. To stay in that cab freezing to death was dangerous to him. You can interpret the concept of operating a truck, and the law said refusing to operate a truck. Well, does refusing to operate a truck mean that you refuse to operate it in exactly the manner that you were told to? Does it mean driving the cab without the trailer or the cab with the trailer?  Gorsuch zeroed in on the fact that, well, he did not refuse to operate because he drove the cab. He was operating. Well, no, he was not operating in any common person's understanding. He left the trailer there. He wasn't driving it down the road. But he searched for that slight little way that he could say: Well, that does not quite fit, and therefore I can find for the corporation.

542,MERKLEY,proceeding_id,topic-id,960,"I thank my colleague from Illinois for coming down to help focus on some of those cases. I appreciate the great knowledge he brings to Senate issues and the deliberations in the Judiciary I am not a member of the Judiciary Committee, so, as I listened to my colleagues commenting on the questions that were being raised and how they were being answered, I saw in the course of those hearings a trajectory in which many colleagues found, as they looked into the heart of these decisions, that there was an absence of heart reflected in the decisions.  The ability to understand the full context of which something happened is so important. When I was a freshman in college, I had a course, a freshman seminar, and that seminar was taught by an esteemed professor of the law school. She would have us read the circumstances of a case, and then say: How would you have ruled on this case? We would write up our little memos, our short little memos, not really based on law because we didn't know the law but on common sense or whatever life experience would have brought to bear.  Then the next week, we would read the Justice's opinions, their decisions on what they had found to be the case--did they sustain the argument for the defense or otherwise, and what arguments did they bring to bear?  I was always struck that William Douglas seemed to have the best grip on being able to place himself into the mindset and the situation of folks who were bringing grievances forward to be addressed. I think a lot of that came from his life experience and the life experience in which he had basically lived in the wilderness part of the time. He had hung out with hobos, and he had ridden the rods underneath the railroad cars to get from one place to another. He had experiences that were not just inside the bubble--the billionaire bubble, the elite bubble, the gated community.  The opposite of that is the situation when I was in New York back in 2008 and I was speaking to someone about campaigning for the The individual said: I don't understand why you are so concerned about healthcare. Everybody has healthcare--everybody. Well, in his world, in his bubble, everybody had healthcare and everybody was wealthy, but that is not the entirety of the world.  So it is so important to have people on the Court who can get inside the experience that others have and that diverse experience. You don't see that reflected in decisions that have been written by Neil  I thank my colleague from  The Guardian wrote an article titled ``The Guardian view of Trump's Russia links: a lot to go at.'' I will share this particular article, but before I do so, let us remember that we are here at this moment with three substantial issues.  One issue is the fact that for the first time in U.history, a Supreme Court seat has been stolen from one President and delivered to another--the first[[Page S2289]]and only time. Sixteen times we have had a vacancy in a Presidential year, and 15 times the Senate has acted to consider the nominee, in some cases rejecting them, in some cases--in most cases confirming them, but always acting until last year.  The second big issue is this Russia investigation, the investigation of the links between the Trump campaign and the Russians, this big cloud hanging over the legitimacy of the It needs to be resolved. That certainly affects whether it is legitimate to be considering at this moment the President's nominee before that cloud is dissipated or resolved because this individual, whoever is confirmed for this seat, will quite likely serve for many decades. When it is a younger nominee, as it is with Neil Gorsuch, that could be five decades. It could be an extensive length of time with decisions that stretch far into the future.  Rather than rush through this in a few days, we should be setting this aside until these issues are resolved to make sure that we have established the legitimacy of the President's role in office and gotten rid of this cloud hanging over him.  The third, of course, is the nominee himself. I so much appreciate my colleague from Illinois proceeding to, through his questions, raise a number of the points about Neil Gorsuch's record. There is the case of the frozen trucker. We did not talk about the case of the autistic child, but that is very similar, where the law--and it is similar in this sense--the law was quite clearly written to promote a particular resolution of a challenge, and that is that every child, despite their disability, would have the opportunity to have an appropriate education. Neil Gorsuch managed to reduce that down to mere improvement over de minimus; that is, basically a tiny little bit of improvement over doing nothing. That was the Neil Gorsuch standard.  That standard went to the Supreme The Supreme Court just recently issued its decision, and it was not a confirmation that it is OK to have just a mere improvement over doing nothing, it was a wholesale rejection, because the law is very clear, and Neil Gorsuch tormented it and twisted it and tortured it to produce a position that you can do nothing and meet the standard of the law that says you have to do quite a bit.  So it was 8 to 0. It was not six out of eight or seven out of eight, but eight out of eight. Every Justice, no matter where they were in the ideological spectrum, said: That is an absurd finding and overthrew the Neil Gorsuch decision.  (",CREC-2017-04-04-pt2-PgS2257-2.txt

I want to give special thanks to the team of individuals who make this body work in order to provide for the opportunity for extended debate, sometimes here under extraordinary circumstances. Because I have been here through the night speaking, one of those extraordinary circumstances was this night that has just passed. The stenographers, the Parliamentarians, the pages, our doorkeepers, our caucus staff, the bill clerks, and others who staff the desks in the offices in the Democratic and Republican cloakrooms--I am excited to see the set of smiles on the pages' faces. I don't know if the same pages were here all night or not. Well, they will hopefully really get a lot out of this opportunity to serve here. But thank you to all the staff members who have labored during the wee hours of the night and into this morning.  I was summing up the issues that we labor under and noting a significant one is the stolen Supreme Court seat and the damage that completing that theft will do to our institutions. I have been going through a number of cases that are related to the far-right, anti-we-the-people vision of Neil Gorsuch, from the frozen trucker case, to the autistic child case, to the worker suffering sexual discrimination or gender discrimination at work--all of these cases that have come forward.  We have the third issue, of course, being that cloud that is hanging over the Presidency because of the investigations underway at this moment into the role the Trump campaign may have played in communicating with or collaborating with the Russians in their extensive strategy to interfere with our Presidential election. So there are a lot of concerns.  This should be the last case where we are cutting short the debate by filing a petition to close debate on the opening day, but there it is--another first, another degradation of the institution.  Dahlia Lithwick wrote in November:       We are already hearing from Republicans and Democrats in      leadership positions that it is incumbent upon Americans to      normalize and legitimize the new Trump presidency. We are      told to give him a chance, to reach across the aisle, and      that we must all work hard, in President Obama's formulation,      to make sure that Trump succeeds. But before you decide to      take Obama's advice, I would implore you to stand firm and      even angry on this one point at least: The current Supreme      Court vacancy is not Trump's to fill. This was President      Obama's vacancy and President Obama's nomination. Please      don't tacitly give up on it because it was stolen by      unprecedented obstruction and contempt. Instead, do to them      what they have done to us. Sometimes, when they go low, we      need to go lower, to protect the thing of great value.  I don't love the way that is phrased, that is for sure. Because in my mind, the point here is to guard our institutions and make them work better. That is the high road. That is not going lower; that is going higher. We must strengthen and defend these institutions that are being torn asunder by this strategy of stealing a Senate seat.  That is an article from the Slate.[[Page S2295]]  The Miami Herald says: ``Supreme Court Nominations Will Never Be the Same.''       The story of the Supreme Court in 2016 can be summarized in      a statistic: It's been 311 days since Justice Antonin Scalia      died on February 13, and his seat remains unfilled. That is      not the longest Supreme Court vacancy in the modern era, but      it's about to enter second place--and it will become the      longest if Donald Trump's nominee isn't confirmed about the      end of       This striking fact will be front and center when the      history of the court in 2016 is written, but what really      matters isn't the length of the vacancy. It's the election in      the middle of it. The Republican Senate changed the rules of      confirmation drastically by refusing even to consider Judge      Merrick Garland's nomination. And against the odds, it paid      off for them.  It is interesting because we talk about the nuclear option of changing the rules, but in a very de facto matter, the nuclear option went off the day the majority leader came to the floor and said that we are going to conduct ourselves in a totally different way than the Senate's ever conducted itself. Unlike every other time in U.history, when there was a vacancy during election year and the Senate acted, we are not going to act. We are going to essentially engage in stonewalling the President's nominee--no hearing, no discussion. That was a nuclear option. So, certainly, I think that is a point well made by this article.       The history of the confirmation process is central to the      history of the court. There have been some important      landmarks in the last century. Louis Brandeis was the first      justice to have a confirmation hearing. Felix Frankfurter was      the first justice who had to testify at his confirmation.       More recently, the confirmation process for Robert Bork in      1987 had epochal consequences. For the first time, judicial      philosophy was a focus.  That was 1987.       No one disputed Bork's intelligence or qualifications.      Instead liberals, including law professors like my colleague      Laurence Tribe, criticized Bork's conservatism, as opposition      to fundamental rights.  Well, there is a whole host of commentary from all across Let's turn to the Pittsburgh Post-``The Senate's shame: Merrick Garland deserved a hearing for Supreme Court.''       Judge Merrick Garland is returning to his work on the Court      of Appeals for the D.Circuit, his nomination for the      Supreme Court killed without a vote by a Republican Senate      majority more concerned with partisan politics than with      doing its job.       The behavior of those who disposed of his nomination stands      in sharp contrast to his own record and reputation as a      nonideological judge.       Judge Garland is a moderate jurist with a reputation for      careful reasoning. Mere days before President Barack Obama      announced Merrick Garland's nomination, Senator Orrin Hatch,      a Republican from Utah, told a conservative news site that if      the President wanted to pick a moderate, he ``could easily      name Merrick Garland, who is a fine man.''       But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had already      announced, in February, that his caucus would block any Obama      nominee. ``This vacancy,'' he said, ``should not be filled by      this lame-duck President.'' So the Senate refused even to      hold hearings.  Let's be clear. We have had 16 vacancies in the course of an election year during our 200-plus years of history, and never before did a majority refuse to exercise their advice and consent responsibility under the Constitution, arguing that it is a lameduck That is not embedded in the It is not embedded in the Senate rules. It is not embedded in history. It is not embedded in any logic. When you elect a President, you elect him for 4 years.  Obama was elected, not by a small margin, not by an electoral victory combined with a citizen majority loss. No, he won the citizen vote massively, as well as winning the electoral college. He won it twice. You can't look for a better endorsement for the role of a President and an affirmation in the face of the determined effort to ensure he did not get a second term.  So that lameduck argument is lame. The argument that the President was a lameduck so, therefore, his Supreme Court nominee should not get a hearing is disingenuous and irresponsible. Mr.Obama had a year left in his term, and Presidents have their full constitutional authority until noon on inauguration day. They must perform all of their duties until then.  Granted, a President must nominate justices the Senate can reasonably be asked to confirm. You can't ask a Senate dominated by the other party to confirm someone whose judicial philosophy could appeal only to someone who shares the President's politics. He must, when facing such a Senate, choose someone in the middle. Mr.Obama did that. He did his job. He picked the very judge Senator Hatch said would be a moderate choice.  The Senate did not do its job. Its refusal to confirm Judge Garland was not based on any flaw in the nominee's character, any deficit in his abilities, or even any disagreement with his jurisprudence. It was pure partisan politics. Senate Republicans wanted to let a Republican President fill the vacancy, and they are going to get their way. But this refusal of the Senate to do its duty cost a good man a fair hearing, and, more importantly, it cost the Nation a potentially fine justice, one more faithful to the law than one of the political parties or particular judicial ideology.  As a result of this abdication of responsibility, it will be harder to get Justices like that in the future. Indeed, the Senate has established a terrible precedent that makes it less likely that any President will be get a Senate controlled by the other party to confirm his or her Supreme Court nominees, however wise and well-qualified.  This was a study of Washington politics at its worst--political and constitutional malpractice--and it will have a lasting consequence.  Well, there is still time to change course and not have this legacy, as characterized by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, of ``political and constitutional malpractice with lasting consequences''. So one question we have not talked about too much in this debate through the night is how voters view this GOP maneuvering to push through Trump's ultraconservative Supreme Court nominee. This is a national survey of likely voters by Greenberg Quinlan Rosner It notes the following:       In the wake of President Donald Trump's nomination of Neil      Gorsuch to the U.Supreme Court, a new national poll shows      that voters believe that the nomination has real consequences      for the direction of the country. Voters strongly oppose      efforts by the Republicans to change the rules in order to      push through Trump's ultraconservative nominee.  Americans see this as a fight that matters to them. When presented with potential consequences and rulings that could result from Gorsuch's confirmation, including overturning Roe v. Wade and leaving the flow of special interest money in politics unchecked, large majorities of voters say they are more likely to oppose the nominee.  Key findings from the poll conducted January 27 through 31 on behalf of NARAL Pro Choice America Foundation, Every Voice, and End Citizens United, include:       Voters overwhelmingly believe that Trump's nomination will      have a real impact on the country's future. Fully 72 percent      of voters think the nomination will have a big difference in      the direction of the country. Voters across the political      spectrum agree on the importance of this nomination, with 76      percent of Democrats saying it will make a big difference,      along with 75 percent of Republicans and 64 percent of       So, in short, basically roughly three out of four Americans recognize that it is a very big deal because out of this discussion could come a confirmed nominee, a ninth vote on the Supreme Court, and that 5-to-4 votes of the Supreme Court steer the country in very different directions, depending on how that 5-to-4 voting occurs.  If you are adding to the Supreme Court spectrum of conservatives who have this view of Merrick Garland and antipathy toward the ability of citizens to pursue justice through class action lawsuits, and an effort to always kind of torture the law in order to find for corporations over the individuals, and a love of arbitration agreements, and even inventing them as we heard last night--inventing an arbitration agreement where none exists--in order to prevent an issue from going forward in the courts--all of that is a real handicap for Americans in the future. So Americans understand this is a big deal.       Americans strongly object to any GOP attempts to use      political tactics to strong-arm Trump's nominee through the      confirmation process. After hearing balanced messaging, seven      in 10 (69 percent) oppose Republicans changing the rules to      prevent a filibuster and allow the Senate to confirm a      nominee with just a simple majority instead of the required      60 votes, with 54 percent strongly opposing this proposal. In      fact, even 4-out-of-10 Trump voters (39 percent) oppose      Republicans trying to change the filibuster rules.[[Page S2296]]       Highlighting potential actions and rulings that could      result from confirming Trump's Supreme Court nominee makes      voters much more likely to oppose him. Large majorities of      voters say they are more likely to oppose Trump's nominee      when they hear a diverse set of issues that could be impacted      by a nominee like Actions that create strong      opposition include:       Upholding the Citizens United decision to allow      corporations, unions, and wealthy donors to spend more money      on elections.       Overturning the Roe v. Wade decision that made abortion      legal.       Eliminating or weakening environmental regulations that      protect air, water, and land from pollution.       Refusing to uphold or eliminating rights and protections      for LGBT individuals.       Failing to protect voting rights and making it more      difficult for Americans, particularly the poor and people of      color, to vote.       Weakening the ability of labor unions to organize workers      to negotiate for better wages and working conditions.       Voters strongly support legal abortion and oppose a Trump      nominee they believe could put that right at risk. Seven out      of 10 voters (69 percent) support a woman's right to choose,      and they recognize that Trump's Supreme Court nominee      jeopardizes the Roe v. Wade decision that made abortion      legal. More than half of voters (52 percent) think it is very      or somewhat likely that Roe v. Wade will be overturned if      Trump's nominee is confirmed. This possibility raises strong      opposition for voters, with 61 percent who say they are more      likely to oppose a nominee who wants to overturn Roe v.       Voters have strong negative reactions to a Supreme Court      nominee who will continue to allow corporations and special      interests to use money to gain influence and drown out the      voice of individuals in politics. Opposition to a nominee who      wants no spending limits for corporations and wealthy      individuals in elections is broad and deep. Overall, 78      percent are more likely to oppose a nominee (56 percent much      more likely to oppose), including 92 percent of Democrats, 84      percent of Independents, and 59 percent of Three      quarters of voters express a desire for their Senators to      oppose a Supreme Court nominee who was ruled in favor of      allowing campaign contributors to spend more money in      politics.       Voters recognize this Supreme Court nomination is crucial      to the direction of the country and they strongly oppose any      efforts by Republicans to skirt the rules to push through      Trump's ultraconservative nominee.  So the date of that Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research poll was February 1. I think it really highlights that voters understand that what we are doing now--this process of considering the potential confirmation of a nominee--has huge consequences for this country and has a huge impact on a whole variety of issues--environmental issues, labor issues, discrimination issues, consumer issues, commerce issues, a whole host of a range of things that the Supreme Court regularly considers. So there is a lot of concern at this point.  Here is another issue, and that is the potential impact on LGBT rights. This is an article by Rebecca Buckwalter-Poza entitled: ``Judge Gorsuch Threatens the Dignity of LGBT People.''       Judges with Supreme Court aspirations tend to guard their      views, avoiding stances and statements that could impede a      nomination or a confirmation. Judge Neil Gorsuch has done      just that, leading observers to look to his influences rather      than his issuances. Among them is Justice Anthony Kennedy,      for whom he clerked. While Judge Gorsuch and Justice Kennedy      may share a bond, they part ways on several issues. One      lesser known but critically important point of potential      disagreement surrounds a somewhat nebulous legal principle      critical to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender, or LGBT,      rights: the dignity of free persons.       For decades, the Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed that      individuals' due process right to liberty also protects their      dignity--and shields them from indignity. The concept of      dignity encompasses an individual's innate value as people      and their right to live free of interference; their right to      make important personal decisions; and their entitlement to      social recognition or protection from discrimination. This      notion of human dignity is at the heart of the Court's three      landmark LGBT rights cases: Lawrence v. Texas, United States      v. Windsor, and Obergefell v.       Judge Gorsuch's writing--both on the bench and in his book      against ``assisted suicide,'' based on his Oxford      dissertation--suggests he is, at a minimum, skeptical of the      principle from which the right to dignity derives:      substantive due process. To be clear, substantive due      process, which protects individuals from having their      fundamental rights violated without justification, has      been part of Supreme Court jurisprudence for more than 100      years.       In one case, Judge Gorsuch made a point of incorporating      criticisms of substantive due process. He noted that ``some''      believe if such a concept existed, it would reside elsewhere      in the ``Others,'' he offered, question whether      substantive due process ``should find a home anywhere in the      Constitution.'' This critical aside, while mild, is unusual.      Judge Gorsuch hews to precedent on substantive due process      only grudgingly, after conceding that ``the Supreme Court      clearly tells us'' that substantive due process does have a      home in the       In his book, Judge Gorsuch went so far as to criticize the      Supreme Court for adhering to substantive due process      precedent in ``case after case.'' He also proposed an      alternative relevance for dignity, based in equal protection,      that could restrict rather than protect individual rights.      The recognition of innate human dignity is the foundation for      equality, Judge Gorsuch claimed, and equality makes      ``assisted suicide''--termed ``death with dignity'' in those      states that permit it--unacceptable because all people      created equal enjoy an inalienable right to life. This view      is troubling, not only in signaling an intent to      misappropriate the concept of dignity to restrict individual      choice, but also because of the implications for reproductive      access, rights, and justice.  This article continues:       Senators must press Judge Gorsuch to commit to upholding      Supreme Court precedent based on the recognition of dignity--     or admit he would not respect this long-established, critical      principle.  This goes on in a somewhat scholarly fashion.  (",CREC-2017-04-04-pt2-PgS2257-2.txt
545,GRASSLEY,proceeding_id,topic-id,1623,"Mr.President, we are continuing to debate the nomination of Judge Gorsuch to serve as Associate Justice of the Supreme My colleagues on both sides of the aisle have said that this is an important moment for the I couldn't agree more.  I think it is important to reflect on why we are here and how we got here. Before I turn to the Supreme Court and the current debate, let me take just a few minutes to talk about lower court nominees and provide a little bit of history and context, especially for the benefit of some of the Senators who weren't here over the last few years.  I am going to start way back in the spring of 2001. President George Bush had just been elected As we all know, it was a close election, and it was hard fought. The Senate was closely divided, with the Republicans in control. Given how close the Presidential election was, there were elements of the hard left who refused to accept the results of that election. Some blamed Ralph Nader, others blamed Governor Jeb Bush, and still others blamed the Supreme Many on the hard left claimed that President George Bush wasn't a ``legitimate'' Liberal interest groups were egging on the Democratic leadership to fight the new President at every turn.  That still sounds very familiar for this year we are in.  At the same time, one major concern for the hard-left liberal interest groups was that President Bush, who they claimed wasn't legitimate, would be able to nominate conservative judges. Again, doesn't that sound familiar?  Senator Cornyn went over some of this same subject yesterday, but it deserves discussion now, and it serves as a reminder of where we have been before because sometimes the past predicts the future.  So in the spring of 2001, the hard-left interest groups went to the Senate Democratic leadership with a plan. According to the New York Times, ``42 of the Senate's 50 Democrats attended a private retreat . . . where a principal topic was forging a unified party strategy to combat the White House on judicial nominees.'' Thinking about 2017, doesn't that sound a little familiar?  At that meeting--Cass Sunstein, Marcia Greenberger, and Laurence Tribe spoke at the retreat and pitched to the Democrats who were present their idea of how this crusade could proceed.  According to one attendee, ``They said it was important for the Senate to change the ground rules, and there was no obligation to confirm someone just because they are scholarly and erudite.''  Well, let's think about that for a moment. Why do you suppose they believed they needed to ``change the ground rules'' for confirming judges? It is because up to that point you didn't filibuster judges. You just didn't. You heard the majority leader speak to that point in his short remarks this morning about how things have changed after more than 200 years.  Well, as it happened, less than a month after the caucus retreat, Senator Jeffords from Vermont switched parties and began caucusing with the That threw the majority to the Democrats for the next 18 months. Then they lost the election of 2002, and in the spring of 2003, Republicans were back in the majority.  Now back in the minority, Senate Democrats went ahead with the plans that were enunciated at that retreat to ``change the ground rules.'' For the first time in the history of the Senate, they began to systematically filibuster circuit court nominees--not because they believed the nominees weren't qualified. The nominees were qualified. And it was not because they believed the nominees didn't have the necessary experience. The nominees did have the necessary experience. They filibustered those nominees because they believed they were conservative judges.  So with respect to appellate court nominees, Senate Democrats, at the behest of the far left, took the unprecedented step of using the filibuster in a very systematic way for the first time in Senate history. At the time, there was a lot of debate about changing the rules, dubbed the so-called nuclear option, so that nominees would be afforded an up-or-down vote, consistent with the Senate's history and practice.  Well, Republicans exercised restraint and agreed to step back. Then President Obama became Our side didn't like the use of a filibuster for judges, but we also didn't think there should be two sets of rules--one for a Republican President and one for a Democratic Common sense tells you that is a legitimate position to take.  We defeated two circuit court nominees, one to the Ninth Circuit and one to the DC Then President Obama nominated three individuals to the DC Our side denied cloture on those three nominees to the DC  Well, at that point, their side didn't like playing by the rules they wrote, so then-Majority Leader Reid took another unprecedented step. In November of 2013, he utilized the so-called nuclear option to eliminate the very tactic they pioneered. The nuclear option becomes effectively the regroup.  So that is how the filibuster was first used on lower court nominees and later eliminated. Senate Democrats took the unprecedented step to utilize that. Then when it no longer benefited them, they used unprecedented means to eliminate it.  This brings me back to where we are today and the rest of this week--talking about a Supreme Court nominee, Judge  Everyone knows we had a big debate last year about whether to proceed with the Garland nomination. There were 52 Republicans who believed we should follow Senate history and tradition and not proceed with the nomination in the middle of a heated election year.  I know it frustrates my colleagues to hear me say it, but fact is that in 1992, when then-Senator Biden was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he announced that he wouldn't hold a hearing to fill a vacancy in the last year of President Bush's term. So last year, we followed the precedent that then-Senator Biden described in 1992 for all of the same reasons he discussed.  You get back to this commonsense principle: Can you have one rule for Republican Presidents and another rule for Democratic Presidents? We didn't feel you could. And, of course, everyone in this Chamber knows that if the shoe were on the other foot, the Democrats would have done the same thing, because they said they would. In fact, President Obama's former White House Counsel admitted as much. She said she would have recommended the same course of action if the tables were turned.  So now here we are, April 2017, with the nominee before us. Just as in 2001, we have just had a very contentious Presidential election. It was close. It was hard fought, and frankly, some on[[Page S2305]]the hard left refused to accept the results of the election. Once again, leftwing groups are egging on the minority leader to take another unprecedented step with respect to judicial nominations. Only this time they want him to lead the very first partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nomination in U.history. Based on the vote we had yesterday, it appears 44 Democrats are prepared to follow the minority leader on this fool's errand. No Supreme Court nomination in our country's entire history has ever failed because of a partisan filibuster. There is no getting around that fact.  Abe Fortas, whom I have referred to, was subjected to a bipartisan filibuster over ethical concerns when President Johnson tried to elevate him to be Chief  Justice Thomas was confirmed by a vote of 52 to 48. I was here for that nomination. A single Senator--any Senator--could have demanded a cloture vote, but out of 100 Senators, none did. Why? For the simple, commonsense fact and 200 years of history that you don't filibuster a Supreme Court nomination.  But today is entirely different. The minority is committed to filibustering this fine nominee in the first partisan filibuster in U.history.  So here we are. The President has nominated an exceptionally qualified judge to take Justice Scalia's seat on the Supreme The Democrats will break new ground again by conducting a partisan filibuster of the nominee. Republicans aren't the ones breaking new ground here. As a matter of fact, the Democrats' own Vice Presidential nominee last year emphatically promised that the Democrats would further change the rules to make sure an expected-President Clinton's nominees couldn't be filibustered.  So at the end of the day, the fact is that if Democrats insist on a filibuster, the Republicans will insist on following the practice that Senators have followed for more than 200 years, and that is not to have a partisan filibuster for somebody going to the Supreme We don't conduct partisan filibusters of Supreme Court nominees, and we certainly are not going to start with this highly qualified nominee.  I hope those that think back 16 or 17 years--when this meeting of Democrats in retreat came to the conclusion that you had to break new ground--realize that they have poisoned the well of the comity traditional of the I think maybe a lot of them realize that was a mistake, as we realized that was a mistake, and it would be nice to get back to the comity of the Senate that existed on judges prior to 15 or 16 years ago. But that is going to take people on their side who were present at that same retreat who are still in the U.Senate to drill a new well, because the present one is poisoned, and we need to get back to the comity that we have had.

That is a decision Members are going to have to make.  America needs judges who can follow the law, apply the law, have the highest ethical standards, and value the independence of our courts. To me, that is a description of Judge That is him in a nutshell. We saw it throughout his career, and we saw it again at his confirmation hearings in the Judiciary  Democrats on the committee asked him to answer hypothetical questions. They asked about issues that are probably going to be coming before the Supreme Court of the land. There are ethics rules that say that judges and nominees cannot answer those kinds of questions and, of course, Judge Gorsuch followed the rules. That is exactly what other nominees have done in the past who were nominated by Republican Presidents and Democratic  Ruth Bader Ginsburg did so in her confirmation hearing in 1993. She said: ``A judge sworn to decide impartially can offer no forecasts, no hints.'' She said this would display disdain for the entire judicial process. Of course, she was confirmed and sits on the Court today. It has been known as the Ginsburg standard, and every nominee since her nomination hearing has followed that same standard. That is what Justice Gorsuch did.  The Democrats on the Judiciary Committee tried to criticize Judge Gorsuch for some of his opinions that they didn't like. They talked about a couple of cases where the person who was on the losing side in the case was sympathetic. They suggested that the Court should have ignored the law and sided with ``the little guy'' in the involved cases. Judge Gorsuch pointed out that judges are absolutely not supposed to consider what they think is sympathetic. They are supposed to rule on the law. Federal judges actually swear an oath ``to administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich.''  Most Senators recognize that judges should be impartial. The minority leader, Senator Schumer, has actually spoken about how important this is. At the confirmation hearing for Justice Sonia Sotomayor in 2009, nominated by President Obama, Senator Schumer praised the way she put the ``rule of law above everything else.'' He said that she followed the texts of statutes, ``even when doing so results in rulings that go against so-called sympathetic litigants.'' That was in 2009. Now it is 2017, and that is the identical standard Judge Gorsuch has continued to follow.  Judge Gorsuch pointed out that it is his job to apply the law, not to write the law. Writing laws is the job of We are not here to select the 101st Senator; we are here to select a Justice for the Supreme We are selecting a Justice for the most important Court in the land, and it is important and imperative that we take this decision seriously and that we set aside any partisan grudges.  Democrats who want to filibuster this judge are not arguing any principle here. Reasonable individuals know this nominee deserves to be confirmed.  One lawyer wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post on March 8, a board member of the very liberal American Constitution He wrote that ``there is no principled reason'' to vote against Judge Well, he is exactly right.  I listened to the arguments Democrats made in the confirmation hearing. I was not convinced. If any of my colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle are undecided about how to vote, I suggest they go back and look and listen to the hearings as well and look at what other people have said about this nominee.  A Chicago Tribune editorial said that confirmation hearing revealed ``unassailable assurances by Gorsuch that he would decide each case on the merits, based on the law as written, applied to the world as it is today.''  The Detroit news agreed. It said that Judge Gorsuch showed that he is a ``deeply knowledgeable nominee who should be confirmed by the Senate.''  On Monday, USA TODAY had their own headline. It said, ``On the Merits, Gorsuch Merits Confirmation.''  The American Bar Association surveyed 5,000 people who have worked with Judge Gorsuch over the years. These people described him using words like ``brilliant,'' ``thoughtful,'' and ``really, really, really smart.''  The Bar Association also found that ``Judge Gorsuch believes strongly in the independence'' of the judiciary. This is the Bar The American Bar Association predicted that ``he will be a strong but respectful voice in protecting it.'' The group ended up giving him its highest possible rating. Interestingly, Senator Schumer once called this group ``the gold standard'' for evaluating judges--``the gold standard,'' he called it--and they have given him their highest possible rating. So why does the minority[[Page S2306]]leader think the gold standard is not good enough anymore?  Judge Gorsuch was even introduced at his confirmation hearing by a former top lawyer for the Obama administration. Neal Katyal is a He served as Solicitor General of the United States under President He called Gorsuch ``one of the most thoughtful and brilliant judges to have served our nation over the last century.'' Let me repeat. This is someone who served as Solicitor General of the United States under President Obama calling Judge Gorsuch ``one of the most thoughtful and brilliant judges to have served our nation over the last century.'' He even wrote an op-ed in the New York Times that predicted that Judge Gorsuch would ``help to restore confidence in the rule of law.'' Help to restore confidence. Isn't that what we want as a nation--confidence in the rule of law?  I think that any Democrat who has looked at this nominee's record will find it is an easy decision to confirm him. If there is a Democrat who reaches the opposite conclusion, I say come to the floor of the Senate and explain why you think our judges should go into a case favoring one side over another because one side is more sympathetic than the other. If there is a Member who thinks that a judge should make promises about how they will rule just to win a confirmation vote of a given Senator, I say come to the floor and make your case. If there is a Member who thinks a Justice on the Supreme Court should rule based on that Justice's own preferences and not based on the law, I would say please come to the floor of the Senate and say so.  I don't think that is what the American people want. The American people do want Justices who are smart. They want Justices who are principled, who are fair, and who know that their job is to follow the law, not to write the law and not to legislate from the bench. The American people know that Neil Gorsuch is exactly that kind of judge. He is the kind of judge we should have on the Supreme Court, we need on the Supreme Court, and we need on every court in the land. That is why I am committed to vote to confirm Neil Gorsuch to serve on the U.Supreme  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

I offered that recommendation before I had an opportunity to sit down one-on-one with Judge Gorsuch, although, in fairness, we had an opportunity in the Senate to review Judge Gorsuch and his credentials in 2006 when this body voted to confirm him by voice vote to the U.Court of Appeals where he now sits. After spending time with this exceptionally talented jurist and after reviewing his performance before the Senate Judiciary Committee, my level of respect for him has only grown.  Judge Gorsuch checks the box on every measure of what I am looking for in a Supreme Court nominee. Intellectual capacity, experience, independence, integrity--he has all of these. There is no question that he has the intellectual capacity to meet the challenge.

He went on to earn a doctorate in legal philosophy at I think this is one of the many illustrations of Judge Gorsuch's tremendous depth. And whatever else my colleagues will have to say about Judge Gorsuch in this contentious confirmation debate, there is no question that he is an intellectual heavyweight.  I next look to those who mentored Judge Gorsuch along the way, and one really cannot have better mentors than the late Justice Byron White and sitting Justice Anthony Justice Kennedy, we all know, has carved a niche for himself as the swing vote on the Supreme There is a great deal of debate about whether a Justice Gorsuch will be more of a Scalia than a Kennedy or a White or whether, instead, he will be a I suspect that he will be a Gorsuch, and that is fine by me.  What really matters is that Judge Gorsuch will come to the Supreme Court with a strong understanding of its dynamics, and there is no question that he will be effective from day one. There is no question that he will be his own man. I want to emphasize that point.  Judge Gorsuch made it very clear to me when we met that he has made no commitments to the President or his team. And he made it clear at the hearings that if any commitment were sought, he would have gotten up and walked out. After spending time with Judge Gorsuch, I believe him. I believe him on that. His commitment to an independent judiciary is resolute, and I think on this issue he will not bend to political expedience, as he should not.  He is not the President's man, not the party's man, nor will he represent an ideological movement on the Judge Gorsuch will be his own man, following the law where it leads. That is what we should want in a Supreme Court Judge Gorsuch's unshakable integrity explains why he has earned the unanimous ``well qualified'' rating from the American Bar  I am also enthusiastic about Judge Gorsuch because he brings a western perspective to a Court that is desperately in need of diversity. Mr.President, you would surely agree with that--that making sure we have those who are knowledgeable based on their experience, of what is like to live in the West is important. Six of the eight sitting Supreme Court Justices have spent their entire professional careers in the Boston-Washington corridor--six of the eight. The only sitting Justice who came to the Supreme Court from someplace other than the Boston-Washington corridor is Anthony Kennedy, who was elevated from the Ninth Judge Gorsuch has, of course, done the ``Washington thing,'' but his home is in the West, and he served for a decade on the Tenth Circuit in I think that makes a real difference, at least in my book.  Appellate judges in the East rarely hear cases involving Federal Indian law and Native American issues. Among the hundreds of cases that Judge Gorsuch has heard, dozens involve Indians and Indian law. In deciding those cases, he has demonstrated great sensitivity to the unique role of Indian Nations under our  I think that explains why Judge Gorsuch has been enthusiastically endorsed by the National Congress of American Indians as well as the Native American Rights NCAI is the umbrella organization for the Nation's federally recognized NARF is an independent, highly respected public interest law firm which advocates for Native Americans nationally. Neither of these organizations--neither NCAI nor NARF--could ever be characterized as right-leaning. Yet they have endorsed Judge Gorsuch after reviewing his track record on cases involving Native rights. I think it is also important to recognize that the Central Council of the Tlingit and Haida Tribes of Alaska has also endorsed the Gorsuch nomination, which is important for Alaska  Another example: The Federal government controls vast amounts of land in the West and, of course, that includes our home State of Public lands cases tend to originate in the West, not in the It is tremendously important that somebody on the Supreme Court have a familiarity with these issues, and Judge Gorsuch clearly does.  Along with the pervasive Federal presence in the West comes a huge Federal regulatory influence. Mr.President, you and I know that Alaskans[[Page S2307]]talk about the extent of Federal overreach in our State like other people talk about the weather. Alaskans will be interested to know, perhaps excited to know, that one of Judge Gorsuch's top intellectual interests is regulatory overreach. He has publicly questioned the proposition that Federal courts must defer to agency interpretation of the law when regulations are challenged. That is a very good thing because when a homeowner has to go to court to litigate the question of whether the pond in the back of his house is regulated wetland, the last thing that the homeowner wants to hear is that the scales of justice are somehow tipped in favor of the agency on accord of a principle known as Chevron deference.  I understand--and we all know--that there are some interest groups that suggest that Judge Gorsuch's views on Chevron deference means that somehow or another he stands for big business and against the little guy. To those organizations, allow me to introduce you to an Alaskan named John  Mr.President, you and I know him well. Mr.Sturgeon was prohibited from taking his hovercraft, his boat, up a river in northern Alaska adjacent to National Park Service land. Mr.Sturgeon had to go all the way up to the Supreme Court to vindicate that right, and, against many odds, he won.  I think it is clear that Federal agencies can and do trample on the rights of the little guy. I will tell you, I find Judge Gorsuch's views on the question of deference highly refreshing at this point in time.  I should point out that I don't agree with all of the opinions written by Judge Gorsuch, but I don't expect that from a nominee. That is almost an impossible standard. In fact, Judge Gorsuch himself has acknowledged that. I do expect that the nominee be always true to the law, as Judge Gorsuch has demonstrated throughout his career.  Finally, from everything I know, Judge Gorsuch is a good and a decent man. He is a husband. He is a father of two girls. He is an outdoor person. He is a person who gives back to the next generation. In addition to his judicial duties, he regularly teaches legal ethics and professionalism at the University of Colorado Law In the classroom, he is known to have great respect for his students and their diverse views.  In endorsing Judge Gorsuch's elevation to the Supreme Court, the Denver Post suggested that ``While Democrats will surely be tempted to criticize the nomination of anyone Trump appoints, they'd be wise to take the high road and look at qualifications and legal consistency.'' That is an editorial from the Denver Post, published on January 16 of this year, 2017. Those are pretty wise words. Again, ``Democrats would be wise to take the high road and look at his qualifications and legal consistency.'' That is what we should be looking at. And I think it is so unfortunate that many of my friends on the other side of the aisle have failed to heed this advice laid down in the Denver Post earlier this year.  I have seen judicial nominees come and go over my 14 years in this body, but I will tell you, I haven't seen anyone more intriguing than Judge Gorsuch with his qualifications. He has had a stellar legal career. He is brilliant. He is a rock star among Federal judges. And that kind of judge is the one law students would compete to clerk for. If this body could step back from the politics of all this, he should be confirmed with upwards of 80 or 90 votes, not subjected to a filibuster. That is the caliber of the person we are considering. I honestly cannot fathom why an individual of Judge Gorsuch's stature would be drug through the mud. I just don't believe that reflects well on this body.  I am known within the Senate for my independence in evaluating judicial nominees. While I was not a part of the Gang of 14 back in 2005 who proposed the standard for Federal court nominees, I have pretty much chosen to live by it. Except in the most extraordinary of circumstances, I do not believe judicial nominees should be denied a straight up-or-down vote. I just don't believe they should be denied that. I have practiced that. If one were to examine my record, it is clear that I have walked that walk. Sometimes it has been a walk accompanied by my friend the Senator from In the case of Goodwin Liu's nomination to the Ninth Circuit, I was the sole Republican to stand up for this principle and vote against a filibuster. I would not have voted to confirm Mr.Liu, but I felt very strongly that he had the right to an up-or-down vote.  So we are at this place today in considering not a nominee to the Ninth Circuit but a nominee to the Supreme I would ask my colleagues on the Democratic side to give the same deference to Judge  I also pride myself as one who believes in the traditions of the Senate, but it is not the tradition of the Senate to filibuster a U.Supreme Court nominee.  I do not believe that Judge Gorsuch is getting a fair shake in today's Senate, and as deeply as I care about bipartisanship in this body, I will not acquiesce to an effort to deny Judge Gorsuch a seat on the Supreme  I acknowledge my friends on the other side of the aisle who have indicated that they will not support a filibuster, and I implore those of my colleagues who have indicated that they will filibuster the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to reconsider that position.  After spending time with Judge Gorsuch, after studying his life story, I am left with the undeniable impression that Neil Gorsuch has been nominated to a position that he has prepared his whole life to assume. He is not merely a good choice, in my book, he is the best choice. He will not merely be a good Justice; I believe he will be a great Justice, perhaps a Justice of historic proportion.  So today I offer Judge Gorsuch my most enthusiastic endorsement. I have no doubt that before we leave for Easter recess, he will be confirmed as an Associate Justice of the U.Supreme  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  Mr.Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING Without objection, it is so ordered.                                 Syria  Mr.Mr.President, before I get into my remarks about the impending action of the Senate with regard to the so-called nuclear option, I would just point out that the attacks yesterday on innocent men, women, and children should not have come as a surprise. It was in 2013 that the then-Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, and the head of the CIA recommended to the President that we arm the Free Syrian Army and bring Bashar Assad's barbarity to a halt. The President of the United States rejected that. Bashar Assad used chemical weapons, and the President called me and Senator Graham over to the White House and said: If they cross the redline, I am going to act. We are going to degrade Bashar Assad and upgrade the Free Syrian Army and have regime change.  Then, of course, he backed down. You know, there is one thing worse than doing nothing: It is saying you are going to do something and then not doing it. That sent a signal everywhere in the world, not just The fact is, we knew it would happen again. So we have seen this movie before. Unless we act, we are going to see it again.  I am encouraged, frankly, that General Mattis, General McMaster, and the President of the United States have said that this act of incredible barbarity and cruelty will not go unresponded to. But I can assure my colleagues this: If we don't respond to this, then there will be more use of these chemical weapons and weapons of mass destruction, and there will be more innocent people who will die.  Eight years of Obama's failure is what led to the events that just took place that horrified all of us. That requires us to stand up to this barbarity, help the Free Syrian Army, establish safe zones, and make sure that Bashar Assad, propped up by the Russians and the Iranians and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and Hezbollah, is no longer able to perpetrate these war crimes on innocent men, women, and children.  Mr.President, it is also with some sorrow that I regret having to come to[[Page S2308]]the floor to speak once again on the issue of eliminating the 60-vote threshold on judicial nominations, specifically a nominee to the U.Supreme It is particularly troubling to do so because the nominee in question, Judge Neil Gorsuch, has impeccable legal credentials and a strong reputation as a fair- and sharp-minded lawyer and jurist. The American Bar Association and many others of all political stripes agree that his distinguished career as a lawyer and a jurist makes him well qualified for the position of Associate Justice on the U.Supreme  Regrettably, very regrettably, my colleagues in the minority have decided to filibuster the nomination of this good, decent, highly qualified man.  Numerous times over the years, the Senate has come to a standstill over nominees, whether they were judicial or executive branch. That gridlock has inevitably led to threats from the majority--whichever party was in the majority--to use the ``nuclear option,'' basically changing the rules of the Senate of 200 years to strip the minority party of their right to filibuster certain nominees.  I have been privileged several times to be a part of a group of Senators who were able to come together and negotiate agreements to end the gridlock surrounding nominees, avert the nuclear option, and allow the Senate to move forward with our work on behalf of the American people. My work in these groups--often referred to as gangs--has won me both praise and condemnation and has often put me at odds with some in my own party.  In 2005, I joined 13 of my colleagues in an agreement that allowed for votes on three of President Bush's judicial nominees who were being filibustered by the Democrats, who were in the minority at the time. Part of that agreement addressed future nominees. It stated:       Signatories will exercise their responsibilities under the      Advice and Consent Clause of the United States Constitution      in good faith. Nominees should only be filibustered under      extraordinary circumstances, and each signatory must use his      or her own discretion and judgment in determining whether      such circumstances exist.  In other words, if that nominee is so far out of the mainstream that it is extraordinary, only then would they seek to block the nomination and filibuster.  I have had conversations with colleagues on both sides of the aisle in an attempt to once again come up with a way forward and avoid both a filibuster of Judge Gorsuch and the nuclear option. Sadly, I learned on Monday that those efforts had failed and that the Democrats had secured the necessary votes to successfully filibuster the highly qualified Supreme Court nominee for the first time in our history. In response, the majority leader has indicated that he will move to change the Senate rules and eliminate the ability of the minority to do so.  We are in a terrible place. My colleagues should understand that this is a historic moment if we move forward with it.  In 2013, then-Majority Leader Harry Reid changed the Senate rules to eliminate the 60-vote threshold on most judicial and executive branch nominees. Those in my party, including me, were enraged--rightly so. We warned that the Democrats would not be in control of the Senate or the White House forever and that they would come to regret their actions. We were right.  Their actions came back to haunt them. I believe our actions will haunt us as well.  In an op-ed on November 27, 2012, Senator McConnell, knowing of the Democrats' plans to change the Senate rules in their favor, wrote this:       A serious threat has been quietly gathering against one of      the most cherished safeguards of liberty in our government--     the right of a political minority to have a voice. Until now,      this has always been the defining characteristic of the      That's why all Senators have traditionally defended      the Senate as an institution, because they knew that the      Senate was the last legislative check for political      minorities and small states against the kind of raw exercise      of power large states and majority parties have always been      tempted to wield.       The threat I'm referring to is the effort by some      Democrats, most of whom have never served a day in the      minority, to force a change in the Senate rules.  How soon we forget.  In fact, Chairman Grassley exactly predicted what is about to happen. In November 2013, he said:       Not too many years ago, my colleagues on the other side      described their fight to preserve the filibuster with great      pride. Today the other side is willing to forever change the      Senate because the Republicans have the audacity to hold      them, the majority party of today, to their own standard.       The silver lining is that there will come a day when roles      are reversed. When that happens, our side will likely      nominate and confirm lower court and Supreme Court nominees      with 51 votes regardless of whether the Democrats actually      buy into this fanciful notion that they can demolish the      filibuster on lower court nominees and still preserve it for      the Supreme  Senator Alexander, on November 21, 2013, when threatened with the nuclear option by the Democrats, said:       This action today creates a perpetual opportunity for the      tyranny of the majority because it permits a majority in this      body to do whatever it wants to do any time it wants to do      it.  Senator Alexander went on to say:       In my view, this is the most important and most dangerous      restructuring of Senate rules since Thomas Jefferson wrote      them at the beginning of our country.  On November 21, 2013, Senator Shelby said:       Democrats won't be in power in perpetuity. This is a      mistake--a big one for the long run. Maybe not for the short      run. Short-term gains, but I think it changes the Senate      tremendously in a bad way.  The same day, on the same issue, Senator Thune said:       I think Democrats are playing with fire. This is very      dangerous in terms of what it means for the What goes      around comes around. And someday, they're going to be in the      minority.  Senator Burr said on that same day:       The American people know what they get when the minority      party is stripped of its filibuster rights: they get      unchecked power by the executive branch.  He went on to say:       If sweeping legislation and lifetime appointments cannot      muster 60 votes in the United States Senate, then it probably      is not a good idea to force either on the American people.  My own colleagues on this side of the aisle need to remember our own words and heed our own warnings. We will not control this body forever. We will not hold the White House in perpetuity. What we are poised to do at the end of this week will have tremendous consequences, and I fear that someday, we will regret what we are about to do. In fact, I am confident we will.  Having said that, it is hard for me to keep a straight face when I hear the current righteous indignation coming from the other side. After reading the comments some of my Democrat friends made in 2013, it is difficult to have much sympathy for where they find themselves today.  Senator Merkley, who was perhaps the biggest proponent of changing the rules at that time, said this:       Without the nuclear option, Republicans are going to      disable the executive branch.       Ending the abusive filibuster on nominations is a big step      toward restoring the functionality of the Senate, and that      matters for all of us.       This is a terrific vote for the U. Senator Udall said:       I'm just so encouraged now that we're going to be able to--     without filibusters--put people on the courts in an orderly      way.  Senator Warren said on November 13, 2013:       We need to call out these filibusters for what they are:      Naked attempts to nullify the results of the last election.       If Republicans continue to filibuster these highly      qualified nominees for no reason other than to nullify the      President's constitutional authority, then Senators not only      have the right to change the filibuster, Senators have a duty      to change the filibuster rules. We cannot turn our backs on      the We cannot abdicate our oath of office.  Senator Sanders on May 14, 2013, said:       If we bring this nomination to the floor and there is a      request for 60 votes, which we're not going to get, I think      it is time for the Democratic leadership to do what the      American people want, and that is to have a majority rule in      the United States  I did not make up those last quotes. Those are actual quotes. This isn't fake news.  Elections have consequences, my friends. Elections have consequences.  I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle keep this in mind: Now that we are entering into an era where a simple majority decides all judicial nominations, we will see more and more nominees from the extremes of[[Page S2309]]both the left and the right. I do not see how that will ensure a fair and impartial judiciary. In fact, I think the opposite will be true, and Americans will no longer be confident of equal protection under the law.  When then-Majority Leader Reid changed the Senate rules in 2013, there was no one more critical of his actions than the Senator who stands before you now. I fought hard to convince my colleagues of the damage those changes would do to this body. I did so because I love the I revere this institution and the place it holds in our system of government. It is imperative that we have a functioning Senate where the rights of the minority are protected, regardless of which party is in power at the time.  While what happened in 2013 was infuriating to our side, it was also heartbreaking. It was heartbreaking because it seemed to me that the uniqueness of the Senate had been irreparably damaged and, along with it, any hope of restoring meaningful bipartisanship.  The unprecedented nature of the Democrats' filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee has left me in the difficult position of having to decide whether to support finishing what Harry Reid and the Democrats started in 2013 and eliminate the 60-vote threshold on Supreme Court nominations. I find myself torn between protecting the traditions and practices of the Senate and the importance of having a full complement of Justices on the U.Supreme  I am left with no choice. I will vote to change the rules and allow Judge Gorsuch to be confirmed by a simple majority. I will do so with great reluctance, not because I have any doubts that Judge Gorsuch will be an excellent Justice but because of the further--and perhaps irreparable--damage that it will do to the  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

553,CARDIN,proceeding_id,topic-id,3031,"Madam President, I take this time to explain to the people of Maryland and our Nation my views on Judge Neil Gorsuch to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United  There is no more important responsibility that a Member of the Senate has than the advice and consent of an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United Of the many important responsibilities we have, this is one of the most important responsibilities.  I have taken this on to try to understand as much as I can about Judge Gorsuch, to understand the dynamics of what his membership on the Supreme Court would mean, because I recognize it is not just an appointment for this term of This is a lifetime appointment, and it is very possible that he, if confirmed, will serve on the Supreme Court for a generation. So his impact on the workings of the Supreme Court is something that is extremely important to each Member of the  I think many of us are looking for an Associate Justice who can bring about more consensus on the Supreme Court, who can try to deal with some of the great divisions in our Nation in a way that represents the values of our Constitution, that will allow our Nation to move forward in a united way.  We also recognize that the Senate must give an independent evaluation of a Supreme Court This is not because the President of your party nominated someone to the Supreme Court, whether you support or oppose; it is the independent review process that each Senator undertakes to determine whether the nominee should get our support.  So what I look at is someone who would be a mainstream jurist, who is sensitive to the civil rights of all Americans, who would understand the importance of our Constitution, which has been a Constitution that has expanded rights and not one that we would look at ways to move in the wrong direction on extending constitutional protections--that is, move backward rather than forward.  First, let me start by stating that I am troubled by the process President Trump followed in nominating Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme During his campaign, he talked about a litmus test for Supreme Court Justices, that they must be pro-life in the mold of Justice The list that was submitted to him in which Judge Gorsuch was a part was proposed by the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist That is not a good way to start a process of bringing in a consensus nominee to the Supreme Court of the United  To my knowledge, there was no consultation with any Democrats prior to the nomination being made. The reason why consultation with all Members of the Senate is important is that if you engage in real understanding as to what the Senate--and we represent the entire country--is looking for in a Supreme Court Justice, you have a much better chance of ending up with a nominee who is going to enjoy broader support, bipartisan support, real bipartisan support in the U.Senate, and then the 60-vote threshold does not become a hurdle.  There is a reason we have the rules we do in the Senate, and the 60-vote concept on a controversial nominee is so that we don't end up with an extreme candidate who would end up being on the Supreme Court of the United States, that there must be that process that would generate 60 votes.  So despite my concern about the process that was initiated by President Trump in the nomination, I have tried to look at all of the opportunities to understand Judge Gorsuch's record and his likely actions as a member of the Supreme I took the time to meet with Judge Gorsuch, and I found that interview, that process, to be extremely helpful in understanding his judicial philosophy. I monitored the hearings that took place in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and I found that testimony to be helpful. I reviewed the testimony of experts who had submitted both verbal and written comments in regard to Judge I have reviewed his extensive legal record. We do have an extensive legal record that I am going to comment about that went into my own process in determining whether I can support him.  I came to the conclusion that I could not support Judge Gorsuch to be an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States because he is not a mainstream candidate. I am concerned that he would put corporate interests before individual rights. The strength of our Constitution is in the individual. Individual rights should be paramount to special interests or corporate interests.  I saw in his legal opinions a hostility toward environmental interests, women's health, marginalized students with disabilities, and other vulnerable types of individuals, that had me greatly concerned.  I was particularly concerned about whether he could separate his political views from his legal views. This is an extremely important point. We want our Justices on the Supreme Court not to be influenced by the politics around us.[[Page S2310]]  In the legislative branch, it is perfectly legitimate to take into consideration political views. The President of the United States is nominated by a political party; that is understood. But the Supreme Court--the Justices on the Supreme Court need to leave their political views outside of their responsibilities. I was deeply troubled, after reading the opinions of Judge Gorsuch and his writings, that he would not be able to separate his political views from his legal views.  I was concerned about whether he would truly be an independent check on the We know that President Trump is testing the constitutional reach of his office. We have seen that in some of the Executive orders he has issued. And I have little confidence by his responses at the hearings that Judge Gorsuch would be an independent voice toward the President of the United  Let me cite some examples to fill in the blanks on what I am saying. Judge Gorsuch challenges the Chevron deference doctrine. In the Gutierrez case, he indicates that judges rather than agencies should be basically administering our laws. The longstanding deference to agencies to interpret our law has allowed agencies to carry out their mission. Without that authority, it is extremely challenging to see how an agency can carry out the missions of laws we have passed. Judge Gorsuch raises questions as to whether that document is still relevant.  Let me make it clear. Who benefits from the Chevron doctrine? The Chevron doctrine has allowed agencies to protect workers' rights, protect our environment, protect consumers, food safety, and the list goes on and on. Each of our States has examples to show how important the Chevron doctrine has been. In my State of Maryland, the Chesapeake Bay is critically important to Maryland's economy, critically important to the character of our State we have in Maryland and our future. The protection of the public health of the Chesapeake Bay has very much been advanced by the Chevron deference doctrine.  Judge Gorsuch wrote: ``Chevron appears to qualify as a violation of the separation of powers.'' Then he argued that its ``primary rationale is no more than a fiction.'' Looking at what he has said about a fundamental document that is there to protect our environment, protect workers, protect public health, versus what Justice Scalia once explained--and I quote from Justice Scalia: ``In the long run, Chevron will endure and be given its full scope, because it more accurately reflects the reality of government and thus more adequately serves its needs.'' In the Gutierrez case, Judge Gorsuch was showing a more activist conservative agenda than Justice  Let me move on to Citizens We have talked about Citizens United probably more than any Supreme Court case on the Senate floor. We know it is a 5-to-4 Supreme Court decision. We know it opened up the floodgates for dark money, allowing corporations to have constitutional rights which we thought were only for individuals.  In the Riddle case, Judge Gorsuch announced a strict scrutiny standard to political contribution limits that quite frankly would make the Citizens United case even worse and would gut campaign finance law limits. I think each of us should be concerned about that decision.  Let me move on to the TransAmerican Trucking case. Here, Judge Gorsuch was in dissent. He was in the minority. What he basically said was that a truckdriver had to sacrifice his life in order to protect his job; otherwise, he could be fired. What I mean by that, as I think many of our colleagues know, but let me say to those who might not be totally familiar, the truckdriver found himself abandoned because the brakes of his trailer were frozen in subzero temperatures. He contacted his dispatcher for help and after several hours recognized that his life was in danger because of hypothermia. He did not have adequate heat in his cab.  He had one of three choices. He could try to maneuver the cab and the trailer with frozen brakes, maybe costing himself his life or the lives of other people on the road; he could remain as he was instructed by the dispatcher and perhaps freeze to death; or he could do what I think any reasonable person would do: He disconnected the cab, took care of making sure he was safe, warmed himself up, and returned to the trailer in order to complete the mission. For that, he was fired, and Judge Gorsuch said that was acceptable. That is an extreme opinion and one that gives us great pause as to how Judge Gorsuch will act on the Supreme Court of the United  Let me talk about NLRB v. Community Health Services, wherein Judge Gorsuch was again in the dissent. It had to do with backpay for workers. In this opinion, he showed real hostility to workers and unions--something that had me greatly concerned.  Another case that received a great deal of publicity in this body was Hobby I raise it here for one principal reason. What the Court was saying and Judge Gorsuch was agreeing with was that the religious protection that is provided under the Constitution--that it is more important for a company to be able to exercise that religious freedom than the employees. Once again, one of my principal concerns is whether Judge Gorsuch will protect the rights of individuals or whether he will side on behalf of business. Clearly, in the Hobby Lobby case, he decided on business, to the detriment of women's rights, the LGBT community, and others.  In the Planned Parenthood Association of Utah case, he showed a direct hostility to Planned Quite frankly, this case is very difficult to understand because Judge Gorsuch would have allowed the Governor to cut off funds even though the case had been settled and the parties had not asked to have the case retried.  We talk about activism and that we do not want to see activist judges. To me, that demonstrates that Judge Gorsuch, indeed, will be an activist judge in his trying to move a particular political agenda.  In Endrew v. Douglas County School District, which is a case that came in during the confirmation hearing process, we had a severely autistic child, and Judge Gorsuch was responsible for the absurd reading of the de minimis benefit of defending against private placement. The Supreme Court rightly rejected that logic on an 8-to-0 decision.  Justice Roberts wrote the opinion about the IDEA law in that there are protections for disabled students in our school system. Judge Gorsuch would turn back the progress that we have made on civil rights and on constitutional protection.  As I mentioned earlier, I am very concerned about whether Judge Gorsuch can keep his political views separate from what he says--how he acts as a potential Justice on the Supreme Court of the United I go to a 2005 National Review article in which he wrote:       American liberals have become addicted to the courtroom,      relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and      the ballot box as the primary means of effecting their social      agenda. . . . This overweening addiction to the courtroom as      the place to debate social policy is bad for the country and      bad for the judiciary.  I mention that particular case and quote Judge Gorsuch because we do not want a judge to side with either being a liberal or a conservative. We do not want a judge to say: I have a responsibility to promote an agenda as a judge. We do not want a judge to be able to take a political view and take that onto the bench. Whether it is a person whom we agree with politically or disagree with politically, we want to have an independent judiciary. This National Review article causes me grave concern as to whether Judge Gorsuch can, in fact, be that neutral person on the  Judge Gorsuch appears to be an activist judge and will become an activist judge and will turn back progress to protect individual constitutional rights. That is something that gives me grave concern. It is the reason I cannot support this nominee to be an Associate Justice of the U.Supreme  Let me turn to process for one moment, because it looks as though, sometime tomorrow, we are going to be called upon to vote on a cloture motion. I want to comment on that if I might.  As I said earlier, to me, Judge Gorsuch is not mainstream. He will put[[Page S2311]]corporate interests above individual interests. He shows a hostility toward the environment and women, health, women's health, et cetera. He has political views that, I think, he would not be able to differentiate, and he would not be an independent check and balance in our political system.  For all of those reasons, it seems appropriate to me that this is why we have a 60-vote threshold--to make sure that we do not take extreme nominees and allow them to be confirmed by a partisan vote. We want to have a broader consensus, and Judge Gorsuch did not earn that broader consensus.  There are additional considerations here, and this goes back a few years with the Republican leadership. What they did to President Obama's judicial nominations must be underscored because this is not in a vacuum. We did not get to this place in a vacuum from what has happened already but in our going back to President Obama when his district court nominees were delayed--in some cases, totally blocked--and required a record number of cloture motions to have been filed and acted upon--a record number. We had, as I understand, more clotures and more filibusters of President Obama's nominees by Republicans than we did in the entire history of the U. There has been a direct effort by the Republican leadership to filibuster judicial nominees. That is wrong. It should not have been done. Yes, there are reasons for some but not for the record numbers that were done. You should be able to allow for the comity.  Quite frankly, in 2013, the Republican leader told President Obama: No more DC Circuit Court judges. Let me repeat that. In 2013--this was the first year of the President's term--the Republican leader said: No more DC Circuit Court judges. We had 3 vacancies in the DC Circuit Court; 8 of the 11 had been filled, and 3 were vacant, and it had nothing to do with the nominees. They just said that they were not going to consider any of them, and they used a filibuster to block any filling of these positions.  First, I quote from Chief Judge Henry Edwards when he talked about the DC Circuit:       The review of a large, multi-party, difficult      administrative appeal is the stable judicial work of the DC      This long distinguishes the work of the DC Circuit      from the work of other circuits. It also explains why it is      impossible to compare the work of the DC Circuit with other      circuits by simply referring to the raw data of case filings.  Chief Justice Roberts noted that about two-thirds of the cases before the DC Circuit involve the Federal Government in some civil capacity. That figure is less than 25 percent nationwide. He also described the DC Circuit's unique character as a court with the special responsibility to review legal challenges of the conduct of the national government.  My point is clear. This is the second most important court in our land, and in the first year of President Obama's term, the Republicans announced that they would filibuster any attempt to put any judge on this circuit. Then we had the ultimate filibuster by the Republicans, and that was Merrick  In February 2016, after Justice Scalia's death, a nominee was submitted to us by President Obama who was acknowledged to be mainstream, acknowledged to be well qualified, acknowledged to be a consensus nominee, and he got the ultimate filibuster. Most of the Republicans in the Senate would not meet with him. He did not have a committee hearing or a committee vote, and he did not have a floor vote. That was the ultimate filibuster. It was wrong, particularly when we know that he would have received 60 votes.  So you cannot compare Judge Gorsuch with Judge Garland because, unlike Judge Garland, Judge Gorsuch does not share the same evaluation of being able to be a consensus, mainstream candidate who would receive a 60-vote threshold.  For all of these reasons, if the majority leader is going to pursue the cloture vote on the Gorsuch nomination, I will not vote in favor of cloture. I would hope that we would be able to return to the comity that is important in the U.Senate, but we recognize there are times in which you should have a 60-vote threshold. When the President of the United States goes outside of the norms and the process has already been employed by the Republicans, I urge my colleagues to rethink the course that we are on.

554,SCHATZ,proceeding_id,topic-id,1585,"Madam President, when our country was founded, corporations were on the minds of no one. They are not mentioned in the Constitution or the Bill of Rights, and when the topic finally came up to the Supreme Court, Chief Justice John Marshall called corporations a ``mere creature of the law.''  People have certain unalienable rights. Corporations do not. We established corporate personhood so that companies could raise capital and enter into contracts, but nobody ever thought that this term that was used--``personhood''--actually meant that corporations were people. They are not. It is not complicated. Corporations do not eat. They do not sleep. They do not worry about their children or their elderly parents. They do not get sick. They do not retire, and they do not have complex motivations. In fact, under the law, they have only one motivation, which is to maximize profits.  Any logical person knows that corporations are not people, but in Judge Gorsuch's America, they are.  There is no doubt that he is a very smart person, but he, actually, had a hand in creating this theory that corporations have the same rights as human beings--that they are, in fact, people. We are supposed to pretend that this premise is not insane, but it is crazy, and it is hurting our democracy. For the past several decades, we have increasingly limited people's rights in favor of corporate rights.  Now Republicans want us to confirm a judge who says that corporations have religious rights. Judge Gorsuch was a part of the Hobby Lobby decision that went before the Supreme Court, in which the Tenth Circuit decided that corporate personhood extends to First Amendment religious rights, and because the corporation itself--not just the people who own it--has been granted those rights by judges like Neil Gorsuch, the rights of corporations now usurp the health and the rights of American citizens. That is the problem with Judge Gorsuch's worldview.  It is not just that he is a conservative; it is that he actually thinks that corporate entities have the very same rights as American citizens--rights, by the way, that do not come with the same responsibilities that we all have as American citizens. Yet this judge wants to confer more rights onto corporations when we are already past the tipping point as a society when corporations have more power than people.  We are in the absurd position of asking: How far are these corporate rights going to extend? They have been given First Amendment rights. They have been given Fourth Amendment rights. Do they get the right to vote next? Do they get the right to keep and bear arms? How many more constitutional rights are we going to give to corporations before we say that enough is enough? We are already well beyond the point at which corporate interests beat out the individual, whether it is at the polls or in the workplace.  There are a lot of other things about Judge Gorsuch's worldview that I object to, but, at my core, I think I might be able to get around some of those things in knowing that the Constitution requires the Senate to advise and consent, not agree with. Yet his worldview regarding corporations as people embodies everything that is going wrong with our country and with the By the way, it is probably fair to say that almost every nominee whom we have seen this year embodies this worldview.  Time and again, Democrats in the Senate have raised the alarm about this administration's nominees, and we have been overruled. What is the result? You have Cabinet Secretaries destroying American diplomacy. You have Secretaries trying to ban Muslims from entering the United You have an EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt, leaving a dangerous product on the market that has been proven by his own scientists to hurt children. Why? Because they prioritize corporate rights over people's rights.  The problem is this: Cabinet Secretaries come and go; Supreme Court[[Page S2312]]Justices do not. Let me put it this way: This administration's Cabinet is like a date. It is a really bad date, but at least it comes to an end. A Supreme Court Justice on the other hand is not a bad date; it is a marriage. It is a lifetime appointment that will have an impact on generations of  The fact that he is out of the mainstream is absolutely essential for us to consider. The fact that he thinks corporations are people is, in my mind, disqualifying--so disqualifying that I will vote no on cloture, and I will vote no on final confirmation if it comes to that, which brings me to the question of cloture.  When the Senate votes on cloture, the question before the Senate is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate should be brought to a close?  For the Supreme Court nominee, we have rules, and those rules say that you need 60 Senators to end debate--not 59, not 51, not 57. There are 59 Senators who do not get to decide when to end debate; 60 do. If you cannot get 60 votes to end debate, you do not have cloture.  After 2013, there is only one position--one appointed position that retains that 60-vote threshold, and that is the U.Supreme That is for a very straightforward reason. It is that we have decided as a body that the Supreme Court needs to have bipartisan support; that if a person cannot get 60 votes, you change the nominee, you do not change the rules.  We have decided that this position--this institution, the Court itself, the highest Court in the land--should be beyond our partisan disputes and differences. That is the foundation of the U.It is the way this place works. Without this rule, the reality will be grim. Without this rule, if you are a Member of the minority party, the President's nominees don't have to listen to you, meet with you, think about you. Without this rule, advice and consent is rendered meaningless for whichever party is out of power.  I have been here now 5 years, about 4\1/2\ years. Even in my short time here, the door swings both ways in Remember that today, this week, for the Republicans it might feel satisfying to use power maximally, to use the greatest authority possible under the U.Constitution, but without this rule, the Senate itself will be undermined by its own I have never seen any legislative body endeavor to diminish its own authority, and that is what is going to happen this week.  We can argue about how we got here. Was it in 1987 when the Senate rejected Robert Bork? Was it in 2013 when Leader Reid responded to historic obstructionism by eliminating most filibusters on nominees? Was it last year when Merrick Garland was not even given a hearing? We all have our talking points. At the end of the day, both sides own some of this mess. I am a I think it is 80/20. Republicans will think it is 80/20 on the other side. The general public may think it is 60/40 or 50/50. I am not sure that matters anymore. The question of who is at fault is not the most important question. The question is, What do we do next? Will the Senate undermine its own authority and strengthen the power of partisanship?  I would say this to my Republican colleagues: Think about what you are going to do next. Think about what this is going to mean the next time you are in the minority party, because it will not be Senators Duckworth and Cortez Masto who can't even get a meeting with a Supreme Court nominee, it will be you.  This is about the future of the Senate and the Supreme The nuclear option will mean nominees for the Supreme Court will not have to meet with or consider minority opinions. It will mean that the Senate's habit of being slow--sometimes maddeningly so, but we know it is in the best interests of the country--will go away for this appointment. That tradition allows the center to hold, and it will be undermined.  To my Republican colleagues, I am not asking you not to do this. I am asking you to take your time. In the world's greatest deliberative body, there is no reason to rush this decision. I am asking you to wait. I am asking you to take a few weeks before you decide to change the Senate forever. Take your time. This is probably one of the most consequential decisions you are going to make in the U.Senate because it is about the Senate itself. This is worth talking about. This is worth deliberating over. It is worth thinking over. Go home. Talk to your constituents. If you want to do this, you can do this anytime you want. You can do this the Monday we get back from our spring work period. For goodness' sake, there is no reason not to think about it for a little bit longer.  All we need are three Members of the Republican Party to go to their leader, publicly or privately, and say: We are not with you on nuclear yet; give us some time to try to save this important aspect of the Otherwise, you will make both the Supreme Court and the world's greatest deliberative body more extreme and more divided, and I believe you will regret it.

555,MARKEY,proceeding_id,topic-id,1928,"Madam President, I rise to speak in opposition to the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve as an Associate Justice of the U.Supreme  Let me begin by making clear my view that the vacancy on the Supreme Court created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia was President Obama's to fill. In an act of unprecedented obstructionism that makes a filibuster pale in comparison, Senate Republicans broke with longstanding Senate tradition and refused to hold a vote or even a hearing on President Obama's nominee, Judge Merrick  As we now consider President Trump's nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch, we cannot ignore or forget this hyperpartisan action. We also cannot ignore how President Trump came to nominate Judge President Trump went to two of the most partisan, conservative organizations he could find--the Koch brothers-supported Heritage Foundation and the rightwing Federalist Society--and said to them: Who do you want on the Supreme Court? They compiled their dream team of 21 ultraconservative candidates. President Trump looked at the names on that list and asked himself which judge could pass the rightwing litmus tests he had articulated during the campaign. His choice was Judge Neil  On the campaign trail, Candidate Donald Trump made clear that he was pro-life and would appoint pro-life judges to the Supreme In one interview, he was asked about his pro-life position as follows:       So, how important is that issue to you now? When President      Trump picks Supreme Court justices, would there be a litmus      test?  Trump responded:       It is. It is.  During the second Presidential debate, Candidate Trump doubled down on this issue. He was asked specifically about Roe v. Wade, the longstanding Supreme Court precedent establishing a woman's right to choose. The question to Candidate Trump was ``Do you want the court, including the justices that you will name, to overturn Roe v. Wade?''  Trump responded that he would ``be appointing pro-life judges,'' adding, ``Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justices on . . . that will happen,'' meaning Roe v. Wade will be overturned.  We know from Donald Trump's own words that he had a litmus test for Supreme Court nominees on a woman's right to choose. That litmus test is that he will appoint only pro-life Justices who are committed to overturning Roe v.  What about a litmus test on guns? During the Presidential campaign, Candidate Trump repeatedly emphasized his pro-gun views, which are in lockstep with the National Rifle He was asked about a litmus test for the Second Amendment--specifically, the precedent established in the 2008 Supreme Court case of District of Columbia v. In Heller, the Justices ruled 5 to 4 that a commonsense Washington, DC, law banning handguns and requiring other firearms to be stored unloaded or locked violated the Second  Candidate Trump was asked: ``Will you make upholding the Heller decision a litmus test in Supreme Court nominees?''  Trump answered: ``Yes, I would.''  The followup question: ``So you won't nominate somebody to the Supreme[[Page S2313]]Court unless they agree with Scalia on the Heller decision?''  Trump responded: ``Correct.''  We know from Donald Trump's own words that he had a litmus test for Supreme Court nominees on guns--his judges must support the National Rifle Association's agenda and its unreasonable and dangerously broad view of the Second  From that list of 21 names provided to him by the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society, President Trump chose Judge Neil Gorsuch, apparently convinced that he was the man who would pass these litmus tests.  The Senate Judiciary Committee's hearings on Judge Gorsuch were an opportunity for him to dispel doubts about his independence that President Trump's selection process had raised. Unfortunately, Judge Gorsuch did nothing to address these concerns. In fact, his appearance before the Judiciary Committee raised more questions than it answered because Judge Gorsuch was positively sphinx-like before the Senators questioning him.  For example, when repeatedly asked about something as elementary as his judicial philosophy, Judge Gorsuch refused to answer. He declined to say whether he agreed with the Roe v. Wade decision, the District of Columbia v. Heller decision, or other controversial decisions, such as Citizens United, which opened the floodgates to unrestricted, secret money in electoral campaigns, or even the decision in Bush v. Gore, which decided the 2000 Presidential election.  Judge Gorsuch also refused to respond whether he agreed with other Supreme Court precedents on the right to privacy, the right to counsel in criminal proceedings, voting rights, or same-sex marriage. Contrast that to Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who during her confirmation hearing explained that she fully understood the individual right to bear arms that the Supreme Court recognized in the Heller decision. Contrast that with Justice Anthony Kennedy, who during his hearing praised the Supreme Court's landmark 1963 decision in Gideon v. Wainwright, which established the right to counsel in criminal cases. Even contrast Judge Gorsuch with Chief Justice John Roberts, who at his hearing affirmed that privacy is part of the liberty interest protected by the due process clause. Instead, at his hearing, Judge Gorsuch repeatedly parroted that critical Supreme Court decisions were precedents of the Court ``that he would follow unless and until they are overturned.'' He shed no light on what he felt about those precedents or whether he would be inclined or disinclined to vote to overturn them.  Only after considerable prodding did Judge Gorsuch eventually agree that the decision in Brown v. Board of Education, which did away with the doctrine of separate but equal and desegregated schools across our Nation, was correct. Having to pry out of Judge Gorsuch that concession does not inspire confidence in him.  His performance at the hearings left us with many troubling things that we don't know about Judge Gorsuch, but equally troubling about Judge Gorsuch are the things we do know about him.  We do know that Judge Gorsuch authored the Hobby Lobby decision in which he ruled that corporations are people whose religious beliefs are more important than the reproductive rights and health of women.  We do know that Judge Gorsuch has questioned the judicial doctrine of what is known as Chevron deference. That is the rule from the Supreme Court case of Chevron v. The Natural Resources Defense Council under which judges must generally defer to expert administrative agency interpretations of laws they are charged with administering. In a speech last year, Judge Gorsuch attacked the modern administrative state that has developed under Chevron, saying that it ``poses a grave threat to our values of personal liberty.''  What Judge Gorsuch is saying is not some abstract legal theorizing; he is attacking the fundamental rules that protect the health, safety, and welfare of all Americans that are put in place by agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Securities and Exchange In the decades since Chevron was decided, it has been instrumental in courts upholding these agency rules that ensure that our air and drinking water are clean; rules that ensure that drugs and medicines are safe and effective; rules that ensure that our automobiles, workplaces, food, medicine, and children's toys are not dangerous; and rules that ensure our financial markets are fair and offer investors a level playing field.  Even Justice Scalia supported Chevron deference. But Judge Gorsuch has signaled that he would overturn it and instead allow pro-corporate judges to substitute their policy views for those of the agency experts. If threatening the destruction of the regulations that protect the health, safety, and welfare of Americans sounds familiar, it should. It is straight out of the alt-right, Steve Bannon playbook. And it is a fringe position that is not worthy of representation on our Nation's highest  We also know that the Supreme Court just rejected Judge Gorsuch's harsh reasoning in a disabilities rights case. A few years ago, Judge Gorsuch wrote an opinion for the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in a case under the Individuals with Disabilities Education That opinion held that schools across the country must provide educational benefits to students with disabilities that must be ``merely more than de minimis.'' But just last week, in an IDEA case, all eight Supreme Court Justices disagreed with Judge Chief Justice Roberts wrote that the IDEA--the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act--is ``markedly more demanding than the `merely more than de minimis' test applied by the Tenth Circuit,'' and added that Judge Gorsuch's approach would effectively strip many disabled students of their right to an education.  We also know that Judge Gorsuch has consistently ruled against employees in cases involving claims of unsafe workplaces and sex discrimination, and he has repeatedly sided with insurance companies that sought to deny disability benefits to employees.  Here is something else we know. If the first 75 days of the Trump administration are a preview of coming attractions, one thing could not be more clear: The U.Supreme Court's rule defending the Constitution will be tested as never before: conflicts of interest, emoluments, Muslim bans, rescinding LGBTQ protections. The list of constitutional rights the Trump administration is violating gets longer every single day.  Now more than ever, we need a Supreme Court Justice who is independent and not beholden to ideology. Now more than ever, we need a Justice who will stand up for the rights of all Americans against big corporate interests. A Justice who would be to the right of Antonin Scalia on the issue of Chevron deference is not a mainstream A Justice who would be to the right of Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas by a substantial margin--as professors from Michigan State University and the University of Wisconsin concluded after examining Judge Gorsuch's opinions on the Tenth Circuit, and the Supreme Court's decisions reviewing them--is not someone within the mainstream of American jurisprudence.  Everything we have seen so far--from Donald Trump's judicial litmus tests, to the visible hand of rightwing interest groups in the selection process, to Judge Gorsuch's reticence before the Judiciary Committee, to his pro-corporate bias in cases he has decided--leads me to the conclusion that he will be neither a Justice for all Americans, nor one on whom we can count to stand up to President  We cannot let Judge Neil Gorsuch become the crucial ninth vote on the Supreme One Justice matters. The list of recent 5-to-4 decisions coming out of the Supreme Court shows that one judge's vote can forever alter history. Just remember that Bush v. Gore, Citizens United, District of Columbia v. Heller, and the Affordable Care Act, were all decided by 5-to-4 votes.  I will, therefore, oppose Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court and support the filibuster, and I urge my colleagues to do so, as well. If Judge Gorsuch cannot muster 60 votes, the problem is not with the process, it is with the nominee. If Judge Gorsuch cannot get to the 60 votes historically required for confirmation to the Nation's highest Court, I urge President Trump to withdraw his nomination and[[Page S2314]]consult with a wide range of Senators--legal scholars and others who past Presidents have sought out before making a Supreme Court nomination--and put before us someone in the mold of Merrick Garland, who can enjoy bipartisan support and be within the broad mainstream of American jurisprudential history.  Otherwise, the consequences of forcing Judge Gorsuch's nomination through will fall squarely on the shoulders of President Trump and his Republican allies in the Senate, if they decide to exercise the nuclear option, forever changing the history of the United States  I urge a ``no'' vote on Judge  I yield back to the  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt2-PgS2309.txt
556,KAINE,proceeding_id,topic-id,1576,"Madam President, I also rise to discuss the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch of the Tenth I take this very seriously.  I started my legal career as an appellate law clerk in the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in the South, working for a spectacular jurist, Judge Lanier Anderson He taught me about what it was to be an appellate judge: humility, not making a case a personal cause, and careful application of the law.  I then went on to practice law in the State and Federal courts, the trial and appeal courts, including the U.Supreme Court as a civil rights lawyer for 17 years. When I was the Governor of Virginia, I twice had to appoint members of the Virginia Supreme Court and grappled with qualifications to serve on an appellate bench.  Maybe most especially, my wife was a judge. So with a judge in the house--she was a judge for 8 years--I spent a lot of time also thinking about the characteristics of a good judge. Judge Gorsuch has some strong characteristics, educational background, and professional experience. These are characteristics that are worthy of respect. But I have decided that there is an additional characteristic that is very important--judicial philosophy.  And as I have looked at Judge Gorsuch's judicial philosophy, I have concluded that I cannot support him. I have read scores of his opinions. I met with him in my office. I am so proud of my colleagues--Democrat and Republican--because in 2 months, Judge Gorsuch has enjoyed something that Merrick Garland didn't get in 10 months. Judge Gorsuch has had meetings with virtually all He has had a Judiciary Committee hearing, a Judiciary Committee vote. He is getting floor debate, and he will get a floor vote. Those are the five things he is entitled to, and he is getting all of them.  Judge Merrick Garland was nominated. Republicans wouldn't meet with him. They wouldn't hold a hearing. They wouldn't do a committee vote. They wouldn't do a floor debate, and he wouldn't get a floor vote. He got nothing he was entitled to as a sitting judge on the DC Also, the Senate didn't exercise the advice and consent function that is part of our constitutional job description.  Let's talk about Judge Gorsuch's record. Many of my colleagues have been speaking for hours. I want to focus on one aspect of his record. Judge Gorsuch was promoted by President Trump as not an activist. And Judge Gorsuch has written with scorn about activist judges, saying that judges who impose their moral or social preferences on others can't square their position with the He even scorned activists in courts, saying that liberals are addicted to the courtroom, as if somehow bringing constitutional claims in courts is wrong.  So I think it is fair to look at Judge Gorsuch by his own standard. Is he an activist or not? The best definition of a nonactivist judge was the definition given by Chief Justice Roberts during his confirmation hearing. He said: I am an umpire. I have no platform. I have no agenda. I call balls and strikes without fear of any party, without favor to any party. I am an umpire.  I looked at Judge Gorsuch's record and talked about a set of cases that determine whether that is, in fact, true. And I have concluded that Judge Gorsuch is definitely an activist. He may not be an activist on everything. I don't think you have to be an activist on everything to be an activist, but I do believe he is an activist. It shows through in no area clearer than it shows through in cases dealing with women's ability to make their own decisions about their own healthcare, especially reproductive health.  There is a famous 2013 case that has been much discussed during these discussions and in committee--Hobby Lobby v. It was a challenge brought up in the Tenth Circuit, where Judge Gorsuch now sits. The legal question before the circuit court was pretty straightforward. Under a congressional act designed to protect religious liberty--the Religious Freedom Restoration Act--a company claimed that its religious views conflicted with the contraception mandate of the Affordable Care And, if so, could they gain protection for their own position?  It was sort of a controversial case because the notion that a company could assert religious views was sort of a novel theory at the time. But, with Judge Gorsuch as part of the majority, the majority in the Tenth Circuit ruled that, yes, a company could assert a claim based on sincerely held religious beliefs under the RFR statute. And they could assert that their beliefs conflicted with the ACA's contraception mandate.  Then, in 2014, that ruling was upheld by the U.Supreme Court--a controversial decision, but the majority agreed with the position that, yes, a company could assert that its sincerely held religious beliefs were, in fact, in conflict with the statute, and they could get relief from the statute for doing that. Judge Gorsuch joined the ruling, which was later affirmed by the Supreme  What interested me about Judge Gorsuch in the case was that he chose to write a concurring opinion. Most folks know what they are. If you are not a lawyer--when a panel writes an opinion, there is a majority opinion that is the ruling in the case. If a judge feels that it is wrong, a judge will write a dissenting opinion saying: No, you are wrong, and here is why. You are dutybound, if you think the majority is wrong, to write a dissent.  A concurring opinion is about as voluntary as it gets. A concurring opinion is: I agree with the outcome, but I have a point I want to make. I can't convince the rest of the majority to go along with me, and I want to make this point.  So Judge Gorsuch wrote a concurring opinion that was incredibly revealing. It was voluntary, and that shows you a little about a person's philosophy. It was incredibly revealing for two reasons. First, Judge Gorsuch had already joined the majority opinion to say that the employer, Hobby Lobby, could challenge the employer mandate of the He had already joined that, but he stretched beyond to rule that, in addition, the individuals owning the company should be able to sue to challenge the employer mandate, even though they weren't the employer.  The ACA mandate applied only to the employer of the female employees. The employer was Hobby But even though the mandate didn't even apply to the Green family who owned the company, Judge Gorsuch said that they should be able to challenge the ACA anyway.  I practiced law for a long time. There is a complete separation--there is supposed to be--between individuals and an incorporated company. You can run a business and not incorporate it, and in that case, there is no separation. But as soon as you incorporate it, you get all kinds of protections, especially that you can protect your own personal assets from liability for corporate actions. The Green family had done that. But Judge Gorsuch said: Even though you voluntarily separated yourself from the company and even though the mandate doesn't apply to you, you should be able to file a lawsuit to challenge the mandate. I found that to be highly unusual--a great stretch. I asked him about it when we talked. He did not give me a satisfactory answer.  Here was the thing about the Hobby Lobby case that was more notable. It was the way Judge Gorsuch described what the case was about. The majority opinion in the Tenth Circuit and the majority opinion in the Supreme Court described the case the same way. They basically said that the owners of this company claimed that the contraception mandate was contrary to their religious views. That is what the case[[Page S2315]]was about. The clash was between the owners' religious beliefs and the statute. That is what the case was about. But Judge Gorsuch described the case completely differently. Here are his words:       All of us face the problem of complicity. All must answer .      . . to what degree we are willing to be involved in the      wrongdoing of others.  He didn't describe it as a clash between the owners and the statute. He described it as a case about whether you are willing to be complicit in the wrongdoing of others. That wasn't the legal issue at all. In the Gorsuch concurring opinion in Hobby Lobby, what does that phrase mean--``the wrongdoing of others''? Who are the others he is talking about? He is talking about female employees of Hobby Lobby, who wish to make their own choice from among available and lawful methods of contraception. Those are the others he is referring to.  He is also referring to that choice as ``wrongdoing.'' That is a completely editorial comment that is not drawn from what a lawyer said or what a plaintiff said. That is his own characterization of the case, and it is completely irrelevant and, I would argue, insulting. It is a completely irrelevant and insulting reference to something that was not part of the case at all, except Judge Gorsuch decided to inject it into the case.  Somebody who looks at women making their own choice of contraception as the ``wrongdoing of others''--that is very telling.  The PRESIDING The time for the Democrats has expired.  The majority whip.

The parties were fine with the decisions. They were going back to the district court and they did not apply to have the cases reheard en banc. But in both those cases, Judge Gorsuch took the highly unusual step of trying to get the appeals heard anyway, even though the parties did not want to have them reheard. In my experience as an appellate advocate, that is virtually unheard of. I have talked to litigators in the Tenth Circuit, and they have said the same thing. It is highly rare. The fact that Judge Gorsuch would do it in two cases--both of which involved women's health access--is important.  Finally, in his confirmation hearing, Judge Gorsuch was asked directly whether he agreed with the decision in Griswold v. Connecticut, the 1965 decision that said married couples could not be criminalized for using contraception.  He said it was a precedent worthy of respect like all precedents, but he would not agree--he would not say he agreed with the case. Chief Justice Roberts, during his confirmation, said he agreed with the case. Justice Thomas said: I have no quarrel with Justice Alito said he agreed with the case. But Judge Gorsuch would not.  Griswold v. Connecticut has been used repeatedly in the last 50 years to basically create a body of constitutional precedent that says the relationships of people--romantic, inmate relationships--should be free from the intrusion of Big You can't criminalize somebody because of their relationship. I think somebody who is not willing to commit to that principle is somebody who has not earned my vote.  With that, I yield the floor. Again, I thank my friend from  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Young).

560,CORNYN,proceeding_id,topic-id,1110,"Mr.President, Members of the Senate have been coming to the floor talking about the important vote we will be casting tomorrow and then again on Friday which will result in the confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch as the next Associate Justice of the Supreme  Having served on the Senate Judiciary Committee since I first came to the Senate, it has been my honor to participate in the confirmation hearings in the committee on now five Supreme Court Justices, Judge Gorsuch being the latest.  What I have been struck by when it comes to Judge Gorsuch is how much our friends across the aisle--who cast a party-line vote in the Judiciary Committee against the judge on his confirmation--how much they have been struggling to come up with even one intellectually honest argument against the nominee, in spite of his obvious and tremendous qualifications and bipartisan support.  For example, I heard our colleague from Virginia, my friend Senator Kaine, criticize a couple of decisions that the judge made. What he left out is that Judge Gorsuch participated in 2,700 panel decisions on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals during his 10-year tenure there. Ninety-seven percent of them were unanimous. As the Presiding Officer knows, that means that each of the judges--three judges on the typical panel or in an en banc--basically that everyone agreed, whether they were nominated by a Republican or So this whole idea of cherry-picking the judge's judicial report to try to find some straw, to grasp at some straw with which to disagree with his confirmation is pretty striking to me.  But last night we saw the latest act of desperation to try to justify the unprecedented partisan filibuster of Judge For example, it was reported that a handful of lines in a 2006 book were borrowed from other sources. Well, the timing of this says it all. This book has been published for 10 years. The only reason for this allegation is a last-minute attempt to try to make something, really anything stick to tarnish the character of someone who will soon serve on the Supreme  This kind of baseless attack is not only disingenuous, it is transparent and it has absolutely no merit. Even the author of the main article allegedly plagiarized has rejected that characterization. So this is the person who wrote the article who Judge Gorsuch was claimed to have plagiarized, in essence. Well, the author of the main article rejected the characterization of plagiarization. She said that under the circumstances, it would have been awkward and difficult for Judge Gorsuch to have used different language.  Other academic experts have also rejected the claim and made clear that the preferred methodology for facts is to cite original sources, which is exactly what Judge Gorsuch did. Talk about an eleventh-hour baseless attack.  The bottom line is this: Instead of evaluating the judge based on his qualifications, the sterling reputation he has among people across the political spectrum, our friends across the aisle are determined to attempt the first successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. That is disappointing, but it is also destined for failure.  Yesterday, I pointed out how we actually got here. Back during President George Bush's first term, Senator Schumer and others laid the groundwork and then executed a strategy for unprecedented obstruction of judicial nominees. That was in response to the election of the last Republican This is in response to the election of a new Republican I think for him, following the election of the current one, obstruction of a perfectly qualified nominee to the Supreme Court is just the next step. It actually represents the ultimate escalation of this weaponization of the filibuster used in judicial confirmations.  As I have said before, based on the merits of the nominee, the justifications for opposing Judge Gorsuch are paper thin. Our colleagues across the aisle unanimously supported Judge Gorsuch when he was confirmed to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals just 10 years ago. He got everybody's vote. It was a voice vote. This was to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, a lifetime tenured position. All of them agreed he[[Page S2316]]should be confirmed. Well, that includes then-Senator Obama, Senator Clinton, and Senator So I would ask you, what has changed in the last 10 years that now cause them to reach deep into their bag of tricks and to filibuster this nominee for the Supreme Court? Well, it is not his track record as a judge, that is for sure. As I mentioned, of the 2,700 cases he has participated in, 97 percent were unanimous--97 percent.  One recent analysis put him in the middle of the circuit ideologically speaking, and for a decade he has done good, fair work as a judge on the Tenth Circuit--really outstanding work, to be honest. That should tell you something about this judge and this man, but it should also tell you something about the opponents of this nominee, many of whom, like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, as I mentioned, supported his nomination just 10 years ago. The only thing that has changed, the only thing that explains the radical shift of Democrats in opposition to this good judge, is that now President Trump is in the White  I honestly believe that every excuse they have come up with to engage in this unprecedented filibuster is completely without merit. What they are really upset about is what happened on November 8. I don't believe--if they won't confirm Judge Gorsuch, they will never vote to confirm any nominee of this President, period.  What we are talking about and all we are asking for is an up-or-down vote. If they want to vote against the nomination, that is their right, but, as everybody knows, to get to that, we first have to get 60 votes to close off debate and then get to the majority up-or-down vote. But they will not even allow us to move to a vote.  I hope our Democratic friends who are obstructing will reconsider. I believe there are four Democrats who are going to join all of the Republicans in voting to confirm this nominee, so he will enjoy bipartisan support, as he should.  This judge is a faithful interpreter of the law. He believes in an independent judiciary and enjoys support across the ideological spectrum. He will be confirmed as the next Supreme Court justice, but it is up to our Democratic friends to determine just how that occurs.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

562,ROUNDS,proceeding_id,topic-id,1174,"Mr.President, I rise today to offer my strong support for Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump's pick to replace Justice Scalia on the Supreme On Monday, his nomination passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and we expect to confirm him before the end of the week. I am tremendously excited to have him on the bench. Throughout his career, Judge Gorsuch has proven time and again that he is exceptionally qualified to serve on the Supreme He has been praised and endorsed by members on both sides of the political spectrum, the left and the right.  As a judge on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals since 2006, after being unanimously confirmed by this body, Judge Gorsuch has proven he is as mainstream as they come. In fact, of the 800-plus opinions that he has written for the Tenth Circuit, less than 2 percent, or 14 opinions, have drawn dissents from his colleagues. In other words, 98 percent of his opinions have been unanimous. That is even more remarkable when you look at the makeup of the Tenth Circuit--12 of the judges were appointed by Democratic Presidents, while only 5 were appointed by It does not get much more mainstream than that.  During his confirmation hearings last month, Judge Gorsuch again proved that he is eminently qualified to serve on the bench of our Nation's highest Let me share some of his quotes from his hearing:  ``The Constitution doesn't change. The world around us changes.''  ``I don't believe in litmus tests for judges.''  ``If I'm confirmed, I will do all my powers permit, to be a faithful servant to the Constitution and laws of this great nation.''  One last quote:       As a judge now for more than a decade, I've watched my      colleagues spend long days worrying over cases. Sometimes the      answers we reach aren't the ones we personally prefer.      Sometimes the answers follow us home at night and keep us up.      But the answers we reach are always the ones we believe the      law requires. And for all its imperfections, I believe that      the rule of law in this nation truly is a wonder. And that      it's no wonder that it's the envy of the world.  It is clear that Judge Gorsuch is qualified to serve on the Supreme Court and that he understands the role of a judge: to interpret the law, not to make the law.  To that end, I would also like to highlight Judge Gorsuch's in-depth understanding of the separation of powers doctrine, and I am optimistic that Judge Gorsuch will carefully scrutinize cases and controversies that involve executive overreach.  The past 8 years have seen an unprecedented expansion of the administrative state. This has come at the expense of both the legislative branch, whose purpose is to make laws, and the judicial branch, whose purpose is to interpret the law and decide on a specific law's constitutionality. But more concerning than that, it has also come at the expense of American citizens.  Overreach by executive agencies has led to regulatory expansion that results in the Federal Government involving itself in nearly every facet of our lives on a daily basis. This expansion has been permitted, in part, to U.courts relying on the flawed Chevron doctrine to show great deference to agency interpretation of the laws passed by As a result, agencies have been able to broadly interpret laws in a way that has allowed them to expand their regulatory authority far beyond what Congress ever intended.  Fortunately, U.judges are beginning to question the Chevron doctrine and its impact on the separation of powers doctrine relied on by our Founding Fathers and affirmed in the U.Judge Gorsuch is one of those judges. Regarding Chevron, Judge Gorsuch has written that Chevron seems to be no less than a judge-made doctrine for the abdication of the judicial duty that prevents American courts from fulfilling their constitutionally delegated duty--interpreting what the law actually intends.  Careful judicial scrutiny and interpretation of the law will allow courts to rein in agency actions that are inconsistent with the law and beyond the bounds of what Congress intended.  In his concurrence in Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch, Gorsuch argues that the Administrative Procedure Act vests in the courts the responsibility to ``interpret statutory provisions and overturn agency action inconsistent with those provisions'' and questions the idea that Congress ``intended to delegate away its legislative power to executive agencies.''  Judge Gorsuch takes his duty as a judge with the utmost seriousness. He seeks to interpret the law the way Congress intended, not in the way an executive agency wants it to be.  His careful and academic approach to judicial review is well-suited for our Nation's highest I am confident that Judge Gorsuch will respect and enforce the constitutionally affirmed separation of powers doctrine that in recent years has been diluted by executive agencies broadly interpreting laws, resulting in regulatory overreach. This has minimized the role of Congress in the legislative process. As a result, the voices of American citizens have also been minimized and replaced with unelected Washington bureaucrats who think they know what is best for all  Judge Gorsuch is one of the finest judges our Nation has to offer. The knowledge and careful deliberation he will bring to the Court will result in rulings that reflect justice, fairness, and an interpretation of what the law is and what Congress intended it to be, not what administrative agencies want it to be.  Despite impeccable credentials, we are in a situation today because of a precedent set in November 2013 by then-Majority Leader Harry Reid and his conference. Former Leader Reid's use of a so-called nuclear option in 2013 meant the Senate could reinterpret its rules via simple-majority vote. Former[[Page S2317]]Leader Reid accomplished this by challenging a ruling of the Chair with regard to the number of votes needed to end debate on certain nominations.  The Standing Rules of the Senate require the support of a supermajority, or 67 percent of Senators, to change the rules. To challenge the ruling of the Chair, Reid only needed a majority vote to overturn the Presiding Officer's correct interpretation of the written rule. In other words, Former Leader Reid broke the rules to change the rules and, by default, broke precedent to change the precedent moving forward as well.  Based on this new precedent set by Former Leader Reid, the Senate is likely to confirm Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court by a simple-majority vote. Because the Senate has always operated on precedent, we will likely follow this new precedent to approve Judge Gorsuch's nomination later this week.  When he is confirmed, Judge Gorsuch will make a tremendous addition to the Supreme His lifetime of defending the Constitution and applying the law as it was written provides clear evidence that he has the aptitude for this lifetime appointment to our Nation's highest  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

564,FISCHER,proceeding_id,topic-id,913,"Mr.President, I rise today in support of the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be our next U.Supreme Court Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution entrusts Members of the Senate with a responsibility vital to our democracy: providing advice and consent on the President's Supreme Court nominees.  The significance of this task cannot be overstated, and it is one that I take very seriously. Days after President Trump nominated Judge Gorsuch to fill the late Justice Scalia's seat on the Supreme Court, I shared the qualities that I wanted to see in a They included a strong commitment to the rule of law, first-rate credentials, and a solid judicial record. The time has come to determine whether the nominee meets those criteria.  After meeting personally with Judge Gorsuch, watching his confirmation hearing, and evaluating his background and legal record, I believe that answer is a resounding ``yes.'' Judge Gorsuch's credentials are exemplary. He has an extraordinary resume and a brilliant mind. For 10 years he has served on the U.Court of Appeals for the Tenth The Senate confirmed him to this position by unanimous consent in 2006. No rollcall vote was needed because all 100 Members supported the nomination.  To date, Judge Gorsuch has decided 2,700 cases, and 99 percent of the time he sided with the majority. He has offered opinions in 800 of those cases, and 98 percent of the decisions in these cases were unanimous. This record tells us something important: He is well within the mainstream. It is why he has gained the respect of prominent attorneys on the right and on the left. Several of my Democratic colleagues have made similar observations.  Senator Donnelly recently said that he would support Judge Gorsuch's nomination because ``he is a qualified jurist who will base his decisions on his understanding of the law.''  Similarly, Senator Heitkamp indicated that she would vote to confirm Judge Gorsuch because ``he has a record as a balanced, meticulous, and well-respected jurist who understands the rule of law.''  My colleagues have it right. A Justice should be a follower of the Constitution, not a trailblazer or an advocate. His or her role is to interpret and uphold the laws, not to create them. Judge Gorsuch understands this. He takes it seriously.  In his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Gorsuch emphasized the importance of judicial precedent and a fair approach to the law. He said: ``I come here with no agenda but one . . . to be as good and faithful a judge as I know how to be.'' Similarly, in a private meeting in my office, the judge promised to ``follow the law, wherever it may lead.''  Judge Gorsuch recognizes the pivotal but limited role that the Constitution allows judges to play in our During long days of testimony at his confirmation hearing, he made clear that while legislators answer to the people, a judge answers only to the law. At the same time, Judge Gorsuch said that he interprets his judicial oath as a promise to ``make sure that every person, poor or rich, mighty or meek, gets equal protection of the law.''  ``Equality before the law'' is Nebraska's State motto. It represents the commitment Nebraskans made 150 years ago when we entered the That principle remains strong today. It should be a cornerstone of judicial philosophy for any nominee to our Nation's highest It is why the words ``Equal Justice Under Law'' are engraved on the front of the Supreme Judge Gorsuch is dedicated to this principle. He is committed to applying the laws neutrally, equally, and fairly to all people.  Some of my Democratic colleagues are saying that Judge Gorsuch is out of the mainstream. They argue that he will not look out for the little guy. They are prepared to take the unprecedented and extreme step of filibustering this nomination. This would be the first successful totally partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court Justice in the history of the U. Let me share some of the facts about this institution. In our country's history, no Cabinet nominees have ever been denied their appointments by a Senate filibuster. In our country's history, no Federal district court judges have ever been denied their seats by a Senate filibuster.  The first time a filibuster was used to defeat a judicial nomination was for a Circuit Court judge, Miguel Estrada, who was nominated by President George Bush to the U.Court of Appeals for the DC  In our country's history, the filibuster has been invoked only to block a Supreme Court nominee. It was in 1968, and a threatened bipartisan filibuster by Republicans and Democrats prevented Associate Justice Fortas from becoming Chief Justice of the Supreme The nominee ended up withdrawing because of ethical concerns. Two sitting members of the Supreme Court were confirmed by fewer than 60 votes on an up-or-down vote, but neither one was the subject of a filibuster.  A filibuster of this nominee sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the reputation of this institution. Judge Gorsuch will make an excellent Supreme Court The American people deserve to have him on the bench.

After receiving degrees from Columbia, Harvard, and then Oxford, Judge Gorsuch went on to clerk for notable Supreme Court Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy before entering private practice.  After 10 years of private practice, Gorsuch began his career in public service as a Deputy Associate Attorney General at the U.Department of In 2006, he was nominated by President George Bush to the U.Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, and he was confirmed unanimously by the U. Let me repeat that. He was confirmed unanimously by this body. I believe that says a lot about Judge Gorsuch as a candidate. In a body that is so often divided, a candidate who can receive unanimous support is truly noteworthy.  When nominated by the President, Judge Gorsuch said: ``A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge . . . stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands.'' During his tenure on the Tenth Circuit, he has demonstrated fair and prudent judgment in his opinions.  In addition to his impressive professional background, Judge Gorsuch has roots as a westerner and will bring those roots and a much needed perspective to the Supreme Because decisions that come from the Court affect the lives of Americans from across the country, it is important that the Court be composed of Justices from different regions of the country. It is critical that our next Supreme Court Justice have a familiarity with the challenges Western and Midwestern States face, like my home State and others--issues such as States' rights, Second Amendment rights, land use disputes, and the complex relationship between State and Tribal governments. These are the everyday realities we face across this country that the Justices must deal with.  I expect many of these important issues to come before the Supreme Court in the coming months. In fact, just yesterday, the Court decided to move forward on litigation regarding former President Obama's waters of the U.rule, also known as WOTUS, which has had a significantly burdensome impact on farmers and ranchers and threatens the constitutional role of the  Judge Gorsuch's background also makes him a prominent voice for Indian As chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, I believe it is important for our next Supreme Court Justice to have a concrete record of respecting Tribal sovereignty. I was pleased to learn that he has earned the support of a number of Native-American groups, including the National Congress of American Indians and the Native American Rights  Judge Gorsuch has had a long history of handling cases that have affected Native Americans from his time on the Tenth Circuit, and he has demonstrated a consistent understanding of the unique legal principles that are involved in Federal Tribal law. The boundary between State and Tribal authorities is often ambiguous; yet Judge Gorsuch was able to bring clarity as he diligently studied the law and respected existing precedents in Tribal sovereignty.  For example, the Ute Tribe of Utah has been engaged in legal battles with the State over the State's authority to prosecute Native Americans on Tribal land. Judge Gorsuch has consistently ruled in favor of Tribal sovereignty.  In Hydro Resources v. EPA, a case in which EPA overreach was redefining the boundaries of Indian lands, Judge Gorsuch overruled the EPA's interpretation and respected the current Tribal boundaries.  For all of these reasons, I urge a ``yes'' vote on Judge Gorsuch's nomination. As the highest Court in the land, the decisions have a widespread impact on millions of  When the stakes are this high, it is necessary that we confirm someone with a sound, fair, and prudent approach to the law. I have no doubt that Judge Gorsuch is the right person for this role. I enthusiastically support his nomination, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same.

569,MURRAY,proceeding_id,topic-id,1143,"Mr.President, I come to the floor to express my deep concern about the Republicans' rush to fill the vacant Supreme Court seat and about President Trump's nominee for this critical position.  I believe one of the most solemn and consequential decisions we make as Senators is whether to support a nominee to the highest Court in the country. It is a responsibility I do not take lightly. And after careful consideration, I will be voting against the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch, and I will be opposing a cloture motion ending debate.  I come to this conclusion weighing several things. First, a Supreme Court Justice has an enormous responsibility to uphold our Constitution and defend our democracy. The Court's decision affects every citizen in every corner of this country. At times, one Justice--perhaps this nominee--may be the only thing standing between someone's rights and an executive branch that operates as though it is above the law.  That is a real concern--one I have heard over and over from people in my home State of Washington who are frightened about the direction President Trump is trying to take our country.  Since taking office about two months ago, he has demonstrated complete disregard for the law, the Constitution, and American families. He has tried to force through un-American bans on Muslim refugees and immigrants. He fired Sally Yates, an Acting Attorney General who dared to stand up to him.  It is clear this President doesn't just think he is above the law. He has, at times, shown a true disdain for it, repeatedly insulting the men and women on the bench, even telling a crowd that perhaps the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals--a court that didn't rule in his favor--should be broken up.  Now, we need an independent judiciary that can safeguard the rights of citizens against this executive branch, but with so much chaos created by this President, coupled with the cloud of an FBI investigation into him and his associates, I have no reason to trust that he or his administration are acting in the best interests of our country or our democracy, and I cannot support moving forward with his choice for the  On top of that, I am concerned about the unprecedented pace of the Judiciary Committee process, which would rush through this nominee on the fastest time line in recent history. That is pretty striking because this same committee failed to hold a single hearing on this vacancy for 12 months following Justice Scalia's passing. It refused President Obama's nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, any opportunity to be heard, which brings me to my serious concerns about this particular nominee.  I wish to start with women's access to healthcare. President Trump campaigned on promises to overturn women's constitutionally protected rights to make their own healthcare decisions, secured by the historic ruling in Roe v. This President has broken almost every promise he has made, but one he appears to be keeping, especially in selecting Judge Gorsuch, is his promise to undermine women's health and rights.  Judge Gorsuch would have taken the ruling in Hobby Lobby to allow women's bosses to decide whether or not they get birth control to an even more extreme result. His deeply conservative record suggests he can't be trusted to stand for women's constitutionally protected healthcare rights or access to care. In fact, it seems clear he will[[Page S2319]]work to weaken those rights at every opportunity.  Since day one of this Presidency, women nationwide have made it absolutely clear they do not want to go backwards, and that is something I am going to continue to fight for.  I am also going to keep fighting for our workers, and I am troubled that as a Federal judge on the Tenth Circuit, Judge Gorsuch has a clear record of siding against workers and with corporations and big businesses.  The Associated Press said his opinions were ``coldly pragmatic and they're usually in the employers' favor.''  His history of dismissing workers' safety concerns and hostility toward upholding disability rights greatly concerns me and strongly suggests that he would join conservative Justices to undermine workers' rights.  We need a Justice on the Supreme Court who will uphold workers' protections and safety and the right to organize.  I am also deeply concerned about the potential effect on children and students with disabilities.  In a number of cases, Judge Gorsuch ruled in ways that made it more difficult for them to receive the support and services they not only deserve but are entitled to under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act--our Nation's special education law. I strongly believe in this law, and I believe we should be doing everything to ensure individuals with disabilities can obtain their full potential by accessing meaningful, quality public education--certainly not the bare minimum.  It is notable that while Judge Gorsuch was testifying--actually, while he was testifying before the Judiciary Committee 2 weeks ago--the Supreme Court unanimously rejected his prior ruling in a case involving the rights of a student with disabilities to receive a meaningful education. It is highly troubling that when it comes to policies concerning torture, Gorsuch--as a member of President George Bush's Justice Department--advocated that the President has broad powers to basically ignore parts of the legal ban on torture.  This deference to Executive power is concerning, to say the least, but it also makes a whole lot more sense as to why Judge Gorsuch would be Donald Trump's 1 choice.  His testimony before the Judiciary Committee regarding Citizens United, in which he incorrectly stated that the Court left Congress the ability to enact commonsense campaign spending limits, strengthens my decision to vote no.  So if you believe in transparency in our elections and upholding the integrity of our democracy or you believe we need a Justice who will protect the rights of all Americans and stand with them and not with President Trump and millionaires and billionaires, this choice is clear.  As I have urged my colleagues for weeks, with so much chaos in the administration and so many questions now surrounding this President's commitment to the rule of law: Slow down. Stop playing political games. Respect the families we represent. Respect the separation of power, and stop trying to jam this nominee through.  Whatever you do, do not blow up the Senate rules for Supreme Court nominees. Invoking the nuclear option is a dangerous path to go down.  I have been in the majority and I have been in the minority. Either way, I believe when it comes to a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court, the Senate must adhere to a higher standard and the 60-vote threshold. If you can't get that many votes for a Supreme Court nominee, you don't need to change the rules, you need to change the nominee.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt2-PgS2309.txt
570,LEAHY,proceeding_id,topic-id,5987,"Mr.President, first I wish to commend the senior Senator from Washington State for her terrific statement.  I know, as a member of the Judiciary Committee, that we reported the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch by the narrowest margin--a party-line vote. The majority leader then filed cloture to cut off debate on this nominee. He has shown that he will use whatever tactic is necessary to ensure this nominee is confirmed, no matter the concern of Senators or millions of other  Today is just the 75th day of the Trump administration. After only 75 days of having a Republican-controlled White House and Congress, the Republican leader has promised to vitiate the historic rights of the minority in this institution. He is prepared to abdicate the Senate's constitutional duty to serve as a check on the President and our responsibility to protect the independence of the Federal judiciary, all in the service of Donald Trump's agenda and because, as we know, Donald Trump asked him to.  Senate Republicans seek to justify their tactics by claiming that Democrats would do no different were the shoe on the other foot. They are free to make that argument, but it is wrong. There is one claim in particular that I need to address. Some Republicans have asserted that, if President Bush had made a Supreme Court nomination in 2008, the final year of his term, Democrats would have pocket filibustered that nomination the same way that Senate Republicans did to Chief Judge Merrick Well, I was the chairman of the Judiciary Committee during that time, and I can assure them that they are wrong. Democrats did not invent an election year exception to the Look no further than when a Democratic-led Senate confirmed Justice Kennedy during a Presidential election year.  If President Bush had made a Supreme Court nomination in 2008, that nominee would have had a hearing, and all Senators would have had the opportunity to debate that nomination on the floor. As Senator Hatch and I wrote in 2001, ``The Judiciary Committee's traditional practice has been to report Supreme Court nominees to the Senate once the Committee has completed its consideration. This has been true even in cases where Supreme Court nominees were opposed by a majority of the Judiciary Committee.'' This Senator would not have disregarded precedent and constitutional obligation because of partisan politics. Whether such a nominee would have been confirmed would have depended on his or her views, but the nominee would have been given a fair process, which Senate Republicans denied Chief Judge Garland when they pocket filibustered him.  My record in 2008 shows that I treated President Bush's nominees fairly. We confirmed 28 circuit and district nominees in 2008, including 10 in 1 day, just weeks before the election, and reduced the number of judicial vacancies to just 34. Compare that to 2016, when Senate Republicans allowed just nine circuit and district nominees to be confirmed in total. That is less than 33 percent of the 2008 number. Moreover, Republicans' pocket filibusters, even for nominees supported by home State Republican Senators, allowed the number of judicial vacancies to skyrocket over 100. Of course, they had done the same thing at the end of the Clinton administration, pocket filibustering more than 60 nominees. Those are the facts. Anyone who claims that judicial nominees were never obstructed before 2001 has conveniently forgotten those facts.  When Senate Democrats changed the cloture rule for lower court nominations in 2013, we did so reluctantly and only after Senate Republicans repeatedly abused Senate rules to wage in unparalleled obstruction of President Obama's nominees over a period of years. By November 2013, the Republican leader had orchestrated an unprecedented number of filibusters, including requiring cloture motions on 34 circuit and district nominees in less than 5 years--compared to 18 nominees who faced cloture motions during the entire 8-year tenure of President  When it comes to judicial nominations, the filibuster has been a tool to protect the independence of our courts by compelling Presidents to find mainstream, consensus nominees who do not bring an agenda with their lifetime appointments to our courts. Senate Democrats filibustered a small number of President George Bush's nominees, but it was not because they were conservative, or had been nominated by a Republican It was because we had serious doubts about their ability to put partisanship and ideology aside and be fair, neutral judges. Or it was because the President had ignored the traditional role of home State Senators when selecting the nominee. We confirmed numerous[[Page S2320]]conservative nominees, including Judge Neil In fact, during the 41 months that I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee while President Bush was in office, the Democratic-majority Senate confirmed more circuit and district nominees than were confirmed during the 55 months when Republicans held the majority.  When President Obama took office, Senate Republicans imposed a new standard. Just 2 days after he was sworn in, a group of extreme conservative activists instructed Senator McConnell to treat President Obama's judicial nominees in an ``unprecedented'' way, and that is what he did. For the first time, even noncontroversial district court nominees were subject to filibusters--Leader Reid was at one time forced to file for cloture on 17 of them in a single day because of Republican obstruction, even though none were particularly controversial and many actually had the support of their home State Republican  Republicans filibustered judicial nominees they ultimately supported. They stalled Senate action for weeks and months on judicial nominees who they did not oppose and who they ultimately voted to confirm once their filibusters ended. Senate Republicans kept making up new excuses for filibustering nominees that had nothing to do with the nominees themselves. They abused the Thurmond Rule to filibuster Judge Robert Bacharach, even though he had been reported almost unanimously and was supported by his two very conservative Republican home State It was obstruction for obstruction's sake.  But the final straw was when Republicans blockaded the DC The Senate had confirmed four of President Bush's nominees to that court, but only one of President Obama's five nominees. When Senate Republicans filibustered President Obama's last three DC Circuit nominees in late 2013, they barely even bothered to pretend to find fault with the nominees themselves. These were mainstream nominees with broad support. Their only alleged flaw was that they had been nominated by President Senate Republicans unilaterally decided that President Obama should not get to make additional nominations to that court, effectively trying to nullify the results of the 2012 election--a prelude to their unprecedented treatment of Chief Judge Merrick  Compare that to the situation we are in this week. We are told that we must rubberstamp Judge Gorsuch or the majority leader will change the rules. Now, some may remember reports from last year where several Senators promised to blockade any Supreme Court nominations by one of the Presidential candidates if that candidate won the election. Of course, those were Republican Senators talking about Secretary But that proposed blockade is not what is happening here. The fact is that there is a vacancy on the Supreme Court, and that vacancy should be filled with a qualified, mainstream judge. I know that a Republican President would probably make a different selection than the one I would make, but I have always been willing to consult with Presidents of both parties to find mainstream, consensus nominees. That is my constitutional obligation as a  Now, all Presidents, including President Trump, are entitled to have their Supreme Court nominees considered on the merits. Over my 42 years in the Senate, I have evaluated every nominee on the merits, and I have never gone to reflexive partisanship. In fact, I have voted to confirm six Supreme Court nominees of Republican I do not know if there is any Republican in this Senate who could say that about nominees of Democratic  Although I had concerns that Judge Gorsuch would bring a partisan agenda to the Court, I went to his hearing with an open mind. I had hoped he could convince me that he was a conservative I could support, as I did Chief Justice I voted for Chief Justice Roberts not because I thought I would always agree with him--and I do not--but because I was able to take him at his word that he did not have an ideological agenda. I cannot take Judge Gorsuch's word that same way.  It is no secret that Judge Gorsuch is very conservative--that much was evident back in 2006 when he was confirmed to the Tenth Back then, he did not have a judicial record, but he gave answers that were reassuring. He discussed the importance of following precedent and of judicial restraint and deference to He said, ``Precedent is to be respected and honored. It is not something to be diminished or demeaned. It is something you should try to uphold wherever you can, with the objective being, follow the law as written and not replace it with my own preferences, or anyone else's.'' He explained that judges should not be ideologues who disregard precedent ``to effect [their] own personal views, [their] politics, [their] personal preferences.'' Well, I wish that same judge were before us today, but he is not.  Judge Gorsuch has a fine resume. I do not take issue with the qualifications on paper, but my concern is that he has not lived up to his own standard. I am concerned that his personal views and his politics have permeated throughout his judicial philosophy. That is, in fact, the reason why his nomination is before us today.  To know what kind of a Justice Judge Gorsuch would be, we have to understand why he was chosen. President Trump made very clear right from the beginning that he had a litmus test: Anyone he nominated to the Supreme Court would automatically overturn Roe v. Then-candidate Trump proceeded to outsource the selection process to far-right interest groups. The leader of that unprecedented vetting process admitted they were not driven by ``Who's a really smart lawyer and who has been really accomplished?'' but by a search for someone ``who understands these things like we do.''  Let us be clear. These are not groups that support independent judges who act with restraint. These groups search for nominees who will skew the courts, who will call to reject precedent, and who will further their partisan agenda. And they gave President Trump a list and said: Here, you are allowed to pick from our people. If these groups sought a mainstream, widely respected, and independent jurist, they would have been as supportive as I was of Chief Judge Merrick Instead, they funneled money to push Senate Republicans to hold Chief Judge Garland's nomination hostage and to have the Senate defy the Constitution of the United States for the first time ever in not allowing advice and consent.  The Federalist Society's purpose statement, which is on their website, calls for ``reordering priorities within the legal system to place a premium on,'' among other things, ``traditional values.'' These groups and the billionaire donors who fund them have a clear agenda--one that is antichoice, antienvironment, and procorporate. I am not one to gamble, but in my mind they would not have gambled with millions of dollars on Judge They chose and invested in him for a reason. They are supremely confident he shares their far-right agenda. So is the White  The White House Chief of Staff has said that Judge Gorsuch ``has the vision of Donald Trump.'' He said that, with this nomination, ``We're talking about a change of potentially 40 years of law.'' It is clear that the people who vetted Judge Gorsuch do not want a nominee who will ``call balls and strikes.'' They want a nominee who will expand the strike zone to the detriment of hard-working We should all find that concerning.  At his public hearing, Judge Gorsuch did nothing to allay my concerns. In fact, he solidified them. I cannot recall a nominee refusing to answer such basic questions about the principles underlying our These were fundamental questions that we should ask every nominee seeking a lifetime appointment to our Highest Court, but Judge Gorsuch would not answer. Some of the questions that I asked him were not intended to be difficult. Several could have been answered by any first-year law student, with ease; yet, unless we were asking about fishing or basketball, Judge Gorsuch stonewalled and avoided any substantive response. He was excruciatingly evasive. His sworn testimony and his approach to complying with the Judiciary Committee's historic role in the confirmation process was, in my view, patronizing.  Judge Gorsuch claimed that he did not want to prejudge potential cases.[[Page S2321]]That is a valid concern, but only within reason. It should not be used to evade questions on long-settled precedent or on the meaning and purpose of constitutional provisions. Judge Gorsuch would not even state whether he agreed with certain landmark Supreme Court cases such as Brown v. Board of He refused to say whether he believes that the Equal Protection Clause applies to women. He refused to say whether the framers of the First Amendment believed it permitted the use of a religious litmus test. He refused to provide information regarding his selection by extreme special interest groups and a billionaire businessman. And he even refused to confirm whether he would continue to recuse himself from matters involving that billionaire--as he has done on the Tenth Circuit--even if presented with the exact same facts.  Other Supreme Court nominees have been far more forthcoming. When asked whether he agreed with important precedents, then-Judge Alito answered the questions. When I asked then-Judge Roberts whether Congress has war powers, he said, ``Of course. The Constitution specifically gives that power [to declare war] to Congress.'' I asked whether Congress has the power to stop a war, and he said, ``Congress certainly has the power of the purse,'' but added, ``as a judge, I would obviously be in a position of considering both arguments, the argument for the Legislature and the argument for the The argument on the Executive side will rely on authority as Commander in Chief, and whatever authorities derive from that.'' It was perhaps not the answer I would have liked, but he certainly engaged with the question and showed that he understood the issue in a way that did not prejudge any potential case.  I later asked then-Judge Roberts whether ``Congress can make rules that may impinge upon the President's command functions.'' He responded: ``Certainly, The point that Justice Jackson is making there is that the Constitution vests pertinent authority in these areas in both branches. The President is the Commander in Chief, and that meant something to the On the other hand, as you just quoted, Congress has the authority to issue regulations governing the Armed Forces, another express provision in the Those two can conflict if by making regulations for the Armed Forces, Congress does something that interferes with, in the President's view, his command authority, and in some cases those disputes will be resolved in Court, as they were in the Youngstown case.'' Whether one agrees with it or not, that was a substantive answer.  I asked Judge Gorsuch a similar question in writing--whether he agreed that ``the Constitution provides Congress its own war powers and Congress may exercise these powers to restrict the President--even in a time of war'' as the Court held in Hamdan v. Here is the totality of his response: ``I agree that Hamdan v. Rumsfeld recognized limitations on the power of the It is a precedent of the Supreme Court entitled to all the weight due such a precedent.'' Perhaps that is better than no response at all, but not by much.  When I asked Judge Gorsuch a straightforward question about whether the Framers of the First Amendment believed it permitted the use of a religious litmus test, he refused to answer. Any first-year law student knows the answer to that one.  I asked then-Judge Roberts a similar question--whether he would reject Korematsu and hold it unconstitutional to intern U.residents who ``have a particular nationality or ethnic or religious group.'' He said: ``I suppose a case like that could come before the I would be surprised to see it, and I would be surprised if there were any arguments that could support it.'' I do not think he prejudged any cases, but he was still able to provide a real answer to a basic question--and he earned my support.  I had hoped that, if Judge Gorsuch was not willing to be transparent for the lights and cameras, he would at least answer written questions--given time to carefully craft answers. Again, he declined. He refused to expressly acknowledge that Congress has war powers, even though we know we do. Every high school student knows that the Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war. He again misstated the holding of Citizens United in an attempt to evade my question about Congress's ability to enact campaign finance legislation. He provided no answer at all to questions regarding the Supreme Court's decision in Shelby County to gut the Voting Rights Act or about women's rights to obtain contraception. And, again, he refused to answer whether the First Amendment prohibits the President from imposing a religious test, even when the Trump administration has adamantly claimed such a litmus test is not at issue with his travel ban.  Previous nominees respected the Judiciary Committee's constitutional role by answering questions in a substantive way, not with mere platitudes. The difference is clear to As an editorial in the Rutland Herald put it:       Gorsuch's affable muteness sent a message: I am above the      people and their concerns. I have no responsibility to anyone      but the narrow band of millionaires and ideologues who have      advanced my nomination and to the President who has declared      war on the American government.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks the full editorial.  Judge Gorsuch claimed that his personal views do not matter so he would not share them. But that did not stop him from speaking at length about overcriminalization and arguing that there are too many Federal criminal laws and regulations. Those of us on the Judiciary Committee know this is a substantive and controversial policy issue that has been vigorously debated in recent years. I have to wonder why this was the only issue where he put forward his actual views. That is not good enough for me. As the article by Garrett Epps in the Atlantic put it, Judge Gorsuch's refusal to answer questions implied that the role of a judge is ``a job which calls, apparently, for neither values nor any firm connection to human life as it is lived.'' The American people know better.  All of this matters because court decisions, especially Supreme Court decisions, are not simply detached applications of neutral principles. If there were, all judges would reach the same results. They do not. Legal decisions are not mechanical. They are matters of interpretation and, often, matters of justice. One Supreme Court Justice said more than a century ago: ``When we take our seats on the bench we are not struck with blindness, and forbidden to know as judges what we see as men.''  Whether he will acknowledge it or not, Judge Gorsuch's record says a lot about his judgment and his sense of justice. In a policy role at the Justice Department, he embraced broad and discredited assertions of Executive power. Judge Gorsuch once complained about liberals relying on the courts to vindicate their constitutional rights, but, once on the bench, he had no problem rubberstamping the far right's social agenda when he ruled that employers could control their employees' access to contraception. As a judge, he twisted statutory language to limit the rights of workers, of women, and children with disabilities.  Judge Gorsuch also reached for broad constitutional questions that were not before him in order to advance his agenda. Just last summer, Judge Gorsuch wrote a concurrence to his own opinion in a case called Gutierrez-Brizuela v. His unanimous panel opinion decided the case on narrow grounds. But Judge Gorsuch nevertheless wrote a separate concurrence to argue that the Chevron doctrine should be overturned. The Chevron doctrine not only forms the basis for our modern government, but it is well-settled law and has been for decades. As Emily Bazelon and Eric Posner wrote in the New York Times, ``The administrative state isn't optional in our complex society. It's indispensable.''  Judge Gorsuch's rejection of that has shown that he is not a mainstream nominee. His judicial record demonstrates a partisan agenda--a hostility toward our government's power to enact environmental, labor, consumer rights, and other regulations that keep hard-working Americans safe and ensure a level playing field--not just for the wealthy few, but for all hard-working Americans.[[Page S2322]]  Between not answering questions, Judge Gorsuch spoke repeatedly about the limited role that judges play in our democracy. His actual record belies that claim. I think that is precisely why these extreme-right interests groups selected Judge That is why the President's Chief of Staff promised he will bring a change of 40 years of law, and that is why I cannot support this nomination.  It is for this nominee that Senate Republicans have brought us to this precipice, but perhaps we should not be surprised. Republican leadership has sought to govern only by simple majority since day 1 of the Trump administration. They paraded before the Senate the most extreme and partisan slate of Cabinet nominees I have ever seen. Their signature legislative goal--to repeal the Affordable Care Act--collapsed under the weight of their own intraparty infighting. Then, they dusted off the Congressional Review Act and, by party-line votes, rolled back more than a dozen environmental, workplace, privacy, healthcare, and transparency protections--all over the objections of the minority.  Think about that. Republicans have not sought compromise on anything in this That is not the way to govern. To give you one example, they repealed an important internet privacy rule that protected Americans' online activity. That means that by party-line vote, hard-working Americans will now see their private internet activity sold to the highest bidder for greater corporate profits. They are allowing these companies to basically come in and spy in your house because they are making money.  But Senate Republicans didn't stop there. They rolled back protections to ensure that all students have the same educational opportunities. They eliminated rules requiring employers to maintain records of workplace injuries so employers could avoid accountability. In other words, if you have major injuries, you do not have to keep a record of that to make sure nobody knows this is a dangerous place to work. They rolled back rules holding coal companies accountable for their pollution. Most recently, Republicans undermined healthcare access for millions of Americans, rolling back protections under the title X program. In underserved communities and rural areas like Vermont, title X is critical in making sure women have access to the basic healthcare they need.  But that is what one-party rule gets you. They are great at looking out for corporate interests. They struggle at looking out for the interests of hard-working The irony of it all is that even these partisan efforts have been too partisan for some Three times this year--the most of any Vice President since 1911--Vice President Pence was forced to make the trip to Capitol Hill to break a tie and ensure some of these extreme measures passed.  With the Gorsuch nomination, Republicans are proving they have no interest in playing by the rules; they prefer to break them. The unprecedented obstruction of Chief Judge Merrick Garland is going to be a permanent stain on this body. But then, days after the 2016 election--after Republicans turned their back on the Constitution for a whole year, even though they had sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution, which calls for advice and consent, they refused to advise and consent and have a vote on Chief Judge Merrick Garland--Republican leaders threatened to change the rules to get their own nominee through--before we even had a name. After disregarding his constitutional obligations for nearly a year, the majority leader now tells us we must rubberstamp President Trump's nominee or he will forever damage the  It is interesting that the majority leader's argument for obstructing Chief Judge Merrick Garland was that the American people needed to weigh in on this decision, as if they had not weighed in when they reelected President Obama in 2012. But when the American people did vote last November, nearly 3 million more of them chose Secretary Clinton over Donald In fact, Ezra Klein had it right 2 months ago when he wrote that this nomination ``makes a mockery of the popular will.''  Mr.President, I ask unanimous that the article, ``The country deserves a compromise Supreme Court nominee. Neil Gorsuch isn't one,'' by Ezra Klein, also be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  Because of the divergence between the popular and electoral vote, Klein argued, ``This is a time, if ever there was one, for a compromise nominee, and Gorsuch is not a compromise nominee.'' This is exactly what the 60-vote threshold is for. It helps ensure that Presidents consult with Senators of both parties and find mainstream, consensus nominees. The filibuster protects the rights of the minority and of individual Senators; it protects the constitutional role of the Senate, and it helps us protect the independence of the Supreme The Court is no place for someone with a radical, partisan agenda.  Senate Republicans are defending their threat to change the rules by claiming that Judge Gorsuch is essentially a perfect nominee and that, if Democrats filibuster Judge Gorsuch, then we would filibuster anyone. That is nonsense. We have asked only for a mainstream nominee. Perhaps they are confusing our approach with their blockade of Chief Judge Unlike committee Republicans' treatment of Chief Judge Merrick Garland, I take my constitutional duty to independently evaluate a President's Supreme Court nominees seriously. As I have said, my votes on Supreme Court nominations have never been about reflexive partisanship. I have evaluated every nominee on the merits--and I have voted to confirm six Supreme Court nominees of Republican  If the Senate does not vote to end debate on this nomination, that is a judgment on defects of this nominee. I remind the Republicans that they do have a choice here. We can work together with President Trump to find a mainstream, consensus nominee. I expect that an actual mainstream nominee would be confirmed easily, even if nominated by President Recall the process President Obama used when he selected Chief Judge Merrick He sought advice from both Republican and Democratic Members of Congress and was told this was a person who would get a solid majority vote. He said: ``We have reached out to every member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to constitutional scholars, to advocacy groups, to bar associations, representing an array of interests and opinions from all across the spectrum.'' President Obama nominated somebody who, in normal times, would have gotten the vast majority of votes of Republicans and If President Trump would have followed that template, we would not be in this extraordinary place.  Let me conclude with this. In the committee, I said I respect this institution as much as anyone. I have been here for more than 42 years. I have devoted myself to the good the Senate can accomplish. We 100 Senators stand in the shoes of 320 million We should be the conscience of the First and foremost, we must do what is right by 320 million And I am not going to vote solely to protect an institution when the rights of hard-working Americans are at risk. It is for these reasons that I must oppose this nomination.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Rutland Herald, 5, 2017]                             No to Gorsuch       Senate Democrats are prepared to block the appointment of      Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, and the Republican      majority is prepared to change the Senate rules to push the      appointment through anyway.       Patrick Leahy and Bernie Sanders are willing to      filibuster the Gorsuch nomination, offended by the      candidate's evasiveness and alarmed by his ideological      rigidity. Mounting a filibuster comes at a cost, however.      Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the      Republicans would rewrite the Senate rules in order to      prohibit the use of a filibuster to block Supreme Court      nominees. As it stands the Republicans would need 60 votes to      shut down debate; if the Republicans change the rules,      Gorsuch would need only 51 votes to gain confirmation.       Elimination of the filibuster on high court nominations      worries some But what do they have to lose? If      they give in to McConnell they will have retained the right      to filibuster but would have lost the power to exercise it.      Instead, they would have surrendered to one of the most      egregious power grabs in the nation's history, allowing the      Republicans to place their stamp on the judiciary in order to      impose an agenda on the nation that the nation has shown no      indication it supports.[[Page S2323]]       The Republican campaign to seize dominance of the judiciary      must be seen as an effort by narrow interest groups to force      measures into the law that the American people would never      allow the legislative branch to advance. In order to pursue      this agenda, the Republicans have resorted to a contemptuous      assault on the role of Congress as the body that must consent      to judicial appointments.       The refusal of the Republicans to allow even a hearing on      President Barack Obama's appointment of Merrick Garland to      the Supreme Court showed that they were willing to scoff at      their own constitutional obligations in service of their      ideological and economic loyalties.       Gorsuch's refusal to answer even the most basic questions      about his thinking was an expression of the same contempt for      Congress that McConnell displayed in refusing to allow a      hearing for Gorsuch's affable muteness sent a      message: I am above the people and their concerns. I have no      responsibility to anyone but the narrow band of millionaires      and ideologues who have advanced my nomination and to the      president who has declared war on the American government.       Much is at stake with the Gorsuch nomination. His own      rulings suggest he adheres to a view that the high court went      astray in the 1930s in decisions allowing the federal      government to give rule-making power to agencies established      to protect workers, consumers, investors, air, water, the      purity of food and drugs. There is a cohort of extreme      conservatives--President Donald Trump's adviser Steve Bannon      is their godfather--who have declared that they want to      destroy the ``administrative state.'' Gorsuch's rulings and      his refusal to describe his thinking suggest he is one of      them.       The filibuster is an antidemocratic tradition in the Senate      that allows a minority to block action by refusing to end      debate on a measure. It is usually defended as a means to      demand from senators comity and a willingness to join with      the other side to find middle-of-the road solutions. In      normal times, the majority would nominate a centrist justice      in order to draw support from both sides so that the minority      would not see the need to mount a successful filibuster.       But these are not normal times. The Republicans have      succeeded in getting their way by refusing to compromise, and      they will continue to get their way until the Democrats stand      up to them. McConnell may ditch the filibuster this time, but      he may rue the day after the people revolt against the      disaster of the Trump administration and elect a Democratic            Leahy and Sanders are taking a necessary and principled      stand against the Republican effort to steal a seat on the      Supreme The Democrats may not win this battle, but      they are on the right side.                                  ____                       [From Vox, 3, 2017.] The Country Deserves a Compromise Supreme Court Neil Gorsuch                                Isn't                            (By Ezra Klein)       The problem with Neil Gorsuch's nomination for the Supreme      Court is not Neil He is, by all accounts, a      brilliant jurist and a kind man. But he is an extremely      conservative judge at a moment when an extremely conservative      judge makes a mockery of the popular will. For the good of      the country and the Court, this moment demands a compromise      nominee, and Gorsuch is not that.       Antonin Scalia's seat came open under a Democratic      president and a Republican This should have led to a      centrist nominee. And President Barack Obama tried to offer      one: Merrick Garland, who had previously been suggested for      the Court by Republican Orrin Republicans did not      oppose They refused to consider him, or anyone else,      for the opening. They insisted that no opening on the Court      could be filled in an election year--an absurd faux principle      which implies that vacancies on the Court must be left      unfilled fully 50 percent of the time.       Having blocked efforts to replace Scalia under Obama,      Republicans were relieved when Trump won the Electoral      But Democrats decisively won the popular vote and      gained seats in the I do not want to overstate this:      US elections are not decided by simply tallying up votes. But      though the public will doesn't decide elections, it should      still weigh on those who hold power. This is a time for a      center-right nominee, just as Obama put forward a center-left      nominee in       The choice is all the more important because the Supreme      Court is, itself, a strange and undemocratic institution. It      is insulated from popular opinion, and judges serve for life.      Forcing it unnaturally out of step with the public is bad for      both the Court and the country.       Senate Democrats have the power to filibuster nominees to      the Supreme I don't agree with those who think      Democrats should filibuster anyone who isn't Garland, as      Jeff Merkley is threatening. But Democrats should insist on a      compromise nominee--it would be wise of them to offer a      realistic list of more centrist candidates--and use the      filibuster to give their position teeth.       It's true that Republicans could eliminate the filibuster      with only 51 votes, but it's not clear why that's relevant.      If the Supreme Court filibuster will be eliminated the moment      it's used, then it's a fiction, and there's little cost to      seeing it unmasked as such. If Republicans would prefer to      destroy the filibuster than make any accommodation to the      majority of voters who wanted a Democratic president to be      making this pick, then that's their prerogative--at least the      Democrats' base will know their legislators did their best.      Democrats need not be in the business of protecting a      filibuster they cannot use.       It's a mistake to see Supreme Court nominations as about      the individual's resume rather than the country's wishes. If      the question is whether Gorsuch is qualified to be on the      Court, of course he is. But that's not the question. The      question is whether Gorsuch should be on the Court--whether      he is the right pick for this moment, and for the decades in      which he's likely to serve. He is not.       Republicans lost the popular vote in the presidential      election preceding Scalia's death. They lost the popular vote      in the presidential election after Scalia's death. The will      of the people might not be all that matters in politics, but      nor should it be meaningless. This is a time, if ever there      was one, for a compromise nominee, and Gorsuch is not a      compromise nominee. Republicans do not need to nominate a      liberal, but Democrats should insist they nominate a justice      more in the mold of Anthony Kennedy than       The Supreme Court is undemocratic enough as it is. It does      not need to be made more so.  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt2-PgS2309.txt

573,FEINSTEIN,proceeding_id,topic-id,2407,"Mr.President, I rise today as the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee to speak about the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court of the United  In committee, at the outset of the hearings, I remarked that our job was not to evaluate legal doctrines and theories or to review Judge Gorsuch's record in a vacuum. Our job is to assess how this nominee's decisions will affect the American people and whether he will protect the legal and constitutional rights of all  I have had this in mind throughout the entire process. Let me begin with an aside. I represent a large State, and I do pay close attention to constituent letters, calls, and emails. A weekly report lets me know on what issues people are focused and what they think. I take this feedback very seriously.  In general, my barometer has been that when I receive over 30,000 calls, emails, or letters, that is when I know an issue is reasonably meaningful to many people in the To be clear, I don't base my final judgment on any issue or nominee solely on the numbers of calls and letters I receive. However, this is a representative democracy. I find this to be an important measure of what California constituents are thinking.  When it comes to this nomination so far, my office has received a total of 112,309 calls, emails, and letters from California constituents; and 92,799, or 83, percent, oppose this nominee and 19,510, or 17 percent, support this nominee.  Let me read a few of the emails. One constituent from Silverado, CA, wrote:       ``In 1971, when abortion was illegal, I was forced to have      a child at age 16. That was 46 years ago. With Gorsuch, we      would step back into that world where women and girls have NO      choice but an illegal and unsafe abortion OR become a mother.      It is wrong. The choice is untenable and dangerous.      Filibuster Gorsuch and do whatever it takes.''  I was a college student in the 1950s, and I remember very much what life was like before a woman had the right to privacy, to control her reproductive system according to Roe v.  Another constituent from San Diego emailed:       ``As a beneficiary of the right to marry 3\1/2\ years ago,      I personally understand how important Supreme Court decisions      are. I also attended a segregated elementary school when I      was a little boy. I do not trust that Neil Gorsuch would      advocate for the best interests of women & minorities. Please      do not confirm him.''  A woman from Richmond, CA, wrote:       ``I believe that we, the people, will have a difficult time      getting fair and equal treatment with Gorsuch being on the      Supreme He will help the rich corporations, and the      poor and middle-class will suffer irreparably.''  I don't comment on any of these because none of these are sacrosanct, but they are opinions.  Brandon Gregg from Burlingame wrote:[[Page S2324]]         ``The republicans did not give Merrick Garland a hearing,      instead waiting until Trump could propose a young right-     leaning judge who will take our country backwards. Gorsuch      will not advance the agenda of human rights within our      Constitution, but will plunge us back into the past where      minorities had little protection, women did not have equal      rights, people of color were denied the right to vote, and      protections for all people that we take for granted, did not      exist. This is not the world I want for myself, my children,      or my grandchildren. Filibuster Gorsuch's confirmation.      Please.''  The bottom line is that Californians are letting me know loud and clear that who sits on the Supreme Court matters. Unfortunately, up to now, much of the press coverage on this nomination has been about politics and process.  In contrast, little has been said about how the Supreme Court affects the lives of Americans, their families, and their communities. So, let me say, in the past 24 years that I have been a member of the Judiciary Committee, I have seen that the Supreme Court is, in fact, the last word in so many areas: the personal rights of all Americans, including whom they can marry, and whether women have the right to privacy that allows them to control their own bodies.  The Supreme Court determines whether decisions about healthcare will be determined by families or businesses. The Supreme Court has the final say on whether States and localities will be able to pass laws that make it harder for low-income people, people of color, seniors and students to vote. The Supreme Court will decide whether corporations are able to pollute our air and water with impunity.  It is the Supreme Court that will be the final world on Executive authority, whether it is used to waterboard, detain individuals indefinitely, or overreach in other ways.  Each year, more than 350,000 civil and criminal cases are filed in Federal courts. The Supreme Court hears arguments for only about 80 cases a session and makes decisions on approximately 50 more cases without hearing arguments.  Now, this means the Supreme Court only hears a very small percentage of cases--less than 0.02 percent.  Before the current vacancy, the most significant questions were closely decided by 5-to-4 decisions, with five votes coming from Republican-appointed  These include important decisions that affect our elections, like Shelby County and Citizens United, decisions that weakened the power of average voters by expanding the role of dark money and gutting a key provision of the Voting Rights We also saw a 5-to-4 decision in Heller that overturned 70 years of precedent on the Second Amendment and blocked the District of Columbia's commonsense gun regulations.  As my colleague Senator Whitehouse outlined in the Judiciary Committee, in the last several years, this Supreme Court has issued an additional 11 5-to-4 decisions that promote the rights of corporations over the rights of everyday people, on topics as wide-ranging as age discrimination and harassment to limiting access to courts and juries.  So who sits on the Supreme Court matters. Just look at some of the key cases that have come down since this vacancy arose last year. For example, the Supreme Court deadlocked 4-to-4 on a case to determine whether unions are able to fight for fair pay and benefits for all workers by requiring them to contribute to a union's action on their behalf.  We know this issue will go back to the Supreme If, next time the Court rules against unions like the California Teachers Association, it will be overturning a 40-year precedent known as ``agency shop,'' and it will permit an assault on worker's rights.  Also last year, the Supreme Court considered the case on North Carolina's law that reduced early voting days, eliminated same-day registration, and established new restrictive photo ID requirements to vote. The Fourth Circuit struck down North Carolina's law concluding it had ``targeted African Americans with almost surgical precision.'' Yet, when the Supreme Court considered it, they deadlocked 4 to 4. Who sits on that court matters.  After 4 days of hearings and reviewing Judge Gorsuch's record, we have learned that he, indeed, has strong views of what the law should be and how it should be interpreted. While Judge Gorsuch was not responsive to many questions, he did tell us that he is happy to be called an originalist, and that he embraced the term. He also stated that he believes judges should look to the original public meaning of the Constitution when they decide what one of its provision mean.  According to him, ``the Constitution isn't some ink blot on which litigants may project their hopes and dreams. . . . but a carefully crafted text judges are charged with applying according to its original public meaning.''  Original public meaning--that takes us back to 13 colonies, 4 million Americans, and 1789. I find this originalist judicial philosophy to be deeply troubling. It essentially means that judges and courts should evaluate all of our constitutional rights and privileges as they were understood in 1789. To freeze our understanding of the Constitution in 1789, I think, ignores the Framer's intent. But more importantly, it would ignore the vibrancy and growth of our  We are no longer a society that condones slavery. We no longer permit segregation. We do not allow child labor. We recognize that women not only deserve an education but can be leaders in business, government, and their homes.  We cannot turn the clock back 230 years.  As Justice Brennan said, asking judges to resolve legal questions by looking only to what people believed when our country was founded was ``little more than arrogance cloaked as humility'' that ``while proponents of this facile historicism justify it as the depoliticization of the judiciary, the political underpinnings of such a choice should not escape notice.'' After all, ``[t]hose who would restrict [legal claims] to the values of 1789 specifically articulated in the Constitution turn a blind eye to social pro-gress. . . .''  This is Justice Brennan's speech in 1985 at Georgetown This is an important point that I think bears repeating. A judge's decision to adopt an originalist philosophy is inherently political because it discounts the expansion of constitutional protections beyond White men who owned property. Yes, that is the way it was back then.  The U.Constitution, I deeply believe, is a living document intended to evolve as our country evolves. We are not supposed to ignore social progress, and I don't believe the Founders of our country ever intended us to do so.  Another concern with Judge Gorsuch's record is his extreme, conservative view of the Federal For example, he has indicated he believes the longstanding legal doctrine that allows agencies to write rules to effectively implement laws should be overturned. That doctrine, as the Presiding Officer well knows, is the Chevron doctrine. It was discussed in committee.  Chevron was itself a unanimous opinion authored by the liberal Justice Stevens and joined by conservatives, including Chief Justice This legal doctrine has been in place for decades and has been cited more than 15,000 times. If Chevron is overturned, as Judge Gorsuch has advocated, many important laws that Congress has passed would become ineffective.  I want to give a personal example.  In 2007, Senator Olympia Snowe and I finally passed legislation, thanks to Senator Ted Stevens and Dan Inouye, to increase the mileage efficiency of cars. This was critical to address because pollution was clouding up our cities, and it was important to improve the functioning of our automobiles.  Our legislation required the Department of Transportation to set standards so that fuel economy would increase at least 10 miles per gallon over 10 years--that is the time we could foresee--and continue to rise after that. We instructed the agency to achieve the ``maximum feasible average fuel economy'' and directed the Secretary of Transportation to consider ``technological feasibility, economic practicality, the effect of other motor vehicle standards of the government on fuel economy, and the need of the United States to conserve energy.'' That is directly from the bill.  Here is the result. It has just been announced that this program will raise fuel economy to more than 50-miles per[[Page S2325]]gallon by 2025. I think the specifics were 54 miles to the gallon.  This would have been impossible in 2007 when we were trying to pass the bill. We could not possibly understand, 10 years hence, technical details of specific automobile efficiency technologies and how they would develop in the decades to come.  Federal agencies simply must play a role. We need their technical expertise and ongoing involvement to ensure the legislation we pass is implemented effectively--as intended by  In committee, I discussed Judge Gorsuch's textualist view. This means that he believes statutes should be interpreted only by ``the plain meaning of the language.''  Combined, this judicial philosophy includes: One, limiting laws and statues to a dictionary definition that he selected. Two, reversing precedent to say that agencies can't interpret ambiguous laws. Three, reinstating a legal doctrine to further limit agency experts. Taken together, these three points would require Congress to pass bills so that they are either so specific that they would be very limited in effect or so broad they would actually be meaningless.  For example, Senator Collins and I have been working on legislation that would require the FDA to ensure the safety of personal care products such as we all use--shampoo, deodorant, cosmetics, shaving creams, lotions. The FDA does not do it in this country, but they do it in Our bill asks the FDA to evaluate the safety of the chemicals that are put in these products.  In committee, we had testimony about a shampoo that once used, hair fell out of the individual's head and many thousands of complaints had been registered.  Congress does not have the expertise to do the chemical evaluations, and without deference to the FDA, the bill would have to be thousands of pages long to cover every contingency for every product made by hundreds of companies, and that simply is not workable.  If Congress can no longer rely on Federal agencies, and if all laws can only be interpreted by limited dictionary definitions, then government would have no ability to regulate markets, defend against a financial crisis, protect workers, build safe roads, or safeguard our environment.  We depend on the scientists, the biologists, the economists, the engineers, and other experts to help ensure that our laws are effectively implemented. So this is really a dastardly controlling mechanism.  Under the arguments proposed by Judge Gorsuch, this would no longer occur.  Instead, only congressional action would be able to address these important issues. These rules that agencies would bring would have to be written by And even that would be severely limited. Such a radical change in law would hurt ordinary Americans, certainly their safety, and certainly our communities.  Let me say once again that who sits on the Supreme Court matters.  The issues facing our country are consequential, and they have a real-world impact on all of us. Justices on the Supreme Court must understand that the Court's decisions have real-world consequences for men, women, and children across our  Unfortunately, based on Judge Gorsuch's record at the Department of Justice, his tenure on the bench, his appearance before the Senate, and his written questions for the record, I cannot support this nomination.

If you want to know the backbone of the United States of America, look up in the stands. These are the United Mine Workers of America, who made us the country we are today. They gave us the life we have and our freedom, and for people not to understand that makes no sense to me at all.  All I am asking is for my colleagues to understand that the miners protection simply is this: Keep your promise, the promise that we made basically to all the miners who have given their lives. They have given everything they have--their blood, sweat, and tears basically for us to have energy for this country of ours. Now all they are asking is: Can't we at least keep our healthcare? Can't we at least keep our pensions? We have worked for that. We have negotiated for that. Every contract they negotiated basically was a give-and-take proposition so that they would be able to continue to have this after they retire.  For a lot of our colleagues and comrades who have passed away, the widows and families they leave behind are still dependent on this healthcare.  We have been fighting for this. On April 28, we are going to lose it again--April 28. I know the way things work around here. Someone will come down and say: Well, we have negotiated a little extension.  I want to make sure everyone is on notice: We will use every vehicle we can, absolutely every pathway that we can to make sure we will not leave here until we have our miners protected. Our miners will be protected with their healthcare and their pensions.  All 48 Democrats are united. Many of our colleagues on the Republican side have joined us or are willing to join us. All we are asking for is that vote.  I want to make it very clear: We will do anything and everything that we must. We have been very patient, but I am not going to have another notice sent out to our retired miners, to their families, to their widows saying: Well, we have given you another 90-day or 120-day extension. That is not going to happen this time. That is my commitment to them and their families. That is my commitment, basically, to the people who have depended on them.  Really, each and every one of us in this great country of ours should say thank you to them for the job that they have done.  We will fight this and we will continue to fight this onslaught, and I can't figure out why.  In October, 16,300 of our Nation's coal miners and their families were told that they would lose their healthcare on December 31. Then we extended it.  Can you imagine an elderly person receiving a notice the first of February, the end of January that says: Guess what, in 90 days, you are going to lose it again because we gave an extension until April of this year.  I can't understand it at all. I don't know how anybody could be that inhumane.  The cosponsors are working with us. We have held firm. The White House knows that we are serious about this. The President himself has given me his verbal support. I need him now to either tweet or call Senator Mitch McConnell, our majority leader, and tell him it is time to act. It is time for Mr.McConnell, the Senator from Kentucky, our friend from my neighboring State, to act. That is all we are saying.

Also, I want to tell you, first, your Senator from West Virginia--you don't have a better fighter than in anyone but him. Second, I am totally committed to making this happen for you, and I will do everything in my power. Our entire caucus--all 48 of us--are completely behind you.  I thank my friend from West  Mr.President, as each hour brings us closer to the cloture vote on the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court and a potential rules change if that vote fails, I rise this afternoon to entreat my friend, the majority leader, to step back from the brink.  As I and so many other of my colleagues have made clear, we Democrats have principled reasons to vote against this nominee on tomorrow's cloture vote. First, he has instinctively favored corporate interests over average[[Page S2326]]Second, he hasn't shown a scintilla of independence from President And third, Judge Gorsuch, based on his record and history, has a deeply held, far-right special interest judicial philosophy that is far out of the mainstream.  He was selected from a list developed by the very hard-right, special interest Heritage Foundation and Federalist The Washington Post, after analyzing his decisions on the Tenth Circuit, concluded that Judge Gorsuch may be the most hard, conservative Justice on the bench, to the right of even Justice  It may seem abstract to many Americans, but Judge Gorsuch's judicial philosophy matters a great deal. It will affect dozens of decisions and decades of jurisprudence that could have far-reaching consequences on the lives of average  As Emily Bazelton in the New York Times put it: ``[T]he reality is that Judge Gorsuch embraces a judicial philosophy that would do nothing less than undermine the structure of modern government--including the rules that keep our water clean, regulate the financial markets, and protect workers and consumers.''  If that philosophy becomes the majority view on the Supreme Court, average Americans are in big, big trouble.  The prospect concerns almost every Democrat here in this body, enough to prevent cloture on Judge Gorsuch's nomination tomorrow.  This leaves the majority leader and my Republican friends with a choice: Break the rules of the Senate or sit down with us Democrats and the President to come up with a mainstream nominee who can earn enough bipartisan support to pass the  We Democrats believe the answer isn't to change the rules; it is to change the nominee, as Presidents of both parties have done when a nominee fails to earn confirmation. Instead, my Republican friends seem intent on breaking the rules for Judge Gorsuch and are trying to find reasons to justify it.  The truth is, each side can blame the other. We believe they are more in the wrong. They believe we are more in the wrong. The game of pointing fingers and ``they started it'' can go back and back and back to the very founding of the  If my Republican friends think that they have to change the rules because this blame game has gotten so far out of hand that Democrats will never pass a Republican-nominated Supreme Court Justice, I would remind them of Justices Alito and Roberts, two conservatives who, nonetheless, passed the Senate, having met a 60-vote bar. That was during a pretty contentious time as well.  If my Republican friends think that what we Democrats did in 2013 was so wrong and that is the reason to break the rules, I would remind them that the only reason we changed the rules was because the Republican minority in the Senate had forced cloture petitions to be filed on more nominees under President Obama's first 5 years than in all the 225 years before him combined. They forced the majority leader to file more cloture petitions for President Obama's nominees than all the cloture petitions filed from George Washington through George  When we Democrats changed the rules, however, we purposefully left the 60-vote bar for the Supreme Court intact because we knew, as the Republicans know, that the Supreme Court is different. Justices on the Supreme Court don't simply apply the precedents of a higher court. They set the precedents. That is why Justices should be mainstream enough to garner substantial bipartisan support.  If the majority leader breaks the rules tomorrow--that is his choice--he would be forever unwinding that important principle, erasing the last shred of bipartisanship in the Senate confirmation process.  If my Republican friends think a filibuster on Judge Gorsuch is so wrong that they have cause to break the rules, I would remind them that almost every one of them lined up behind the majority leader when he vowed mere hours after the death of Justice Scalia that President Obama would not get to fill a Supreme Court seat, despite 11 months left in his That was much worse than a filibuster. Even my friend, the Republican Senator from Tennessee, called it ``audacious.'' But I think Representative Adam Schiff of California said it best: ``When McConnell deprived President Obama of a vote on Garland, it was a nuclear option. The rest is fallout.''  The fact is, the Republicans blocked Merrick Garland using the most unprecedented of maneuvers. Now we are likely to block Judge Gorsuch because we are insisting on a bar of 60 votes.  We think a 60-vote bar is far more in keeping with tradition than what the Republicans did to Merrick The majority leader himself has stipulated--this is Mitch McConnell's quote: ``In the Senate . . . it takes 60 votes on controversial matters.'' On the other hand, there is absolutely no precedent, rule, tradition, or custom that can justify what the Republicans did to Merrick Garland, none.  The two are not equivalent. Over the long history of partisan combat over judicial nominations, of course there is blame on both sides. We don't believe the blame should be equally shared between Republicans and  The Republican Party has been far more aggressive in employing new tactics and escalating old ones to fight the nominees of a President of the opposing party. The Republican Party has been far more aggressive in their selection of judicial candidates, picking judges who have an ideology closer to the conservative extremes of American politics, while Democrats have tended to select candidates closer to the center.  Keep this in mind: The last time a Republican-controlled Senate confirmed a Supreme Court nomination of a Democratic President was 1895.  Let me repeat that amazing fact. The last time a Republican-controlled Senate confirmed the Supreme Court nomination of a Democratic President was 1895.  So we can argue endlessly about where and with whom this all started. Was it the Bork nomination, which received a vote in a Democratic Senate, by the way? Or was it the obstruction of judges under President Clinton? Was it when Democrats blocked a few judges under President Bush or when Republicans forced Democrats to file more cloture petitions in 5 years of President Obama's Presidency than during all other Presidencies combined? Was it Judge Garland or Judge Gorsuch?  Wherever we place the starting point of this long, twilight battle over the judiciary, we are now approaching its end point. We are nearing the final hour, and the stakes are considerable.  After the cloture vote on Judge Gorsuch, Democrats will have been denied Merrick Garland due to tactics we felt were unfair and Republicans will have been denied Judge Gorsuch because of tactics they think are unfair. Our two parties have traded bitter blows. In the tortured history of the Scalia vacancy, the debate has been saturated with contradiction. But in a very real sense, even though each side thinks their side is more right than the other, neither side is happy with how we got here.  Now we are standing on the brink of an irrevocable change to the way this body conducts business. As the majority leader once said: Changing the rules is a bell that is very hard to unring.  As the clock ticks steadily toward tomorrow, what are we going to do? I, for one, would like to see us step back from the brink. As the Democratic leader, I still hope that I can sit down with the Republican leader and find a way out of this pernicious cycle. I believe that as leaders of our respective caucuses, it is at least up to us to try for the sake of the The Republican leader and I disagree on a great many things, but we agree upon the importance of the Senate in American life. We can decide today to commit to solving this problem. Each side can stop pointing fingers. Each side can lay down their arms. Each side can put aside the resentments built up after years of trench warfare on nominees. We can decide today to talk about a way out of this impasse instead of changing the rules.  We both lost Supreme Court nominees. We shouldn't also lose a longstanding rule of the Senate that encourages our two parties to work together to fulfill one of the Senate's most important functions.  So the option to sit down with us Democrats and talk about a new nominee who can gain sufficient bipartisan[[Page S2327]]support remains on the table right now. I hope my friend the Republican leader thinks about where we are headed and takes a moment to let reason and prudence prevail over rancor and haste.  Just as the majority leader holds the power to exercise the nuclear option, he also has the power to avoid it. If the majority leader is willing to cooperate in a bipartisan way, if he is willing to sit down with us in good faith and try to find a way out, he will find an open door and an open mind, and maybe, maybe we can for the moment avoid an outcome that no Senator from either side wants to see.

580,BOOZMAN,proceeding_id,topic-id,747,"Mr.President, the Senate is at a crossroads. Senate Democrats at the behest of far-left activist groups are leading the charge to break a 230-year-old precedent of confirming Supreme Court nominees by a simple majority vote. Why?  Well, when you go down the list, there is only one reason. That reason is not based on substance or reality; it is purely partisan. Judge Gorsuch is eminently qualified. That does not seem to be in dispute. His credentials are exceptional. His resume is impressive. His judicial demeanor, professional competence, and integrity all exceed what you expect in a nominee for the highest Court in the land.  Judge Gorsuch checks every box, so much so, that the American Bar Association gave Judge Gorsuch its highest rating. The ABA's assessment, mind you, has been referred to by the minority leader as the ``gold standard'' when it comes to evaluating a nominee's fitness to serve on the Senate Democrats must be concerned about Judge Gorsuch's past then. Again, that is not the case. No one was able to dig up anything remotely resembling a scandal in Judge Gorsuch's past during this process. You can't manufacture a controversy where none exists. Nothing about Judge Gorsuch has come to light during this confirmation process that could conceivably merit blocking a vote on the nominee.  I have heard some Democrats try and argue that Judge Gorsuch is out of the mainstream. That hasn't stuck, either. This is a judge who has been with the majority of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals 99 percent of the time, and 97 percent of his decisions were unanimous. Judge Gorsuch is about as mainstream as you are going to find.  Editorial boards from newspapers across the country, including USA Today, have written in support of his nomination. Does anyone honestly believe that USA Today, which is far from a conservative newspaper, would support confirming Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court if he were out of the mainstream?  Now Senate Democrats are seemingly creating new standards out of thin air to justify this blatantly partisan action. According to the talking points, the nominee is now expected to tell the Senate and the American people exactly how he or she would rule on matters that may come before the Court, especially the instances where the activist base has a very keen interest. As the Judiciary chairman rightly pointed out, the standards set by Justice Ginsburg in her confirmation hearings that it would be inappropriate for a nominee to offer hints or make commitments on matters that may come before the Court have been adhered to ever since.  This leaves Senate Democrats with a filibuster that lacks a reason. The minority leader has suggested that the Senate abandon Judge Gorsuch's nomination if cloture is not agreed to and ask the President to submit a new nominee. This demand rings hollow. Here is the truth: If this nominee cannot get the Senate Democrats' blessings for a vote, then no nominee put forward by the President can.  Again, we are talking about a top rung in his profession. Judge Gorsuch is well qualified, and he was unanimously confirmed to the Tenth Circuit Court of As I mentioned earlier, he received the highest possible rating after an exhaustive evaluation from the American Bar  Senate Democrats failed to create outrage and controversy over Judge Gorsuch's nomination because there is simply none to be found, but that didn't stop them. They made this amazing 180-degree turnaround. Senate Democrats who just last year pushed for an immediate vote at the height of a contentious Presidential election now appear to be fine with leaving that seat vacant literally for years. Just last year the minority leader sounded the alarm about the judicial chaos a deadlocked Court could lead to. He appears to be no longer concerned about that. By this logic, a vacancy on the Supreme Court for a few months would be a devastating blow to democracy, but one held vacant for years would be acceptable. This makes absolutely no sense. The only explanation for it is that Senate Democrats expect to be voting on a nominee put forth by a Democratic administration, not one put forth by President  Judge Gorsuch will be confirmed to the Supreme Court this week. It is unfortunate that we may have to break longstanding precedent to do so, but Senate Democrats actually are to blame for that.[[Page S2328]]  With that, Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from South  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt2-PgS2309.txt
581,SCOTT,proceeding_id,topic-id,1009,"Mr.President, we heard famously that elections have consequences, and over the next few days we will have an experiment in what I call ``the physics of politics.''  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. If the Democrats use for the first time a partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee, we will have an equal and opposite reaction. An unprecedented action is going to evoke an unprecedented reaction.  Neil Gorsuch deserves to be confirmed, and I want to share for the next few minutes why. For more than 2 months since the nomination was first announced, we have seen that Judge Neil Gorsuch possesses the qualifications and the temperament to serve as our next Supreme Court  While all nominations carry enormous responsibility, this is arguably the most important position we are tasked with filling. We need someone who is extraordinarily qualified, someone who will respect the foundation of our country, someone who has the mental resilience to stay above the political fray. Some of my friends on the left have called Judge Gorsuch unqualified, too conservative, and someone who is simply not in the judicial mainstream.  Judge Gorsuch started his legal career by earning degrees from not one, but two Ivy League schools--Columbia University for his undergrad, Harvard Law for his juris doctor, graduating cum laude. Even as a Marshall Scholar, he earned a doctorate degree from When one takes into account these extraordinary educational achievements, it would be simply incomprehensible that anyone would consider him unqualified.  His record on the bench is just as impressive. We have heard these numbers so many times that we sometimes just gloss or glaze over these numbers, but these numbers are powerful indicators of how successful he has been as a judge. Out of nearly 2,700 cases, Judge Gorsuch has been overruled only twice--98 percent of his opinions were unanimous, further proving that he falls exactly square in the judicial mainstream. He has received ``well qualified,'' as my Senator from Arkansas just stated a few minutes ago, from the American Bar Association, the highest rating available for a Supreme Court  Judge Gorsuch is also not new to the nomination process. Just a few years ago, in 2006, Judge Gorsuch was unanimously confirmed by the U.Senate to the Tenth  Let me say that one more time because so seldom do we see the Senate acting in a unanimous fashion. This, perhaps, is a moment of reflection that Judge Gorsuch, in just 2006, received a unanimous vote for the Tenth Every single Democrat who was serving in the Senate at that time voted in support of Neil Gorsuch, including 12 Members who are still serving in this Chamber today. His bipartisan support has not stopped there.  Senator Bennet from Colorado says that Judge Gorsuch represents the best qualities of Colorado and that we need to fulfill our responsibility to this nominee.  Senator Donnelly, from Indiana, has said: ``I believe he is a qualified jurist who will base his decisions on his understanding of the law and is well respected among his peers.''  From West Virginia, Senator Manchin acknowledged that, while he may not agree with future decisions that will be made by Judge Gorsuch, he also said, without question, that he has ``not found any reason why this jurist should not be a Supreme Court Justice.''  Senator Heitkamp, from North Dakota, said, during her meeting with our Supreme Court nominee, that Judge Gorsuch reinforced the importance of a judiciary that remains independent from the executive and the legislative branches of government.  Neal Katyal, the former Acting Solicitor General under President Obama, said of Gorsuch that he is a first-rate intellect and a fair and decent man. The judge's work reflects his dedication to the rule of law.  Last month, throughout his 3-day confirmation hearing, Judge Gorsuch provided detailed and thoughtful responses that should have answered every concern from committee members. As I watched, I was incredibly impressed with his depth of knowledge, his genuine demeanor, and his obvious respect for the rule of law. He understands that his job is not to make the law. Let me repeat that because this seems to be an unusual experience--at least it has been for me--to hear that a judge understands and appreciates that his job is not to make the law, that his job is not to alter the law but, as he expressed time and again, that he is committed to interpreting the law as it is written.  One of his most memorable comments from his hearing has left a lasting impression on me, and I hope it does on you as well.  He said:       A judge who likes every result he reaches is very likely a      bad judge, reaching for results he prefers rather than those      the law compels.  In one sentence, Judge Gorsuch eloquently summarized what we should expect from our Supreme Court Justices, and it also gives insight into how he intends to serve once confirmed.  After his extensive and exhaustive hearing, we clearly see, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that this man is more than qualified for the appointment. Any argument to the contrary is based purely on political opposition.  Today, the Senate stands on the verge of breaking historical precedence. We have let political disagreements get in the way of a judicial seat--a nomination that should stand far above political rancor.  A year ago, Judge Gorsuch was serving on the U.Court of Appeals for the Tenth He had no idea that he would find himself in the midst of a partisan battle. There is no question that this man has led an exemplary life and deserves a fair vote.  We are, simply, asking for a fair vote--a vote. Let us move past these political games and confirm a man who has earned this position, with a nearly flawless record, as one of the brightest judicial minds our country has to offer.

583,ENZI,proceeding_id,topic-id,1651,"Mr.President, I rise to offer my support for the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court of the United States of  Several weeks ago, shortly after President Trump announced this nomination, I came to the floor to say what an admirable choice he had made and had known him for some time.  After meeting with Judge Gorsuch to discuss his nomination and after reviewing his qualifications and after observing my colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee thoroughly vet him, I am all the more convinced that this man is eminently qualified to serve as America's next Associate Justice of the Supreme  I was impressed that both of his Senators introduced him to the committee for the hearing. I was kind of surprised that the biggest comments that I heard about the hearing itself, were that he did not answer some of the questions directly. As with previous Justices, they do not answer questions directly when they are asked a theoretical question about some possible future case that might come before them and are without the details.  Another reason that I am convinced that he is very qualified is that the people with whom he went to school have all had good comments to say about him. The people he went to law school with have had good comments. The people who have been on the bar with him--in the legal arena--have had good comments to say about him and so have the other judges with whom he has worked through the years as he has moved up through the different processes.  I am confident that he is qualified to be our next Justice because of his extensive judicial experience, his commitment to the rule of law, and his principled character.  Neil Gorsuch's first job out of law school was a couple of blocks from here. Even back then, he was already preparing to serve his country on the[[Page S2329]]Supreme Court by learning from some of the best jurists in He performed clerkships first for the U.Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit and later for Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy at the U.Supreme  After working in private practice and at the Department of Justice, in 2006 President George Bush nominated Judge Gorsuch to serve on the U.Court of Appeals for the Tenth The Senate confirmed him by a voice vote. That is unanimous.  Let me say that again because it is relevant to the misplaced--in my opinion--partisan rancor we are hearing over this nomination. In 2006, only Lindsey Graham bothered to attend the Senate Judiciary Committee's hearing to consider Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the Tenth Circuit Court of This body--including then-Senators Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama--was so confident about Neil Gorsuch's character and his qualifications to serve as a Federal judge that he was confirmed by the Senate without anyone even asking for a recorded vote.  With what was in essence an endorsement from three of the most influential political figures then serving in the Senate among my colleagues across the aisle, I find some of the opposition to Judge Gorsuch and the questioning of his qualifications somewhat baffling. I hope my colleagues in the Senate will put aside the political bickering and scorekeeping that have dominated Washington over the last several months and give Neil Gorsuch a fair vote, up or down, based on his qualifications and his suitability for service on the Supreme  Since joining the Tenth Circuit, Judge Gorsuch has been a busy man, doing exactly the kind of work that makes him qualified for this nomination. The Tenth Circuit exercises appellate jurisdiction of Federal cases originating in eight States that cover about 20 percent of America's landmass. That jurisdiction does include my home State of  As a member of the Tenth Circuit, Judge Gorsuch estimates that he sat on appellate panels considering approximately 1,800 criminal cases and 1,200 civil cases. The list of citations of case decisions he has authored is a single-spaced, 21-page document. After hearing all of those cases and drafting all of those opinions, even Judge Gorsuch's detractors have criticized only a mere handful of the hundreds of opinions he has authored.  I am confident that Neil Gorsuch is qualified to be a member of the Supreme Court because of his steadfast commitment to the rule of law. The many opinions he has written are known for being clear and easy to understand. But, most importantly, his opinions reflect his respect for following the law as it is written and for applying and adhering to judicial precedent. He is a judge who applies the law to the facts of the case and reaches the conclusion that the examination yields, regardless of his own personal beliefs.  As he said, ``Personal politics or policy preferences have no useful role in judging; regular and healthy doses of self-skepticism and humility about one's own abilities and conclusions always do.''  Judge Gorsuch is an adherent to, and defender of, America's Constitution and the separation of powers that document prescribes. As he said, ``Judges must allow the elected branches of government to flourish and citizens, through their elected representatives, to make laws appropriate to the facts and circumstances of the day.''  Throughout this nomination process, during all of which Judge Gorsuch has been under a political microscope, we have seen that he is a man of admirable character with a temperament that makes him well suited to serve as a Supreme Court  We know he has a resilient character and thick skin--qualities important to any Justice--because we have seen his demeanor and response to the criticism of his career and negative characterizations about some of his previous decisions--very few of them, I should add. We have seen his reaction in the face of accusations about his judicial independence. In the face of that--biting disparagement about the work he has spent his life trying to perfect--Judge Gorsuch has been respectful, remarkably patient, and resolutely committed to upholding the ethical canons and conduct demanded of him as a jurist.  We have glimpsed Judge Gorsuch's character as he has spoken about the people he values and those he strives to emulate. His legal heroes are people like Justice White, who he said ``followed the law wherever it took him without fear or favor to anyone''; Justice Anthony Kennedy, who, Judge Gorsuch said, ``showed me that judges can disagree without being disagreeable''; and Justice Scalia, who reminds us ``that the judge's job is to follow the words that are in the law--not to replace them with words that aren't.''  Neil Gorsuch has told us that he has also looked closer to home, to his family, to shape his character: his mother, who he said ``taught me that headlines are fleeting, but courage lasts''; his father, who he said showed him that kindness ``is the great virtue''; his paternal grandfather, who Judge Gorsuch said taught him that ``lawyers exist to help people with their problems, not the other way around.''  Neil Gorsuch has demonstrated his commitment to the law, his scholarship, and his temperament befitting that of a judge. He is eminently qualified to be a member of the Supreme Court--not in my opinion--that is what the judges have said.  I am not the only one who believes this. My office has received hundreds of calls and letters from my constituents in Wyoming urging the confirmation of Judge He has a lot of support from folks in the Wyoming legal community, from both parties, whom I know and trust and whose opinions I value.  Judge Gorsuch has earned a ``well qualified'' rating--the highest rating they award from the American Bar To give him this rating, the ADA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary conducted a peer review of Judge Gorsuch's integrity, professional competence, and judicial temperament.  As children we all learn that you might be able to fool your parents or our teachers, but you can never fool your peers. You especially cannot fool ones with whom you have worked long hours like most judges and lawyers are known to do. You can't fool your peers. They are the ones who see you at your best and at your worst. That is why it is so remarkable that dozens of Neil Gorsuch's Harvard Law School classmates--people representing many different political and philosophical persuasions and who have known him for more than a quarter of a century--signed a letter supporting his nomination to the Supreme  Among our most important duties as Members of this body is to carefully vet all nominees who come before us. Never is that responsibility so stark and so substantial than when our Nation faces a vacancy on the Supreme  In November, millions of people went to the polls and rejected the kind of tired, partisan bickering when they voted for a change in Those same voters went to the polls knowing that there was a vacancy on the Supreme Court and that whoever became the next President would choose that nominee.  For many weeks now, Judge Gorsuch has been before us as that nominee. He has undergone scrutiny under which most of us would wither. We have all had time to examine his record.  I thank Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Feinstein, and all of our Senate colleagues who serve on the Judiciary Committee for conducting such thorough and detailed nomination hearings that provided us ample opportunity to examine Judge Gorsuch's qualifications and temperament.  I believe there is only one logical conclusion to reach after all of this examination; that is, that Judge Neil Gorsuch is supremely qualified for and capable of the solemn and mighty task of serving as the next Associate Justice of the Supreme  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this confirmation.

We know about his record as it relates to being reversed or overturned.  We know that our colleagues who, for some reason, are opposing Judge Gorsuch continue to come to the floor and talk about the reasons they apparently can't support Judge Gorsuch: because he will not violate judicial ethics--the ethics judges are expected to keep; because he will not preview how he would rule under a certain fact circumstance. George Washington himself could come down from a mountaintop and would be rejected by the U.Senate to be a Supreme Court  It is pretty incredible to see and hear the arguments that have taken place--some lasting all night--because some of these arguments are nothing more than sour grapes. Some of these arguments are nothing more than that two wrongs must make a right, in their minds. They criticize Republicans for invoking the Biden rule or the Schumer rule, and then they decide because of that, they are going to demand the seat be held open--not confirmed--because they believe it was taken from them. In their mind, if you do two things that are wrong, it must be a right. We have taught our children that is not true.  We know, in this instance, that the American people decided who the Supreme Court Justice would be.  In 2006, Judge Neil Gorsuch was nominated to serve on the Tenth Circuit A dozen sitting Members of this Chamber didn't object to his nomination then. They didn't oppose him. They didn't come and register their ``no'' vote. In fact, nobody even showed up at his confirmation. Lindsey Graham was the only one. That is how objectionable he was then. So either of a couple of things has happened: Nobody did their work then to find out what kind of judge he was going to be or they have decided that the politics have changed.  To me, the most egregious part of this debate is that the politics of the time are demanding that there be absolute obstruction for the first time in over 230 years of a Supreme Court Justice, trying to defeat a Supreme Court Justice with a partisan filibuster for the first time in two centuries, of a judge who agreed 99 percent of the time with the opinions of the court. Ninety-nine percent of the time, his opinions were made with a majority of the court; 97 percent of the time, they were made unanimously.  This is an individual who has outstanding legal credentials: Harvard, Columbia, and, most importantly, time spent at the University of  He is a fourth-generation I think an old joke of the late Justice Scalia was that four of the five boroughs in New York have their own Supreme Court justice. Wouldn't it be nice if we had a Supreme Court Justice from west of the Mississippi River, another western voice on the Supreme Court, a judge who comes from a circuit court that represents 20 percent of the landmass? If you are a Westerner and you have a choice of putting a judge on the Supreme Court who is familiar with Tribal law issues, a judge who is familiar with water issues, a judge who is familiar with public land issues, that is a pretty good pick for the High Court, to represent a vast part of America that is underrepresented on the Nation's High  This institution can seem pretty puzzling at times because you consistently hear the outcry for bipartisan support: Let's work together. Let's have bipartisan support. Then the President nominates a judge who has strong bipartisan credentials from the people who know him the best. Look, most people in Washington, DC, most people in this Chamber have known Neil Gorsuch for just a couple of months since the time of his nomination. Most conversations people in this Chamber have had with Judge Gorsuch have consisted of an hour or two at a judicial confirmation hearing or perhaps when he visited the office prior to the hearing. That is the extent of their relationship and their knowledge and their understanding of Judge  But the people who know him best--the people out in Colorado, Republicans, Democrats--believe he is well qualified and should be confirmed, that he deserves an up-or-down vote. People like Democratic Governor Bill Ritter believe that Judge Gorsuch should have an up-or-down vote and be confirmed.  Some people find Judge Gorsuch to be so unreasonable or so unfit to serve on the High Court, they might find it hard to believe that the 2008 cochair of the Democratic National Convention is supporting Judge Gorsuch's confirmation.  Jim Lyons, an attorney and close friend of President Bill Clinton, supports the confirmation of Judge  They know his record. They have reviewed the cases that the opposition has stated that they find so egregious, and they still believe he is worthy of confirmation to the  The standard that has been set by those who oppose Judge Gorsuch is a standard that simply says: No Justice could be confirmed. Why? We know that because Judge Gorsuch's credentials, his academic background, his judicial history, his temperament, his qualifications, his ratings show that he is more than able to serve and deserving to serve on the Supreme  There is a certainly a difference in philosophy that has been presented here, a difference of philosophies that some people believe that a judge should just be a judge who follows the law or rules and makes a decision based on where the law takes them, but there are people who believe that a judge somehow has to be maybe a focus group of opinion or policy preferences, that a judge should be somebody who puts their thumb on the scale of justice to reach an outcome that is preferred by a political party. That is not what our Founders had in mind when they wrote the That is not what justice is about.

The opportunity to grant a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States is[[Page S2331]]one of those moments. The next Supreme Court Justice will break the 4-to-4 deadlock that has constrained the Court since the passing of Justice Scalia and this body's unprecedented refusal to act on Chief Judge Merrick Garland's nomination to fill that vacancy during the final year of President Obama's second term.  Before discussing the pending nominee's merits, we must consider this nomination in its historical context. Chief Judge Garland, I believe, was one of the most qualified nominees for the Supreme Court in generations. After meeting with him and reviewing his record, I had no doubt that he easily would have earned bipartisan support and cleared the 60-vote threshold, as did each of President Obama's prior nominees to the Yet my colleagues on the other side of the aisle refused even to meet with him.

Nothing in our conversation or his testimony before the Judiciary Committee convinced me that he plans to moderate his positions to dispense equal justice under the law. I am deeply concerned that granting him a lifetime appointment to be a final authority on the meaning of the Constitution would further tip the scales of justice in favor of corporations and the powerful at the expense of working people and the powerless. Therefore, I cannot support Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court of the United  This is a pivotal time for our Nation, when the people's trust in the judiciary is in decline, attributed by many to the streak of 5-to-4 decisions of the Roberts Court that have consolidated corporate power. Given how radically the Court has changed many of our institutions over just the past decade, it is difficult to overstate the importance of understanding a nominee's judicial values and the human element the nominee will bring to the  I have applied the same, simple test to each Supreme Court nominee throughout my time in this body. It is not enough for a nominee to display intellectual gifts or to possess a textbook understanding of American history and jurisprudence. Judicial decision making at the Supreme Court is not an assembly line where mechanical application of the law will resolve every dispute.  Rather, the nominee must demonstrate that she or he will use judicial discretion to give meaning to the text and spirit of the  Justice Harlan Fiske Stone laid the foundation for this model of judicial review in United States v. Carolene Products He wrote that judges must enforce the specific text of the Constitution, but he went further than that, urging judges to apply stricter scrutiny to laws that impede the effective operation of government and channels of political participation. Judges should likewise demand the most compelling justifications for laws that single out powerless, discrete, and insular minorities. These principles deeply influenced future scholars and judges and laid the groundwork for modern constitutional law as we have understood it since the Warren  These are the decisions that struck down race and gender segregation, proclaimed the rule of ``one person, one vote,'' enshrined the right to remain silent and to counsel in police custody, and recognized the fundamental right of a person to marry for love, regardless of race or gender.  This tradition stands in stark contrast to the new wave of hyper-partisan legal activism we have seen manifested in our courts in recent years. This judicial activism attempts to disguise judges' personal political agenda by arguing that they are merely applying pure, indisputable, mechanical logic. This philosophy goes by varied names: textualism, originalism, strict constructionism, and so forth. But in the main, it is an ideological prism to disguise traditional judicial discretion, expand the law without limits to benefit politically powerful majority groups and corporations, and constrict the law for the minorities, workers, and the politically powerless.  We know too well the devastating effects of this line of thinking as it has manifested itself in the Roberts In the case of Shelby County, the Court disregarded congressional intent and ruled 5 to 4 that the preclearance formula that helped millions of African Americans secure the vote in States with a history of discrimination was no longer necessary. This freed several States to enact severely restrictive election laws that clearly benefit one party and racial group at the expense of another, and courts are still working to resolve these imbalances.  In Hobby Lobby, with an intellectual framework formed in part by Judge Gorsuch, the Court ruled 5 to 4 to give for-profit corporations religious rights to opt out of providing comprehensive health coverage for their employees. This has opened the door for corporate religious challenges to an untold number of duly enacted restraints on corporate excess, from child labor laws to basic protections against employment discrimination.  In Citizens United, as we all too well know, the Court broke with decades of precedent, the facts of the case, and common sense to create a constitutional right for corporations to spend unlimited money on our elections. Indeed, our political system is still reeling from billions of dollars in anonymous political expenditures, and we are only now beginning to recognize the national security concerns that have resulted, with hostile powers, such as Russia, seeking to influence our democracy. In order to satisfy partisan, ideological ends, the Court has left us powerless to limit the purchase of political influence or even to know who is spending all this money on our politics.  Judge Gorsuch's record strongly suggests that he would contribute to the Roberts Court's partisan, pro-corporate orientation. Indeed, the very same business groups that spent $7 million in dark money to block Chief Judge Garland's nomination to this seat also spent $10 million on ads and lobbying efforts to support Judge Gorsuch's nomination. It stands to reason that these groups believe that Judge Gorsuch shares their right-wing beliefs and will benefit their interests.  The Judiciary is supposed to be above politics. Judges write opinions to satisfy due process and establish precedents that will guide future decisions. The opinion-writing process is not intended to be an arena for judges to pursue self-serving or ideological ends. That is why I am deeply concerned with Judge Gorsuch's clear willingness on the Tenth Circuit to go beyond precedent and the facts of a case before him to advance arguments designed to bend the law to his ideology.  In Riddle v. Hickenlooper, Judge Gorsuch joined a panel decision that struck down uneven contribution limits in Colorado election laws. He then wrote separately to advocate that all campaign finance laws should be subject to greater constitutional questioning. This was both unnecessary to decide the case, and a clear signal by Judge Gorsuch that he would work to abolish what remains of laws limiting the flow of anonymous corporate money into our elections.  Judge Gorsuch has reached furthest beyond precedent when doing so would deconstruct Federal agencies that constrain corporations, and protect workers, consumers, and the environment. This confirmation process has introduced many to a relatively obscure doctrine of administrative law called Chevron deference. The Chevron case stands for the essentially uncontested proposition that, when someone sues a Federal agency and a reasonable person could read the statute at issue more than one way, the court should defer to the agency's reasonable interpretation of the law it is charged with enforcing. This case has long been a target for attacks by corporations and their advocates because it levels the playing field in cases between massively well-funded corporate lawyers who want no regulations, and agencies charged with bringing big business into compliance with the law. Judge Gorsuch has written strongly against this principle, but even Justice Scalia acknowledged the sound reasoning behind the Chevron case.  Judge Gorsuch would seemingly return us to the old days when powerful[[Page S2332]]companies could pollute the environment, scam their customers, and discriminate against their employees as long as they could pay enough lawyers and get the right judge when the Federal agency sues. In the case of Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch, he took the very unusual step of writing a concurrence to his own majority opinion in order to attack Federal agencies and make the case that decades of Chevron precedent should be overturned. It is highly unusual, after you have written the majority opinion at the circuit level deciding the case, that you would then step aside and write a separate epistle advancing your ideas.  He wrote in language that is familiar to those of us in the political branches of government, but out of the ordinary for a Federal judge. He compared Federal agencies to a ``tyrannical king'' and a ``behemoth'' and a ``colossus'' and laid out his constitutional theory for challenging Chevron in the Supreme None of this analysis was necessary to the case before Judge Yet in writing this and similar opinions, Judge Gorsuch signaled his willingness to break from precedent and contort the law to fit his ideological vision of how the system should work to benefit the powerful and his preferred interests.  My colleagues on the Judiciary Committee spent a great deal of time and effort questioning Judge Gorsuch and trying to elicit responses about his basic judicial philosophy. Unfortunately, his answers were largely nonresponsive and failed to address many of our concerns about his record.  Judge Gorsuch's record and writings shows he believes judges should always interpret the Constitution and other laws from the perspective of those who first drafted the law, regardless of how the world looks today.  The Founders and Framers, however, did not leave us a blueprint to answer every new question of law. Nor did the delegates to the Constitutional Convention demand that all future judges be ``originalists.'' The laws and values of 1789 would shock and alienate--as they should--many Americans today, particularly women and racial and other minority groups. Worse yet, a judge attempting to resolve a case as if it were the 18th, 19th, or even 20th centuries may wittingly or unwittingly use that construct to inject into the case the judge's own view of how the government ought to work.  The Hobby Lobby case is a key example of this ideological inconsistency at work to the detriment of less powerful This case concerned, as I noted earlier, whether a for-profit corporation could refuse to comply with the Affordable Care Act's mandate that employers provide health coverage, including contraceptives, to over 23,000 employees on the ground that doing so would conflict with the corporation's purported religious rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or  The text of RFRA provides that the ``government shall not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability.'' The legislative history of RFRA is both recent and clear. In the case of Employment Division v. Smith, decided in 1990, the Supreme Court rejected two peyote users' claim of a religious right to consume the drug on grounds that the Constitution permits some burdens on religion if the aim of the law is secular and generally applicable. When Congress debated RFRA in 1993, the House and Senate reports showed explicitly that Congress's aim was ``only to overturn the Supreme Court's decision in Smith'' and to require courts considering RFRA cases to ``look to free exercise cases decided prior to Smith for guidance.''  No Supreme Court case prior to this time had ever granted corporations religious rights and nothing in RFRA's legislative history suggested that Congress's intent was to do so. Notwithstanding these facts, Judge Gorsuch joined his colleagues to hold that a for-profit corporation's religious beliefs may overcome its employees own consciences and rights to comprehensive health coverage. He relied on an 1871 law called the Dictionary Act, which provided that in certain circumstances, Congress's use of the term ``person'' can also mean businesses, ``unless the context indicates otherwise.'' This reference to context means that Judge Gorsuch had discretion to use history and common sense to reach the conclusion that corporations don't have religious views, but people do, and RFRA was enacted to protect real people's rights. But instead, he took this opportunity to endow corporate entities with religious rights that could help them escape the law in untold circumstances.  Let's explore for a moment Judge Gorsuch's belief that judges should always give meaning to the original intent of a law's draftsmen. In this case, what is a corporation and how does it operate? In 1787, there were roughly six non-bank corporations in America, and their powers were severely restricted in the wake of colonists' experiences with the abusive practices of the Crown and royal English corporations. Around the time that Congress passed the Dictionary Act, corporations were harshly regulated by law to achieve specific commercial ends and nothing more. There were legal limits on the capital they could raise. Many could not operate outside their state of incorporation. They were often prohibited from owning property that was not necessary for specific commercial activities. Most were even forbidden to engage in any activity that was not explicitly enumerated in their corporate charters, and a real person could sue to render a corporation's action a legal nullity if it were not expressly in furtherance of the corporation's business mission. The idea that a corporation in this context could exercise fundamental religious rights, much less that its religion should excuse it from complying with duly enacted laws that protect real people, would have been outrageous to the Framers and the Congress that passed the Dictionary  Judge Gorsuch knew or should have known the ahistorical nature of his decisions. We have yet to see the full scope and consequences of his vision of a near-unlimited right of corporations to opt out of our laws, but we can imagine the harmful choices and difficult litigation on this point that may lie ahead. I, for one, have deep concerns about any judicial philosophy that bends so far in the direction of corporate interests and completely ignores tens of thousands of real people in the process.  For as much as Judge Gorsuch's record shows that he is willing to entertain new or arcane legal theories to reach a better outcome for corporations and the powerful, it is also clear that he will go to no such length to vindicate the rights of minorities, the disabled or workers.  One example highlighted during Judge Gorsuch's confirmation hearing is his record on lawsuits under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or The purpose of IDEA is to ensure that students with disabilities receive a public education that is tailored to their special individual needs. In the 2008 case popularly referred to as the Luke case, however, Judge Gorsuch ruled against the parents of a severely autistic child who sought reimbursement for the cost of a specialized school because their son was not making appropriate progress in the public school. In denying the parents relief, Gorsuch reinterpreted IDEA to require that public schools need only provide de minimis, or nonzero educational progress to children with disabilities. Not only did Judge Gorsuch go beyond the facts of the case to close any path to relief for the family, but in this and similar cases, he attempted to set a legal precedent for future cases that effectively eviscerated the meaning and protections of  Fortunately, the Supreme Court intervened. In a rare unanimous decision released, ironically, on the second day of Judge Gorsuch's confirmation hearing, the Court rejected Judge Gorsuch's narrow reading of the law. In fact, the Chief Justice did not mince words when it came to Judge Gorsuch's lower bar for schools. He said Judge Gorsuch's model would hardly provide ``an education at all'' for children with disabilities, and that ``receiving instruction that aims so low would be tantamount to `sitting idly . . . awaiting the time when they were old enough to drop out.' '' This stark, unanimous rebuke of Judge Gorsuch's view of the law in the middle of his confirmation hearing was yet another reminder that this nominee is outside of the judicial mainstream.[[Page S2333]]  But Judge Gorsuch has not just restricted his reading of the law in the educational context. In TransAm Trucking, v. Administrative Review Board, a majority of the Tenth Circuit held that a truck driver was wrongfully fired when he drove away from his trailer to find help after being stranded for hours in subzero temperatures in a vehicle with no heat and a rig with failed brakes. Judge Gorsuch disagreed so sharply that he penned a dissent. Under his strict textualist view of the law, the driver was protected from firing for ``refusing'' to operate in dangerous conditions, but the word ``refusing'' could not be interpreted to include driving away to get potentially lifesaving help, rather than freezing to death. Again and again, Judge Gorsuch's record shows he is capable, but either unwilling or unable to give the same benefit of the doubt to average working people as he does to their employers, their landlords and the most powerful among us.  Mr.President, Constitutional law is not concerned with easy cases or simple answers. We have constitutional guarantees to inalienable rights because we know that majority rule sometimes gets it wrong, particularly when it comes to the rights of the minority. That is what makes the qualifications for a seat on the Supreme Court fundamentally different from any other Federal or State court in the A judge's job is to apply precedent, be faithful to the law, and exercise measures of empathy and common sense to dispense justice. A Supreme Court Justice's job is to decide when the law is wrong and must be changed in order to fulfill the promise of the The Supreme Court cannot perform this function unless the individual Justices bring to it the values and willingness to be the last resort for the powerless when the system fails. They must be able to make unpopular decisions and side against political and cultural majorities. They must be able to reject precedent when the established way of doing things no longer safeguards the fundamental protections to which every American is entitled. They must do this for the least and most derided among us, because if they do not, there is nowhere else to turn. They have the final word on the meaning of the law.  I take Judge Gorsuch at his word that he respects the law and approaches this nomination with seriousness and a sense of responsibility. A thoughtful reading of his work as an advocate and a judge reveals that he has a consistent predisposition to favor corporations and the powerful over human beings and the powerless. To be sure, there is nothing inherently wrong when a corporation, or a landlord, or an employer or a President of the United States wins a case in a court of law. The system often works as it should even when it hands new victories to those who seldom lose at anything. But at this moment in the life of our Nation, it is vital that the next Justice of the Supreme Court be willing and able to elevate the rights of the people above the prevailing political view of the wealthiest and most powerful when the two are in conflict. I cannot conclude that Judge Gorsuch meets this standard. Therefore, I will oppose his nomination and I would urge my colleagues to do the same.  With that, I yield the floor.

587,UDALL,proceeding_id,topic-id,1644,"Thank you, Mr. We have many important responsibilities as U.We often have to make very difficult decisions. Deciding to vote against cloture and confirmation for Judge Gorsuch has been a tough decision.  Since coming to the Senate, I have been a strong advocate for reforming the rules, to curb abuses to ensure the body can function, and to make sure that the President's nominees are treated fairly. I believe our constitutional duty to provide advice and consent is one of the most important of all of our responsibilities as Senators, especially for nominees to our Nation's highest Court, and I believe that withholding consent should be rare--rare but not unheard of. Sometimes circumstances will be so extraordinary that filibustering a Supreme Court nominee is necessary. The gang of 14 knew this. That was the group of 14 Senators who forged a compromise in 2005. Three of them are still in the Their agreement allowed some controversial judicial nominees to be confirmed to appellate courts, but it also allowed the Senate to avoid triggering the nuclear option, and it addressed how they would weigh future nominations.  The gang of 14 agreed to the following: ``Nominees should be filibustered only under extraordinary circumstances and each signatory must use his or her own discretion and judgment in determining whether such circumstances exist.''  I think that is a good standard, to only filibuster a nominee under extraordinary circumstances. Unfortunately, in my evaluation of Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court, I can't think of more extraordinary circumstances.  First, this wasn't President Trump's seat to fill. Justice Scalia died on February 13, 2016. President Obama still had nearly 1 year at that point to serve in his term. So President Obama fulfilled his constitutional duty. He nominated one of the most qualified nominees in the history of the Court, Judge Merrick Shortly before Judge Garland was nominated, Senator Hatch, one of our most respected Republican colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, said Judge Garland would be a great pick. Senator Hatch went on to say that President Obama ``probably won't do that because this appointment is about the election.'' But President Obama did do it. Judge Garland is not just a fine jurist, he is an exceptional human being. Judge Garland's lifelong commitment to public service is well known. He deserved far better treatment by the Senate majority.  Judge Garland was denied a hearing. Many of my Republican colleagues wouldn't even give him the courtesy of a meeting, and he never got a vote, which was a disgrace. It is an injustice that needs to be remedied before I could ever consider voting for Judge  President Trump could fix this. He could make a commitment to nominate Judge Garland to the next vacant seat on the It would be the right thing to do. I have been very open that I believe the Senate has become dysfunctional, but what the majority did last year was unprecedented. Things went from bad to rock bottom.  Being senatorial used to mean something. The Republican majority has shattered that tradition for purely partisan reasons. In fact, the majority leader has publicly stated: ``One of my proudest moments was when I told Obama `you will not fill this Supreme Court vacancy.''' That is a violation of the U.Constitution's requirement that the Senate provide advice and consent.  Now, in 2017, Senator McConnell has guaranteed Judge Gorsuch's confirmation, even before he had his hearing. For him the outcome has been a foregone conclusion. So we see there is no advice and consent now, either, just the exercise of power to block a nominee from another party. But President Trump could help heal that deeply partisan wound inflicted by his party. There is still time for both sides to come together and work out an agreement with bipartisanship and fairness first, and put aside the bitter partisan fighting that has divided the Congress and our  There is also a pragmatic reason for President Trump to appoint Judge Garland to the next seat. President Trump needs to ask himself if he wants to be subject to the McConnell precedent. Is he willing to accept that he only gets to appoint Justices for 3 years? If a Supreme Court vacancy occurs in 2020, does President Trump understand that it is not his vacancy to fill? That is the absurd standard that Leader McConnell has established. If the Republican majority is dead-set on changing the rules to jam this nominee through after all that has happened, then we need to talk about this.  Perhaps the best thing to do in order to ensure the President understands the gravity of the Republicans' obstruction of his predecessor is to go ahead and put the McConnell rule in place for President Let's establish in our rule that President Trump only gets 3 years to appoint We can do this with a simple standing order. The majority leader believed President Obama should only have 3[[Page S2334]]years to appoint Justices, certainly the same standard must apply to President If the Republican majority thought that their policy in 2016 was good for President Obama, it should be good for President What is fair is fair.  I have a standing order drafted that would do that, and I hope an agreement can be reached to rectify the injustice that was done to Judge Garland, and I hope that Republicans will decide against using the nuclear option. But if that doesn't happen, I will call on the Senate to adopt this standing order so that President Trump was bound by the same restrictions as President  If we are going to change the rules tomorrow, then let's get the Republican majority on record. Are they prepared to hold President Trump to the same unjust standard as President Obama? We can find out.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the text of my standing order at the end of my remarks.  Unfortunately, Judge Garland's unacceptable treatment isn't the only concern that guides my decision to vote against Judge Like many things in the Trump administration, there is no shortage of extraordinary circumstances. Perhaps the most serious is the cloud of suspicion over his  U.intelligence agencies have concluded that the Russian government interfered in the U.Presidential election and that it interfered to help Candidate There are unexplained ties between the President, his campaign staff, his associates, and Russian officials. People close to the President had meetings and telephone calls with Russian officials during the campaign and transition, and, most critically, the FBI and the Department of Justice are investigating whether the President and his associates coordinated or conspired with the Russian Government to interfere with the Presidential election. It is an investigation that began last July and is likely to continue for months.  If the President or his close advisers worked with Russia to help him win the U.election, do we really want to let him appoint a Justice to the Supreme Court, someone who could be on the Court for 30 years or more? There is no reason to rush this nomination.  Remember, Republicans had no problem letting Judge Garland's appointment languish for 293 days, and President Obama wasn't under investigation. Judge Gorsuch was nominated just 64 days ago. If Republicans had treated Judge Garland's nomination with the same expediency, he would have been confirmed last May when President Obama still had 8 months in office. The unacceptable treatment of Judge Garland and the investigation into Russia's influence in the election are reasons enough to vote against Judge  But there is one more critical issue: the nominee himself. I have met with Judge Gorsuch and followed the hearing in the Senate Judiciary I carefully studied his record, and based on all of this information, I can't support his confirmation. The Supreme Court changes people's lives. Its decisions stand for generations. It is essential that Justices understand not only how these issues impact our democracy but how they affect people's lives, and that they consider them free of ideology.  Our meeting and the Senate hearings were Judge Gorsuch's opportunity to convince me that he will be an independent mind on the He failed to answer questions that were critical for me--his position on the rights of working mothers, whether women can choose their own health care decisions, LGBTQ rights, and dark money in our elections, just to name a few. But what I found most troubling is that he failed to convince me that he would be an independent voice on the  In just the last couple of months, the President has taken constitutionally questionable actions affecting Muslim immigrants, freedom of speech, and religion. The FBI is investigating his campaign, and he faces scrutiny about whether his company is benefitting from his office. All of these issues could well come in front of and before the Supreme It is more important now than ever before that we have a neutral, clearminded Justice sitting on the bench. After carefully considering all these issues, I cannot support Judge Gorsuch's confirmation. It is not an easy decision, but I believe it is the right one for our country.

589,PETERS,proceeding_id,topic-id,1011,"Mr.President, the U.Supreme Court is a pillar of our Nation's democracy, and I take very seriously the Senate's responsibility to advise and consent on nominees to serve in this revered institution. Our constitutional democracy is a system of checks and balances with three coequal branches of government. Each branch is intended to serve as a check on the other two.  If congressional Republicans are unwilling or unable to check President Trump, this leaves our courts as the last line of defense against an administration that is committed to expanding the already vast power that is provided to the  We have seen this play out over the past 2 months as President Trump has twice rolled out unconstitutional travel bans only to have Federal courts stop their implementation. The President's reaction was telling. He lashed out at the ``so-called `judge' '' and urged his Twitter followers to blame not only the judge who stayed a travel ban but the entire Federal court system should an attack occur.  Judge Gorsuch wants us all to know that he found these attacks on the judiciary ``disheartening.'' He told me as much when we met. He made a point to use the same language when in meetings with a number of my colleagues. Personally, I would say that these attacks on the judicial branch are more than disheartening--they are appalling, and I would say they are dangerous.  Judge Gorsuch is, by all accounts--and in my opinion--a good man, but as I have reviewed Judge Gorsuch's record and previous rulings, I have to say that I find them disheartening.  I find it disheartening that he has regularly sided against everyday Americans' rights, including women's reproductive rights, workers' rights, and civil rights. I find it disheartening that, instead of allowing women access to basic healthcare, Judge Gorsuch authored a concurring decision that argued that corporations have religious beliefs.  Yes, we all know that corporate law creates a legal fiction of personhood, but let's be real. Corporations are not people. They are not humans, and I have never sat next to a corporation at church. Corporations do not have religious beliefs. To say otherwise defies common sense.  Judge Gorsuch's ruling and the subsequent Supreme Court decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., is a dangerous step backward for women's health. This ruling puts corporations before people and could leave women in Michigan and across the country without access to essential healthcare services. This decision is a step backward for women. It is, instead, a step forward for the growing power that corporations have in this country. Courts not only serve as a check against a powerful executive branch, but they are supposed to put individuals on a level playing field against large, powerful corporations.  I am disheartened that Judge Gorsuch was the only Tenth Circuit judge to rule against a Detroit truckdriver who was unfairly fired for not staying in his disabled trailer after waiting for hours in dangerously cold weather. In a 2-to-1 decision in TransAm Trucking v. DOL, Judge Gorsuch ruled that TransAm Trucking[[Page S2335]]was in the right when it fired Alphonse Maddin for walking away from his disabled semi instead of risking death by hypothermia.  I am also disheartened by Judge Gorsuch's ruling on accommodations for disabled students. In Thompson R2-J School District v. Luke P., Judge Gorsuch ruled that schools only need to provide meager accommodations to satisfy the Individuals with Disabilities Education  During Judge Gorsuch's confirmation hearing, the Supreme Court handed down a decision that ruled unanimously against his position. Even the most conservative judges on the Court overruled him.  Chief Justice John Roberts powerfully wrote:       When all is said and done, a student offered an educational      program providing ``merely more than de minimis'' progress      from year to year can hardly be said to have been offered an      education at all.  Whether it is ruling against children who want an equal opportunity to get a quality education or women who want access to healthcare or a truckdriver who simply wants to make it home safely at the end of his shift, I am disheartened that Judge Gorsuch often fails to take into account the human face behind each case.  The U.Supreme Court is often the last line of defense for everyday Americans, and Judge Gorsuch's previous rulings indicate he believes that corporations have greater rights than individuals. As millions have been spent by the corporate elite in support of his nomination to the Supreme Court, the judge has failed to acknowledge how deeply the Citizens United decision has corrupted our government by opening the floodgates for special interest money to pour into our elections.  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle will tell you that Judge Gorsuch is a mainstream judge. I would argue that most Michiganders do not consider the Koch brothers or the Heritage Foundation to be mainstream. Mainstream Michiganders would tell you that our winters can be bitter cold and that you cannot sit in a stalled vehicle for hours without risking life and limb. They would tell you that corporations are not people and, therefore, do not have religious beliefs. They would tell you that all children deserve a chance at a quality education.  A lot of my colleagues will be discussing Senate procedures and rules and precedent in the coming days, and I will simply say this: Michiganders and all Americans deserve a true mainstream, consensus Supreme Court Justice who can earn broad bipartisan support and not merely squeak by.  Now, more than ever, we need the Supreme Court to be our Nation's North Star, not a weathervane that responds to rapidly shifting political winds.  Serving on the Supreme Court requires more than education, more than experience, and more than a pleasant demeanor. A Supreme Court Justice must have sound judicial philosophy and the ability to interpret the law as intended by the Constitution and by the  I am extremely concerned that Judge Gorsuch's judicial approach is out of step with mainstream Michigan values, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing his nomination.

He graduated from Columbia, Harvard, and He clerked for two Supreme Court He worked at the Justice Very importantly--and we are not hearing a lot about it from our colleagues on the other side--he was unanimously confirmed for a U.court of appeals job for the Tenth Circuit in 2006. Senators such as Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden all voted for him, as well as many of my colleagues in this body on the other side of the aisle who are still serving.  He is a westerner. We know that right now the U.Supreme Court, with the possible exception of Justice Kennedy, has no westerners. Geographical diversity on the Court is very important. This morning, my colleague Senator Murkowski talked about how the current Supreme Court is occupied by Justices who have spent almost their entire lives in the Boston, New York, DC corridor. That is not That doesn't represent the whole country. Judges in Western States focus on issues like Native-American law, lands issues, oil and gas issues. It is very important, certainly for my State of Alaska, to have a judge with that kind of background.  But it is more than facts on a page that make Judge Gorsuch such a strong candidate for the High During Senate Judiciary Committee hearings last week, his temperament was also tested and his judicial philosophy was articulated. It was clear during those hearings that Judge Gorsuch will bring a commitment to following the rule of law and that he believes no one, including the President of the United States, should be above the law. He reveres the separation of powers and the fundamental principle that it is the Congress of the United States, not the judiciary, that makes our laws.  He performed exceptionally well. He answered question after question with consistency and displayed a legal philosophy well within the mainstream of judicial thought within the United  As the Presiding Officer knows, it is not just Members of this body who are talking about Judge Gorsuch and how well qualified he is; commentators across the country have focused on how qualified Judge Gorsuch is to be our next Supreme Court Let me highlight just a few of their quotes.  This is from an editorial from the Chicago Tribune:       Here is a judge who knows the law and knows the role of the      judiciary: He isn't on the bench to make law, he's there to      interpret it faithfully.       Neil Gorsuch should be confirmed.  The Detroit News:       After two days of often hostile hearings, Supreme Court      nominee Neil Gorsuch is proving himself an even-tempered,      deeply knowledgeable nominee who should be confirmed by the      United States  The Denver Post said:       [Judge Gorsuch] possesses the fairness, independence and      open-mindedness necessary to make him a marvelous addition to      the Supreme  USA TODAY's editorial board declared: Gorsuch merits confirmation. This Supreme Court nominee is qualified within the broad judicial mainstream of  In fact, we looked to see if there was any major paper across the country or commentator who is opposed to Judge Gorsuch's nomination. It was hard to find any. It was hard to find any in any part of the country. Two former chief justices of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals--both appointed by different Presidents of different parties--stated that Judge Gorsuch ``represents the best of the judicial tradition in our country.''  Even one board member of the liberal American Constitutional Society who said he supports Democratic candidates and progressive causes declared: ``There is no principled reason to vote no on Judge Gorsuch's confirmation.''  He received the highest rating from the American Bar And it is not just the ABA, there is a long list of different groups across the country, many representing minority groups in America, who have supported Judge Gorsuch--the National Congress of American Indians, the Native American Rights Fund, the Hispanic Leadership Fund, the Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Tribes in The list goes on and on and on.  Given the broad-based support--from the left, from the right, from the center--why would my colleagues on the other side of the aisle threaten the traditions of this institution and not even allow an up-or-down vote on Judge Gorsuch? Well, I have been listening. I have been listening to the speeches to see what they are saying. It seems that some of my colleagues are focused on this vague notion of vagueness--literally, vagueness. If we listen to their comments, they talk about Judge Gorsuch's supposed ambiguity, his vagueness, his evasiveness, that he won't answer questions on how he would rule on specific cases, so they are going to oppose him because of this. Well, these are curious and, to be frank, unconvincing reasons to oppose Judge  First, as we know, a nominee is typically not expected to say how he or she would rule on future cases. Judicial nominees, whether appointed by Democratic or Republican Presidents, have said this repeatedly. I will provide a quote from a prior nomination hearing by one of our current Supreme Court She stated:       Because I am and hope to continue to be a judge, it would      be wrong for me to say or to preview in this legislative      chamber how I would cast my vote on questions the Supreme      Court may be called upon to decide. Were I to rehearse here      what I would say and how I would reason on such questions, I      would be acting injudiciously.  That was what Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg told the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1993. She continued during her confirmation hearing:       A judge sworn to decide impartially can offer no forecasts,      no hints, for that would show not only disregard for the      specifics of the particular case, it would display disdain      for the entire judicial process.  Many have called this the Ginsberg standard, one that Justices have followed in front of the Judiciary Committee during their confirmation hearings and one that Judge Gorsuch also followed. Indeed, during his hearing, Judge Gorsuch stated that if the President or others had asked such a specific question on how he would rule on a particular case, ``I would have walked out'' of the room.  So my colleagues on the other side of the aisle can't have it both ways. They say they want an independent voice on the Court, but they are also opposing Judge Gorsuch because he won't tell them how he would rule on certain cases. This is a new standard and an impossible standard to meet.  The second reason the vagueness standard of many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle in their opposition to Judge Gorsuch is unconvincing is that it ignores the fact that this is a judge with a record. They say: He is vague. We are not sure what his views are.  Judge Gorsuch has decided roughly 2,700 cases, over 800 of which he authored. There is nothing vague about that. In 97 percent of the time in those cases, he reached a unanimous decision with the other panelists on the Tenth These are not vague decisions. His judicial philosophy and temperament are on full display in literally[[Page S2338]]tens of thousands of pages of decisions in his own words. There is nothing vague about them.  My colleagues can challenge him on his mountain of legal opinions, but please, with all due respect, let's drop the facade of opposing him because of vagueness, and that they don't know what the issues are is not an argument that has much merit.  So despite widespread acclaim from groups across the country, representing a broad spectrum of liberals and conservatives, and despite a tenured, concrete record as a judge on the U.court of appeals, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle appear to want to engage in a partisan filibuster of Judge Gorsuch's nomination.  What exactly does this mean? The language, I admit, can be confusing--cloture, filibuster, 60-vote threshold. In plain English, what is really going on? It means that the minority leader right now wants to prevent the Senate from having an up-or-down vote on the merits of this Supreme Court nominee. In other words, no vote ever on the qualifications of Judge We will just filibuster.  I have been watching a number of my colleagues come to the floor and talk about what they are planning on doing. The minority leader has essentially been saying: We all do this. We are all guilty. Nothing new here. This is just a little bit of payback. This is how this place operates.  In many ways, these arguments are almost cavalier in what they are about to do. But we shouldn't buy that. I have been in the Senate only 2 years--a mere blink of an eye compared to others--and I missed a lot of the other nominations and debates in 2013, the Gang of 14 many years ago. But I like to read a lot of history, and here are some facts that are important to understand as we debate the Gorsuch confirmation:  First, there has never been a partisan filibuster of a new President's nominee for the Supreme Court--never.  Second, it has been the custom, always, of the U.Senate to give a new President's nominee an up-or-down vote. For example, Republicans gave this courtesy to President Clinton when he nominated Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993 and Stephen Breyer in 1994 and President Obama with his first-term nominees, Sonia Sotomayor in 2009 and Elana Kagan in 2010. They all got up-or-down votes.  Third, there has never been a 60-vote requirement for any Justice on the Supreme Court during the confirmation process in the U.Senate--never.  Let me go through the votes of the current Supreme Court Justices: Justice Kennedy, 97 to 0; Justice Thomas, 52 to 48; Justice Ginsburg, 96 to 3; Justice Breyer, 87 to 9; Chief Justice Roberts, 78 to 22; Justice Alito, 58 to 42; Justice Sotomayor, 68 to 31; Justice Kagan, 63 to 37.  Incidentally, Justice Scalia, whom Judge Gorsuch would be replacing, passed the vote in the U.Senate 98 to 0. Note that two of the current members of the Supreme Court were confirmed by fewer than 60 votes.  Bottom line: There has never been a 60-vote requirement in the U.Senate or a partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee during a President's first term--never.  Here is another fact equally as relevant to Judge Gorsuch's confirmation: More than any other President, more than any other Presidential election in recent memory, the one last year was clearly about the U.Supreme Republicans in the Senate and Candidate and now President Trump told the American people: There is an open seat on the U.Supreme This is an important issue. Let the people decide.  And they did. Polls show that millions of Americans ended up voting for President Trump and against Hillary Clinton based, at least in part, on which candidate they believed should nominate our next Supreme Court Justice and whether they wanted the Court to act as a superlegislature, interpreting a living Constitution, or whether they wanted a Justice in the mold of Justice Scalia, with a more modest view of how the Court should view its station in our constitutional order.  The American people, including my constituents, spoke loudly in November on this issue of the U.Supreme Court by voting against Hillary Clinton and for Donald And to his credit, President Trump kept his word on this important issue by putting forward an extremely well-qualified candidate who will be a worthy successor to Justice  Despite all this--an extremely well-qualified nominee and a national election that focused on who should fill the vacancy of the Supreme Court--it appears that the minority leader of the Senate is going to ignore the will of the American people and set a precedent dating back to our Nation's founding by leading a filibuster against Judge Neil We shouldn't allow this to happen, and we won't.  I hope my colleagues who are contemplating this will change their minds because in going forward with this filibuster, who are they really punishing? They are punishing the American people, as well as undermining the traditions of this body--a body with rules crafted carefully over the last two centuries.  As I mentioned, we need to work together in this body. In my 2 years in the Senate, I have tried hard to work with my colleagues on bipartisan issues. I have also tried hard to show all my colleagues the respect they deserve as duly elected Senators of this important body. Whatever the outcome of this vote on Judge Gorsuch, I certainly want to make clear that we need to continue respectfully working across the aisle for the sake of our Nation, and we need to rebuild trust in the But at the same time, I believe strongly that Judge Gorsuch deserves to get an up-or-down vote. I certainly encourage my colleagues to bring that vote forward and to confirm this exceptionally well-qualified candidate to be our next Supreme Court And the American people deserve as much, as well.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt2-PgS2309.txt
597,HATCH,proceeding_id,topic-id,4838,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak out against the abuse of the Executive authority. Before I do, I want to compliment the distinguished Senator from Alaska for his cogent remarks here today on the floor. He is one of the great new additions to this body, and he ought to be listened to. I personally respect him and appreciate the words he said here today.                            Antiquities Act  Mr.President, I rise today to speak out against the abuse of Executive authority under the Antiquities  Over the last two decades, past Presidents have exploited the law in the extreme, using it as a pretext to enact some of the most egregious land grabs in our Nation's history. My home State of Utah has been hit especially hard by this Federal overreach. Time and again, Presidents have abused their power under the Antiquities Act to proclaim massive monument designations--to lock away millions of acres of public land.  My State has fallen victim to not one but two catastrophic monument designations. These designations were made unilaterally, without any input whatever from our congressional delegation or even the local Utahans whose lives would be directly affected by such decisions. Rather than advancing the important cause of conservation, these national monuments have come to symbolize Washington at its worst.  How did we get here? How did a century-old law, which is intended to give Presidents only limited authority to designate special landmarks, become a blunt instrument for Executive overreach? In answering this question, some background is necessary.  In 1906, Congress passed the Antiquities Act, which granted the President limited authority to establish national monuments to protect areas containing ``historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest.'' The Antiquities Act was a well-intentioned response to a serious problem: the looting and destruction of cultural and archaeological sites.  When applied as intended, the law has been indispensable in preserving our Nation's rich cultural heritage. But the law has not always been applied as intended; rather, it has been abused, exploited, and distorted beyond all recognition. It has been hijacked by past Presidents not to preserve archaeological features but to satisfy special interests and to advance a radical political agenda--all at the expense of States' rights.[[Page S2339]]  By signing their authority under the Antiquities Act, past Presidents have seized millions of acres of public land, violating both the spirit and arguably the letter of the law. We need only look at the history of the Antiquities Act and its enactment to see how far we have come and how far we have strayed off course.  As with any law, congressional intent is key. On this point, I would like to refer to the House Congressional Record dated June 5, 1906. When asked how much land would be taken off the market in the Western States by passage of the Antiquities Act, Congressman John Lacey, the bill's lead sponsor, gave a simple response: ``Not very much.''  The bill provides that it shall be the ``smallest area necessary for the care and maintenance of the objects to be preserved.'' ``The smallest area necessary.'' These words are damning in light of recent monument designations which, far from regulating the smallest area necessary, have sought to restrict the largest area possible. I wonder what Congressman Lacey would say today if he could see how his bill has been manipulated for extreme partisan ends. I wonder what he would say if he could see how his legislation has been exploited by past Presidents to lock up entire sections of State land--all without congressional approval. And I wonder what he would say about the two most recent monuments designated in Utah: Bears Ears and the Grand Staircase-Escalante monuments. Together, these two monuments encompass 3.25 million acres--an area roughly the size of the State of To say that Congressman Lacey and his colleagues would be disappointed is an understatement.  In passing the Antiquities Act more than 100 years ago, Congress did not intend to cede undo authority to the executive branch, and they certainly did not intend for future Presidents to proclaim the massive land grabs of the recent past. They intended to give Presidents only limited authority to designate special landmarks, such as the unique national arch or the site of old cliff dwellings. Yet today, when it comes to the Antiquities Act, there is a shocking disparity between what Congress intended and what has actually happened.  As a case in point, look no further than my home State of Utah, where President Obama's last-minute, lameduck monument designation at Bears Ears is wreaking havoc on the local population. In the parting shot of his Presidency, President Obama defied the entire Utah congressional delegation and the will of his own constituents when he declared the Bears Ears a national monument. With the stroke of a pen, he locked away an astonishing 1.35 million acres--a geographic area larger than the total acreage of all five of Utah's national parks combined.  If that is not enough, consider that Utah's second most recent national monument, the Grand Staircase-Escalante, spans 1.9 million acres. That is an area double the size of all of Utah's national parks combined. When President Clinton proclaimed the Grand Staircase-Escalante a national monument more than 20 years ago, I remember standing on this very floor and speaking out then, just as I am speaking out now. My words back then are just as applicable today. I said:       While the 1906 Antiquities Act may indeed give the      President the literal authority to take this action, it is      quite clear to me that in using this authority, he is      violating the spirit of U.environmental laws. Real damage      has been done here. The failure even to consult prior to      making this decision should be considered devastating to      representative democracy.  To this day, the Grand Staircase proclamation remains among the most flagrant abuses of Presidential power I have ever seen. Without so much as a ``by your leave'' from Utahans, this unilateral action cut off access to millions of acres of land, suffocating economic development and uprooting the lives of thousands of Utahans who relied on the region's resources for their very survival. And just like Bears Ears, this designation came with no input from Utah's Governor, the Utah congressional delegation, or even local communities.  The Grand Staircase monument designation exemplified Executive overreach of the worst kind. Even Democrats were stunned by this shocking power grab, and many of them conceded to me privately when I was then shouting publicly that the President was never meant to set aside millions of acres through the Antiquities  Even the San Francisco Chronicle--by no means a conservative newspaper--panned President Clinton's Grand Staircase proclamation. In 1996, the editorial board stated:       The question is whether a decision of such magnitude should      be carried out by Executive order. We think not. This may      well be a worthy idea, but it deserves a fair hearing. It      deserves to go through public deliberations, as slow and      messy as democracy may be, to fully air the concerns.  That was more than 20 years ago. In the intervening period, nothing has changed. Bears Ears was Grand Staircase all over again. When President Obama declared the Bears Ears a national monument in the twilight hours of his Presidency, he ignored the years of work Utah's congressional delegation had spent fighting to pass legislation to protect the region via a fair and open process. He ignored the State legislature and the He ignored the stakeholders and even local Utahans who were all working together to find a workable solution. He ignored the best interest of Utah and cast aside the will of the people, all in favor of the top-down unilateral approach meant to satisfy the demands of far-left interest groups. This is Executive hubris at its worst. It was never supposed to be this way.  Congress, not the President, is solely responsible under the Constitution for the management of property and land within the Federal domain. Only through passage of the Antiquities Act can Congress grant authority to the President to make limited monument designations. Congress entrusted the executive branch with narrow authority, but the executive branch has violated that trust time and time again.  For years, I have fought to check the abuse of Executive power under the Antiquities As far as back as 1997, in the aftermath of the Grand Staircase proclamation, I introduced legislation requiring an act of Congress before the President could establish any national monument of more than 5,000 acres. As early as last year, in anticipation of the eminent Bears Ears debacle, I wrote a bill prohibiting any further extension or establishment of national monuments in Utah without express authorization from  Most recently, I have been working closely with the Trump administration from day one to right the wrongs of previous administrations. Within days of his nomination, I indicated to Secretary Ryan Zinke that undoing the harm caused by the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase monument designations was among my top priorities.  In a private meeting in my office, I even told Secretary Zinke that my support for his nomination would depend largely on his commitment to this cause. After gaining assurances from Secretary Zinke that he would work with us in this effort, I was eager to support his confirmation. I probably would have supported it anyway because he is a fine man. But I am really pleased that he agreed with me on the injustices that have occurred in  Just 2 weeks later, I found myself in the Oval Office where I engaged President Trump for over an hour on a wide-ranging discussion that focused specifically on the public lands issue. I have to say that I was amazed at the President's willingness to help. He listened intently as I relayed the fears and frustrations of thousands in our State who have been personally hurt by the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase monument designations.  I explained the urgency of addressing these devastating measures. I asked for his help in doing so. I was encouraged that, unlike his predecessor, President Trump actually took the time to listen and understand the heavy toll of such overreaching actions. Our President even assured me that he stands ready to work with us to fix this disaster. More than any of his predecessors, President Trump understands what is at stake here.  I was really buoyed up by the conversation with him in the Oval Indeed, in all my years of public service, I have never seen a President so committed to reigning in the Federal Government and so eager to fix the damage done by these overbearing monument designations. We are fortunate now to have the White House at our side in the fight for local control.[[Page S2340]]  There are many areas in this country that merit protection. I welcome the opportunity to work with my colleagues to further that cause. But the process to determine how best to protect these areas is equally important. That is why, for decades now, I have vehemently opposed unilateral actions to restrict the use of entire landscapes without even the charade of a public process.  Using the Antiquities Act to protect our public lands, we must set a new precedent of collaboration and trust between the States and the Federal I look forward to working with President Trump to establish this new precedent.  Mr I will turn to another matter of pressing importance, the confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be a Justice on the U.Supreme I have been in a lot of these battles over the years. I have to say, this one bothers me as much as any battle we have had.  In early January of this year, the Democratic leader issued a warning to then-President-Elect Donald Trump regarding the President-elect's anticipated selection of a Supreme Court nominee. Even before President Trump took the oath of office, the Democratic leader was already threatening the soon-to-be-President to either pick a ``mainstream and independent'' nominee or the Democrats would oppose the President-elect's choice ``with everything we have.''  Well, President Trump did exactly what the Democratic leader asked when he nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Not only is Judge Gorsuch a mainstream and independent judge, he is easily one of the finest and most qualified nominees to the High Court that I have seen in all my 40 years in the His selection was also the result of the most transparent Supreme Court nomination process in American history.  President Trump and Hillary Clinton both made the Supreme Court a centerpiece of their campaigns and spoke at length about the type of judge they would appoint to replace Justice Candidate Trump even made the novel pledge to nominate someone from a list of judges his campaign released to the public. This gave the American people the opportunity to vet the list and to discuss more generally the proper role of judges in our system of governance.  When the American people elected Donald Trump to be our next President, they ratified his list of candidates. When President Trump subsequently selected Neil Gorsuch from that list to be his nominee, he kept his promise to the American people. That is who I expected him to select at that time.  Judge Gorsuch's judicial record on the Tenth Circuit paints a clear picture of the judge's judicial temperament and philosophy. Of the more than 2,700 cases Judge Gorsuch has participated in on the Tenth Circuit, 97 percent of them were decided unanimously. Judge Gorsuch voted with the majority on that court 99 percent of the time, even though the majority were  In the 1 percent of the cases in which Judge Gorsuch dissented, he did so with almost the same frequency, whether the majority opinion was written by a judge nominated by a Republican or a Democrat Additionally, Judge Gorsuch has gained bipartisan support, including from President Obama's former Solicitor General, Neal Katyal, a man whom I respect, said that Judge Gorsuch is committed to the rule of law and the judiciary's independence.  Judge Gorsuch was described by six former Solicitors General appointed under four different Presidents as, ``highly respected'' and ``admired by his colleagues appointed by Presidents of both parties and law clerks of all political stripes.''  The American Bar Association gave Judge Gorsuch its highest rating of ``well qualified'' to be an Associate Justice on the Supreme I think we can all agree that this is a far cry from the profile of an extreme or activist judge. It is a far cry from that. That needs to be pointed out. I want to know how anyone can, while keeping a straight face, honestly make the case that Judge Gorsuch is anything but mainstream.  In reality, quite the opposite is true. Judge Gorsuch is exactly the kind of judge we need on the Supreme He is an impartial, thoughtful man with tremendous judicial experience, a person that you can't help but respect. He has been educated at some of the best schools in the world and has excelled at every stage of his career.  He has served with character, courage, and integrity for more than a decade on the Federal bench. It would be hard to even imagine a better, more suitable choice for the Supreme Court than Judge After seeing the judge sit through several grueling days of confirmation hearings and nearly 20 hours of questioning before the Senate Judiciary Committee, my confidence in Judge Gorsuch has only been solidified.  Despite the Democrat's best efforts before and during the hearings to distort his record, he demonstrated time and again that his judicial philosophy is to impartially interpret and apply the law and the Constitution wherever it might take him.  Now we are about to witness something unprecedented in the history of our The partisan minority is going to block a vote on a Supreme Court nominee. In all of the Senate's 228-year history, that has never happened before. Three Supreme Court nominees have faced filibusters in our Nation's history. The first, Abe Fortas, faced a bipartisan filibuster by Senators of both parties concerned about Fortas's questionable ethics background.  The second and third, William Rehnquist and Samuel Alito, endured partisan filibusters by Democrats who disagreed with these nominee's judicial philosophies. The filibuster against Fortas succeeded, in part, because Fortas lacked a clear majority support, and, in part, because he was ethically compromised. The filibusters against Rehnquist and Alito, by contrast, failed. Rehnquist and Alito both enjoyed clear majority support and both were confirmed. But that was a different Senate at the time. There was a lot more open mindedness about the qualifications of these judges and their right to sit on the bench.  I regret to say that we are likely to add a fourth filibustered Supreme Court nominee, Neil Like Justices Rehnquist and Alito, Judge Gorsuch enjoys clear majority support. Like Justices Rehnquist and Alito, Judge Gorsuch faces opposition from Senate Democrats who don't like his judicial philosophy. Why, I will never understand. In particular, they object that Judge Gorsuch takes the law as he finds it, rather than trying to bend the law toward liberal social ends.  Unlike Justice Rehnquist and Alito, however, Judge Gorsuch is apparently not going to clear the 60-vote threshold for cloture. This is because Senate Democrats, with only a few exceptions, have concluded that no nominee who does not subscribe to their views of hot-button social issues should be allowed to serve on the Supreme Never, never, in the history of this body has the Senate allowed a partisan minority to defeat a Supreme Court nomination for which there is clear majority support.  The only successful filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee in our Nation's history was bipartisan, and it involved an ethically compromised nominee, Abe Fortas, who resigned from the bench shortly after his nomination failed rather than face impeachment for serious conflict-of-interest violations. Those circumstances are not even remotely comparable to the situation we face today.  The filibuster of Judge Gorsuch, should it go forward, will be entirely partisan. It will have nothing to do with Judge Gorsuch's ethics or character, which are above reproach, and it will occur in the face of clear majority support for the nominee.  Senate Democrats' decision to block Judge Gorsuch should come as no surprise to anyone who has been following the confirmation wars for more than the last 5 seconds. My Democratic colleagues will no doubt shout to the hilltops--some of them. There are some that are standing up here too. But they will shout to the hilltops that Republicans are ruining the Senate if we decide to put a stop to their unprecedented obstruction of this nominee.  They will no doubt cry that the 60-vote threshold for cloture on Supreme Court nominees is sacrosanct and that by putting an end to Democrats' unprecedented obstruction, Republicans are somehow undermining this institution's ideals.[[Page S2341]]  When the American people hear these claims, when they hear Senate Democrats argue that Republicans should respond to their unprecedented obstruction by allowing a nomination with clear majority support to fail, they should recognize these arguments for what they are: hypocrisy. The fact is, we are only in this situation, forced to choose between rewarding Democrat obstructionism and changing the Senate's rules, because of Democrats and the campaign they have waged against qualified judicial nominees for the past 30 years.  Every single escalation of the confirmation wars can be laid at the feet of This is a simple truth, and nothing my colleagues on the other side of the aisle can say can change it. I speak from experience. I have been here for through all of it. I was here in 1987 when Democrats started the confirmation wars with their disgraceful treatment of Robert Bork, one of the greatest lawyers in the country and a person who was supremely qualified to be on the Supreme  I remember vividly the day the late Senator from Massachusetts came to this floor and smeared Judge Bork as a man would somehow turn back the clock to darker days in our Nation's past. I have to say, Senate Democrats twisted Judge Bork's words, misrepresented his record, and in sum, did their best to turn a good and decent man into some sort of a monster.  In their scorched-earth campaign against Robert Bork, Senate Democrats sowed seeds of destruction that are coming now to full fruition.  Next came Clarence My Democratic colleagues learned from their Bork experience that fabrications and misinterpretations can bring down even the most qualified nominee, so they set to work on Judge Not satisfied merely with denigrating Judge Thomas's professional qualifications, they set out to destroy him personally as well.  I have been in the Senate for 41 years, and never in all my time have I seen a lower moment than the way the Senate Democrats treated Clarence No baseless allegation, no lurid lie was too low for my Democratic colleagues' attention. To his great credit, Judge Thomas endured this slander with dignity and respect and was confirmed by a slim 52-to-48 margin.  Thankfully, after the Thomas ordeal, we stepped back from the brink. When Bill Clinton became President and had two Supreme Court vacancies early in his term, Senate Republicans did not play tit for tat. Instead, we gave Justices Ginsburg and Breyer fair hearings and confirmed them overwhelmingly. And how did Senate Democrats pay us back for our fair treatment of President Clinton's nominees? They filibustered President George Bush's nominees.  I have used the word ``unprecedented'' to describe Democrats' expected filibuster of Judge Well, what the Democrats did to President Bush's judicial nominees was also unprecedented. For the first time in history, Senate Democrats successfully filibustered 10 court of appeals nominees. These were nominees with majority support in this body. These were nominees who would have been confirmed had they gotten an up-or-down vote. I cannot overstate how dramatic a change this was to Senate norms and procedures. For the first time in history, Senate Democrats created an effectual 60-vote threshold for judicial nominees. Remember that Clarence Thomas was confirmed with only 52 votes. Had Senate Democrats filibustered his nomination, it would have been defeated. But they didn't because partisan filibusters of nominees with majority support were simply not in the accepted playbook. What Senate Democrats did during George Bush's Presidency changed the Senate forever.  Next up was Samuel Like Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice Alito faced a partisan filibuster by Senate Like Chief Justice Rehnquist, he overcame that filibuster. But what is notable about Justice Alito is he received fewer than 60 votes for confirmation. He overcame the filibuster because 19 Senate Democrats voted to end debate on his nomination even though only 4 ultimately voted for confirmation. Fifteen Senate Democrats chose not to filibuster Justice Alito even though they opposed his nomination because they recognized that filibustering a Supreme Court nominee with clear majority support had no precedent in this body's norms or history.  What happened when Barack Obama became President and Republicans had an opportunity for payback? Did they filibuster Sonya Sotomayor and Elena Kagan? Of course not. Indeed, many Republicans voted against Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan, but no Republican tried to prevent their nominations from coming to a vote. Once again, Senate Democrats escalated confirmation wars, and Senate Republicans chose not to reciprocate.  How did Democrats pay us back for our restraint on Justices Sotomayor and Kagan? They nuked the filibuster for lower court nominees. The irony of this move is really something. It was the Democrats who, 10 years earlier, for the first time in Senate history, began the practice of filibustering courts of appeal judges in an effort to stop President Bush's nominees. When Senate Republicans then had the gall not to roll over for President Obama once the shoe was on the other foot, Democrats simply changed the rules back to what they were in practice 10 years prior. Democrats, that is, raised the effectual confirmation threshold to 60 votes by instigating filibusters to block Republican nominees and then lowered it back down to 50 votes to push through Democratic nominees. They did so after only seven failed cloture votes. The Republicans, by contrast, endured 20 failed cloture votes during President Bush's term and never changed the rules.  That brings us to today. Having Borked Judge Bork, smeared Justice Thomas, instigated the filibuster for lower court nominees when it was in their interest, filibustered Justice Alito, and then eliminated the filibuster for lower court nominees when it was in their interest, Senate Democrats now expect Republicans to drop our hands and allow them to block Judge Gorsuch--an unquestionably qualified nominee with broad support from across the legal community and the country as a whole.  Enough, Mr. We have let our Democratic colleagues get away with their games for too long. They were for the filibuster before they were against it before they were for it. They were the ones who created an effectual 60-vote threshold for judicial nominees. They were the ones who then undid that threshold to assist their short-term political interests when they were in power. They are the ones who now, for the first time in history, are seeking to block a Supreme Court nominee with clear majority support.  To put the matter bluntly, my Republican colleagues and I are fed up with these Democratic Party antics. We will no longer be bound by their games and petty partisanship. We will no longer allow them to dictate the terms of debate in ways that always advantage their side and always disadvantage ours.  I regret deeply the point we have arrived at. I am an institutionalist. I love the Senate and what it represents. I love my Democratic colleagues, and they know it. I have been very fair to them through the years, and I continue to be. I value debate, and I honor bipartisanship. But 30 years ago, my Democratic colleagues sent us down this path, and they have done nothing in the years since to turn us from this course. To the contrary, they have only hastened our descent.  If Democrats will filibuster a person like Judge Gorsuch, they will filibuster anyone--anyone--who holds to the traditional judicial values Republicans embrace. Neil Gorsuch is as good as they come. If he is not good enough for Democrats, no one will be.  Democrats demand that Republicans choose a nominee they would choose if they held the White House, when that has never been the standard for Supreme Court nominees and defies all logic and common sense. They demand the power to veto President Trump's choice even though the Supreme Court was, in all likelihood, the issue that won him the election. And I believe that. And they demand that Republicans keep the rules sacrosanct when they have changed the rules and changed the rules and changed the rules.  I am not happy that we are where we are, but I can say without reservation[[Page S2342]]that we are here because of what Democrats have done over the past 30 years to poison the confirmation process.  I am about to change the rules if necessary to put Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme I won't be happy about that, but I will do it because Judge Gorsuch deserves confirmation and because I refuse to reward Democrats for 30 years of bad faith in blocking, stalling, and smearing Republican nominees.  Enough, Mr. I hope my colleagues will come to their senses and realize that we ought to be working to support people of the quality of Judge Neil There will come a time when they are going to have nominees before this body--I kind of hope that doesn't happen, but I think it is bound to happen--and when they do, I hope my fellow Republicans won't treat their nominees the way they are treating ours. It is abominable, it is abysmal, it is wrong, and I think it is time for everybody in this country to know that.

599,BLUMENTHAL,proceeding_id,topic-id,3100,"Mr.President, we will vote today and tomorrow on the Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, in the midst of a looming constitutional crisis. Only in the past few weeks, the Director of the FBI has confirmed that his agency is investigating ties between President Trump's associates and Russian meddling in our recent election.  The urgent need for an impartial investigation and the possibility of the Supreme Court's having to rule on a subpoena directed to the President of the United States is very real. The repeat of United States v. Nixon is far from idle speculation. The independence of our judicial branch has never been more important. It has never been more threatened.  When the story of this constitutional crisis is written, I believe that the heroes will be an independent judiciary and a free press. An independent judiciary is the bulwark against overreaching and autocratic tyranny, and the free press has uncovered much of the facts that have prompted the FBI investigation and, I hope, eventually--sooner rather than later--an independent prosecutor because only a special prosecutor can bring criminal charges that will hold accountable wrongdoers who have broken our criminal laws.  In this constitutional crisis, respect for an independent judiciary is more important than ever before, but it is threatened by forces that are powerful and undeniable. It was threatened first by the denial to Merrick Garland of a hearing and a vote, relying on an invented principle found nowhere in the Constitution that the President of the United States--then Barack Obama--somehow lost his power to appoint Justices during the fourth year of his term. That act of political expediency demeaned this institution, the U.Senate, and it also disrespected our judiciary. It dragged the Supreme Court into the partisan mire that has caused such drastic dysfunction in this branch of government.  President Trump demonstrated his own disrespect for the judiciary through his constant, repeated, relentless attacks, calling one member of the bench a ``so-called judge'' simply because he ruled against him and struck down on constitutional grounds President Trump's illegal travel ban--really a Muslim ban. His demeaning and disparaging comments have attempted to shake the foundation of respect for judicial rulings that have held him accountable and potentially every President accountable to the American people, along with the Senate and the House of He has attempted to convince his audience that judges who rule against him are not only wrong but illegitimate--in one case, because of a judge's ethnic heritage.  I would have thought that there would have been bipartisan shock and outrage at such suggestions, but the silence across the aisle has been deafening. Such a campaign by the Executive against the judicial branch would be extraordinarily disturbing regardless of the circumstances but particularly so now in the midst of this constitutional challenge.  President Trump's disrespect for the judiciary was emphasized, as well, by how he selected his nominee for the Court and how he established a litmus test for that nominee. He proudly proclaimed that litmus test, declaring on multiple occasions that his nominee would automatically overturn Roe v. Wade and strike down gun violence prevention measures. He outsourced that selection process to extreme rightwing groups, like the Heritage Foundation, choosing from their list, from their preapproved selectees. Against this backdrop, President Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme  I want to make clear that despite my outrage about what happened to Merrick Garland, which was far worse than a filibuster--one of my colleagues has termed it the ``filibuster of all filibusters''--and despite my deep concern over a nomination from a President who so disrespects the judicial branch, I was prepared to give Judge Gorsuch a fair hearing. I believe my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee and I provided that hearing, and we will provide a vote.  I strongly believe that during this process, Judge Gorsuch had a special obligation to be forthcoming. I want to be clear that that is not opining on cases or controversies that may come before him or issues that may be before his Court if he is confirmed. Unlike prior nominees, he absolutely refused to say whether he agreed with core principles and precedents, well-established and long-accepted decisions of the Supreme Court that embody and enshrine principles that the American people have accepted and that they expect the Supreme Court to implement.  There is no tradition of a Supreme Court nominee's refusing to answer every question posed to him as Neil Gorsuch did, even questions about iconic cases. Justice Kennedy and Chief Justice Roberts answered unambiguously that they believed that Brown v. Board of Education was rightly decided. Justice Roberts also said of the decision in Griswold v. Connecticut: ``I agree with the Griswold Court's conclusion.'' On the related case of Eisenstadt v. Baird, Justice Alito said: ``I do agree with the result in Eisenstadt.'' Such statements do not prejudice any litigants or prejudge any cases; instead, they provided Senators and, more importantly, the American people with the confidence that these Justices adhere to long-settled legal principles that have formed the basis of critically important cases that came afterward. How far these principles may extend is a live issue, but their underlying legitimacy is not and should not be.  Unfortunately, at his hearing, Judge Gorsuch would tell us only that Griswold and Eisenstadt were precedents--or decisions--of the Court, and he doubled down on his evasiveness in response to written questions that were submitted just last week. There was no reason for him to diverge from the kinds of answers that were provided by Justice Roberts and Justice Alito unless he, unlike them, disagreed with the reasoning that was used in these cases.  These cases go to the core of the right to privacy and equal treatment under the rule of law. The constitutional right to privacy underlies not[[Page S2343]]just the rights of couples to use contraception, which was the issue in Griswold and Eisenstadt, but the right of women to control their own bodies, as established in Roe v. Wade, and couples of different races to marry, as established in Loving v. Virginia, or the right of same-sex couples to equal treatment, as established in Lawrence v. Texas and Obergefell v. Justice Brandeis, in one of the original privacy decisions, called this right to privacy ``the right to be left alone,'' and it is a core constitutional principle that Chief Justice Roberts endorsed as well.  If Judge Gorsuch does not believe in this fundamental right or equal protection under the rule of law, the American people deserve to know it. Unfortunately, his continued evasion of my questions and those of others tells a different story. I am left with the inescapable conclusion that Judge Gorsuch passed the Trump litmus test--an automatically anti-choice, pro-gun conservative and an acolyte of hard-right special interests who screened and selected his name. Yet I am equally and maybe more concerned by Judge Gorsuch's approach to cases dealing with worker safety and consumer rights, issues relating to clean air and water and the fundamental role of the public sector in protecting individuals and putting their rights above corporate interests.  The important concerns my colleagues and I have raised have been caricatured by some Senate Republicans to a belief that judges should always rule for sympathetic plaintiffs, and that is simply not so. The TransAm Trucking case, which has been discussed at length on the floor and in committee, is of concern not because of the individual but because of the reasoning he used. He relied on a handpicked dictionary definition to rule against a worker who left his truck as he was under threat of grave physical peril and perhaps death, and he distorted the meaning of the statute, leaving aside basic common sense and feeling. He called Congress's declared statutory purpose--protecting health and safety--too ``ephemeral and generic'' to provide an interpretive guide. That is how he characterized our purpose here in protecting the safety of workers. This approach shows that Judge Gorsuch looks for guidance not in the words that Congress has chosen but in his own dictionary. And it may not even be Webster's; it may be the dictionary that is in his head or is in the heads of the rightwing groups who screened and proposed his name.  Then there is Judge Gorsuch's open hostility to the Chevron doctrine, which is a term that was likely meaningless and incomprehensible to most Americans before these proceedings and may be again after we are done. Yet it is a profoundly important principle of law that essentially stands against judicial activism--the very defect that many of our Republican colleagues believe is too characteristic of the courts today.  The structure of our government depends on the flexibility of these agencies that protect the purity of our drinking water, the safety of workers on construction sites, the integrity of our financial markets, and much, much more, so that it may do its job and enforce rules and laws that provide not only protection for ordinary people, everyday Americans, but also a level playing field for the good guys who want to do the right thing, and they are the majority of businesses in this country.  The proposed abandoning of the Chevron doctrine that Judge Gorsuch supports would eviscerate the enforcement of these basic rules that protect workers and consumers--people who drink water in their homes and breathe the air and go to work every day and expect to come home safely, as well as people who invest their money in a way that is protected against fraud.  As Emily Bazelon and Eric Posner wrote this Sunday in the New York Times:       Judge Gorsuch is skeptical that Congress can use broadly      written laws to delegate authority to agencies in the first      place. That can only mean that at least portions of such      statutes--the source of so many regulations that safeguard      Americans' welfare--must be sent back to Congress, to redo or      not.  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, 1, 2017]                  The Government Gorsuch Wants To Undo                   (By Emily Bazelon and Eric Posner)       At recent Senate hearings to fill the Supreme Court's open      seat, Judge Neil Gorsuch came across as a thoroughly bland      and nonthreatening nominee. The idea was to give as little      ammunition as possible to opponents when his nomination comes      up this week for a vote, one that Senate Democrats may try to      upend with a filibuster.       But the reality is that Judge Gorsuch embraces a judicial      philosophy that would do nothing less than undermine the      structure of modern government--including the rules that keep      our water clean, regulate the financial markets and protect      workers and consumers. In strongly opposing the      administrative state, Judge Gorsuch is in the company of      incendiary figures like the White House adviser Steve Bannon,      who has called for its ``deconstruction.'' The Republican-     dominated House, too, has passed a bill designed to severely      curtail the power of federal agencies.       Businesses have always complained that government      regulations increase their costs, and no doubt some      regulations are ill-conceived. But a small group of      conservative intellectuals have gone much further to argue      that the rules that safeguard our welfare and the orderly      functioning of the market have been fashioned in a way that's      not constitutionally legitimate. This once-fringe cause of      the right asserts, as Judge Gorsuch put it in a speech last      year, that the administrative state ``poses a grave threat to      our values of personal liberty.''       The 80 years of law that are at stake began with the New      President Franklin Roosevelt believed that the Great      Depression was caused in part by ruinous competition among      companies. In 1933, Congress passed the National Industrial      Recovery Act, which allowed the president to approve ``fair      competition'' standards for different trades and industries.      The next year, Roosevelt approved a code for the poultry      industry, which, among other things, set a minimum wage and      maximum hours for workers, and hygiene requirements for      slaughterhouses. Such basic workplace protections and      constraints on the free market are now taken for granted.       But in 1935, after a New York City slaughterhouse operator      was convicted of violating the poultry code, the Supreme      Court called into question the whole approach of the New      Deal, by holding that the N.I.R.was an ``unconstitutional      delegation by Congress of a legislative power.'' Only      Congress can create rules like the poultry code, the justices      said. Because Congress did not define ``fair competition,''      leaving the rule-making to the president, the N.I.R.     violated the Constitution's separation of powers.       The court's ruling in Schechter Poultry v. the United      States, along with another case decided the same year, are      the only instances in which the Supreme Court has ever struck      down a federal statute based on this rationale, known as the      ``nondelegation doctrine.'' Schechter Poultry's stand against      executive-branch rule-making proved to be a legal dead end,      and for good reason. As the court has recognized over and      over, before and since 1935, Congress is a cumbersome body      that moves slowly in the best of times, while the economy is      an incredibly dynamic system. For the sake of business as      well as labor, the updating of regulations can't wait for      Congress to give highly specific and detailed directions.       The New Deal filled the gap by giving policy-making      authority to agencies, including the Securities and Exchange      Commission, which protects investors, and the National Labor      Relations Board, which oversees collective bargaining between      unions and employers. Later came other agencies, including      the Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety      and Health Administration (which regulates workplace safety)      and the Department of Homeland Still other agencies      regulate the broadcast spectrum, keep the national parks      open, help farmers and assist Americans who are overseas.      Administrative agencies coordinated the response to 11,      kept the Ebola outbreak in check and were instrumental to      ending the last financial crisis. They regulate the safety of      food, drugs, airplanes and nuclear power plants. The      administrative state isn't optional in our complex society.      It's indispensable.       But if the regulatory power of this arm of government is      necessary, it also poses a risk that federal agencies, with      their large bureaucracies and potential ties to lobbyists,      could abuse their power. Congress sought to address that      concern in 1946, by passing the Administrative Procedure Act,      which ensured a role for the judiciary in overseeing rule-     making by agencies.       The system worked well enough for decades, but questions      arose when Ronald Reagan came to power promising to      deregulate. His E.P.sought to weaken a rule, issued by the      Carter administration, which called for regulating      ``stationary sources'' of air pollution--a broad wording that      is open to interpretation. When President Reagan's E.P.     narrowed the definition of what counted as a ``stationary      source'' to allow plants to emit more pollutants, an      environmental group challenged the agency. The Supreme Court      held in 1984 in Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council      that the E.P.(and any agency) could determine the[[Page S2344]]     meaning of an ambiguous term in the law. The rule came to be      known as Chevron deference: When Congress uses ambiguous      language in a statute, courts must defer to an agency's      reasonable interpretation of what the words mean.       Chevron was not viewed as a left-leaning decision. The      Supreme Court decided in favor of the Reagan administration,      after all, voting 6 to 0 (three justices did not take part),      and spanning the ideological spectrum. After the conservative      icon Justice Antonin Scalia reached the Supreme Court, he      declared himself a Chevron fan. ``In the long run Chevron      will endure,'' Justice Scalia wrote in a 1989 article,      ``because it more accurately reflects the reality of      government, and thus more adequately serves its needs.''       That was then. But the Reagan administration's effort to      cut back on regulation ran out of steam. It turned out that      the public often likes regulation--because it keeps the air      and water clean, the workplace safe and the financial system      in working order. Deregulation of the financial system led to      the savings-and-loans crisis of the 1980s and the financial      crisis a decade ago, costing taxpayers billions.       Businesses, however, have continued to complain that the      federal government regulates too much. In the past 20 years,      conservative legal scholars have bolstered the red-tape      critique with a constitutional one. They argued that only      Congress--not agencies--can create rules. This is Schechter      Poultry all over again.       And Judge Gorsuch has forcefully joined in. Last year, in a      concurring opinion in an immigration case called Gutierrez-     Brizuela v. Lynch, he attacked Chevron deference, writing      that the rule ``certainly seems to have added prodigious new      powers to an already titanic administrative state.''      Remarkably, Judge Gorsuch argued that Chevron--one of the      most frequently cited cases in the legal canon--is      illegitimate in part because it is out of step with (you      guessed it) Schechter Never mind that the Supreme      Court hasn't since relied on its 1935 attempt to scuttle the      New Nonetheless, Judge Gorsuch wrote that in light of      Schechter Poultry, ``you might ask how is it that Chevron--a      rule that invests agencies with pretty unfettered power to      regulate a lot more than chicken--can evade the chopping      block.''       At his confirmation hearings, Judge Gorsuch hinted that he      might vote to overturn Chevron without saying so directly,      noting that the administrative state existed long before      Chevron was decided in 1984. The implication is that little      would change if courts stopped deferring to the E.P.A.'s or      the Department of Labor's reading of a statute. Judges would      interpret the law. Who could object to that?       But here's the thing: Judge Gorsuch is skeptical that      Congress can use broadly written laws to delegate authority      to agencies in the first place. That can mean only that at      least portions of such statutes--the source of so many      regulations that safeguard Americans' welfare--must be sent      back to Congress, to redo or not.       On the current Supreme Court, only Justice Clarence Thomas      seeks to strip power from the administrative state by      undercutting Chevron and even reviving the obsolete and      discredited nondelegation doctrine, as he explains in      opinions approvingly cited by Judge But President      Trump may well appoint additional justices, and the other      conservatives on the court have expressed some uneasiness      with Chevron, though as yet they are not on board for      overturning it. What would happen if agencies could not make      rules for the financial industry and for consumer,      environmental and workplace protection? Decades of experience      in the United States and around the world teach that the      administrative state is a necessary part of the modern market      economy. With Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, we will be      one step closer to testing that premise.  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt2-PgS2309.txt
600,BLUMENTHAL,proceeding_id,topic-id,424,"His philosophy represents the height of activism, because it would allow courts to substitute their policy judgments for agency expertise. Abandoning the Chevron doctrine and the principles it represents invokes a desire to destroy a broad array of rules that protect critical rights. One such rule was issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in the aftermath of a Connecticut tragedy at L'Ambiance Plaza decades ago when a collapse killed 28 workers in Bridgeport, The rule prohibiting the use of the lift slab construction technique that led to L'Ambiance's collapse has now saved the lives of others. But would it have survived a review by Judge Gorsuch? My fear is that he would have struck it down and substituted the activist instinct of a judge instead--protecting the corporations that might use it.  Today we still know very little about Judge Gorsuch's core beliefs because he evaded so many questions. But here is what we do know. We know that the man who hired him has said he passes his rightwing litmus test. We know that conservative organizations have spent millions of dollars on the prospect that he will move American law dramatically to the right. And we know that he will not answer questions that his Republican-appointed predecessors answered about core tenets of American jurisprudence. In short, he has left us with substantial doubt.  Let me conclude on this note--that doubt. Important and critical doubt that should preclude us from confirming him today leaves women wondering how long they will have autonomy over their healthcare decisions, same-sex couples questioning whether they might be denied the right to marry the person they love, workers and consumers doubting their rights, and Americans fearing the Court will abandon protections of privacy, equality, and the rule of law.

602,WHITEHOUSE,proceeding_id,topic-id,2155,"Mr.President, this is my 163rd ``Time to Wake Up'' speech. I persist in the hope that one day these little water drops will ultimately cut through the stone of fossil fuel intransigence.  Last week our new President, Donald Trump, announced an Executive order aiming to wipe out many of his predecessors' climate change measures. So I would like to take some time this evening to examine his Executive order--which is, in many respects, a sham--and show how very far away it is from the actual wishes of the American people.  So to set the scene, exactly as the big polluters wanted, the Trump Executive order purports to roll back climate protections. It seeks to change rules for how industry controls methane leaks from natural gas extraction and to lift a ban on new coal leases on our Federal lands. It signals an effort to unwind the Clean Power Plan, which has helped put us on track to sharply reduce carbon emissions over the next decade. Typical for this insider-friendly administration, it is a polluter's wish list, but terrible for the American people--sad, as the President would say.  President Trump promises that this will revitalize the coal industry, but it won't. Appalachian coal is being crushed in the market by Wyoming coal, and cheap natural gas is crushing both Appalachian coal and Wyoming coal, and ever-cheaper renewables are catching up on them all. So like so much of what this Oval Office does, this was political theatrics, not real policy.  The Clean Power Plan is going nowhere because America is not, despite Trump's best efforts, a banana republic. The administrative agencies that Trump directed to stop taking action on climate change are actually obliged to follow the law, and they will be held to the law. Under the Administrative Procedures Act, these agencies have to follow real facts, not conjure up ``alternative facts'' from the fever swamp of the Breitbart imagination. Their record and their decisions will be reviewed by courts--not ``so-called'' courts, real courts. Administrative agencies cannot make decisions that are, to use the standard of administrative law, arbitrary and capricious. This is an Oval Office that lives by being arbitrary and capricious, but administrative agencies cannot be, or their work will be thrown out in court.[[Page S2345]]  The question of carbon dioxide as a pollutant has been settled by the U.Supreme Even Administrator Pruitt seems to recognize the folly of trying to undo the EPA carbon dioxide endangerment finding. So we have, as a matter of law, a dangerous pollutant, and under the law, it must be regulated. So this performance of the Trump Show is a waste of time because ultimately lawyers and courts will give the law--the law--the final say.  Courts are actually pretty good places for addressing climate change. It is very hard for the lies that are at the heart of climate denial to withstand judicial scrutiny. Smelly conflicts of interest can be exposed, and administrators with those smelly conflicts can be removed or recused. Judges aren't supposed to be influenced by campaign contributions or political threats. The law, and real facts, not alternative facts, prevail.  In litigation like the cases in New York and Oregon, the fossil fuel industry will face discovery, testimony, and cross-examination. Lawyers and courts will ultimately force things back on track. In the meantime, this Trump show makes losers of the American people. The Clean Power Plan is a reasonable approach to confronting our carbon problem. It gives States flexibility, and it would save American families $85 a year on energy costs once fully implemented. Good luck making a better plan.  I represent Rhode Island, a downwind State prone to air pollution from out-of-State smokestacks. We are also a coastal State, where rising seas driven by climate change threaten our coastal towns. I am sure the Presiding Officer can sympathize with the risk to coastal communities as the sea levels rise.  Just this past week, our Providence Journal had a story that said there are seven water treatment plants that are in danger of inundation in a 100-year storm, which, of course, is becoming more and more likely each year. So for Rhode Island, reducing carbon pollution and other greenhouse gases is part of preserving the map of the State we love and protecting the health of our people.  We need EPA, because our State environmental agency can't regulate out-of-State pollution. That brings me to the man standing next to the President as he signed this order, EPA Administrator Scott He is a man who built his career raising money from the industry, and for years lent his badge of office to the industry-enabled legal assault on the Clean Power As you might imagine, he beamed as President Trump passed him the pen used to sign the Executive order.  Years ago, in Central and South America, fruit company puppets ruled banana republics. They wore ostentatious uniforms and enjoyed the trappings of power, but it was the fruit company backers who really called the shots. That is why banana republics are called banana republics. The fossil fuel industry is well on its way to try to turn America into a banana republic, but it won't work. It is a stain upon the Senate that Pruitt actually got through the Senate without ever having to disclose who funded his political dark money operation. That is a first. That is a first. The Republican majority would not have those questions answered because they were so eager to shove this fossil fuel operative into the Administrator's seat at Inconvenient questions like that wouldn't get answered in banana republics, either.  While fossil fuel interests have been calling the shots in Washington, the American people have been of an entirely different mind. Let me show several polls that have come out over the past few weeks documenting public concern about climate change.  The Gallup poll shown here found that 71 percent of the American people believe climate change is happening--71 percent. Seventy-one percent trust scientists that, in fact, climate change is happening; 68 percent believe that global warming is caused by human activities; 62 percent believe we are already feeling the effects of climate change in our lives; and 45 percent worry a great deal--worry a great deal--about global warming.  A recent poll indicates that climate change is the top worry for 66 percent of  Yale's program on Climate Change Communication recently launched an extensive interactive map. It was featured recently in the New York It shows that Americans all over the country overwhelmingly believe that climate change is real and support a variety of actions to address it. So let's start with what Americans believe. Seventy percent believe that global warming is happening, and 53 percent believe it is caused mostly by human activities. Most scientists think that global warming is happening--that is a near majority--and 71 percent trust scientists about global warming. That, by the way, compares to 9 percent of the Republican Senate caucus when we called a vote on the issue last So if we are looking for who is out of step here, it is the Republican Senate caucus that is very out of step with the public.  And when you go on to solutions, 82 percent of Americans want research into renewable energy sources; 75 percent want to regulate CO2 as a pollutant; and 69 percent want to set strict CO2 limits on existing coal-fired powerplants.  Actually, the Clean Power Plan was a good deal softer than strict CO2 limits, and even then, 69 percent of Americans support it, and 66 percent of Americans support requiring utilities to produce 20 percent of their electricity from renewable sources.  So my colleagues from Republican States might think this data is representative of people living in their districts, that this is being biased by concern from blue Well, here is a State-by-State look. So these are all the The colors reflect the percentage of Americans who think that climate change is happening. The break point from blue to tan is the 50-percent break point. So in every single State in the Union, no matter how red, a majority of Americans understand that climate change is happening. How that 50 percent ends up being 9 percent on the Senate floor is a story that I have told in other speeches. But we will see that at 45 percent, it is just pale blue. There is not a bit of pale blue anywhere. The entire country is above 50 percent.  So the next item this allows us to look at is Americans who support funding for research into renewables. Now, the lowest color here is the kind of deep orange and that comes in at 75 percent. That is the lowest point of any State in wanting support funding for research into renewables--75 percent--and it goes all the way up into the 90s.  For renewable research in coal country, we see 82 percent support in Wyoming; 81 percent support in West Virginia; 79 percent support in Kentucky; and the same in the oil patch--79 percent of Texans support renewables. Despite this support, President Trump recently proposed massive cuts, showing once again that the Trump show is not the America show even in fossil fuel  The support for carbon dioxide limits on existing coal-fired plants is also widespread. In all 50 States--in all 435 red, blue, and purple congressional districts--there is majority support, every single place. So what did President Trump and the fossil fuel operative at EPA do in the face of this? Signed this silly Executive order purporting to undo the Clean Power  Yale's map allows us to do some interesting stuff. It is interactive, so we can zoom in. Let's take a quick zoom in Oklahoma, Administrator Pruitt's home  As we can see, in every congressional district, a majority of Oklahomans believe climate change is happening, trust climate scientists about climate change, support regulating carbon dioxide as a pollutant, and support setting strict carbon dioxide limits on existing coal-fired powerplants--even in  So who is Scott Pruitt representing? Because he is certainly not representing any State in the country, any congressional district in the country, certainly not representing Oklahoma or any congressional district in  Interestingly, not too long ago, President Trump and his children were on the same page as those majorities of Oklahomans and I have shown this before: In 2009, Donald, Ivanka, Donald Junior, and Eric Trump supported meaningful and effective measures--in an ad in the New York Times to fight climate change--calling[[Page S2346]]climate change ``scientifically irrefutable'' and warning that its consequences would be ``catastrophic and irreversible.'' So 7 years ago, the entire Trump family recognized that climate change was based on scientifically irrefutable evidence and had catastrophic irreversible consequences.  Despite the popularity of getting something done on climate change in every single congressional district in the country, we do nothing. What is up with that, if not politics--fossil fuel industry politics? The most voracious special interest in American politics, the fossil fuel industry, has captured the Trump show, installed its flunkies at the EPA, and hopes to unwind environmental and public health safeguards that the public supports.  So I have to keep asking the fossil fuel guys: How do you think this ends? Are you delusional enough to believe that you can defeat real science and ignore both the laws of nature and the will of the American people?  It is bonkers. It is political power run amuck.  We have a chance to push back a little bit. Scientists will be marching in Washington, DC, and around the country on April 22 to reject the phony-baloney alternative facts of President Please join them wherever you can. The following weekend, people from around the country are coming to DC--April 29--for the People's Climate I was in the People's Climate March in September 2014 with more than 400,000 other concerned Americans, and it was a heartening and energizing experience. So mark your calendars for April 22 and for April 29, and come to DC or to the satellite marches being held around the country.  As these maps have shown, you are not alone in seeking climate action. Every single congressional district in the country wants climate action. It is only the death grip of the fossil fuel industry on this building that prevents that from happening.  So help make these the last days of denial by this dirty industry and its rightwing climate denial fanatics. As days and months slip by, we lose precious time to address both the harm to Mother Earth of climate change and the harm to America of being made ridiculous around the world by our obeisance to the fossil fuel industry. We are supposed to be the city on the hill, not fossil fuel's banana republic.  It is time for America to begin leading again on climate. It is time to wake up.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt2-PgS2309.txt
603,BENNET,proceeding_id,topic-id,2097,"Mr.President, our founders knew that ``while history does not repeat, it does rhyme.'' That is why they mined the politics of ancient Greece and Rome for lessons about the promise and the perils of self-government. In their wisdom, they placed those lessons at the heart of the American political experiment. Two hundred thirty years later, that experiment has exceeded their wildest hopes, in no small part because generation after generation of Americans--including elected officials, including Members of this body--understood that our government is far more than the sum of our laws or the letter of our Our system is also held together by rules, written and unwritten, that help elected officials resolve their differences without unleashing a downward spiral of recrimination that could endanger the Republic itself.  They understood, for example, that while civility, compromise, and cooperation are not required by law, laws cannot pass without them. They recognized that while the majority may have the power to rule on its own, it should not trample over the minority. They understood that, at some point, partisanship should give way to patriotism.  Throughout history, including moments far more difficult than our own, these principles were the quiet guardrails of our politics, keeping dysfunction at bay. But in recent years, we have begun tearing these guardrails down, and in doing so, we risk the revenge of history by ignoring it.  There is a tendency around here to think that our problems are unique and that the consequences of our actions are fleeting.  Some 2,400 years ago, the ancient history of Korsia was consumed by civil war. According to Thucydides, both sides spared ``no means,'' he wrote, ``in their struggles for ascendancy. . . . In their acts of vengeance they went to even greater lengths, not stopping at what justice or the good of the state demanded, but making the party caprice of the moment their own standard.''  As the civil war intensified, both sides struggled to end it because ``there was neither promise to be depended upon nor oath that could command respect; but all parties dwelling rather in their calculation upon the hopelessness of a permanent state of things, were more intent upon self-defence than capable of confidence.''  The Founders read They knew that once factions cross the line, once they violate tradition in an escalating retaliation, it becomes very hard to turn back.  James Madison in particular understood the peril of faction. He wrote how people with ``a zeal for different opinions concerning religion, concerning government, and many other points'' have ``divided mankind into parties, inflamed them with mutual animosity, and rendered them much more disposed to vex and oppress each other than to cooperate for their common good.''  They also feared that, once in power, majority factions would abuse that power to run roughshod over the minority. In a country with such diverse beliefs and traditions, doing so could threaten the very stability of the  For these reasons, the Founders embedded checks in the design of our government. That is why in the Senate we represent entire states, not gerrymandered districts. Colorado, for example, has roughly equal numbers of Democrats, Republicans, and That is why the Senate gives smaller States disproportionate representation, with Colorado receiving the same votes as  That is why traditions of the Senate hand the minority tools to encourage consensus between political parties. The filibuster is one of those tools, and it has been used for good and for ill throughout our history. By requiring the consent of 60 Senators to proceed on key votes, the filibuster ensures that the legislation we pass and the nominations we approve reflect at least a modest level of consensus. The filibuster is meant as a tool of last resort, but in recent years it has become yet another weapon in our endless partisan warfare. It was not always that way.  From George Washington to George Bush, the filibuster was used just 68 times against Presidential nominees. But during just the first 5 years of the Obama administration, Republicans used the filibuster 79 times against his nominees. That was my first term in the Senate, and at that time, I saw the filibuster the way many Americans still do--as an undemocratic tool for delay and gridlock. So in 2013, after unprecedented Republican obstruction of highly qualified nominees, I voted with the Democratic majority to end the 60-vote threshold for most Presidential nominations, invoking what is known as the nuclear option.  Although Republicans were wrong to abuse the rules, Democrats were wrong to change them. Even as we changed the rules, however, we made a point to retain the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations, recognizing their profound influence on our country's laws.  Last year, dysfunction in the Senate reached a new low when Senator McConnell denied Judge Merrick Garland, President Obama's nominee for the vacancy left by the late Justice Scalia, the courtesy of even a hearing, to say nothing of a vote. That was an offense to the traditions of this body and our  I recognize that it is impossible to separate politics from the courts, but at the same time, we must not allow the judiciary--and especially the Supreme Court--to become a pure extension of our partisan elections and politics. Alexander Hamilton wrote that ``liberty can have nothing to fear from the judiciary alone, but would have everything to fear from its union with either of the other departments.'' Continuing, he wrote that because of ``the natural feebleness of the judiciary, it is in continual jeopardy of being overpowered, awed, or influenced by its co-ordinate branches.''  Our actions over the last few years--and I would say over the last few days--jeopardize not only the Senate,[[Page S2347]]but also the judiciary. Today, some of my colleagues plan to filibuster President Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil The Republican leadership has responded by threatening to invoke the nuclear option, which would eliminate for all time the 60-vote threshold for Supreme Court nominees and allow them to confirm Judge Gorsuch with the narrowest partisan majority. This is precisely the outcome our Founders feared, when lifetime appointments to our highest Court, which touches every aspect of American life, become just another partisan exercise. We must not go down this road.  This President may have several more opportunities to nominate a Supreme Court Justice during his term. If that happens, Republicans would face enormous pressure to nominate an extreme candidate, knowing that they could confirm them without a single Democratic vote--indeed, that they would be expected to confirm them without a single Democratic vote. And to those who believe that President Trump could not nominate someone more outside the mainstream than Judge Gorsuch, I would say to just look at some of President Trump's Cabinet nominees, some of whom are among the least qualified and most radical ever confirmed by this body. By the way, under the change to the rules that we made, it is the first Cabinet to be confirmed requiring just 51 and not 60 votes.  Not to put too fine a point on it, but if you don't like the ring of Judge Gorsuch, how do you feel about Justice Pruitt, who doesn't believe in climate change, or Justice Sessions, who has a record of opposing civil rights and equality? If we continue down this path, both of those could be confirmed with a slim majority vote.  With respect to Judge Gorsuch, I am proud he is from But I am concerned by his judicial approach, which too often seems to rely on the narrowest interpretation of the law with little appreciation for its context. In particular, I believe he has far too much confidence in the original meaning of the words in legislation or, for that matter, even the Having worked on legislation for nearly a decade now, I know these words, so often written in the dead of night in meager attempts to let everybody go home, cannot be explained without reference to the legislative context or human history or lawmakers' intent. Sometimes a comma really does end up in the wrong place.  Although I have reservations about his approach to the law, I do not have reservations about his qualifications for the He is a committed and honorable public servant, and that is why so many members of the Colorado bar and bench support his nomination. Qualified nominees deserve an up-or-down vote. That is the tradition of this body. How members vote is a matter of conscience for each of us.  For all of these reasons, and in the hope of preserving the minority's voice in our government, which so many generations before us have done, I will oppose efforts to filibuster this nomination. If we go down this road, we will undermine the minority's ability to check this administration and all those who follow.  Today we have a President who does not appreciate the separation of powers and who has made unprecedented attacks on the free press and the judiciary. The country needs an empowered Senate minority right now, more than ever. More than that, the country needs a Senate that can forge a consensus about our future, rather than carrying on the bitter and tired divisions of the past. I know it can be hard. I have been here long enough to know it can be hard for both sides to see beyond the partisan tactics of the moment. Lawmakers will never lack for an excuse to break with custom or change the rules to their benefit. They may even argue, as some recently have, that the damage is not that bad--that everything can continue on as normal.  We should know better than that. Our Founders certainly did. They would recognize our path today in the currents of history. The Roman Republic endured for nearly 500 years, but it was brought low by events that should seem eerily familiar to people in this  In 60 BCE, the Roman Senate was consumed by a controversial land reform initiative. One side was led by a Senator named Cato; the other, Julius To stop land reform and other initiatives, Cato employed delay tactics similar to the filibuster, freezing the Roman Senate for months. While the action was within the rules, it broke with Senate custom. Caesar vowed to press forward. Cato's allies responded by declaring a religious holiday for the rest of the legislative calendar, stopping the reform effort in its tracks.  In a further break with precedent, Caesar bypassed the Senate and took the bill to the people's assembly for approval. Furious, Cato's allies boycotted the government and postponed the next election by 3 months. While Caesar eventually triumphed, the incident intensified a cascade of recrimination that the Roman Senate struggled to escape. Legislative strikes, delayed elections, and believe it or not, shutdowns grew in frequency. Manufactured crises became routine.  As the dysfunction grew, the Senate became increasingly irrelevant, as power flowed to Caesar and military leaders. Even as Senators recognized the danger, they failed to correct course. Too much damage had been done. Centuries-long custom had been broken. Trust among Senators had eroded. Confidence in the body collapsed.  As dysfunction in the Senate rose, so did popular calls for a strongman to clean up the mess. Within a decade, Caesar crossed the Rubicon with an army, and the Republic soon gave way to tyranny. It would take 1,300 years for another large Republic to emerge--this time in the United States of  Unlike us, our Founders knew this history as well as their own. But they could not guarantee that we would heed its lessons. That is why they built institutions to check the worst impulses of faction, to help us navigate profoundly consequential decisions--like confirmations for the Supreme Court--without tearing each other apart. But the Founders also placed their faith in the willingness of elected officials to resist the lure of narrow interests or passions of the moment and rise up to defend their institutions and our traditions, especially in hard times. We must not betray their faith.  With each escalating crisis, we damage not just the Senate, but the The Rubicon may be far, but with each rule and custom broken, we draw nearer. Choices on both sides have brought us to this low point, but I have faith that we can choose--and we should choose--a different path. We can choose to step back from the brink to find common ground, to fulfill our obligation in the time we are serving here to sustain the American experiment for the next century and beyond.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt2-PgS2309.txt
604,BROWN,proceeding_id,topic-id,1614,"Mr.President, I always appreciate the remarks--the well-thought-through remarks of my colleague, and the history lesson putting it into context is always so important and something we should do more of in this body.  I thank Senator Bennet for his words.  The Supreme Court, as we know, has tremendous influence over the lives of our country, the lives of Ohioans, my State, and the lives of so many. Nominees must defend the rights of all Americans to make their own healthcare decisions, to collectively bargain for safe workplaces and fair pay, and to be protected from discrimination and Wall Street greed.  Unfortunately, Judge Gorsuch is simply not that nominee. His record is clear. He has ruled that corporations are people. I am not a lawyer, but I understand that it is a relatively recent concept in American jurisprudence to equate corporations with people. When you do that, you simply give corporations more rights than individuals have. When you come from that position, it means that judges repeatedly rule to choose corporations over workers; they choose polluters over communities; they choose Wall Street over consumer protections; they choose special interest money over our citizens. We have seen too much of that in this country.  We have seen a decline of the middle class, in part because the Federal judiciary is choosing corporations over[[Page S2348]]workers. If chosen, polluters over communities; if chosen, Wall Street over consumer protections; if chosen, special interest money over citizens--that is the Court we have seen in far too many 5-to-4 decisions, as Senator Whitehouse has pointed out so effectively on this floor.  The misguided idea that corporations are people is far outside the mainstream of what most Ohioans believe. It may work for graduates of Harvard and Yale Law Interestingly, if Judge Gorsuch is approved, all nine of the Supreme Court Justices will have attended Harvard or Yale Law I don't know what is wrong with Ohio State or the University of Toledo or Akron University or University of Cincinnati or Case Western or Michigan or Chicago or anywhere else. That is whom Presidents have chosen; those are the people we seem to confirm.  But this view that corporations are people simply doesn't wash with the American people. It is how we got rules that allow Wall Street banks and hedge funds to wreak havoc on ordinary working people and ordinary working families, with no consequences.  Judge Gorsuch himself has argued against the rights of working Americans to band together to hold Wall Street and corporations accountable. He ruled against children with autism. He ruled against students with disabilities. We have a President in the White House who makes fun of disabled people. Now, we are going to put a Justice on the Court who rules against students with disabilities. We have a Secretary of Education who barely knew what IDEA was--the provision of the law that guarantees disabled students an education.  Why we are moving in this direction, I think, amazes most people in this country, whether you have a disabled person in your family or not. His views of protecting students with disabilities are so outside the mainstream that last month, the Supreme Court unanimously rejected his reasoning.  A boy with autism, Luke, wasn't making progress in school, and it was recommended that he be placed in a residential program. An impartial hearing officer and two different judges agreed. But Judge Gorsuch disagreed. He said that, as long as a student with a learning disability is making ``merely . . . more than de minimus'' progress in his or her education, the school district didn't have to do anything else. Think of that. That student, he counts a little bit, but he really doesn't count that much. He doesn't count as a full human being with full rights and full citizenship in this country.  If your disabled child is getting more than nothing, I guess that is good enough, according to Judge Luckily, this Supreme Court, as conservative as it usually is, overturned Judge Gorsuch's precedent that denied a real education to students like Again, they overturned him unanimously. Chief Justice Roberts noted that a student offered an educational program providing merely more than de minimus progress from year to year--this is Justice Roberts, a very conservative Chief Justice--can hardly be said to have been offered an education at all.  In other words, what Judge Gorsuch thinks and thought about this case was that doing only a little bit for this student was meeting the obligation of this civilized society that we are proud of. Fortunately, the eight members of the Supreme Court--four Republican conservative nominees, four more moderate to liberal nominees from the Democrats--unanimously came together and disagreed with Judge  But think about what can happen the next time. If an Ohio family has a child with a learning disability and struggles with that school system, they won't find sympathy from Justice In fact, forget sympathy. They can't count on him to protect their child under the law.  Take a look at the case of Alphonse Maddin, the truckdriver from He was hauling meat through Illinois when he stopped to refuel. His brakes froze. He was stranded. He called for help, for a company repair unit. He waited for hours for help. He nearly froze to death. He couldn't feel his legs. It was 14-degrees below zero in the truck. He needed to get to shelter or risk losing his limbs or worse.  But his company fired him. They claimed he abandoned his cargo. Mr.Maddin later returned to get the cargo and completed his job. But it just did not matter to the company. To the company, the cargo was more important than Mr.Maddin's life. To Judge Gorsuch, that company's interests were more important than Mr.Maddin, more important than his health, more important than his life.  Imagine that. That is what we mean when we say he puts corporations ahead of workers. At the beginning, you remember I said there is this relatively new idea in American jurisprudence that corporations are individuals and people are corporations. When you say that, it means that you side with corporations over workers. You side with polluters over communities. You side with Wall Street over consumer protections. You side with big, dark money from billionaires in Citizens United over citizens.  Take a look at the case of a mother who had leukemia and had to take time off for treatment. After the treatment was over, her doctors advised her not to return to work quite yet. There was a flu epidemic. Her immune system was compromised from chemotherapy. But her employer told her she needed to show up within a week or they would fire her despite 15 years of dedicated service. Guess who Judge Gorsuch sided with? It was not the worker suffering from cancer, who had dedicated a decade and a half of her life to her employer and who wanted to return to work, but she simply was advised against it by her doctor.  This woman's daughter, Katherine, said that when Judge Gorsuch issued his ruling, ``he didn't even think about the impact that this had on our family.'' She said his ruling ``set the precedent that a company's needs come before workers like her mother.''  At a time when Americans work longer and harder than ever before, when we devalue work in this country, when workers' wages--for huge percentages of workers in this country--are stagnant, when people work longer and harder with less and less to show for it, the last thing we need to do is elevate someone who sees workers as nothing more than a cost to be minimized.  That is what is at stake here. We are talking about putting someone on the Court who wants to give corporations special rights, but he has a record of ignoring the rights of ordinary citizens, choosing corporations over people, saying that corporations are, in fact, people. That means that he is almost always, in his cases, choosing corporations over workers, choosing polluters over communities.  Judge Gorsuch's record makes clear that he would turn back the clock on a woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions, or LBGT rights, or clean air and clean water, or safe food and medicine.  That is what is at stake here. If the Senate does not reject his nomination, the decisions Judge Gorsuch hands down will haunt our Nation for generations. My opposition to this nominee has nothing to do with what has occurred in the Senate over the past 8 years, as despicable as it has been. It has everything to do with what could happen over the next 100.  This is about our children and our grandchildren. Seven of the eight current justices have met the 60-vote benchmark. In other words, seven of the eight justices on the Court right now were fairminded enough and centrist enough and agreeable enough that far more than 60 Senators--people in both parties--came together to confirm those nominees.  With so much at stake, it is up to Judge Gorsuch to earn the votes of 60 Members of this body. I do not believe someone who fundamentally wants to give and has given corporations more rights than individual citizens has earned that broad support. The solution is not to change the rules; it is to change the nominee.  That is what we mean by advice and consent. The American people need a Supreme Court Justice who looks out for the interests of all Americans, not just the 1 percent, not just the most powerful, not just the most privileged.

I am happy to strongly support him for the                            Opioid Epidemic  Tonight, Mr.President, I want to talk about another issue, one that I hope can continue to bring us together here in this body and also bring our country together. I rise today to talk about what a lot of experts say is the worst drug crisis in the history of our great country--the worst. It is the opioid epidemic. This is the addiction to heroin, prescription drugs, synthetic heroins like fentanyl. The newest threat, this synthetic fentanyl, is coming into our communities from other countries, particularly  There are laboratories in China where evil scientists are putting together these concoctions and sending them through the U.mail system into our communities.  China is doing it on a scale that is devastating to our communities. As a result, I have urged President Trump to prioritize this issue in his meeting with President Xi in Florida later this week. China has banned one synthetic form of heroin, carfentanil, recently, but there is a lot more to do. I am urging President Trump to make it clear to President Xi that we will do everything we need to do to keep this poison out of our communities.  This epidemic is affecting every single one of the States represented here in this body. I know the Presiding Officer knows that because I know he has been involved in his own It is affecting your home town, whoever you are and wherever you are in the United Unfortunately, it is affecting people you probably know.  Every day we are now losing 144 Americans to drug overdoses, most of which are from overdoses of opioids. That is one American life lost every 12 minutes. That will be about the length of this speech. Look at your watch. In the next hour, five Americans will die of a drug overdose.  I have been working on this issue for a long time. I first got involved over 20 years ago when I was in the House of Representatives and a constituent came to me because her son had died of a combination of smoking dope and huffing gasoline. She came to me and said: What are you doing about it?  I was ready. I talked to her about the fact that we had $15 billion devoted to interdicting drugs and incarcerating people and so on.  She said: What are you doing to help me and my community? I have gone to my church. They are in denial. I have gone to the school, and they say it is not a problem here. I have gone to my neighbors, and they won't come together and talk about it.  So we got involved in this issue, and I set up our own community coalition back in my home town of Cincinnati and chaired that for 9 years. I am still very involved with that group, but I also got involved with legislation to try to do things to actually reduce the demand for drugs, because that is so important.  Here we are again. The crisis we had then was mostly crack cocaine, marijuana. Then it was methamphetamines, bath salts. But I have never seen anything like this. This is the worst. If you don't think it is the worst drug crisis we have ever faced, then think about this. Look at this chart of drug overdose deaths in  Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of accidental death--the leading cause--in my home State of Ohio, and probably in your State and in our country. This is from 2015, the most recent year for which we have complete data. Nearly two-thirds of the deaths were because of the prescription painkiller heroin-fentanyl issue, or synthetic forms of heroin.  Drug overdoses are not now just the leading cause of death. Overdoses kill more Americans than guns do. This next chart will show that, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more Americans died from drug overdoses in 2015 than died from HIV/AIDS at the height of that epidemic. The peak of the AIDS epidemic was 1995. This is 2015 with regard to drug overdoses.  According to an article in the New York Times, more than four times as many people are dying every day from this epidemic than were dying at the peak of the crack epidemic. In the last 3 years, more Americans have died of drug overdoses than died in the Vietnam war.  Unfortunately, we have reasons to believe that this crisis is getting worse, not better. According to recent figures, fatal overdoses due to prescription painkillers, heroin, or synthetic heroin in 2016 alone went up 26 percent in Connecticut, 35 percent in Delaware, and 39 percent in During the first three quarters of 2016, deaths from overdoses in Maryland increased 62 percent. In Ohio they increased 20 percent the last 2 years in a row.  So we have seen this huge spike here in deaths from overdoses, starting in about 2010 and going up. This is with regard to heroin. This is with regard to non-methadone synthetic opioids--in other words, fentanyl, carfentanil, U4, and other synthetic heroins.  This is a crisis. It is one that, unfortunately, is affecting every single community--whether you are in an urban, suburban, or rural community, whether you are young or old, regardless of your walk in life.  The issue, of course, is much bigger than just the tragedy of overdose deaths. It is also about people whose lives have gotten off track because of these drugs and because of the addiction. There are 200,000 people in Ohio alone who are living with an addiction to these drugs. By the way, if you are addicted, you are much more likely to be committing crimes, fraud, and theft to pay for that habit.  In my State of Ohio--and I will bet in your State--the 1 cause of crime is opioids. A lot of these people have lost a job or can't get a job. I talked to some business folks over the weekend in Ohio who talked about regulations and taxes. They said: You know, this drug issue is affecting every single one of us. We can't get people to pass a drug test. We have employees who are now addicted to prescription drugs or heroin and their absenteeism and inability to come to work is affecting our economy.  So this is something that is affecting all of us. Of course, many have broken relationships with their families and their loved ones. I cannot tell you the number of people who have told me, and I have probably met with 1,000 addicts or recovering addicts over the last few years. I can't tell you how many people have told me: Drugs became everything, and I pushed my family out, and pushed my friends out, and pushed my job away, and it left me in a situation where I was broken.  But living without hope is something that we can deal with, because there are ways for us to get people into treatment and to get people into recovery to help them. We are in a crisis. Some have asked me: Well, how did we get here? That is usually a good start to this: How do we get out of it? How did we get here is complicated. But according to the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions, those who are addicted to prescription painkillers are 40 times more likely to be addicted to heroin.  Let me look at this a different way. Four out of five heroin addicts started with prescription drugs. So this issue of prescription drugs, overprescribing, is a huge part of how this happened in the first place. Increasingly, what we have seen in all of our States is addiction starting with these drugs and then switching to cheaper and more accessible heroin, and then switching again to sometimes more powerful forms of heroin like carfentanil, maybe 30 to 50 times more powerful than heroin. That is what is taking so many lives at such an alarming pace. The epidemic started with overprescribing. The United States uses more prescription pain killers than any other country in the world. It is not even close. Look at these numbers here. This is the daily opioid dose for over a million people. Look at the United States as compared to every other country in the world.  This is using 2014 data, and the numbers may have gotten better because of the work being done to cut back on painkillers. But according to the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians, we consume nearly 70 percent in this country--5 percent of the world's population and nearly 70 percent of the world's painkillers.  In 2012, that number was 75 percent. It is still not even close on a per-person basis. For every American, there are 50[[Page S2350]]pain pills in this country, and second place is Canada with 30 pain pills.  According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, painkiller prescription sales nearly quadrupled from just 1999 to 2014. That number finally peaked in 2012, by the way, and since then has come down slightly. In 2012, there were more prescriptions for painkillers in Ohio than there were people in There were more prescriptions for painkillers--not pills, prescriptions--than there were people in By the way, that was also true in 11 other  Fortunately in Ohio, we have made some progress under the leadership of Governor Kasich, Lieutenant Governor Taylor, Attorney General DeWine, and the State legislature. They have taken some important steps to cut back on painkiller prescriptions. We have cut them back by about one-fifth, about 20 percent since they peaked in 2012, but that number is still way too high. According to the Ohio Board of Pharmacy, 631 million pain pills were prescribed to Ohioans last year. We are also still dealing with the consequences of a lot of the addictions that got started in 2011, 2010, or before.  The number of prescriptions has risen, just as the addiction to opioids has risen. Drug cartels have followed this prescription drug epidemic, bringing in heroin. Those drug cartels flooded my State and probably a lot flooded a lot of your States with this cheaper, more accessible heroin, now synthetic heroin.  According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, Mexican heroin production alone increased sixfold in just 4 years--from eight metric tons in 2005 to 50 metric tons in 2009. That number is now 70 metric tons, and it just keeps rising.  According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, here in this country, Mexican opium poppy planting increased by 64 percent just from 2014 to 2015. So it is getting worse, not better.  According to the Congressional Research Service, virtually all of the heroin produced in Mexico is consumed here in the United States of  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heroin use among young people has doubled in the last decade, among young people 18 to 25 years old.  This affects all of us. It knows no ZIP It certainly knows no walk of life.  Since 2010, heroin overdose deaths have doubled among Hispanic Americans, African Americans, Native Americans, and  A lot of the people who are addicted to prescription drugs have switched to heroin instead. Now we are seeing that heroin addicts are switching also, even if they don't know they are doing it. They are switching to fentanyl and carfentanil. Again, it could be up to 50 times more powerful than heroin. Sometimes they don't know it because the traffickers are sprinkling the fentanyl in other drugs--heroin, of course, but also, we know now, cocaine. They are mixing it with marijuana, mixing it with other drugs, and not letting people know.  We had a 14-year-old girl recently die in Dayton, She was with her friends, snorting what she was told was heroin. She had done it before. But this was fentanyl, and it killed her instantly.  More than 1,000 Ohioans were killed by fentanyl in 2015--more than double the previous year and more than 10 times the number in 2013. In Cleveland, for example, there have been more overdoses from fentanyl in the past 10 months than there had been in the past 10 years. In Columbus, there have already been half as many fentanyl overdoses in the first 3 months of this year as there were all of last year. This is why I say fentanyl is the new risk, the new danger.  As one father who lost his son to an overdose told me: Every time you engage in taking drugs, you are playing Russian roulette because you don't know what is in it.  In my hometown of Cincinnati, fentanyl deaths now surpass heroin deaths. Drug overdose deaths in Cincinnati increased by 40 percent from 2014 to 2015. Over that same timeframe, in just 1 year, heroin overdoses increased 12 percent, while fentanyl overdose deaths increased 153 percent. These numbers are very disturbing. They are discouraging, too, because it seems like we just can't turn the tide. It is easy to feel as though we just can't do anything, that we are paralyzed, but there is actually a lot we can do to help, and we can and should.  Here in the Senate, we have already taken some very important steps in the last year. About 9 months ago, we passed legislation called the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, Last year, we passed the 21st Century Cures Those two together provide much more funding for this issue. The Cures Act alone is $500 million more this year going back to the States to provide funding primarily for treatment for this increase in overdose deaths. There will be $500 million authorized again next year. We have to be sure that gets into the appropriations bill.  We also have seen, I think much more importantly in a way, through the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act--separate legislation--that we are beginning to fund directly programs that work. We spent 3 years looking around the country and had five conferences here in Washington, We brought experts in from all over the country who told us what the best practices were. What is the best prevention technique that is working? How do we get kids not to make these decisions? What is the best thing that is happening in terms of treatment, and then longer term recovery, what works and what doesn't work. Is medication-assisted treatment better? Is it better? Does it rely more on longer term recovery? Have they had more success there?  All of this has led us to put together this legislation, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, that actually funds programs like drug courts that are working around the country. They take people, diverting them from prison, and say: As long as you stay clean, you can stay out of jail, because you are a user, you are not a pusher. But you have to stay clean.  Then they provide them alternatives, including using drugs that reduce the cravings. If you reduce the craving for opioids, that is proving to be very, very successful in some cases. Dimitrol is the drug they use mostly in Ohio to do that. There are some great examples of people who have gone through the drug court process who have now been clean for a few years. They are back to work. They are back with their families. They are back as contributing members of society. So there is hope. We have seen how it can work.  CARA is the first legislation Congress ever passed to promote long-term recovery. Why? Because we have looked around the country and had experts here. We figured out that the treatment programs are important, and before that, the detox program is important. But what is leading to more success is longer term recovery programs.  As an example, think about being in detox for a week and then maybe a couple weeks in a treatment program and then going into a sober housing arrangement where you have regular meetings, where you are getting support from fellow recovering addicts. That seems to work longer. You are there. It seems to work better for most  Unfortunately, we do not have all of CARA's legislation fully implemented yet. Only three of its eight programs have been implemented. It has been a while. It has been about 9 months. It is time to push all of those programs.  I pushed the Obama administration on this. I am now pushing the Trump administration. Last week, I was delighted that the Trump administration announced the creation of a commission on the opioid epidemic, led by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who has a real passion for this issue. I commend the President and Governor Christie for their commitment to making progress on the issue. Their leadership and their partnership with Congress will make a difference.  Today I talked to General Kelly, the new Secretary of Homeland He is going to be on the commission. He said they are going to report about the problem within 90 days. We know a lot about the problem. We also have to be sure we are seeing some action.  What I would suggest today is that the administration work hard to implement the remaining five CARA grant programs that are not yet up and running. For example, it has been 8 months, almost 9 months, since CARA[[Page S2351]]was signed into law. Yet we still don't have the grant for naloxone up and running. Our States and local communities need this Narcan on the street to save people's lives, because this is a miracle drug that reverses the effects of an overdose, but we also need to get more training for some of our first responders so they can administer it more effectively, which is particularly more important right now with this new drug, the fentanyl, the synthetic drug coming in, because synthetic heroin requires sometimes not one, not two but four or five uses of Narcan--maybe more--to save someone's life. So our first responders are asking for this help.  We still don't have the grant for medication-assisted treatment up and running. We still don't have the grant for pregnant and postpartum women's treatment providers up and running. This will help to ensure we have fewer babies who are born with this addiction. Let's get going on these.  For all of us here in Congress, let's be sure that we fully fund It is $182 million a year, every year, in addition to what we were spending on opioids. We need to be sure that funding is there, that these programs are working, and that our communities begin to get more of the help they need. These evidence-based programs that work are what we ought to be supporting, and that is exactly what the legislation does.  I thank Vice President Pence, who was in Ohio on It was a meeting about the economic issues we faced as a country. He talked about tax reform and regulations and skills training, but he also talked about this issue. I think it is important that we are all talking about this issue back home and raising awareness hopefully to save lives, to keep people from going down this path but also to ensure that our fellow citizens know the importance of Congress and State legislatures and local communities getting engaged with it all. Everyone must get involved.  I was in Youngstown, OH, on Friday, and I held a roundtable at the Neil Kennedy Recovery This is one of the first programs of its kind in the country. It started in the late 1940s. It focused more at that time on alcoholism. Executive Director Carolyn Givens was there with her staff. They are incredibly compassionate people. She told me a lot of stories.  I was able to meet with some of the recovering addicts at the center. One told me his name was He told me that center saved his life. It saved his life. This is a guy who worked for years at utility companies. He is a skilled worker. He got involved with prescription drugs because of an accident or an injury, and then he ended up moving to heroin, which was cheaper and more accessible. Then he found his life spinning out of control. Now he is there, and he is getting back on track.  Everybody, by the way, at the roundtable who was there--the staff and community leaders who were involved--they all said: Get this legislation implemented. We need it.  On Friday afternoon, I went to Cleveland and toured the Vincent Charity Medical Center with addiction specialist Ted What an amazing guy he is. This is in a hospital setting where they have a detox unit and a treatment center, which is very unusual. I think it is the only one of its kind in Cleveland, and it is one of a few in the country where, within a hospital setting, these people are getting everything they need. It is a very comprehensive approach. They deal with mental health issues, of course, but also other physical issues people have, and it is helpful to have it all together there at that center. I thank the sisters for what they are doing because they are supporting this, and sometimes it is quite expensive to have a treatment program. At Vincent's, they are doing an awesome job.  Everyone there told me the same thing that I hear across Ohio--that their services have, unfortunately, never been in greater demand. They have a waiting list. They say the situation is getting worse, not better. I think that is true in your State, too, because according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration, SAMHSA, 9 out of 10 of the 22 million Americans who are suffering from addiction are not getting the treatment they need--9 out of 10. CARA and the Cures Act will help change that.  People need to change that in their own hearts. They need to step forward and seek the treatment they need. We need to take away the stigma of addiction because it is an illness. We need to treat it as an illness because that would help people come forward, admit they have a problem, and get the treatment they need. Their families and their communities are desperate for that to happen. CARA and Cures will help change all that.  I applaud my colleagues here, Republican and Democrat alike, for moving forward on this legislation over the last year, but there is a lot more work to do. We should continue to address the underlying issue of overprescribing. It started this epidemic in the first place. We talked about the number of prescriptions that are still out there.  Last week, I joined with my colleague Senator Amy Klobuchar to introduce bipartisan legislation called the Prescription Drug Monitoring Act to keep better track of prescription painkillers, keep them out of the wrong hands, and identify an addiction as early as possible so that it can be treated.  This goes to the pharmacist. You will have to report when someone gets a pain pill prescription. They have to put it on the Prescription Drug Monitoring  It goes to doctors. They have to be sure that when they are prescribing medication, that that is part of the drug monitoring program. They have to access the drug monitoring program before they give a prescription to be sure the person isn't filling the prescription with them that they have already filled somewhere else. Unfortunately, there is a lot of that abuse still out there. Sometimes it is across State lines, which is why Federal legislation is required. Our legislation requires that States work better together to ensure that the Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs are talking to each other.  By the way, if people don't do this under our legislation--the pharmacists, the doctors, and the States--then they have their Federal funding pulled back that we talked about earlier on the CARA legislation.  If you see a sign of addiction starting, our legislation requires that you let the patient's doctor know that so we can begin to identify the people who have an addiction and get them the treatment they need.  I think this is going to be a good bill because it will lead to a smarter and more effective use of taxpayer dollars, and more importantly, of course, it is going to prevent a lot of new addictions from starting in the first place. That, of course, would save lives.  Congress can also do something else that is really important, and that is to give law enforcement better tools to be able to keep some of this poison out of our communities. So the prevention and the treatment and the recovery and Narcan for our first responders--they are all very important, but let's also keep some of this out. Let's do a better job of stopping the heroin at the southern border. Let's do a better job of stopping the fentanyl, which is this new synthetic heroin we are talking about that is causing so many overdoses and deaths. Let's do a better job of keeping that out.  This should be a no-brainer, in my view, because it is coming in through the U.mail system. We know this. All the studies show this. Most of these synthetic drugs are being made in labs in China, and they are shipped by mail to traffickers in the United States, sometimes to Mexico as well. Typically that is done through the Postal Why? Because the private carriers like UPS or FedEx or DHL and others require, when you ship something, that you have advance information provided to the Customs and Border Protection and to others as to where the package is from, what is in it, where it is going. The post office doesn't require that. Is it any wonder that traffickers are using the Postal Service rather than one of these private carriers?  Law enforcement came to us and told us that they could use this data--it is electronic data provided up front--because that would enable them to determine the suspect packages. Of the millions of packages that come into our country, they have to know how to find that needle in the haystack. That is why they want the ability to find these[[Page S2352]]packages, to scan these packages, and to be able to stop some of this poison that is coming into our communities.  The legislation we have with regard to this issue is called the STOP I recently introduced it again this year with Senator Klobuchar, Senator Rubio, Senator Hassan, and many others here in the It is a bipartisan bill, called the Synthetic Trafficking and Overdose Prevention Act, or the STOP It closes this loophole we talked about within the Postal Service and requires the post office to obtain advanced electronic data on packages before they cross our borders, just like the private carriers have to do.  It is not a new idea, by the way. In 2002, Congress placed this requirement on private carriers. That is when it started. It also required that the post office review this and look into this. So, in 2002, this Congress was smart enough to say: This seems to make sense. Let's require the post office to look into it. We have seen the results. The results are that traffickers stay away from the private carriers because they know they can use the Postal Service and get away with it.  Traffickers are lacing the heroin on the streets of America with these synthetic drugs to make them stronger and more addictive. They are getting more people addicted. Fentanyl is also so powerful that it only takes a couple of milligrams--the equivalent of a pinch of salt--to kill you. They say that three flakes can kill you. The fact that heroin is now being laced with fentanyl, of course, makes it much more likely for you not only to have an overdose, because of the strength of this synthetic heroin, but also that you will die from that overdose. Again, it is much harder to use Narcan and to begin to save lives by using that and to reverse the effects of the overdose.  So the STOP Act, to me, again, is something that we definitely ought to do in this It would restrict the supply of these dangerous drugs, raise the prices of these drugs, and would make them harder to get. That is going to save lives.  Support for the STOP Act is growing. Our bill has now been endorsed by the Fraternal Order of Police and by the Major County Sheriffs of They are convinced that this tool will work. Last Friday, I was in Columbus, I met with Franklin County deputy sheriff Rick Minerd, also the deputy chief of the Columbus Police, Mike We had the Cincinnati and Columbus directors of the Customs and Border Patrol--the chiefs--there to talk about it, and we had the Drug Enforcement Agency's special agents in charge there with us. We also had people who were on the investigative side of the Customs and Border The deputy attorney general of Ohio was there, Steve Schumaker, and others. All of these law enforcement people said: Give us this legislation. It is a tool that we need.  We had a hearing today on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and General Kelly was there. He is the new Secretary of Homeland He agreed with me that the STOP Act would ``help [Customs] officers target illegal shipments . . . reduce the ability for the post office to be used for the illicit shopping of all kinds of contraband . . . [and] be helpful to be able to identify packages'' of synthetic drugs. He is right. We need the administration's help and push for this legislation as well. Let's get this done.  President Trump, by the way, endorsed this idea last year when he said during the campaign:       We will close the shipping loopholes to China that others      are exploiting to send dangerous drugs across our borders and      into the hands of our own Postal These traffickers      use loopholes in the Postal Service to mail fentanyl and      other drugs to users and dealers in the United [The]      Trump administration will crack down on this abuse and give      law enforcement the tools they need to accomplish this      mission.  Let's get it done.  Again, I have asked President Trump to raise this issue with President Xi Jinping because China can do a lot more to try to shut down these laboratories in China, to try to stop some of the materials that are coming into the laboratories that make up this fentanyl. By the way, it is in China's interest to do so.  I have received information recently that there is leakage. What does that mean? That means that some of this fentanyl is going out to the countryside, to the suburbs of China, and to the cities of China, and it is affecting their population.  This legislation already has a companion bill in the So this is not an issue in which the Senate can act and then we cannot get it through the process because we cannot get it through the House and the Pat Tiberi and Richard Neal have introduced companion legislation--Tiberi, a Republican from Ohio, and Neal, a Democrat from It is bipartisan. It is the kind of legislation that should draw bipartisan support, and we should get it done.  Is it a silver bullet? No, we do not have a silver bullet. There is not one silver bullet. There is a comprehensive approach here, and these two bills that I have talked about are new steps that we should take.  I urge my colleagues to continue to support the CARA legislation. Let's provide full funding. Let's support the Cures legislation in the upcoming appropriations process. Let's continue to engage the good folks back home who are trying, at the tip of the spear, to do all that they can in terms of providing better treatment opportunities and longer term recoveries and who are going into our schools and talking about prevention so as to do all we can to keep people from going into that funnel of addiction.  Let's pass this legislation. Join us in keeping better track of painkiller prescriptions so that potentially addictive drugs do not end up in the wrong hands and so that addictions get treated early. That legislation is important.  Join me and join the 10 other Senators in pushing back against poisonous synthetic heroin, which is coming into our communities, by supporting the STOP Act as a cosponsor so that we can get this bill to the floor and get it to the President for his signature.  I believe these two pieces of legislation, if allowed on the floor, will pass overwhelmingly. I believe the President would sign them. Most importantly, I believe they would begin to save lives in the communities we all represent.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

As the National Park System begins its second century this year, we have seen record visitation, with 331 million visits in 2016, but record visitation also brings additional strain to our national parks and strain to our infrastructure.

613,STABENOW,proceeding_id,topic-id,1515,"Mr.President, I rise this evening to talk about an issue that will affect families all across Michigan, which is the nomination of Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme He has a long record of siding with special interests and institutions instead of hard-working Americans, and this is of great concern to me. That matters.  I am concerned with his rulings that fail to protect children and students with disabilities in schools, and I am worried that he will limit access to critical healthcare for women and that he is not a mainstream candidate. I can't support a nominee whom I believe is disconnected from the challenges faced by families in Michigan and across America every day.  There is one important example which relates directly to someone from Michigan that Judge Gorsuch has ruled on. People from Michigan have been hurt by Judge Gorsuch's narrow judicial philosophy.  In 2009, a Michigan truckdriver named Alphonse Maddin was trying to complete a shipment driving all night, and his brakes froze in subzero temperatures--which we have. The heater in his cab broke as well. He called his company to report the issue and waited for help to arrive.  While he was waiting for hours in the freezing subzero temperatures, he realized he was having trouble breathing and his body was going numb. He called his company to report that he needed to get somewhere warm, but they told him he needed to either wait for the repair person, or drag his trailer even though the brakes were frozen. Worried he might freeze to death, he finally unhitched the trailer from his truck. Mr.Maddin drove off to seek help, returning in just 15 minutes with assistance. He did what any of us faced with a life-threatening situation would do.  A week later, Mr.Maddin was fired from his job, even though he was transparent in his actions and completed his delivery. He completed his delivery, despite the issues caused by his frozen brakes and the broken heater.  Two different entities within the Department of Labor ruled that what the trucking company did was illegal, and that Mr.Maddin was protected under Federal law because his life was in danger. Thankfully, a majority of the Tenth Circuit judges agreed. Judge Gorsuch, however, disagreed, arguing the law did not protect workers who drove away to avoid freezing to death.  According to Judge Gorsuch's interpretation, Mr.Maddin would have had to choose between his job and his life. What is deeply concerning to me is that when he was asked at his nomination hearing what he would have done, he said he really hadn't thought about it. Judges should think about what is happening to people in situations as they are ruling in a fair and impartial way. This does not look like the ruling of a mainstream nominee.  His rulings don't only affect Michigan workers. I am very concerned about Judge Gorsuch's rulings on legal protections for individuals with disabilities. We passed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act to make sure that children with disabilities got the education they deserved, and that the education would be free and available to all children.  Luke, a young boy from Colorado with autism, was not able to receive the education he needed from his public school. His parents were able to enroll him in a private residential program specializing in children with autism that was more suitable for his needs so he could get what he needed for his development.  His parents applied to the school district for reimbursement, as was appropriate, but the school district refused. His parents went to court, and an administrative judge and a district judge both ruled that the school did not provide Luke with the necessary education to meet the needs that IDEA required. However, Judge Gorsuch ruled in favor of the school district, saying that all the school district had to do was provide an education that was more than just the bare minimum--just the bare minimum. He set a very low bar for Luke and for students like Luke, like my nephew  Just to show how disconnected Judge Gorsuch is from the lives of everyday Americans, look at the Supreme Court ruling which occurred at the same time as Judge Gorsuch's confirmation hearings. In a different case on the very same issue, the Supreme Court challenged and rejected the standard and interpretation that Judge Gorsuch believed should be provided for children and students with disabilities. They unanimously rejected the standard that he approved. This is not the view of a mainstream nominee. This is not the view of a mainstream nominee.  I am also deeply concerned about Judge Gorsuch's opinions and how they could affect women's access to healthcare. In the Tenth Circuit's Hobby Lobby decision, Judge Gorsuch endorsed the idea that corporations can deny their employees access to essential healthcare services, including birth control. His concurring opinion suggested that he supported the notion that for-profit corporations have the right to deny women insurance coverage or any form of contraception an employer disagrees with. This is both alarming and unacceptable. It once again shows how disconnected Judge Gorsuch is from what women in Michigan and around the country experience.  Judge Gorsuch did not recognize the impact of denying coverage to women employees and their families, and putting those decisions in the hands of their employers. Women in Michigan should not have to pay higher costs for healthcare than men, and they should not be denied essential healthcare services. These dangerous interpretations will continue to take us down a path of permitting and protecting discrimination by corporations and institutions over the rights of workers and consumers. Again, that is not a mainstream nominee.  When it comes to supporting women--not just in healthcare, but in the workplace--Judge Gorsuch has had some extremely troubling rulings. In 2003, a woman named Betty Pinkerton experienced several instances of disgusting sexual harassment from a male supervisor at the Colorado Department of Every time she made it clear his comments were not acceptable in any way, they continued over the course of months.  She went to her office's civil rights staff and submitted a written complaint, and he was removed as her supervisor. She was fired about a week[[Page S2354]]later. She sued. But Judge Gorsuch upheld a ruling that claimed she waited too long--she waited too long to report harassment--and believed that Pinkerton's firing was performance based--How often do we hear that in these situations?--despite not being able to produce any real evidence that this was the case. He ruled that she couldn't go to trial and present her case in front of a jury.  So when it comes to protecting women in the workplace, we know that Judge Gorsuch has come up short. This is not a mainstream position and not acceptable, in my judgment, for any Supreme Court nominee, and not acceptable for what I want to see happen for the people in  I wish to end my speech on the importance of consensus because that is what we should do here. That is how we get things done.  For decades, we have confirmed our Supreme Court nominees with consultation and consensus. We have said--and I think it is the right thing--that we should have to have more than just a simple majority to confirm judges to the highest Court in the land for a lifetime appointment. So it makes sense that we come together to do that. In fact, seven of the eight current U.Supreme Courts Justices on the bench today received 60 votes or more somewhere in their process--both President Bush's and President Obama's nominees, as well, those now on the  President Clinton, President Bush, and President Obama talked to Senators from both parties about their picks to get input as to whom would likely be supported and not supported. This did not happen with Judge President Trump had a list chosen by very narrow special interests and did not ask opinions of key people on our side of the aisle as to what would make sense to get the consensus to get 60 votes.  I do not believe Judge Gorsuch will be fair and impartial, giving a fair shot to the workers and families in Michigan as well as around the country. My test is very much about what is best for the people I represent in Who will be fair and impartial and give them a fair shot?  Because I do not believe he can do that, I cannot support his nomination. He is not the right choice for this vacancy. We can come together. I urge my colleagues to go back to the drawing board and bring in a consensus mainstream nominee.  In the past, we have basically had a practical rule of saying if the nominee cannot get 60 votes, we change the nominee. We don't change the rules. It is extremely concerning that this would not be the approach at this time.  I urge that we come together, get a mainstream nominee, and be able to work together to get this done.

614,CASEY,proceeding_id,topic-id,1966,"Mr.President, I rise this evening to speak about the nomination of Judge Gorsuch to be an Associate Justice of the U.Supreme  Every Member of the United States Senate has an obligation to review this nomination thoroughly and to make a determination. I believe the advice and consent duty of a Senator--certainly in my case, when I make decisions about any judge for confirmation, but especially for the Supreme Court--has to be a decision grounded in a review of a number of considerations. I think they are generally the same no matter who the nominee is, but sometimes they can vary. I think in this case there are probably additional considerations that I weighed.  Of course, we want to look at the nominee's character and their integrity, certainly their judicial temperament. Someone can be very capable as a judge and very learned in the law, but they may not have the temperament or the integrity.  I don't think there is any question that there is nothing in the record that indicates that Judge Gorsuch doesn't have the experience or the character and integrity to do this job, and to do it with the kind of temperament we have the right to expect from any judge.  I also believe at the same time, though, that you have to do a review of the cases decided by the nominee--in this case, a judge on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, a very similar kind of job to that which the Supreme Court Justice does. You are reviewing cases on appellate court. In Judge Gorsuch's case, it is the Tenth Circuit--not the Supreme Court, but still appellate court decisions.  Part of that inquiry I believe is a review of an assessment, really, of this individual's judicial philosophy. That is where I will spend most of my time tonight. I will also talk about the rule change that might be upon us.  While reading Judge Gorsuch's opinions, I developed very serious concerns about his rigid judicial philosophy. Judge Gorsuch's opinions indicated, in my judgment, an extremely conservative judicial approach. This leads him to come down disproportionately on the side of powerful interests, against workers in many cases, and consumers in other cases--a cause for particular concern at a time when the Supreme Court itself, under Chief Justice Roberts, has become an ever more reliable ally to big corporations.  A major study published by the Minnesota Law Review in 2013, found that the four conservative Justices currently sitting on the Court are among the six most business friendly Supreme Court Justices since 1946. A review by the Constitutional Accountability Center shows the consequences of the Court's corporate tilt, finding that the national Chamber of Commerce has had a success rate of 69 percent in cases before the Roberts Court, a significant increase over previous courts. These are cases of serious importance to everyday Americans--cases involving rules for consumer contracts, challenges to regulations, ensuring fair play in labor standards, and attempts by consumers to hold companies accountable for product safety and much more.  Another concern I have about his nomination is that at some point in the campaign of last year, the Republican nominee was given a list of names from which he should choose, were he to be elected I would hope that there would be a list of names that any President would consider beyond what we are told in published reports was just 21 names, developed by organizations on the far right. And that fact alone causes me great concern--that the President is permitted, according to this arrangement, this understanding, only to consider a list of 21 names that those organizations developed.  The record of this judge indicates also that he would only exacerbate the problem that I pointed to with regard to the corporate tilt of the current Roberts In my judgment, by doing so, it would further stack the deck against ordinary workers and families. It starts with his basic judicial philosophy. He employs the narrowest possible reading of Federal law and shows extreme skepticism--even hostility--toward executive agencies or what some might call administrative agencies, agencies that carry out the law in areas like labor or consumer protections and the like.  Many have expressed concerns about his opinion in the Hobby Lobby case, where Judge Gorsuch endorsed the idea that owners of for-profit corporations can assert corporate religious liberty rights, opening the door potentially to widespread discrimination against LGBT Americans and other Americans as well. But a variety of other cases are equally illustrative of Judge Gorsuch's troubling approach to the law.  I will give you just a few examples. One case involved the tragic death of a trench hand who was electrocuted while working as part of an excavation crew. The court reviewed a ruling by the Department of Labor, punishing the mining company for failing to provide proper safety training to the worker. Judge Gorsuch mocked the Department of Labor's ruling as nothing more than a ``Delphic declaration'' devoid of necessary proof, and he concluded that the agency was wrong to penalize the company following the worker's death. Fortunately, a majority of the Tenth Circuit disagreed and affirmed the Department of Labor's ruling.  Another case involved a truckdriver who was stranded on the side of the road at night in subzero temperatures, with the brakes on his trailer frozen and the heater in his cab broken. He called dispatch for help multiple times, but after hours of waiting in the freezing cold, this truckdriver was having[[Page S2355]]trouble breathing, and his torso and his feet were numb. Worried about his safety, he unhitched his trailer, drove the truck away, and then later the company fired him for abandoning the trailer.  Three different authorities within the Department of Labor ruled against the company. Judge Gorsuch disagreed, parsing a Federal statute to argue that the driver was not protected in his decision to drive away, despite the risk of freezing to death if he stayed put. Again, fortunately, the majority of the Tenth Circuit Court disagreed, describing the judge's labored interpretation of the statute as ``curious,'' and ruling in favor of the truckdriver.  I have a basic disagreement with Judge Gorsuch's rulings regarding the legal protections for individuals with disabilities, especially students with disabilities. In one case, he ruled against parents who believed their autistic child was not receiving an adequate education at his public school. A hearing officer, an administrative law judge, and a U.district court all found in favor of the family, ruling that they were entitled to reimbursement for tuition at a residential program tailored for children with autism.  Judge Gorsuch reversed the rulings and, instead, articulated an extremely narrow interpretation of Federal law--this particular Federal law that protects students with disabilities, the IDEA law, the Individuals with Disabilities Education  In 2004, Congress amended the IDEA, in part, based upon findings that its implications have been ``impeded by low expectations.'' Nevertheless, Judge Gorsuch ruled that because the student in this case made some progress in public school, even though he could not generalize his learning to settings outside of school--which is the goal of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act--the family, the judge believed, was not entitled to tuition reimbursement. That decision happened a number years ago.  It just so happens that the U.Supreme Court, the current Court with only 8 members, voted 8 to 0 against the basic position that Judge Gorsuch had in that education case--a different case but the same question about what is the duty owed by a school district to a child with a disability. That ruling happened to be announced during the week that Judge Gorsuch was in front of the Judiciary Committee--in fact, on one of the very days he was in front of the committee. A unanimous Court disagreed with his approach to those kinds of cases involving children with disabilities in a public school.  These cases and others are illustrative of a broader trend in the judge's jurisprudence, whether it is a case involving an employee seeking redress for work place discrimination, hospital staff fighting for back pay after an unlawful reduction in the work hours, or a victim of improper conduct by a medical device company looking for justice. Judge Gorsuch's approach produces rulings disconnected from the lived experience of those they impact.  Therefore, after review of many of his cases, after consideration of his judicial philosophy, and after a review, as well, of the current state of this Court--especially the corporate tilt of this current Roberts Court--I have concluded that I could not support Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme  I wanted to add some comments before concluding tonight about what this vote may mean to the Senate and the rules of the It is my belief--others, of course, disagree--but it is my belief that if you seek to become an Associate Justice on the most powerful Court in the world, you ought to be able to garner the support of at least 60 members of the U.If your nomination to the Court is the subject of such consensus, you ought to be able to get 60 votes in the U.If both your nomination and your judicial philosophy is seen as such a mainstream nomination, you ought to be able to get 60 votes. Despite that, it is a point in time when we are having a debate about how we arrived at this question of a potential change in the rules. I believe that the reason we got here is because of substantial and unyielding obstruction by Republicans in the U.Senate over a number of years.  Just consider this: From the founding of our Nation, through President Obama's first term when Senate Republicans were in the minority, cloture--the motion to cut off debate and proceed to a final vote--has been filed in a total of just 147 nominations. Just 147 times in the total history of the U.Senate, the minority forced the majority to file cloture. Of all the Presidents before President Obama combined, cloture needed to be filed only on 68 of these nominations, but in President Obama's first term before Republicans took the majority of the Senate, Republicans refused to consent to votes and forced the Democratic leader to file cloture on 79 nominations--over 50 percent of all the cloture motions ever filed on nominations in the history of the U.So half of those cloture petitions were filed just in the last couple of years. That doesn't even include what I think was an outrageous obstruction that continued once Republicans took the majority, culminating, of course, in their refusal to consider Judge Merrick Garland's nomination. So Judge Garland, of the District of Columbia Circuit, the chief judge who had great support, I think, on both sides of the aisle--Judge Garland had maybe a few meetings, no vote, and not even a hearing before the Judiciary  According to the Congressional Research Service, President Obama is the only one of the five most recent Presidents whose first term was marked by nominations that languished for over half a year on average. Also in his first term, he was the only President of the previous five under whom the district court vacancies increased, unaccompanied by the creation of new judgeships to meet the demand. In fact, President Obama's district court nominees, during his first term, waited an average of 60 days longer for confirmation than those of President George  I think the evidence is overwhelming. Senate Republicans' obstruction of judicial nominations reached historic levels under President So we are here at this point, and we have to make a decision. My vote will be to insist on 60 votes; therefore, I will be voting no on cloture and also voting no on the nomination of Judge  I yield the floor.

615,KLOBUCHAR,proceeding_id,topic-id,3106,"Mr.President, I come to the floor to join my colleagues in speaking on the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve as an Associate Justice on the Supreme As you know, Senators have a solemn obligation to advise and consent on a President's nominee for the Supreme Court, and I take that obligation very seriously.  My goal during the hearing as a member of the committee was to understand the judge's view on the law, his judicial record, and his philosophy. We needed to know what kind of Justice he would be and what that would mean for  Although many cases decided by the lower courts are less complicated, even though some of them are complicated, many of them are more straightforward than the ones that come before the Supreme The cases that go before the Supreme Court are the hardest cases. They involve the most complicated legal gray areas.  I have heard my colleagues many times talk about some of the unanimous decisions that the judge was involved in. I know that. But when I look at the kinds of cases that come before the Supreme Court, those are different kinds of cases. As I looked over the judge's record, I tried to focus on situations where he faced hard cases like those he might decide as a Supreme Court In my mind, the question was this: What would Judge Gorsuch do if he were appointed to the Supreme Court? What kind of philosophy would he have?  In difficult cases, one judicial approach is to try to find consensus by ruling on the narrowest possible grounds. Judge Merrick Garland, who was nominated last year, was known and praised for that approach by Senators on both sides of the aisle.  Congress actually provides a helpful analogy. When Democrats and Republicans pass legislation, we try to find common ground. We often have different views, but we do find areas of consensus. Sometimes that ground is narrow, but we can find agreement and then come together.[[Page S2356]]  In reviewing the judge's record, I saw that he often took a different approach, one where he often tried to go a step further than the consensus opinion, sometimes really further than the consensus opinion by suggesting a provocative change in the law or by making a broader ideological leap, which I felt was not consistent with the precedent and was not consistent with the kind of philosophy of a judge that, regardless of their political beliefs--I did not expect to agree with everything he said or how he answered the questions, but what I saw was a strikingly different philosophy.  Many of the judge's opinions presented opportunities for narrow judicial consensus, but the judge decided more than the case in front of him. That is what concerns me if he were to be confirmed to the Supreme Court, where he would have to decide the toughest cases and hardest legal questions facing our country.  So after thorough examination and consideration of his answers and the record, I have decided not to vote in favor of the judge's nomination. His judicial approach and his record on critical cases, including the rights of children with disabilities, campaign finance, and preserving health and safety protections, have led me to conclude that I cannot support his nomination to the Supreme  Let me make this clear. Again, I did not expect to agree with every opinion he wrote or everything he said. I certainly did appreciate the introductions of the Presiding Officer, as well as Senator Bennet, and the support he had from That meant something to me. But then when I looked at the record, what I saw time and time again was a judge who clearly demonstrated the contrast between a narrow consensus-based approach and a more far-reaching one.  One area where the judge has gone further to issue broad rulings that would have profound consequences on people's lives is in the case he decided on children with disabilities. During the hearing, because this case had been decided by the Supreme Court right before I got to ask questions, I asked a lot of questions about this case on the IDEA, also known as the Individuals With Disabilities Education  The IDEA was passed to ensure that students with the disabilities are supported in school. In my State, 124,000 children rely on this critical protection. I occupy the Senate seat once held by Minnesota's own Hubert Humphrey--someone who, of course, was never at a loss for words. In fact, this very desk that I am standing behind was the desk Hubert Humphrey signed and used. He delivered a speech 40 years ago, and one line of that speech is just as appropriate today as it was back then.  He said: ``The moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life: the children; those who are in the twilight of life: the elderly; and those who are in the shadows of life: the needy, the sick, and the disabled.''  The Supreme Court has honored that principle. On the day of the judge's hearing, the Supreme Court, in an 8-to-0 unanimous decision, ruled against the narrow interpretation of the IDEA embraced by Judge Gorsuch--an interpretation that limited the educational opportunities of children with disabilities. I could not agree with the 8-to-0 decision more.  All children, particularly those with disabilities, deserve the tools they need to succeed in life, and every Justice on the Supreme Court has a duty to protect these kids. So when the Supreme Court ruled that morning and overturned the standard that the judge had embraced in this Tenth Circuit case, I asked him about his ``merely more than de minimus'' standard that he wrote into that opinion back in 2006.  In explaining his ruling, the judge said that he was bound by precedent to use the narrow standard that he used in that case. He cited a 1996 case from the Tenth Circuit--his circuit--that he said he was bound to follow. Now, he was not on the court back in 1996, but when he did the case in 2006, he used that 1996 case. So I looked at that case.  During the hearing and at the Judiciary Committee business meeting earlier this week, my Republican colleagues repeated those words. They said that the judge was bound by precedent to use his narrow, ``merely more than de minimus'' standard that had, in fact, been rejected by the Supreme Court just this past month. So I looked to see if, in fact, that was true. Was he truly bound by precedent? That is pretty important to me. There have been a number of decisions where he has gone much further than he needed to, where he, in my mind, has abandoned precedent.  I thought, well, here we have a case that is fresh, right before us, and he has said that he was simply following the precedent, that he had no choice at all. Here is what I found: While the 1996 case made a number of findings and concluded that the school district satisfied the requirement in the IDEA statute of providing an appropriate education, the case never actually turned on the standard that the judge said he was bound by, that the judge said was precedent. Here is why: The 1996 case only mentioned the de minimus standard once. It was a passing reference. Even in that mention, the de minimus language is from a different circuit; it was from the Third  In that 1996 case that he claimed he was bound by and that my Republican colleagues keep mentioning that he was bound by, there is no discussion about whether the benefits provided to the high school student satisfied that standard. The case simply did not turn on the de minimus language. I know this seems in the weeds, but the court in 1996 never relied on the de minimus standard to reach the result that it did.  Was that enough? In the one passing mention in the 1996 case, which was not binding, the language actually says ``more than de minimus,'' but the judge went out of his way to add the word ``merely'' to that standard, which had never even been in the case that was not binding on him to begin with. So he changed it and said ``merely more than de minimus,'' that that is all the kind of education a kid with disabilities in that school district in Colorado would have to get. This is like if you say more than empty--the gas tank is more than empty, which means it could be a lot more than empty. Adding ``merely'' puts it closer to empty. You just say it is merely more than empty. The addition of a single word made it more difficult for children with disabilities to get help at school.  That is why it is hard for me to understand why the judge said that the ``merely more than de minimus'' standard was binding on him when he wrote that opinion in 2006. It was not. He added the word ``merely,'' and then he used a standard that did not even decide that 1996 case; that was from a different circuit.  When interpreting the IDEA, the judge once again went a step further instead of deciding the case on a narrow ground. That matters because decisions like this have a dramatic impact on the lives of children and families, which is exactly what Justice Roberts noted when he wrote the opinion 8-to-0 rejecting the standard that Judge Gorsuch had used.  I have heard from families in my State, and so many of them tell me how IDEA has made a real difference for them.  My mom taught second grade in the Minnesota Public Schools until she was 70 years old. I know from her how much she worked with those kids with disabilities and how much she cared about them.  Here is an example I just learned about from my A mom from Watertown, MN, told me about her son, who was born with Down syndrome. She is so thankful for IDEA because its protections ensures that he can have everyday life experiences. IDEA allows her son to be fully integrated with the rest of the students in his school. As a result, he has made many friends and built a strong social network. When she asks her son whether he likes school, he always says, in a resounding voice: Those are the stakes of this legal debate.  Second, I wanted to focus on campaign finance. In my view, one of the most troubling court decisions in recent years is Citizens Since Citizens United, dark money has been spent in extraordinary sums, adding up to an estimated $800 million in just the past 6 years. This continues to have an outsized influence on our politics, distorting our representative democracy and hurting, in my mind, campaigns on both sides of the aisle.[[Page S2357]]  How does this apply to the judge? It applies to the judge because of an opinion he wrote that is very relevant to this area of the law. That case, which is called Riddle v. Hickenlooper, is a narrow case about how campaign finance laws apply to certain kinds of contributions in Colorado, about if they are a major party or not major party.  The judge again decided that a narrow consensus decision was not enough. It was part of that decision, but then he went out of his way to write a separate concurring opinion to suggest that the court should, in fact, apply strict scrutiny to laws restricting campaign contributions. If the Supreme Court adopted the approach in the judge's opinion, it would compromise the few remaining campaign finance protections that are still on the books, and it would make it even more difficult for Congress to pass future reforms.  The notion that Congress has little or no role in setting reasonable campaign finance is in direct contradiction with where the American people are. In recent polls, over three-quarters of Americans have said that we need sweeping new laws to reduce the influence of money in politics. While polls may not be a judge's problem and should not be a judge's problem, democracy is. When unlimited, undisclosed money floods our campaigns, it drowns out the people's voices, and it undermines our elections and shakes the public's trust in the process.  My colleagues and I repeatedly asked the judge about his views on campaign finance laws and public disclosure requirements. He declined to tell us what the proper legal standard would be for evaluating campaign finance laws. He also would not give us a real sense of his views on public disclosure of campaign contributions, although a majority of current Justices support this.  During our exchange on campaign finance, I was reminded of Justice Scalia's support for greater public disclosure and his comments on that topic. Justice Scalia said:       Requiring people to stand up in public for their political      acts fosters civic courage, without which democracy is      doomed. For my part, I do not look forward to a society      which, thanks to the Supreme Court, campaigns anonymously and      even exercises the direct democracy of initiative and      referendum hidden from public scrutiny and protected from the      accountability of criticism. This does not resemble the Home      of the  The most striking example of a judge choosing not to decide a case narrowly based on the facts was the one last year in which he wrote the opinion and then wrote a concurrence to his own opinion. As I noted at the Judiciary hearing, it is better to write a concurrence to your own opinion than write a dissent to our own opinion. But still he felt compelled to write a concurrence to what was an opinion that he wrote. Mostly, judges are happy when they get their peers to agree to a decision, but in this case, he went a step further.  In Gutierrez--the name of the case--the judge went beyond the facts to suggest overturning the long-established precedent of  Chevron is a 33-year-old Supreme Court case that ensures that the most complex regulatory decisions are made by the experts who are best equipped to handle them, not by judges or lawyers without any relevant technical knowledge.  Justice Scalia again embraced the Chevron doctrine, and it has been used in more than 13,500 decisions. Chevron ensures that Federal health, safety, and education rules stay on the books. These rules protect everyone, from the hard-earned pension of an hourly Minnesota grocery store worker, to the clean water in our Great Lakes, to the difference between life and death for Minnesota iron ore workers.  The judge's approach would have titanic, real-world implications on the daily lives of When the judge wrote an opinion that suggested it might be time to ``face the behemoth,'' he suggested a change in the law that would jeopardize countless rules, compromise important protections, and create widespread uncertainty in our laws.  I asked the judge about the uncertainty that would result from overturning I asked what he would replace it with. I didn't get a direct response. The judge even said that he ``didn't know what all the consequences would be'' and that he ``wasn't thinking about being a Supreme Court justice'' when he was writing the decision.  So what does all of this mean? It means that the judge has repeatedly gone beyond the facts of the case, issuing separate concurrences with far-reaching effects or, as in the disability decision, writing opinions with profound consequences.  When I read these opinions, I am reminded of Justice Byron White, who I know Judge Gorsuch clerked for and greatly admired. Justice White has been described by many as a Justice who was focused on deciding only the case in front of him. Here is a quote: ``Time and again, Justice White avoided broad, theoretical bases for a decision, when a narrow, fact-specific rationale would suffice.''  There is a reason we have judges to apply the law to the facts of a case. It is because answers aren't always as clear as we would like them to be, and sometimes there is more than one reasonable interpretation of the law. The cases that get to the Supreme Court are not the ones where everyone agreed at the lower court level. They are the really hard cases.  It is that discretion in making those decisions that makes it so critical that Justices interpret the law evenly, without fear or favor and with the humility to recognize the gravity of the office, to respect the role of the judiciary, and to understand the impact of their decisions on people's lives.  As I look back at the judge's record and his answers in the hearing, I am again reminded that it wasn't a law professor or a Federal jurist who was helped by a court's reliance on Chevron in interpreting a Labor Department rule. It was an hourly Minnesota grocery store worker who got to keep his hard-earned pension after the Eighth Circuit Court relied on  When the Supreme Court stripped away the rules in the Citizens United case that opened the door to unlimited super PAC spending, it was not the campaign financiers or the ad men who get paid to write these ads who were hurt. It was the grandma in Lanesboro, MN, who actually thought it mattered when she sent her Senator a $10 campaign contribution.  When Chief Justice Roberts wrote the unanimous opinion just this past month, rejecting the ``merely more than de minimis'' standard that Judge Gorsuch had used to limit the help kids with disabilities can get at school, the Justice said: ``When all is said and done, a student offered an educational program providing `merely more than de minimis' progress from year to year can hardly be said to have been offered an education at all.'' That is what the Supreme Court said about how the standard that Judge Gorsuch wrote in his opinion in the Tenth Circuit affected students with disabilities.  In the end, I believe we need Justices who understand that the law is more than a set of dusty books in the basement stacks of a law library. It is the bedrock of our society. Above all, we need Justices who understand and will uphold the motto on the Supreme Court building, to ensure all Americans achieve ``Equal Justice Under Law.''  That is why I won't be supporting the judge's nomination to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt2-PgS2353.txt

The authors of the Constitution laid the foundation of the Senate without really knowing what it would look like once it was standing. They knew it would rival and restrain the House of After all, the Senate has a higher age requirement, Members serve 6-year terms, and they have to represent not just a district but an entire But it was clear from the beginning of the formation of the Senate that it would take time before the purpose of this body was truly realized.  For several decades in our Nation's history, it was the House of Representatives--not the Senate--that hosted the great debates and introduced major legislation. It wasn't until the Nation began to splinter in the shadow of slavery that the Senate came into its own. While the rules of the Senate gave us its basic structure, it was the Members of the Senate--the people who made up this body--who had to stand up and lead. We remember them today as lions[[Page S2358]]of the Senate: Daniel Webster, John Calhoun, and Henry This body owes its status to them and their leadership because they began to define the Senate in a way that no one had before.  Over time, this place became one that valued bipartisanship, deliberation, and compromise. It has become a Chamber that balances the right to debate with demands for action.  In some of the toughest moments in our history, the Members of the Senate have used this body to lead, particularly when the President has faltered.  Take President The Watergate scandal had weakened the Presidency in ways that do-nothing Presidents never had. But the Senate, led by a Member of the President's own party, didn't stand by and watch the void, unmoved. They filled the vacuum for the good of the country.  It is this kind of history that has shaped the Senate into what it is today, a body that examines, considers, and protects.  Senator Byrd, the longest serving Senator in U.history once said: ``The Senate is a source of wisdom and judgment--both on the actions of the lower house and on the executive.''  That is what the Senate is for. That is our purpose. We achieve that purpose through customs and traditions; through members who serve 6-year terms and represent whole States; through rules that force bipartisanship, deliberation, and compromise.  Now the majority leader has placed one of those rules on the chopping block because they can't get to 60. He can't find the 60 votes needed to end debate on the President's nomination to the Supreme  We shouldn't be surprised to find ourselves here because, after all, back in February, President Trump told the majority leader to change the rules if he had to. Now, as this administration closes in on its first 100 days without passing a single piece of major legislation, the Senate majority leader is ready to fulfill the President's request and change the rule, instead of changing the nominee.  The question I have for this body is this: Should we change the rules in order to give the President a win before spring break? Should we be weakening the Senate at a time when the executive branch is so weak? Isn't it our obligation to assert ourselves into this void, instead of receding from responsibility?  I can think of no instance in the history of any great legislative body in which a legislature decides to diminish its own power. This is beyond strange in the world's greatest deliberative body, in the world's most powerful legislative For what good reason would we give up our own prerogatives?  This administration has been ineffective. Now the Senate majority leader is suggesting that the Senate respond to this executive weakness by weakening ourselves. This is wrong. The purpose of the Senate is achieved through bipartisanship, deliberation, and compromise. The 60-vote threshold for Supreme Court nominees preserves these ideals. Changing this rule will make it harder to get there.  Look at the House of Look at the way the House Intelligence Committee has dissolved so quickly into partisanship, unable to do its job.  Look at the country. Look at the campaign last year. We are a country divided. Polarization is at an all-time high. Now is not the time to crush a cornerstone of the Senate's foundation.  I don't think this is inevitable. This is not unstoppable. This is up to all of us. It is up to the Members of the Senate to decide if we are going to damage the world's greatest deliberative body at a time when the country needs us the most.  The Senate has always been defined by its The rules, the customs, and the traditions--they help. But at the end of the day, it is the Members of the Senate--like Calhoun, Webster, Clay, Kennedy, Inouye, Hatch, McCain--who make the Senate relevant and necessary.  We are going to find out who we are, as I would ask that at a minimum, the Senate take its time on this decision. Don't rush. That is not who we are. That is not how we get to the best decisions. This is about the future of the Senate and the future of the The nuclear option will mean nominees for the Supreme Court won't have to even meet with the minority party to be confirmed. It will mean that the Senate's habit of being slow--sometimes maddeningly slow--will go away. That tradition that allows the center to hold--not just in this Chamber but across the country--will be undermined.  So to my Republican colleagues, please take a few weeks before you decide to change the Senate forever. Take your time here. This is probably one of the most serious decisions that you are ever going to make as a Senator because it is about the Senate itself. This is worth talking about. This is worth deliberating over. It is worth thinking over.  Go home and talk to your constituents. If you want to do this, you have the votes. You can do this three Mondays from now, anytime you want. But for goodness sake, there is no harm in thinking about it. All we need are three members of the Republican Party to go to the majority leader--either publicly or privately--and say: Give us some time to find another way to do this. Otherwise, you will make the Supreme Court, this place, and this country more extreme and more divided. You will answer this difficult moment in history by weakening one of the last bastions of bipartisanship, and I believe you will regret it.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

All he has done for us has made Alaska a better place for literally thousands of people throughout our  Dan came to Alaska in 1974 after serving in the Army, as so many Alaskans do. Like so many Alaskans, he arrived with a glint of steel in his eye and a mission to help build our Alaska is full of natural wonders, but our manmade wonders are also marvels, and Dan wanted to be part of building more of those marvels for our State and for our country.  He first arrived in the North Slope Borough--the top of the world--to help the community build up their infrastructure and strengthen the Alaskan Native villages in the area. It was a time of enormous change for all of Alaska, particularly the North Oil from the North Slope Prudhoe Bay, the largest oilfield in North America, had recently begun to flow down the Trans-Alaska System for 800 miles. The largest land claims act in U.history, the Alaskan Native Claims Settlement Act, had recently passed, and the governments in rural Alaska were being formed and reformed to take advantage of these opportunities.  After Dan went back to school to receive a master's degree in business administration from Gonzaga, he made his way back to Alaska again to serve as chief financial officer and chief administrative officer for Alaska's North Slope Borough, where he launched an ambitious and ultimately successful capital plan to provide basic necessities that so many Americans take for granted, like running water and sewer,[[Page S2359]]those kinds of services, to the villages throughout the North Slope Borough, again, on the top of the world.  According to Bill Tracey, Sr., from Point Lay, which is one of the villages there, who was a coworker at the time, ``Dan's excellent work ethic and skills earned him the respect of the North Slope leaders. . . . His accomplishments were remarkable.''  With his beautiful and spirited wife Elaine always by his side, Dan then moved his family to Anchorage to head up the Alaska Housing Finance For 18 years, he managed HFC's nearly $5 billion in assets. It is not an overstatement to say that he revolutionized that agency, doing remarkable things, including and most importantly helping thousands of Alaskans--thousands of our constituents, our fellow Alaskans--pursue their dream of buying an affordable home. There is nothing more important than that.  The Alaska Legislature just passed a bill to name the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation the Daniel Fauske Building, and the dedication ceremony will take place in Anchorage on  As his bio indicates, there is no doubt that for decades Dan Fauske served Alaska with his hands, his heart, and with his head. But a bio on paper can only tell you so much about a person; to really appreciate him, you would have to have been with him and watched the energy and can-do spirit radiate from Dan You had to watch him talk to people with respect and humor and understanding and a very keen intelligence. He had a big laugh--a very big laugh--and he told great stories. He also had that rare ability to genuinely connect with everybody he met, it didn't matter who. He was able to speak the language of a businessman, a builder, a veteran, a public servant. He spoke the language of a father, a husband, a friend, and a true In doing so, he gained the respect of everybody, and I mean everybody, in my State--politicians, State workers, military members, people from all across Alaska, people from all across the political spectrum. If you wanted something done and if you wanted it done right in Alaska, you asked Dan Fauske to help you do it. People trusted him. I trusted him.  Most importantly, Dan was a great father to three great boys, D.J., Scott, and Brad, and two daughters, Marcy and Kathy, and he was a great husband to his incredible, vivacious, and very strong wife  Mr.President, Dan Fauske passed away this afternoon with his family and friends by his side.

In their honor and in honor of the thousands of advocates, first responders, crisis hotline volunteers, and others who work tirelessly on their behalf, I introduced a resolution to commemorate National Crime Victims' Rights  I thank Senators Leahy, Crapo, and Feinstein for joining me as cosponsors of this important resolution. In 2017, National Crime Victims' Rights Week takes place from April 2 through April 8. We have commemorated the week every April since 1981.  Here in Washington, DC, and across the Nation, activities are being organized to highlight and promote this year's theme: ``Justice.'' The theme for 2017 recognizes the strength of individual victims. It highlights the resilience of survivors as well as the victim assistance organizations who support survivors in their efforts to heal. And it reflects the importance of securing justice for crime victims.  During this week, we also highlight the contributions of the crisis hotline volunteers and staff, victims' rights attorneys, advocates, sexual assault nurse examiners, police officers, and other emergency responders who provide critical assistance to survivors of crime in communities across the United On Friday, several of these individuals will receive awards during a ceremony hosted by the Office for Victims of Crime at the U.Department of I extend my gratitude to those award recipients for their work to assist victims of crime.  Many of us in this Chamber have championed landmark legislation to enhance the rights of crime victims. For example, I was an original cosponsor of the 1984 Victims of Crime Act,[[Page S2360]]which established the Crime Victims Compensation I also joined my colleagues in supporting the 1994 enactment of the Violence Against Women This landmark legislation enhanced penalties for sex offenders and made hundreds of millions of dollars available for activities and programs to respond to the needs of domestic violence survivors.  The Judiciary Committee, which I chair, has continued to make the protection of victims' rights a top priority. Two years ago, we approved the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, which makes new resources available to help survivors of human trafficking. We also approved the Survivors' Bill of Rights, which establishes new rights for survivors of federal crimes of sexual violence. We cleared the Justice for All Reauthorization Act, which enhances crime survivors' ability to seek restitution and improves victims' access to legal services. And we approved the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crimes Reauthorization Act of 2016.  Supporting and protecting victims of crime will again be an important priority this year in the Judiciary Last week, I convened a hearing to examine allegations that dozens of young athletes experienced sexual abuse at the hands of coaches, instructors, and others.  Senators Feinstein, Collins, and I also recently introduced a bill, the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act, to ensure that sexual assault allegations by young athletes will be reported and investigated promptly. This year, we also will make it a priority to extend and update programs authorized under the Trafficking Victims Protection  In closing, crime victims and survivors in the United States deserve our assistance in helping them cope with the often devastating consequences of crime. That is why it is so important that we support the mission of National Crime Victims' Rights I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting passage of this important resolution.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-04-pt2-PgS2359-3.txt

638,BOOKER,proceeding_id,topic-id,909,"Mr.President, I rise today to introduce the Record Expungement Designed to Enhance Employment Act, or REDEEM This bill would take meaningful steps towards allowing returning citizens to obtain employment. As President George Bush said in his 2004 State of the Union Address, ``America is the land of the second chance, and when the gates of the prison open, the path ahead should lead to a better life.'' The REDEEM Act would help provide people with that second chance after their incarceration. I thank Senator Paul for his tireless work with me on the REDEEM  In the last 30 years, the number of incarcerated people in the United States has drastically increased. Since 1980, the federal prison population alone has grown by nearly 800 percent and American taxpayers are left paying for the bill. In fiscal year 2014, the Bureau of Prisons accounted for a quarter of the Department of Justice's budget at $6.9 billion. Our bloated criminal justice system wastes priceless human potential and fails to make our communities safer. It also fails to adequately prepare the over 600,000 people each year who are released from prison for their return to the community.  A high number of Americans living in our communities have criminal convictions. About 70 million people in the United States have been arrested or convicted of a crime. That means almost one in three adults in the United States has a criminal record. In fact, in our Nation's Capital alone, an estimated 1 in 10 DC residents has a criminal record.  The American Bar Association has identified over 44,500 ``collateral consequences''--or legal constraints--placed on what individuals with records can do once they are released from prison. Of those, up to 70 percent are related to employment.  Today, a criminal conviction is a modern-day scarlet letter that, because of the so-called War on Drugs, has had a disproportionate impact on communities of color. For example, African-American men with a conviction are 40 percent less likely to receive an interview. And the likelihood that Latino men with a record will receive an interview or be offered a job is 18 percent smaller than the likelihood for white men.  To increase public safety, reduce recidivism, and protect the future of our children, I am proud to re-introduce the REDEEM This bill would incentivize states to raise the age of original jurisdiction for criminal courts to 18 years old. Trying juveniles who have committed low-level, nonviolent crimes as adults is counterproductive. They do not emerge from prison reformed and ready to reintegrate into school, nor will the criminal record they have help them obtain a job.  This change in law is important for protecting our children's futures. For kids in the dozen states that treat 17- and even 16-year-olds as adults, no longer would getting into a school yard scuffle result in an adult record that could follow an individual for the rest of their life, restrict access to a college degree, limit job prospects, or lead to likely recidivism.  The bill would enhance Federal juvenile record confidentiality and provide for automatic expungement of records for kids who commit nonviolent crimes before they turn 15 and automatic sealing of records for those who commit nonviolent crimes after they turn 15.  The bill would ban the very cruel and counterproductive practice of juvenile solitary confinement that can have immediate and long-term detrimental effects on a youth's mental and physical health. In fact, the majority of suicides by juveniles in prisons occur when young people are placed in solitary confinement. Other nations even consider it torture.  The REDEEM Act would, for adults, offer the first broad-based federal path to the sealing of criminal records. A person who commits a nonviolent crime will be able to petition a court for sealing of the record, so their future job prospects are not harmed.  And the bill would enhance the accuracy of criminal justice records. Employers requesting a background check from the FBI will be provided with only relevant and accurate information thanks to a provision that will protect job applicants by improving the quality of the Bureau's background check.  Think about this: 17 million background checks were done by the FBI in 2013, many of them for private providers, and upward of half of them were[[Page S2366]]inaccurate or incomplete, often causing people to lose a job, miss an economic opportunity, and be trapped with few economic options other than to reoffend in order to feed a child or pay a debt.  The bill helps guard against gender disparities in federal juvenile delinquency proceedings. Additionally, it would ensure that programming and services are distributed evenly among male and female juveniles. Oftentimes, juvenile females receive less programming and resources than males because of the smaller size of the female prison population. This is wrong and this bill take a step forward to fix the problem.  Finally, the REDEEM Act would lift a ban on two critical Federal benefits: the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program and Temporary Assistance for Needy The intent of those Federal programs is to keep low-income families from going hungry. Yet those convicted of drug felonies lose the right to obtain such benefits. Once an individual has paid his or her debt to society, a path to the reinstatement of those benefits should be available.  I am proud to introduce the REDEEM Act today. Again, I thank Senator Paul for partnering with me on this bill. I urge this bill's speedy passage.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt2-PgS2365.txt
639,WYDEN,proceeding_id,topic-id,569,"Mr.President, most of us have heard the metaphor that small businesses are the engines that power our economy. What we don't hear people talk about as much is the fuel that feeds the engines: capital. Without capital, entrepreneurs cannot see their ideas to fruition, successful business owners cannot expand to meet the needs of the market, and eager job seekers must take their skills elsewhere. Without capital, Main Street falters, and Wall Street keeps the advantage.  Today, more than 9 years after the start of the great recession and many policy reforms later, access to capital remains a challenge. This capital drought hampers small business growth, economic development, and job creation in Oregon and across the country. Despite this, government regulation continues to tie the hands of many willing small businesses lenders--namely, credit unions. According to some estimates, credit unions could lend an additional $11 billion to small businesses if Congress loosened restraints on credit union business lending.  With this in mind, I am pleased to introduce today the Credit Union Residential Loan Parity Act with Senator This bill would increase access to capital by exempting certain loans from the member business lending cap imposed on credit unions. Currently, loans made for one- to four- person, non-owner-occupied housing are treated as business loans when they are made by credit unions. As such, these types of loans count against a credit union's business lending cap, effectively limiting a credit union's ability to provide loans to small businesses. Our legislation would address this issue by allowing credit unions to treat these types of loans as residential loans--the same treatment these kinds of loans receive when made by other financial institutions. In effect, the bill would exempt residential loans from the business lending cap. This exemption would increase access to capital for small businesses, which in turn would create jobs and grow our local economies. In addition to generally increasing credit union lending, our legislation would directly free up capital for small businesses that make much needed investments in rental housing.  I am hopeful that this legislation will be received by colleagues for what it is--a simple step to help ensure America's small businesses have access to the fuel they need to power our economy.  It is my hope that the Senate will pass this legislation swiftly.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 836       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

640,BOOKER,proceeding_id,topic-id,702,"Mr.President, I rise today to introduce the Fair Chance to Compete for Jobs Act of 2017, also known as the Fair Chance This criminal justice reform bill is designed to help returning citizens successfully obtain jobs and reintegrate into society. As the nation's largest employer, it is time the Federal Government leads by example and delays the criminal history inquiry until later in the hiring process. I thank Senator Johnson for his leadership on the Fair Chance Act, and I deeply appreciate Senators Baldwin, Ernst, Brown, and Portman for joining the bill as original cosponsors.  Everyone deserves the dignity of work and the opportunity for a second chance to earn a living. But far too many Americans who return home from behind bars have to disclose convictions on their initial employment application or initial job interview that often serve as insurmountable barriers to employment. This legislation would ensure that people with convictions--who have paid their debt to society and want to turn their lives around--have a fair chance to work.  By encouraging Federal employers to focus on an individual's qualifications and merit and not solely on past mistakes, the Fair Chance Act would remove burdensome and unnecessary obstacles that prevent formerly incarcerated people from reaching their full potential and contributing to society. It would also help reduce recidivism, combat poverty, and prevent violence in our communities by helping people get back to work.  Creating employment opportunities for our returning citizens benefits public safety. With little hope of obtaining a decent paying job, returning citizens are often left with few options but to return to a life of crime. A 2011 study in the Justice Quarterly concluded that the lack of employment was the single most negative determinant of recidivism. A report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that of the over 400,000 State prisoners released in 2005, 67.8 percent of them were rearrested within 3 years of their release, and 76.6 percent were rearrested within 5 years of their release.  Creating employment opportunities for our returning citizens strengthens our economy. Poor job prospects for people with records reduced our Nation's gross domestic product in 2008 between $57 billion and $65 billion. With an increasingly competitive global economy and to maintain America's competitive advantage, we must promote employment of all  Today, I introduce the Fair Chance Act, which would help eliminate barriers to employment for formerly incarcerated people and bring America closer to truly being a land of opportunity for all. It would preclude the federal government--including the executive, legislative, and judicial[[Page S2367]]branches--from requesting criminal history information from applicants until they reach the conditional offer stage.  This bill strikes the right balance. It would allow qualified people with criminal records to get their foot in the door and be judged on their own merit. At the same time, the legislation would allow employers to know an individual's criminal history before the job applicant is hired.  This bill would prohibit federal contractors from requesting criminal history information from candidates for positions within the scope of Federal contracts until a conditional job offer has been extended. Companies that do business with the Federal Government and receive Federal funds should espouse good hiring practices. The Fair Chance Act would permit Federal contractors to inquire about criminal history earlier in the hiring process if the job requires a candidate to access classified information.  The bill includes exceptions for sensitive positions where criminal history inquiries are necessary earlier in the application process. Exceptions include positions involving classified information, sensitive national security duties, armed forces, and law enforcement jobs, and jobs where criminal history information is legally required.  Finally, the Fair Chance Act would require the Bureau of Justice Statistics, in coordination with the U.Census Bureau, to report to Congress on the employment statistics of returning citizens. Currently, no comprehensive tracking of data on the employment histories of people with convictions exists. This provision would change that and allow us to better understand the scope of the problem people with convictions face when trying to find a job.  I am proud to reintroduce the Fair Chance I want to again thank the bill cosponsors and their leadership on this issue. I urge this legislation's speedy passage.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt2-PgS2365.txt
641,HASSAN,proceeding_id,topic-id,690,"Mr.President, I rise today to introduce my first bill in the U.Senate--a bill to help relieve the burden of student debt for young entrepreneurs from New Hampshire and the entire country.  Most of us have seen personally how heavily the burden of student loan debt weighs on students and families across New Less visible, but no less important, is how student loan debt is weighing down our economy--stifling innovation and job creation.  Student loan debt is preventing the next generation of entrepreneurs and innovators from opening their own businesses. A New York Times report highlighted that the percentage of new entrepreneurs between 20-34 years old fell to 25 percent in 2014, down from almost 35 percent in 1996. And Gallup found that 19 percent of graduates with student loan debt say they have delayed starting a business because of it.  It is time to once again unleash the entrepreneurial potential of our young people into creating the jobs of the future. That is why this week I introduced the Reigniting Opportunity for Innovators, ROI, Act, the first bill I am writing as a U.Senator, which would help provide the relief necessary for young entrepreneurs to start up and grow innovative small businesses.  The ROI Act will allow eligible founders and full-time employees of certified small business to defer their Federal student loan payments and interest accrual for up to 3 years while launching a startup. This will help give graduates the financial stability they need to take the risk of starting a business that can create good-paying jobs.  Additionally, this legislation provides an additional incentive for startup companies to move off the beaten path to help revitalize struggling communities. If the startup is located in an economically distressed area, founders and employees will be eligible for cancellation of up to $20,000 in student loans.  The ROI Act is an important step that we can take now to help young entrepreneurs and lay the foundation for a new generation of economic growth.  New businesses are historically the top job creators in our country, and small businesses are the driving force of New Hampshire's economy. But to get the education they need to compete for jobs in the 21st century economy, students are taking on more debt than ever before. In 2015, college graduates left school with an average of $30,000 of student loan debt, and New Hampshire students had the highest average student debt in the country.  At a roundtable discussion at Keene State College, I heard from students about the challenges posed by their student loan debt. One young woman told me that she hoped to start her own business but that she would likely have to put off that goal for another 10 years because of her student loan debt.  Any entrepreneur will tell you that getting a small business off the ground is expensive. These costs, mixed with student loan debt, make it even more daunting for young entrepreneurs to consider taking the leap of starting a new business. Student debt decreases the cash flow of potential entrepreneurs, it hurts their ability to build equity, and it can negatively affect credit scores and their ability to secure financing.

662,CANTWELL,proceeding_id,topic-id,1429,"Mr.President, I rise to oppose the nomination of Neil Gorsuch and to oppose cloture on this nomination.  I take seriously the responsibility to give advice and consent, and I take seriously the President's remarks that he planned on nominating someone to the Court who would overturn Roe v.  A U.Supreme Court nominee requires 60 votes, and if a nominee can't clear 60 votes, then I agree with my colleague, the Senator from New York, that it is the nominee who should be changed and not the Senate rules.  If confirmed, Judge Gorsuch will have a lifetime appointment to the U.Supreme Court and have an impact on many, many Americans' lives. When people say lifetime, I think that doesn't quite accurately reflect this issue and nomination. Lifetime, in this case, may mean 30 to 35 years.  It is hard for me in an information age to think of all the issues that are going to occur in the next 30 to 35 years and what issues this nominee might rule on. But I know this: Right now, privacy rights and how they affect the lives of many Americans are critical, not just to my constituents but to people all over the country.  Judge Gorsuch is commonly referred to as a proponent of originalism and textualism. He believes the U.Constitution should be interpreted by the original intentions of those who drafted it as closely as possible. As someone who knows well the record of the former Supreme Court Justice who wrote the Griswold v. Connecticut decision, I doubt that one would say that he was an originalist.  Some legal scholars have even called Judge Gorsuch a selective originalist, favoring some textual provisions while overlooking others. And while no one expects Judge Gorsuch to reveal how he would vote on a particular case. During his Senate confirmation hearing, he did not give Senators enough background about his judicial philosophy. In our private meeting, he did not give me enough of an assurance of his philosophy as it relates to these issues on privacy for my constituents in  Whether we are talking about access to healthcare or we are protecting individuals' privacy rights from unwanted corporation or government intervention, these issues are critically important. Judge Gorsuch told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he does recognize privacy rights. However, his earlier writings on unenumerated constitutional rights contradict this statement. This contradiction raised questions with me, and I worked to try to further clarify his judicial philosophy on this issue.  I told him that my State had actually codified the rights of women to have access to reproductive healthcare.  He said: Oh, you mean your State legislature did that.  And I said: No, Judge Gorsuch, I mean the people of Washington voted on these issues and voted to protect a woman's right to access to reproductive healthcare.  When it comes to the right to privacy, I work hard to understand where our judiciary is coming from, and if it is for the next 30 to 35 years, I guarantee you these privacy rights are going to be of critical importance.  In the longstanding precedent known as the Chevron doctrine, judges should defer to reasonable agency interpretations of ambiguous statutory language. It allows agencies to get expert input on their decisions and regulations. By overturning this doctrine, it could make it easier for courts to challenge important agency decisions protecting health and the environment. This issue is also important to my We fought the Enron case to make sure that the Federal energy regulators did their job in protecting the ratepayers of Washington from, at the time, what was, in my opinion, a violation of the Federal Power Act on just and reasonable rates. We had to go to a great extent to make sure that the agencies' decisions were carefully considered to make sure we didn't become the deep pockets.  Making sure that this doctrine is continued and not overturned is important. I find it troubling that Judge Gorsuch concluded that this precedent from Chevron v. the Natural Resources Defense Council should be overturned.  Also, yesterday was Equal Pay Day, and there was a lot of discussion about how women still face unequal wages. What would Judge Gorsuch do about equal pay?  As a professor, he told his students that women manipulate family leave policies for their own benefits. As a judge, he frequently ruled against women and their rights. In Hobby Lobby v. Sebelius, a privately held company, which was a store chain, challenged the Affordable Care Act's birth control benefit. The Affordable Care Act required health insurance plans to provide women with birth control coverage with no cost sharing.  Judge Gorsuch joined the Tenth Circuit majority, holding that an employer's religious beliefs could override an employee's right to birth control coverage. Judge Gorsuch also supported an effort to defund Planned Parenthood, an important provider of women's health services. In Planned Parenthood Association of Utah v. Herbert, the Tenth Circuit upheld an injunction to prevent the Governor of Utah from defunding Planned However, Judge Gorsuch dissented and pushed for a rehearing of this case by the full court.  Judge Gorsuch has had a narrow interpretation of the laws meant to protect workers against discrimination. In another case, a worker alleged that she had been unlawfully discriminated against based on gender because she took 2 weeks of leave under the Family[[Page S2373]]Medical Leave She claimed that her employer had a higher performance standard for women than for her male coworkers. The Tenth Circuit ruled in her favor and found that the employer had discriminated against her. However, Judge Gorsuch dissented, arguing evidence of discrimination was entirely absent.  These issues and rulings make me concerned about Judge Gorsuch's judicial philosophy as it relates to what I now believe is an accepted standard.  Judge Gorsuch has also ruled against LGBTQ individuals seeking fair and nondiscriminatory treatment. Lambda Legal and other groups have called his record openly hostile toward the LGBTQ community. Judge Gorsuch has held that a transwoman's constitutional rights were not violated, citing the absence of any medical evidence.  Also, as many of my colleagues have talked about, Judge Gorsuch has had a pattern of ruling against the little guy. My colleague from Hawaii noted that he seems to favor corporate interests over workers' rights and private interests over public interests.  Look at the outcome in many of these cases, which have been cited frequently since his nomination--none more than the case involving the Individuals with Disabilities Education I think it is so important that it needs to continue to be talked about.  This case, which was recently rejected by the U.Supreme Court, limited the opportunities for children with disabilities. Judge Gorsuch had concluded that to comply with the law, the school's responsibility to the student was to make progress that was ``merely more than de minimis.'' That is to say that those children in our education system who have a special need, whether it be autism or something else, through our education system need to make progress, and it could be no more than de minimis.  This ruling impacts hundreds of thousands of students all across America, including in the State of He wrote the majority opinion and used the word ``merely.''  I asked Judge Gorsuch about this because of the cases I mentioned earlier on Federal energy regulators and the fact that we needed strong anti-manipulation laws, and we needed people to interpret the standards to make sure that they were upholding the interests of the public. We had quite a long discussion about this issue. Judge Gorsuch suggested that he was bound by a previous decision.  I know some of my colleagues have also noted this, but when Justice Roberts wrote the unanimous opinion rejecting these ``merely more than de minimis'' standards that Judge Gorsuch used, Justice Roberts said: ``When all is said and done, a student offered an educational program providing merely more than de minimis progress from year to year can hardly said to have been offered an education at all.'' On this point, I agree with the Chief  Not having a deeper understanding about his judicial philosophy and given my great concerns for the right to privacy issues that will remain constant in our society for the next 30 years and given these issues around regulatory standards that are so important, I cannot support this nomination nor support cloture to move ahead.

We have all seen the horrific footage of the victims, many of whom were children.

Immediately following the death of Justice Scalia, in a move as cynical as it was irresponsible, Senate Republicans announced that they would not move forward with filling the vacancy until after the Presidential election. Before President Obama had even named a nominee, the majority leader said: ``The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice.'' The only problem with the majority leader's reasoning was the American people did have a voice in the decision; they had voted to make President Obama the President of the United Nonetheless, Republican members of the Judiciary Committee gathered behind closed doors and vowed to defy the eventual nominee a hearing. Many Republicans refused to even meet with the nominee. They said it didn't matter who the President nominated; they said this was about principle.  But Senate Republicans had a difficult time justifying their obstruction--that is, until they decided to mischaracterize a speech delivered by former Judiciary Committee chairman Joe Biden in June of 1992. In that June of 1992 speech, then-Senator Biden discussed the possibility of a Supreme Court Justice resigning in an election year in order to ensure that a President of the same party could name a replacement. Under those circumstances, he said, the President should refrain from nominating a replacement and the Senate should not hold confirmation hearings until after the election.  My Republican colleagues seized upon this small portion of Senator Biden's speech and dubbed it the ``Biden rule.'' Chairman Grassley said the Senate ought to abide by the Biden rule, which he said holds that there are ``no presidential Supreme Court nominations in an election year.''  The majority leader said: ``As Chairman Grassley and I declared . . . the Senate will continue to observe the Biden Rule so that the American people have a voice in this momentous position.'' So in order to justify a truly unprecedented act of obstruction, my Republican colleagues pointed to the so-called Biden rule and said they were standing on principle. That was the principle. But my Republican colleagues chose to overlook a few important details.  First of all, the scenario Senator Biden described in his 90-minute speech was not the situation our country faced last year. No one strategically resigned last year. A Justice died. No one dies to game the system.  Second and most importantly, my Republican colleagues ignored the actual point that Senator Biden made in that speech. If they had bothered to read the entire speech--and I suspect they actually had--they would have found that further down, Senator Biden said--and this is important. This is what Senator Biden said in the speech used as the justification not to take up Merrick Senator Biden said in that speech, ``If the president [then George Bush] consults and cooperates with the Senate or moderates his selections absent consultation, then his nominee may enjoy my support, as did Justices Kennedy and Souter.''  Allow me to dwell on that for a moment. Senator Biden said that if a Supreme Court vacancy arose during an election year and the President consulted with the Senate or, absent consultation, put forward a moderate, consensus candidate, that candidate[[Page S2374]]should enjoy the support of the Judiciary Committee's chairman. That is the Biden rule. That is the Biden rule.  If Senate Republicans had actually followed the Biden rule, we wouldn't be here today. Merrick Garland would be sitting on the Supreme Court bench.  Over the past few days, I have heard my Republican colleagues denounce Democratic opposition to Judge Gorsuch by claiming that there never has been a partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. But if the shameful and unprecedented obstruction that Republicans used to effectively block President Obama from appointing a Supreme Court Justice wasn't a partisan filibuster, then I don't know what is.  Perhaps my Republican colleagues were concerned that President Obama would seek to replace Justice Scalia--a reliably conservative member of the Court--with a jurist whose view would place him or her on the opposite end of the ideological spectrum. That seems to be the concern that my good friend Senator Hatch expressed when he said:       [T]he President told me several times he's going to name a      moderate, but I don't believe him. [President Obama] could      easily name Merrick Garland, who is a fine man. He probably      won't do that because this appointment is about the election.      So I'm pretty sure he'll name someone the [Democratic base]      wants.  But as it turns out, in recognition of the forthcoming election and the Republican-controlled Senate, President Obama did exactly what then-Senator Biden said a President should do: He named a moderate, consensus candidate. He named Merrick  Judge Garland was supremely well qualified for the job. Here is a guy who was his high school's valedictorian, who attended Harvard on a scholarship, won clerkships with legal legends like Second Circuit Judge Henry Friendly and Supreme Court Justice William Brennan, and left a partnership at a prestigious law firm to become a Federal prosecutor during the George H.Bush administration. He later joined the Justice Department, where he prosecuted the men responsible for bombing the Oklahoma City Federal Building in 1995, and Merrick Garland kept in touch with the survivors' and the victims' families. That is the reason why one of the very first of three Republicans agreed to meet with Judge Garland--Senator Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, a staunch conservative--because people of Oklahoma had such regard for Merrick  After Judge Garland was confirmed to the DC Circuit in 1997, he earned a reputation for working with his colleagues from across the ideological spectrum to identify areas of agreement and to craft strong consensus opinions, often by deciding a case on the narrowest grounds possible.  Judge Garland was the right choice at the right time. He wasn't a partisan warrior or a partisan political animal; he was a judge's judge, and everyone knew it. That is why my Republican colleagues had to hide behind new and misleading so-called rules in order to deny him a hearing and a vote.  Judge Gorsuch is no Merrick Judge Gorsuch is a creature of politics. That is not what Judge Gorsuch told me when I met him earlier this year. I asked Judge Gorsuch if he was bothered by the way the Senate treated Merrick He responded by telling me that he tries to stay away from politics. But documents that the Judiciary Committee received from the Department of Justice, including emails between Judge Gorsuch and Bush administration officials, show that Judge Gorsuch was very heavily involved in politics. A resume he sent to President Bush's political director in November 2004--back when Judge Gorsuch was looking for a job--detailed his work on Republican political campaigns dating back to 1976 and highlighted an award he received from Senate Republicans for his work to advance President Bush's judicial nominees. Ken Mehlman, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, later recommended Judge Gorsuch for a post at the Justice Department and described him as a ``true loyalist.''  Understand, being politically active or being a Republican is not a disqualifying characteristic in a Supreme Court nominee, at least not in my book, but Judge Gorsuch's resume is relevant here because, contrary to what he told me, his resume establishes that he is not just intimately familiar with politics; he knows the politics of the judicial nominations process and he knows it well. Let me explain why I think that is important.  During the campaign, then-Candidate Trump spoke openly about his litmus test and what kind of a judge he would appoint to fill Justice Scalia's seat on the He said that he would ``appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia.'' During the final debate, he said, ``The justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life. They will have a conservative bent.''  Part of the reason that then-Candidate Trump could say that with such conviction is because he had already outsourced the job of coming up with a list of potential nominees to the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation, both rightwing organizations. The groups produced a list of 21 conservative judges for then-Candidate Trump, a list that included Judge Presumably, the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation knew something about the judicial philosophy of the men and women who it had decided to include on that list, given Judge Gorsuch's previous work to push judicial nominees through the I am sure he knew a thing or two about the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society, as well.  In fact, Judge Gorsuch first learned that he was under consideration for the vacancy from the Federalist Society's vice president, who was working with the transition team. Judge Gorsuch went on to interview with a host of other members of the transition team, including now-White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Chief Strategist Stephen Weeks later, President Trump had officially nominated Judge Both Mr.Reince Priebus and Mr.Bannon appeared before rightwing activists at CPAC and talked about his nomination. Mr.Priebus told the crowd that Justice Gorsuch would bring about ``a change of potentially 40 years of law.'' He said: ``Neil Gorsuch represents . . . the type of judge that has the vision of Donald Trump, and [his nomination] fulfills the promise that he made to all of you,'' gesturing to a crowd of conservative activists.  So whether Mr.Priebus was suggesting that, if confirmed, Judge Gorsuch would unsettle 40 years of precedent--like Roe v. Wade or Chevron--or whether he was suggesting that Judge Gorsuch would be a reliably conservative vote for the next 40 years, it seems clear to me that confirming Judge Gorsuch is central to President Trump's political agenda.  Now, my Republican colleagues would have you believe that nothing could be further from the truth. In their view, they say that judges call balls and strikes--nothing more, nothing less. Earlier this week, for example, Senator Cruz said: ``Conservatives understand that it is the role of a judge, and especially the role of a Supreme Court Justice, simply to follow the law.'' He said that Senate Republicans ``are not confirming someone who will simply vote with our team on a given issue.'' It is Democratic judges, according to Senator Cruz who, ``by and large view the process as achieving the result they want and view the process of adjudicating a case as a political process.''  Let me explain why I take issue with that. If my Republican colleagues truly believe that a judge's proper role is to call balls and strikes and to decide cases narrowly, they would have confirmed Merrick Garland, a judge with a proven track record of crafting consensus opinions built on narrow holdings. But a judge who calls balls and strikes isn't really what my colleagues want. Contrary to what Senator Cruz said, what my Republican colleagues want is a results-oriented judge. Why else would they hold open a seat on the Supreme Court bench? Why else would they turn to the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society for candidates? Why else would they trample on the traditions of the Senate? What my Republican colleagues really want is a judge who will vote with their team, and that is the judge they will get by confirming Neil That is what this is all about. That is what this is about.  Unlike Merrick Garland, Judge Gorsuch has little interest in reaching consensus or in citing cases narrowly.[[Page S2375]]Now, Judge Gorsuch took great pains to paint himself as a mainstream nominee. He pointed out that the Tenth Circuit ruled unanimously 97 percent of the time, and that he was in the majority 99 percent of the time, but that is not unusual, and it doesn't provide any insight into his approach to being a judge. After all, the Courts of Appeals are required to follow Supreme Court precedent in all circuits around the country, and the vast majority of their cases are decided unanimously.  So in order to really understand Judge Gorsuch's approach to deciding cases--in order to really understand how he views the law--it is critically important to look at the cases where he chose to write separate concurrences or dissents. These concurring and dissenting opinions offer the clearest window into how he really thinks. Judge Gorsuch tends to write a lot of concurring and dissenting opinions. Even when Judge Gorsuch agrees with the majority and joins their decision, he frequently writes his own concurrence, setting out his own views. Judge Gorsuch has done this 31 times, including writing two concurrences to majority decisions that he, himself, had written. That is not seeking out consensus. That is holding his nose to join a consensus opinion, and then writing separately in order to point the way to broader, more sweeping rulings that other courts might issue in future cases--other courts like the Supreme Court, which doesn't have to follow precedent, which he is now poised to join and where he will not be restrained by precedent.  Judge Gorsuch is a results-oriented judge, and his record demonstrates that he approaches cases with a very specific outcome in mind. Contrary to what my Republican colleagues would have you believe, he doesn't hide that judicial philosophy. Whether it is his concurrence in Hobby Lobby or his dissent in TransAm Trucking, Judge Gorsuch wears that philosophy on his sleeve. It only underscores a disturbing pattern: siding with corporate interests over average  That philosophy was on full display in the dissent that Judge Gorsuch wrote in TransAm It seems clear to me that Judge Gorsuch approached this case with a specific outcome in mind, which was siding with a company over a worker. And in order to just justify that outcome in his dissent, Judge Gorsuch twisted himself into a pretzel.  You may have heard this story, but I want to lay it out as efficiently as possible because I think it reveals a great deal about Judge Gorsuch's philosophy, and it helps to explain exactly why I am voting against him. In this case, trucker Alphonse Maddin is driving a rig on the interstate through He is pulling a long trailer that is fully loaded. He makes a stop. He takes a break. Then, at 11 p.m., he is about to pull back onto the interstate, but discovers that the brakes on his trailer are locked. It is 14 below zero out. These brakes are literally frozen. So he calls his dispatcher to ask for repairs. And he waits.  While he is waiting, the heater in his cab stops working, and he falls asleep and is awakened by a call from his cousin. When Maddin sits up to answer the phone, he realizes that his torso is numb, and that he can't feel his feet. He is having trouble breathing. His cousin later says that Maddin's voice is slurred, and he wasn't tracking. According to the Mayo Clinic, these are all symptoms of hyperthermia. Maddin calls into the dispatcher again. He is told to hang on. He says: I can't. His boss tells him he has two choices, wait there until the repair truck comes, or he can take the whole rig on the road, including the trailer with frozen brakes. Those are the two options he is given by his boss. Maddin knows that if he waits, he may very well freeze to death. That is his first option, or he can go out on the interstate at 2 o'clock in the morning, dragging a fully-loaded trailer with frozen brakes at 10, maybe 15 miles per hour max, posing a safety hazard to other drivers at the interstate. Remember, it is 2 o'clock in the morning. It is dark. It is probably icy. Imagine a car going 80, 85 miles per hour--as people do at 2 o'clock in the morning on an interstate--coming up over a hill behind that rig, and then coming down and seeing this rig going 10 or 15 miles per hour, where you are going 80, 85. That would be like suddenly coming down on a stopped tractor trailer while you are going 70 miles per hour. That is his second option.  Instead, Maddin does what any of us would do. He unhitches the trailer and drives down the interstate to find someplace warm, and he does get warm. Then he returns to the trailer when the repair truck finally shows up, and he is fired. He is fired for abandoning his cargo. Now, there is a law to protect people in Maddin's situation. So he files a case. When it gets to the Tenth Circuit, a three-judge panel agrees with him, with They find that the trucking company shouldn't have fired Mr.Maddin, but one judge dissented--Judge Neil  So during my question, I asked Judge Gorsuch a very simple question: What he would have done if he had been the truck driver; if he had been driving that truck. I asked: Which would you have chosen? What would you have done? And here is Judge Gorsuch's response: ``Oh, Senator, I don't know what I would have done if I were in his shoes.''  Now, is there anyone here who would not have done what that driver did? I don't think so. Of course, you would unhitch the trailer and find someplace warm as quickly as possible--of course. But Judge Gorsuch said he didn't know what he would have done? Is that possible?  I asked him if he had even thought about what he would have done if he were You know, he had heard the case. He did not answer. So I asked him again. I asked him, given the choices of sitting there and possibly freezing to death or going on the road with an unsafe vehicle, or doing what Mr.Maddin did, and Judge Gorsuch responded: Senator, I don't know. I was not in the man's shoes.  Judge Gorsuch said he decides cases based on the facts and the law alone. ``I go to the law,'' he said. But so, in fact, did the majority. Here is the operable law. Here is the law: ``A person may not discharge an employee who refuses to operate a vehicle because the employee has reasonable apprehension of serious injury to the employee or the public because of the vehicle's hazardous safety or security condition.''  The majority ruled that the company could not fire the truckdriver because he had refused to operate the rig, the entire rig, because it was unsafe. But Judge Gorsuch said no. While operating the cab, he was operating the vehicle. Therefore, he did not refuse to operate a vehicle.  Judge Gorsuch said he made that decision by applying the plain meaning rule. I pointed out that the plain meaning rule has an exception: ``When using the plain meaning rule would create an absurd result, courts should depart from the plain meaning.'' It is absurd to say that this company was within its rights to fire him because he refused to choose between possibly dying by freezing to death or possibly killing other people by driving a semi on an interstate at 10 miles an hour at 2 in the morning. Frankly, the company is fortunate that Mr.Maddin made the choice he made because otherwise they may very well have faced a wrongful death claim.  Everyone who was in the hearing knows what Judge Gorsuch would have done in Alphonse Maddin's situation. If Judge Gorsuch had answered honestly, he would have said that he would have done exactly, exactly what the driver did. Everyone would. Judge Gorsuch just did not want to admit it. That is because there is no good answer.  If Judge Gorsuch said that he would do the very same thing that Mr.Maddin did, that would make his dissent look pretty bad. But if he had said ``I would have done what the company told me to do,'' that would be an absurd answer. That would make you question the man's judgment. No one would believe it. So, instead, Judge Gorsuch said: I don't know what I would have done. But of course he did. He just was not being honest. Judge Gorsuch approached Mr.Maddin's case with an outcome in mind, siding with the corporation, and the dissent that he wrote makes that perfectly clear.  When I joined the Senate back in 2009, I arrived here in June, a little later than the rest of my class. Just a few days later, my fifth day in office, Judge Sonia Sotomayor appeared before the Judiciary Committee for her[[Page S2376]]first day of her confirmation hearings for the Supreme I have been thinking a lot about Justice Sotomayor's hearings because the concern I expressed about the direction of the Court back then is just as relevant as today. Back then, almost 8 years ago, I voiced concern about it becoming more difficult for Americans seeking a level playing field to defend their rights and get their day in court, from bringing a discrimination claim to protecting their right to vote.  Back then, I said: ``I am wary of judicial activism and I believe in judicial restraint. Yet looking at recent decisions on voting rights, campaign finance reform, and . . . other topics, . . . there are ominous signs that judicial activism is on the rise.''  That was my first opening statement, the first opening statement that I ever delivered at the first confirmation hearing that I ever attended. But in the years that followed, my concerns have proved to be justified in one 5-to-4 decision after another. We have seen the Roberts Court go out of the way to answer questions not before it, to overturn precedents, to strike down laws enacted by Congress, and to do all of this at great cost to consumers and to workers and to small businesses and to middle-class  In decisions such as Shelby County, the Court gutted one of our landmark civil rights laws, 5 to 4. During the oral argument, Justice Scalia suggested that when the Voting Rights Act had last been passed 97 to 0 in the Senate, the Senate had done it because of the name of the Voting Rights How could you vote against the Voting Rights Act? What a great name. He was showing contempt for this body. What is more judicially active than overturning a law voted on unanimously in the Senate because the Senate just liked the name?  Of course what that did was get rid of preclearance. What is preclearance? Preclearance said that those States that had a history of suppressing the votes of minorities had to preclear any new voting law with the Justice  These were States that had a history of suppressing the votes of racial minorities. Well, that gets overturned. States like North Carolina, Texas, start passing new laws--voter ID laws. The second section of the Voting Rights Act still stayed, so you could appeal to a Federal court. But it takes a while to work its way through.  So finally, in early 2016, a circuit court, the Fourth Circuit I believe, ruled that North Carolina had targeted African Americans with almost surgical precision to suppress their votes. That is why you have preclearance. That is why you want preclearance. But in a 5-to-4 vote, preclearance was struck down. That is one 5-to-4 case. Concepcion, a 5-to-4 decision, allows corporations to force consumers into mandatory arbitration. There are a whole host of 5-to-4 decisions that make it impossible for people to get into the courts.  But the most egregious of all 5-to-4 decisions was Citizens United--another 5-to-4 decision that paved the way for individuals and outside groups to spend unlimited sums of money in our elections.  In each one of those 5-to-4 decisions Justice Scalia sided with the majority. So now this body considers replacing him with Judge I think it is important to understand the extent to which he shares Justice Scalia's views. Judge Gorsuch's record demonstrates that he is, in President Trump's words, a judge very much in the mold of Justice  During his time on the Tenth Circuit, Judge Gorsuch has consistently ruled in favor of powerful interests. He has sided with corporations over workers, corporations over consumers, and corporations over women's health.  A study published in the Minnesota Law Review found that the Roberts Court is the most pro-corporate Supreme Court since World War If the Senate confirms him, Judge Gorsuch guarantees more of the same from the Roberts Court, and I do not believe that is a Court that our country can continue to afford.  So I oppose Judge Gorsuch's nomination. I urge my colleagues to take a close look at his record of siding with powerful corporate interests over average Americans, to consider carefully how he stands to impact the Court, and to reject his nomination.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Kennedy). The clerk will call the roll.  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt2-PgS2372-2.txt

666,MURPHY,proceeding_id,topic-id,4184,"Thank you, Mr. Mr.President, confirming a Supreme Court Justice is one of the if not the most important responsibilities we have as It is a vote we cast knowing full well that the tenure and the influence of the nominee who is before us will likely be greater and much more long-lasting than our own in the  After meeting with Judge Gorsuch and reviewing hours of his testimony before the Judiciary Committee, I have decided to oppose his nomination, and I come to the floor this evening to talk about the reasons why.  I am deeply concerned about the politicization of the Supreme Court and its recent capture by corporate and special interests. I am convinced that Judge Gorsuch would exacerbate that slide and continue the activist bent of the existing Court, and for that reason I won't be supporting him in the vote tomorrow.  There is no doubt that Neil Gorsuch is a well trained, very intelligent lawyer who likely has the right disposition to serve on our Nation's highest Court, but that is not the end of the analysis that I or any of us are required to conduct. I am concerned about Judge Gorsuch's record of putting corporate interests before the public interests. His past decisions demonstrate a resistance on his part to put victims' and employees' needs above those of large corporations. He has regularly sided with employers over workers, corporation's rights over the rights of employees to make personal healthcare decisions. While he admirably claims to rest his decisions on the law rather than his political views, his consistent support for the powerful over the powerless doesn't seem coincidental.  The Roberts Court, in my mind, has swung dramatically in favor of the rights of corporations and special interests over those of individual I would have supported a mainstream nominee, but the risk that Judge Gorsuch will inject his political judgment over a process that already too often favors the rights of corporations over individuals is too great a risk for him to earn my support. That was the statement I released upon making my decision. I wanted to begin my remarks with it.  I want to talk a little bit about the elements inherent in my decision to vote against Judge Gorsuch because I don't take that decision lightly. I have said throughout the beginning of President Trump's tenure that I do believe we owe some degree of deference to a President in making choices as to who will serve him in his administration, and I think that likely applies to the question of whom a President chooses for the Supreme Court as well. I think I voted that way. I certainly voted against many of President Trump's nominees, but I voted for many of the nominees with whom I had very deep disagreements with over policy as well. So it is not a question of whether Judge Gorsuch would be my choice; it is a question of whether I think he is going to be in the mainstream on the Supreme Court or whether I think he is going to be an outlier and bring potentially radical views into the courtroom.  But it is kind of silly for us to pretend this debate is happening in a vacuum. I am making my mind up on Judge Gorsuch, as I will try to outline this evening, based upon my review of his record and my belief about who he will be as a  We would all be lying if we said as Democrats that we don't remember what happened on the floor of the Senate all throughout 2016. Merrick Garland should be on the Supreme Court today, or if not Merrick Garland, someone else who was nominated by President Barack The Supreme Court vacancy occurred with nearly 12 months left in his term--25 percent of a term that he was elected to by the people of the United The Constitution doesn't allow for 3-year terms. It[[Page S2377]]doesn't say the President becomes illegitimate once he hits the final 12 months. The Framers of our Constitution were hopeful that the President would be President for all 4 years. That last year was robbed not just from President Obama but from the American people by Republicans in the Senate when they treated Judge Garland with such disrespect.  It would have been one thing to simply vote against him because you didn't want to let the President of an opposing party fill that seat, but to not even give him a hearing, to not give him a vote, to not even take meetings with him, which was the decision of many Republican colleagues, that was a show of disrespect to Judge Garland that I don't think any of us could have imagined. It was a show of disrespect to this Chamber, to the traditions of this body that those of us who may have supported Judge Garland remember. That bad taste still sits in our mouth.  So I am here to state that my vote against Judge Gorsuch is not payback for the way in which Merrick Garland was treated, but I remember what happened.  To the extent that my Republican colleagues are suggesting that we should vote for Judge Gorsuch or at least vote for cloture tomorrow as a means of upholding the traditions of the Senate--spare me. Spare me. There isn't a lot of interest on this side of the aisle in upholding the traditions of the Senate if we are the only ones doing it.  Some people say: Well, if you voted for cloture on Gorsuch tomorrow and let it go to a final vote, then maybe Republicans would keep the rules as is.  That is belied by the facts. Last year, the Republican majority made it pretty clear that they were willing to break all tradition, all precedent, and all comity in the Senate in order to get their person on the Supreme That wasn't just a 2016 issue; that is the new normal for Republicans in the So whenever Democrats raised an objection to a nominee to the Supreme Court, the rules were going to change because Republicans made it clear that their first priority is to get their people on the Supreme Court and their second priority is to think about and try to preserve the way in which the Senate has run.  I am not voting against Neil Gorsuch because I am mad about what happened, but to the extent that I have heard Republicans in the Senate lecture us about violating the traditions of the Senate, it makes my blood boil because I was here in 2016. I saw what the Republican majority did to Merrick  Maybe we can sit down after this is done and talk about how the Senate just doesn't get into a giant vortex of devolvement, tit for tat, such that all of the reasons why people run for the Senate--the individual prerogatives that Senators have, the demand to find consensus in a way that doesn't exist in the House--all vanish. Merrick Garland is still here, and it would be silly for us to try to pretend he isn't.  One of the reasons I am so worried about Judge Gorsuch is because of his enthusiasm for a brand of judicial interpretation called originalism. It doesn't sound that radical, right, originalism? The idea is that one interprets the Constitution as the Founding Fathers intended it to be; one doesn't place it in the context of today. Simply think to yourself, what would those White men who wrote those words--what would they think about the case before us? What did they mean back in the late 1700s? On its face, it is an absurd way to think about judging cases because so much of what is before a Justice had no relevance and did not exist back in the 1780s, so questions about what these men thought about various questions regarding technology or civil rights are irrelevant because the Framers of the Constitution simply weren't thinking about the same things we are thinking about today.  One of our most famous jurists understood this right from the outset. Justice John Marshall wrote in McCulloch v. Maryland: ``We must never forget that it is a Constitution we are expounding, intended to endure for ages to come and consequently to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs.''  Even those who were judging the Constitution at its outset understood that, as the questions presented to this country changed, originalism--the idea that you only look to the thoughts and words and deeds of the Founding Fathers--probably wouldn't be an efficient way to decide cases.  Justice Brennan gave a wonderful speech at Georgetown in 1985 that is worth reading tonight. Justice Brennan said:       We current Justices read the Constitution in the only way      that we can: as Twentieth Century We look to the      history of the time of framing and to the intervening history      of interpretation. But the ultimate question must be, what do      the words of the text mean in our time? For the genius of the      Constitution rests not in any static meaning it might have      had in a world that is dead and gone, but in the adaptability      of its great principles to cope with current problems and      current needs.  He went on to say:       Time works changes, brings into existence new conditions      and purposes. Therefore, a principle to be vital must be      capable of wider application than the mischief which gave it      birth.  It is a wonderful turn of phrase.  He said:       This is peculiarly true of constitutions. They are not      ephemeral enactments, designed to meet passing occasions.      They are, to use the words of Chief Justice John Marshall,      ``designed to approach immortality as nearly as human      institutions can approach it.''  He said:       Interpretation must account for the transformative purpose      of the text. Our Constitution was not intended to preserve a      preexisting society but to make a new one, to put in place      new principles that the prior political community had not      sufficiently recognized.  Senator Klobuchar asked Judge Gorsuch at his hearing if, because the Constitution only uses the word ``he'' or ``his,'' it meant that a woman could not be Well, the Constitution doesn't specifically speak to this question, but if you were an originalist, I can imagine how many of those Founding Fathers would have answered that question. Why? Because they didn't believe that women deserved the right to vote, so why on Earth would they believe that a woman should be President? At the time, Blacks were considered to be subhuman. They were granted three-fifths status in the They were slaves. To read a document only through the lens of a group of White males who did not believe that a woman should be allowed to vote, who did not believe that Blacks were human beings and on equal footing with the rest of us, is to freeze this document in a time and ask us to, consequently, freeze ourselves in that time as well. If you do not allow the document to move, then you do not allow the rest of us to move either.  Originalism is a fraud, and what it has become is a mask for politics.  Now, what do I mean by that?  When you insist on interpreting the Constitution based only on the ways in which the writers of that document viewed the world, you have no way to base decisions in current times that are based on any real text or set of historical facts because, of course, the Founding Fathers had given no thought to many of the most important questions that are presented to us today--for instance, questions about what rights individuals have with respect to government surveillance over their cell phones, which is a question that the Founding Fathers--the Framers of the Constitution--could never have considered. It allows you to, essentially, make it up for yourself because there is no way that you can find a quote from any of the signers of the Constitution as to what they thought about these modern questions. You can spin it any way that you need to.  Originalism is an invitation to bring politics onto the Court because anybody can make up a reason as to why the people who wrote the Constitution would, ultimately, have decided the way that that jurist wants the decision to turn out.  It connects with other troubling writings of Judge Gorsuch's. He proudly calls himself an originalist. Historically, if we look at the broad swath of jurists who have gotten on the Supreme Court, it is not a mainstream school of judicial interpretation, but he has other radical views as well.  The Chevron deference standard is named for a 1984 case in which the Supreme Court held that it should defer to regulatory agencies when they interpret ambiguous laws that are passed[[Page S2378]]by We pass ambiguous laws, sometimes on purpose and sometimes by accident. But we often do it on purpose because we, ultimately, leave it to the regulator to fill in the details--to proffer regulations, to work out the details of enforcement. We often do not define every single term, in part, because we know that there is going to be the executive branch and people working for an elected official--the President of the United States--who are going to carry out that act and, ultimately, be responsible to the people.  What Judge Gorsuch has suggested is that maybe it is time to overturn the Chevron deference standard. Maybe we should not give any deference to administrative agencies any longer. Maybe the Supreme Court, on every single law, should do a de novo review of its constitutionality and give no deference to the executive branch.  First of all, that would be pandemonium. It would greatly accelerate the number of cases that come before the Supreme Court and the number of major--potentially life-changing--decisions that the unelected Court is making. Why? Because we are always passing statutes here that leave room for interpretation. Again, we do it many times intentionally and sometimes unintentionally, but it happens every single month here that we pass statutes that leave room for interpretation.  We often do that knowing, as I said, that the Executive will make some of those secondary interpretations. We are comfortable with that because, if his interpretation goes wrong, then that Executive is never more than about 3\1/2\ years from an election.  The executive branch is responsible to the people. The courts are not. These are lifetime appointments that we make. If every single statute that we pass is interpreted from the foundation by the Supreme Court and if they get it wrong, there is no way to get rid of them. There is no way to roll that interpretation back. In fact, that is one of the reasons for the Chevron deference--the reluctance of the Court to make itself an active political player in the process of interpreting statutes.  So it is radical that Judge Gorsuch is suggesting that, if he were put on the Supreme Court, he would overturn that 1984 case. Justice Scalia was one of the primary defenders of Chevron for that very reason, in that he saw that the legitimacy of the Court--indeed, the legitimacy of the entire judicial system--would be put in jeopardy if it inserted itself as the primary arbiter of ambiguous statutes, of statutes that needed interpretation.  Originalism is an invitation to take your politics onto the The evisceration of the Chevron deference would, inherently, make the Court a political body. If you combine the two together, you will start to see a Justice who will likely continue this trend line of its being an activist Court that makes political decisions in substitute of the  We have all seen it happen, whether it be in the voting rights case, in which the unelected Supreme Court decided that racism was not something that we had to think about any longer due to their vast experience in the South and in dealing with cases of voter suppression, or in their arbitrary decision that corruption should be very narrowly defined and that we need not pay attention to the slow, creeping corruption that happens when donors get access to the political process through donations of thousands and tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars. The Supreme Court is telling the people of this country and this Congress what corruption is and what it is not.  Those are political decisions that the Court has made--an activist Court--that now may have among its members a Justice who has, effectively, advertised himself as being willing and eager to join that trend line on the  Individual cases raise concerns as well. In Riddle v. Hickenlooper, Judge Gorsuch expressed an openness in providing a higher level of constitutional protection to a donor's right to make political contributions than the Court currently affords the right to actually vote--donors having more rights than voters have.  As for the result of applying strict scrutiny, which is the term that he is referring to with regard to political donations, we do not exactly know what would happen, but it likely would have the consequence of making it almost impossible to regulate campaign finance. Ninety-three percent of Americans, in a recent poll, think that government should be working to limit the impact that big donors have on politics today. Yet Judge Gorsuch has suggested that, as a Supreme Court jurist, he may move the law in the opposite direction, robbing from both of us--Republicans and Democrats--the ability to do what 93 percent of Americans want us to do, which is to restrict the ability of a handful of billionaires to affect the political process.  In the Hobby Lobby decision, yet again, Judge Gorsuch suggests that corporations, in this case, have more rights under the Constitution than do the individuals who work for them--that the religious freedom rights of the corporation trump the religious freedom rights of employees. Once again, it ruled that those with power--big donors or corporations--have more rights than those with less power--ordinary voters, employees of these big companies.  Years ago, Judge Gorsuch wrote in a complaint, according to him, that liberals were using the Court to try to push their political agenda rather than to bring it here to the The reality is that, over the course of the Roberts Court, the exact opposite has happened. It has been Conservatives who have brought their complaints to the court system--their complaints about voting rights, their complaints about campaign finance, their complaints about the Affordable Care Act--rather than to have brought them to the floor of this body.  As the House of Representatives abandons, for the time being, the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act, their allies continue to push cases through the court system that would attempt to unwind it. Judge Gorsuch has been, in his writings at least, blind to this idea that Conservatives have spent just as much time over the past 20 years in trying to push their agenda in court as have Progressives have done that as well.  Clearly, we have full marriage rights in this country because of court cases that Progressive groups push. I am not denying that there is not this trend line on both sides of the political spectrum, but Judge Gorsuch seems to only recognize it in his writings when it comes to the liberals who are pushing these causes.  These are the most important decisions we make. Many of us may only get to vote on a Supreme Court Justice once or twice. This is my fifth year in the Senate, and this is my first vote. My first vote should have come in 2016, but it is coming now in 2017. I do not take it lightly, but there is a reason--when you go back to your apartment here in Washington--that you are watching TV commercials that are paid for by big corporations and billionaires who support Judge Gorsuch's nomination.  He says that he is going to play it straight. He says that he is not going to be affected by his political agenda. I hope that he is right, but the folks who are fronting the money for these ads do not believe him. They think they know how he is going to rule. Believe me. They would not be putting up all of this money on TV if they did not think that Judge Gorsuch was going to be a friend to the big companies, to the billionaire donors who want more and more protection through the court system.  Donald Trump was right about something when he ran for He was not right that elections are rigged, but he was right that, in general, the system--our economic state of affairs--does seem to be pretty rigged against regular people. Economic mobility, which is how we define ourselves as a country, is further away from the people whom I represent in Connecticut than ever before, and the statistics bear that out.  Your ability to move from poverty to prosperity is less today than it has been at any point in our lifetimes. It does feel like the powerful and the rich have recovered very nicely from this recession and that nobody else has. It feels like they have a voice here in Washington that no one else has either.  If you are President Trump, having run on this promise to unrig the system, boy, this doesn't seem like the person you should be sending to the[[Page S2379]]bench, somebody who has openly advertised his enthusiasm for voting with billionaires, with corporations, with folks who have lots of political power already.  The TransAm case, which has been talked about enough on the floor, is a unique one. It is the case of a trucker who was being potentially left to die by his employer on the side of the road, who left his truck to save his life and potentially the lives of others on the road, had he chosen instead to operate it. Judge Gorsuch ruled with his employer, effectively suggesting this man should have risked his life or the lives of others to comply with the strict letter of the law.  Judge Gorsuch was asked in the Judiciary Committee what he would have done: What would you have done if you had two options--sit in that truck and face death or put it back on the road and potentially kill others? What would you have done? Judge Gorsuch said that he hadn't thought about it.  I don't want my Supreme Court Justices to be political. I don't want them to be us. It really is our job to think about, in a real, tangible, grassroots way, the effect of our laws on their lives. But I don't want a Justice who doesn't even contemplate the answer to that question, the impact of the law on regular people. I don't want a Justice who views the law only through the eyes of a group of White men who lived in a fundamentally different world. I don't want a Justice who isn't thinking about how the law applies to people who need a statute's protection, rather than thinking about those who, frankly, don't need the protection of statute because they have been handed a pretty good lot in life from the start.  I am going to oppose cloture tomorrow, and if we eventually get to a vote, I will oppose Judge Gorsuch on final passage.  My final comment is this: When that moment comes, I do hope that our colleagues will think twice about changing the rules of the They had already broken with precedent once in 2016 in a way that I think is unforgiveable. To do it twice in a 24-month period puts this place on a downward spiral that I am not sure we can recover from. If we just want to be the House of Representatives, let's just do it. But there is another way to go, to select a nominee who could truly get bipartisan support.  As my colleague Tim Kaine is fond of saying, there is only one appointment by the President of the United States that needs 60 votes. There is only one person the President picks who needs to get more than 60. That is the Justice of the Supreme Court because it is permanent, because it is important, because it lasts longer than we do. There is probably good reason for that.  Precedent and comity were broken in 2016. I will never, ever forget the disrespect shown to Judge Garland and to everyone in this body, but to double down on that break with precedent, on that break with tradition, by changing the rules of the Senate permanently with respect to Supreme Court Justices--I know they can say that Democrats did it a few years ago. That is true. But the Supreme Court is a different animal entirely, and the decision is one I hope my Republican colleagues will rethink.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt2-PgS2372-2.txt
667,HIRONO,proceeding_id,topic-id,2907,"Mr.President, when Senate Republicans executed their unprecedented block of President Obama's nominee Merrick Garland, the well-credentialed, well-respected, moderate chief judge of the DC Circuit, they knew what they were doing. They were willing to set aside the history and practice of the Senate to make sure no nominee of President Obama's would fill the vacancy created by Justice Scalia's death.  As fate would have it, a Republican won the Presidency and then, the majority leader's path was clear. This is exactly what happened: President Trump selected Neil Gorsuch from a list put together for him by the ultraconservative Heritage Foundation and Federalist These organizations selected Judge Gorsuch because they want to preserve the conservative 5-to-4 majority of the Roberts  This majority has done terrible damage to many laws Congress has passed to protect ordinary Americans, and has made it more difficult for us to pass new laws. My colleagues and I have shined a spotlight on these rightwing organizations and the $10 million campaign they have run on Judge Gorsuch's behalf because they believe his view of the law matches theirs. And therein lies our concern.  These organizations have spent so much money and worked so hard on Judge Gorsuch's behalf because they could trust, perhaps not 100 percent of the time, but enough of the time, that Judge Gorsuch would decide cases in ways they would agree with and support.  Judge Gorsuch is an Ivy League educated lawyer with 10 years on the Federal bench. He is not naive. Even if he refused to acknowledge the fact that these groups are supporting him, Judge Gorsuch knows as well as we all do that politics have a real impact on the kinds of nominees selected to serve on the Supreme  We know he understands this because he said so in his 2005 National Review Online article, which was entitled ``Liberals'N'Lawsuits.'' In that article, he wrote that because Republicans had won elections for the Presidency and for control of the Senate, the Republicans were in charge of the judicial appointment process. As a result, he said, ``the level of sympathy liberals pushing constitutional litigation can expect in the courts may wither over time, leaving the Left truly out in the cold.''  This article demonstrates that Judge Gorsuch understands that judges appointed and confirmed by Republicans will have less sympathy for, as he put it, ``liberals pushing constitutional litigation.'' Clearly, judges do not make decisions divorced from their personal and philosophical leanings. However often or however loudly they might protest, conservatives understand that their arguments about the narrow role of judges--their claims that Justices are there only to modestly apply the law and adhere to the Constitution--are bunk. And Judge Gorsuch must know this too.  Nowhere is this brand of conservative judicial activism clearer than in the actions of the Roberts Court to reach into our elections to tilt the political landscape--with a significant impact on whose votes are heard in our political process and who is able to take part in our elections.  Based on his writings, Judge Gorsuch clearly understands the relationship between politics and the courts. I am convinced that adding Judge Gorsuch to the Roberts Court will only continue the Court's intervention into politics.  The actions of the Roberts Court are clear. This Court has issued a series of decisions that have made it easier for conservative organizations to spend unlimited and unregulated dark money on elections, and that may have made it harder for people to vote, harder for people to participate and have those voices heard in the political process. These decisions have changed who is able to participate in the democratic process, who gets elected, and, in turn, who gets nominated to the Supreme  Justice Felix Frankfurter's famous admonition that ``Courts ought not to enter this political thicket'' captures the challenges for courts treading into politics. Of course there are times when the courts must do so--to ensure one person, one vote, for example. But courts must also be careful when wading into politics because the legitimacy of the court is itself put at risk.  The most memorable example, of course, came when the Court effectively decided the 2000 Presidential election in Bush v.  In the Citizens United and Shelby County decisions, we have seen the tremendous damage the Court can do to democracy when it tilts the electoral process so heavily against ordinary  In the 2010 Citizens United decision, the Roberts Court struck down bipartisan laws limiting campaign contributions that went back more than a century. This decision opened an unrestrained flow of money and potential corruption that has dominated our politics and drowned out the voices of ordinary Americans ever since.  The Court's decision in this case was not an accident. Chief Justice Roberts engineered the decision in that case by steering it away from the narrow question before the Court about how to apply a particular law and into a broad constitutional question. His efforts[[Page S2380]]demonstrate that the Supreme Court has broad power and latitude to push and shape the law.  This kind of conservative judicial activism directly contradicts what Justice Roberts famously said during his confirmation hearing. He said the job of a Justice is to simply call balls and strikes.  Jeffrey Toobin, in a 2012 article in the New Yorker entitled, ``Money Unlimited: How Chief Justice John Roberts orchestrated the Citizens United decision,'' and in his recent book, ``The Oath,'' recounts very clearly how Chief Justice Roberts engineered this campaign spending decision.  The question originally presented to the Supreme Court in Citizens United, according to Toobin's account, was a narrow one. It involved whether one of the provisions of the bipartisan McCain-Feingold campaign finance law applied to a documentary criticizing a candidate and not just to television commercials. In fact, Ted Olson, the well-known conservative lawyer representing Citizens United, the organization that wanted to run the documentary, made a narrow argument that the McCain-Feingold law was not meant to apply to that kind of documentary. This was an argument based not on the Constitution, but on deciding the case before the Court in the narrowest possible way. Such a decision would have been restrained.  It became clear during oral arguments that the conservatives on the Court had the opportunity not just to apply the law, but to change it entirely. Chief Justice Roberts and the other conservative Justices on the Court began to do this by aggressively questioning the government's lawyer on issues not then directly before the As Toobin describes, ``Through artful questioning, Alito, Kennedy, and Roberts had turned a fairly obscure case about campaign-finance reform into a battle over governmental censorship.''  Now that it was clear to Chief Justice Roberts that there was a majority on the court for making a broader constitutional decision, he ordered that the case be reargued, rather than simply deciding the narrow question argued by both Olsen and the government's attorney. Chief Justice Roberts wanted the Court to take head-on a question that was not in fact before it and which the Court had decided the opposite way only 6 years before. When the Roberts Court decided Citizens United the following year, after reargument, it did so on the broadest possible ground--unconstitutional grounds--and found that corporations, like people, have First Amendment rights. It found that these rights could be violated by limits on campaign contributions.  Again, this outcome did not happen by accident; Chief Justice Roberts engineered the result. According to Toobin's account, Chief Justice Roberts chose to assign the opinion for the majority to Justice Kennedy, who was known to be very skeptical of campaign finance laws and believed that limits on campaign spending violate free speech. By doing so, Chief Justice Roberts ensured that the Citizens United decision would be a broad one, and it was.  The way the Court chose to reach out and change the law was wholly unnecessary to decide the case at hand. And it certainly was not judicial restraint; it was judicial activism. The Court in Citizens United reached out to overturn precedent and upend laws dating back more than a century to find new rights for corporations to funnel untold millions into our political system.  This decision also severely limited the ways in which Congress could take action to continue to pursue the aims of campaign finance laws to limit political corruption.  In his article, Mr.Toobin said:       [Citizens United] reflects the aggressive conservative      judicial activism of the Roberts It was once liberals      who are associated with using the courts to overturn the work      of the democratically elected branches of government, but the      current Court has matched contempt for Congress with a      disdain for many of the Court's own precedents.       When the Court announced its final ruling on Citizens      United, on January 21, 2010, the vote was five to four and      the majority opinion was written by Anthony Above      all, though, the result represented a triumph for Chief      Justice Even without writing the opinion, Roberts,      more than anyone, shaped what the Court did.  But the Roberts Court was not done with its activism to radically change the landscape of our elections. In another narrow 5-to-4 decision in Shelby County in 2013, the Court substituted its conclusions for that of Congress and gutted core protections of the Voting Rights Act--protections which were essential for the right to vote for millions of Again, this was not a decision the Court needed to or should have reached. And again, it was a decision engineered by Chief Justice John Roberts and the conservative majority on the Supreme  Back in 1982, Chief Justice Roberts--then a special assistant to the Attorney General--was the point person for the Reagan administration's opposition to strengthening the Voting Rights At that time, Congress acted to fix a hole in the Voting Rights Act that the Supreme Court had opened in a 1980 decision. John Roberts was opposed to these efforts to make clear that election practices or procedures that result in discrimination, not only those with the intent to discriminate, violate the Voting Rights  In 1982, Congress successfully passed their fix over the objections of John Roberts and the Reagan administration. If you look at John Roberts' memos and articles from that period of time--in which he was a strong advocate within the administration for the position it took--his view of the Voting Rights Act was clear. It was a view he would apply years later as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court when he led a 5-to-4 majority to gut section 5 of the Voting Rights  The preclearance provisions of section 5 mandated that any changes to voting laws in States with a long history of discrimination have to be approved in advance--or precleared--by the Justice Department or by the DC district court. These provisions, passed a century after the conclusion of the Civil War, for the first time effectively guaranteed the rights protected by the 14th and 15th Amendments in many parts of the country. Section 5 changed the landscape of our democracy and opened the door for millions of people to exercise their right to vote.  These provisions of the Voting Rights Act were reauthorized nearly unanimously by Congress in 2006. Before reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act, the Senate Judiciary Committee alone held nine hearings on it. The thousands of pages of material the Senate reviewed, together with the record developed in a dozen hearings in the House, clearly established why it was so important to maintain preclearance in order to protect the right to vote in jurisdictions with a long history of voting discrimination.  Yet, in Shelby County, the Roberts Court ignored this evidence and the Court's long precedent. The Court made its own determination about the value of the extensive evidence reviewed by Congress and struck down these core provisions. The Court refused to defer to the extensive findings and determination of Congress even though Congress is expressly charged by the 14th and 15th Amendments to enforce the guarantees of those Amendments--the guarantee of the right to vote. The Court did what John Roberts fought to do years before and weakened the Voting Rights So much for judicial restraint. So much for just calling balls and strikes.  A Justice and a Court devoted to judicial restraint, with an understanding of the separation of powers, never would have ignored Congress acting at the height of its constitutional powers and its factfinding capacity. Yet Chief Justice Roberts and the narrow conservative majority on the Court chose to act--to reach out and to gut one of the core protections of the fundamental right to vote.  We now know that Congress got it right and the Supreme Court got it wrong in its judgment about the continuing need for section 5 of the Voting Rights Immediately after the Shelby County decision, numerous States previously covered by section 5 immediately passed onerous voter ID laws and other barriers that affected the right to vote of millions of people. Some of these laws were even enacted with discriminatory intent, not just discriminatory effect--in other words, they were blatantly meant to discriminate in voting.  These newly raised barriers had a clear impact in last year's elections.[[Page S2381]]For the first time in two generations, thanks to the actions of the Roberts Court, we risk unraveling the progress my friend John Lewis fought for alongside so many others during the civil rights movement.  During his confirmation hearing, I asked Judge Gorsuch about the Shelby County decision, since he often explained the constraints on his approach to judicial decision making in terms of the separation of powers. He said several times that judges make terrible legislators, that courts lack the staff, capacity, and training to do the kind of factfinding that is an essential part of the legislative process. Yet, when I asked him whether the Court's decision in Shelby County raised the kinds of concerns he had noted about the limits of judges as policymakers and legislators, he declined to answer.  But this is about more than Judge Gorsuch's refusal to answer. It is about more than the narrow view he expressed of the role of a judge or, particularly, a Justice--a narrow view that is not a reflection of the real world. Both the process and the outcome in Shelby County and in Citizens United raised exactly the kinds of concerns that make it so important for the Senate to understand Judge Gorsuch's judicial philosophy before putting him on the Supreme Judge Gorsuch would become part of a newly empowered 5-to-4 conservative majority on the Roberts Court, which has been anything but restrained in moving the law for the benefit of corporations and against individual rights.  Taken together, these two decisions, Citizens United and Shelby County, have made it harder for millions of Americans to have their voices heard in our election process and their votes counted at the ballot box. Since Citizens United, the floodgates have opened to unfettered corporate money in our elections. Since Shelby County, 13 States have enacted laws placing limitations on voting. Many of these are in States that would have been prevented from doing so in the first place before the Court gutted section 5 of the Voting Rights After Shelby County, these States could pass such laws, and they did, disenfranchising tens of thousands of voters in the process.  My Democratic colleagues and I asked Judge Gorsuch many questions to try to understand his pattern of narrowly interpreting laws meant to protect individual rights or worker safety in ways at odds with the law's purpose. For example, the narrow interpretation Judge Gorsuch took on the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA, would have left Luke Perkins and thousands of special needs children like Luke without a chance to make educational progress. His interpretation was so at odds with the purpose of the IDEA law that the Supreme Court unanimously rejected and criticized Judge Gorsuch's narrow standard in a case they decided just a few weeks ago.  Time and again, Judge Gorsuch threw up his hands and told us that if we disagreed with this narrow reading of the relevant law, that Congress should do better. In his view, the problem was not the Court--which he seemed to cast as an innocent bystander--but, rather, the way Congress had written the law.  By tilting the political playing field so heavily toward corporations and unfettered dark money and against individuals, the Roberts Court has impacted the composition of who is in The Court has made it even harder for Congress to take meaningful action to, say, pass laws to protect workers' safety or the access of students with special needs to an education. In turn, these decisions have had a real-world impact by changing who gets to participate in the political process and therefore who gets elected and who has input on the kinds of laws that are passed--and, of course, who gets nominated to the U.Supreme  The actions of the Roberts Court in Citizens United and Shelby County make clear the stakes of the Gorsuch nomination. They make clear what the Senate Republicans had in mind in their unprecedented and arrogant refusal to consider President Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme They wanted, instead, a Justice like Judge Gorsuch who would continue the rightward march of the 5-to-4 conservative majority on the Roberts And the United States Senate should not allow this brazen gambit to succeed.

682,GRASSLEY,proceeding_id,topic-id,1070,"Mr.President, within the next hour or so, we will learn whether the minority will come to their senses or whether they will engage in the very first partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. All indications are that they are committed to their course. That is unfortunate. It truly is.  The question one has to ask is this: What, exactly, is so objectionable about this nominee that he should be subjected to the first partisan filibuster in U.history? Is he, really, not well qualified?  He attended Columbia for his bachelor's, Harvard for law school, Oxford for his doctorate. He clerked for not one--but two--Supreme Court He has spent over 10 years on the circuit court and has heard 2,700 cases. It is clear, then, that he is extremely well qualified.  So what is it? What makes this nominee so objectionable?  The truth is, throughout this process, the minority, led by their leader, has[[Page S2386]]been desperately searching for a justification for their preplanned filibuster. Over the course of the last couple of months, they have trotted out one excuse after another, but nothing will stick.  They said he isn't mainstream, but that is not true. Everyone from Obama's Solicitor General to Rachel Maddow has said he is mainstream. They said he isn't independent, but everyone knows he is an independent judge. He is his own man, and he understands the role of a judge.  Then they roll out this ridiculous argument that he is for the big guy and against the little guy. Even liberal law professors like Noah Feldman made fun of that attack. He called it ``a truly terrible idea.'' Then they said we should hold him responsible for the legal positions he took on behalf of the U.The only problem there is, we have had a lot of nominees who have represented the U.They worked for it; the government was their client. The other side certainly didn't want to hold Justice Kagan responsible for taking the truly extreme position as Solicitor General that the U.Government was constitutionally permitted to ban pamphlets. So that argument fell flat as well.  Then, of course, after they ran out of substantive arguments against the judge and his record, they resorted to attacks on his supporters or the President who nominated him or the selection process, anything--anything--to distract from the judge and the stellar record he has.  They trotted out this absurd claim that we should reject the judge not because of some opinion he has written but because those who support his nomination have the gall to actually speak out and make their voices heard, except they forgot to check with their own supporters first to make sure none of them are spending so-called dark money. Of course, they are spending money on issue advocacy, just as the law permits and the Constitution protects under the First  As we all know, issue advocacy during Supreme Court nominations is absolutely nothing new. Those who are complaining about issue advocacy today don't seem to remember the TV ads the far left ran attacking Judge Bork in 1987. I remember those ads. I remember the ads the left ran against Justice Thomas as well. Of course, outside groups on the left have attacked every Republican nominee since.  So expressing selective outrage over issue advocacy doesn't advance their cause either, but they still keep it up.  Finally, the talking point we have heard repeated most often over the last 24 hours is that Candidate Trump ``outsourced'' his selection process to conservative groups. I must say, I find that argument the oddest of all. It is the kind of thing Justice Scalia would call ``pure applesauce.''  The President didn't outsource the selection process to conservative groups. He made his list public for the entire country to review during the campaign--the first President to do that. If anything, he outsourced the selection process to whom? The voters--the American people.  So what do you do? You are out of substantive arguments from the other side. Even shots fired at the judge's supporters somehow boomerang back and hit your own advocacy groups. We have seen all of this before. I have been through a few of these debates over the years. When a Republican occupies the Oval Office, the nominees may change, but the attacks remain the same.  You will hear today the same poll-tested catch phrases we have all heard time and again. You will hear words and phrases like ``outside the mainstream,'' ``far right,'' and ``extreme.'' Invariably, these are words the left tries to pin on every nominee of a Republican President and the people he submits to the With each nominee, the playbook on the left seems to be the very same. The nomination process, it seems, is a desperate attempt to retell the same old preordained narrative.  As I have said, those of us who have been through a few of these episodes have heard it all before, and we are going to hear it in the next few hours again, but this time something is very different. This time, they intend to use the same old preordained narrative to justify the first partisan filibuster in the 220-year history of the United Of course, this result was preordained because as the minority leader said weeks before the President was even sworn into office, ``it's hard for me to imagine a nominee that Donald Trump would choose that would get Republican support that we [Democrats] could support.''  You have already committed to the far left that you will launch the first partisan filibuster in U.history. So you are stuck. You have to press forward, don't you, even though you know the effort is doomed to fail. You know he will be confirmed, and you know in your heart of hearts he deserves to be confirmed. That is why this is an especially sad state of affairs, and I hope my colleagues will change their minds.  At the end of the day, we are left with an exceptional nominee, with impeccable credentials and broad bipartisan support. In short, we have in Judge Gorsuch a nominee who proves without a doubt that the minority leader would lead a filibuster against anyone nominated by this That is unfortunate because it is not the way it has to be, but it is a situation we cannot accept.  I yield the floor.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority whip is recognized.  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt3-PgS2383-5.txt
683,DURBIN,proceeding_id,topic-id,1220,"Mr.President, for 3 straight days, the Senate Republican leader has come to the floor and has given us a history of Presidential nominations to the Supreme Court, but clearly an investigation is necessary. There must have been a hacking into his computer because he can't print the name ``Merrick Garland'' to include in his speech. The Senator from Kentucky, the Republican leader, has failed to mention that name because that name is the reason we are in this spot today.  When Justice Antonin Scalia passed away, President Obama exercised his constitutional responsibility to send a nominee to the Senate to fill the vacancy on the Supreme For the first time in the history of the Senate--for the first time ever--this Republican-led Senate refused to give this nominee a hearing and a vote. It had never--underline the word ``never''--happened before.  Was the reason that he was unqualified? Of course not: he was unanimously ``well qualified,'' serving on the DC Circuit The reason was stated clearly by Senator McConnell: We are going to place a bet that the next President will be a Republican, and we will let them fill this vacancy.  When the Republicans come to the floor, as they have this morning talking about the politicization of this process, the reason we are here, when we should be celebrating the 1-year anniversary of Merrick Garland on the Supreme Court, is because they kept that position vacant so it could be filled by a Republican That is exactly why we are here today.  This notion that it is somehow fanciful that the choice of Neil Gorsuch was made by outside groups is belied by the very words of the President himself, who thanked the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation--two special interest, Republican organizations--for giving him a list of nominees for the Supreme It was very open and public, and there was gratitude--political gratitude--that they came up with the name Neil That is a fact.  When we look at the history that has led us to this moment, the Senator from Kentucky, the Republican leader, has to accept what is clear. In the history of the United States of America, until Senator McConnell's days under President Obama, exactly 68 nominees had been filibustered. Under Senator McConnell and the Republicans, 79 nominees of President Obama's were filibustered. It was an abuse of the filibuster never seen before in the history of our Nation, and it was that abuse of the filibuster and statements made that they would leave vacancies on critical courts, like the DC Court of Appeals, there forever and ever amen, that led to the decision 4 years ago to say that we would employ a change in the rules so we could finally fill these court positions--finally break the filibuster death grip--which Senator McConnell brought to this Chamber in a way never before seen in history.  So the Senator from Kentucky has made history. He comes to the floor every day and tells us history. He made history in the number of filibusters he[[Page S2387]]used on this floor. He made history in denying a Presidential nominee the opportunity for a hearing and a vote, which had never--never--happened before in the history of the United Talk about partisanship.  When it comes to Judge Gorsuch, I read his cases. I sat through the hearings. I was in the Senate Judiciary We took a measure of the man. He was careful to avoid any question that he could when it came to his position on cases and issues and values, and that is not unusual. Supreme Court nominees do that.  So we tried to look at his cases. What do the cases that he decided reveal about the man? Two or three cases came right to the front. The first involved the sad story of a frozen truckdriver on Interstate 88 outside of Chicago in January a few years back. It was 14 degrees below zero, and the brakes on his trailer froze. He pulled to the side of the road, called his dispatcher who said: Stay with the truck. We are sending somebody. Hours passed. He was going through hypothermia. He was freezing. He called the dispatcher and said: I have to do something. He said: You either drive this disabled truck out on the interstate and take your best chances or you stick with the truck. He decided to unhitch the trailer and drive to a gas station, gas up and warm up, and come back. For that he was fired.  Seven judges looked at that case to decide whether it was fair to fire Alphonse Six of the judges said: No, he did the right thing. One judge said: I rule for the trucking company that fired him--Neil Gorsuch, the nominee for the Supreme  In the Hobby Lobby case, the decision was basic, who should decide the healthcare of thousands of workers. Well, the Green family who owns Hobby Lobby said: Our religious beliefs should dominate. We should decide family planning and birth control for our employees and their health insurance. Judge Gorsuch said: That is right because they own a corporation, and a corporation is a person, and as a corporation, they can have sincere religious beliefs. It was a choice between a corporate ownership of a family and 13,000 employees and their own personal religious rights, and Judge Gorsuch ruled for the corporation.  Kansas State A Kansas State University professor, Grace Hwang, after working there for many years, was diagnosed with cancer and had to go through a bone marrow transplant. She took 6 months off. Then, when she was called back to work, she called the university and said: I understand there is an influenza outbreak on campus, and I am afraid, after having just had a bone marrow transplant, to be exposed to influenza at this point. They said: You either come back and teach or you are fired. She didn't come back. They fired her. It was Judge Gorsuch who said their employer was right; Kansas State University was right.  Those are insights into the values of a man who wants a lifetime appointment to the U.Supreme Court, the highest Court in the land. The questions we have raised about his judgment and his values go to the heart of who we are and what we want to be. Do we want the Supreme Court to continue to be a voice for the corporations, the corporate elite, and employers? Do we want to exclude the opportunities of common people like that truckdriver, Al Maddin, to have his day in court and be treated fairly? That is what it comes down to. It is a fundamental question of fairness and justice.  I am sorry, because I love the Senate and I have spent a good part of my life here, that we have reached this moment. But it is this effort to fill the courts of this Nation with Republican appointments, even at the expense of violating Senate traditions that are over 100 years old, that has brought us to this moment.  As someone said, the nuclear option was used by Senator McConnell when he stopped Merrick What we are facing today is the fallout.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

684,SCHUMER,proceeding_id,topic-id,2579,"Mr.President, this past week, the American people have been exposed to a contentious debate here on the Senate floor about the nomination of Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme  The American people have heard many arguments about the judge's merits and his shortcomings. They have also heard Senators litigate four decades of fierce partisan wrangling over the composition and direction of the Federal judiciary. That debate, that long debate, has informed the current one about Judge Newer Members may not remember all the details. Friends of mine, like Senator Hatch, probably remember too many of them. Still, the vote on Judge Gorsuch and the decision by the majority leader to move to change the rules has roped in all of that history.  Now, how did we get here? The truth is, over the long history of partisan combat over judicial nominations, there is blame on both sides. We believe that the blame should not be shared equally between Republicans and We believe the Republican Party has been the far more aggressive party in the escalation of tactics and in the selection of extreme judicial candidates, while Democrats have tended to select judges closer to the middle.  Keep this in mind: The last time a Republican-controlled Senate confirmed the Supreme Court nomination of a Democratic President was 1895. Nonetheless, each side comes here today in full confidence that their side is in the right. It was once said that ``antagonism is never worse than when it involves two men each of whom is convinced that he speaks for the goodness and rectitude.'' So it is today.  My Republican friends feel that they have cause to change the rules because the Democrats changed the rules on the lower court nominees in 2013. We believe we had to change the rules in 2013 because the Republicans ramped up the use of the filibuster to historic proportions, forcing more cloture votes under President Obama than during all other Presidents combined--more cloture votes under Obama than under George Washington all the way through to George  My Republican friends think they have cause to change the rules because we are about to deny cloture on the nomination of Judge We believe what Republicans did to Merrick Garland was worse than a filibuster, declaring mere hours after Justice Scalia's death that they would deny the constitutional prerogative of a President with 11 months left in his term. As my colleague from Illinois noted, we did not hear two words in the long speech of Senator McConnell: Merrick  We could relitigate these debates for the next hour, mentioning everything the Republican leader left out in his remarks. In fact, I am pretty sure we could argue endlessly about where, and with whom, this all started. Was it the Bork nomination or the obstruction of judges under President Clinton? Was it when Democrats blocked judges under President Bush or when Republicans blocked them under President Obama? Was it Judge Garland or Judge Gorsuch? Wherever we place the starting point of this long twilight battle over the judiciary, we are now at its end point.  These past few weeks, we Democrats have given Judge Gorsuch a fair process, something Merrick Garland was denied. My colleagues came into this debate with an open mind. I think many of them wanted to vote for Judge Gorsuch at the outset. So we met with the nominee. We consented to and participated in his hearing. But over the course of the hearing, during which Judge Gorsuch employed practiced evasions and judicial platitudes, the mood of our caucus shifted. Without so much as a hint about his judicial philosophy, without a substantive explanation of how he views crucial legal questions, all we had to go on was his record, and the more we learned about Judge Gorsuch's record, the more we didn't like.  Judge Gorsuch has shown in his rulings and in his writings to side almost instinctively with corporate interests over average He hasn't shown independence from the President, who so routinely challenges the legitimacy of the judiciary. While he has made a studious effort to portray himself as thoughtful and moderate, his record shows that, far from being the kind of mainstream candidate for the Supreme Court that could earn 60 votes, he may very well turn out to be[[Page S2388]]one of the most conservative Justices on the bench. An analysis of his record in the New York Times showed he would be the second most conservative Justice on the bench, and one in the Washington Post showed he would be the most conservative Justice, even to the right of Justice  For these principled reasons, Judge Gorsuch was unable to earn enough Democratic support for confirmation. Because of that, the majority is about to change the Standing Rules of the Senate to allow all Supreme Court nominees to pass on a majority vote.  It doesn't have to be this way. When a nominee doesn't get enough votes for confirmation, the answer is not to change the rules; it is to change the nominee. Presidents of both parties have done so in similar situations. On several occasions, Supreme Court nominees were withdrawn because they did not have enough support; one was even withdrawn after a failed cloture vote.  So this week we have endeavored to give the majority leader and my friends on the other side of the aisle a way out of this predicament. We offered them the option to sit down with us Democrats and the President and discuss a nominee who would earn enough bipartisan support to pass the Senate, not one vetted only by far-right special interest groups.  I came here to the floor each day and made an offer to meet anywhere, anytime to discuss a new nominee. I hoped, perhaps naively, that we could discuss a way forward that both our parties could live with. Unfortunately, there were no counteroffers or discussion offered by the other side. But our offer was meant sincerely.  Democrats and Republicans are caught in such a bunker mentality on this issue that we are just talking past each other. I know that many of my Republican friends are squeamish and uncomfortable with the path we are on, as we Democrats are as well. We have reached a point where the level of distrust is so high on this issue, we can't even sit down and talk.  My Republican friends dismiss out of hand the notion that Democrats will ever vote to confirm a Republican-nominated judge, despite the fact that there were Democratic votes for both Justices Roberts and Alito to get them over 60 and despite our plangent attempts to convince them otherwise. But make no mistake about it, for all the back and forth, when history weighs what happened, the responsibility for changing the rules will fall on the Republicans' and Leader McConnell's shoulders. They have had other choices; they have chosen this one. No one forced them to act; they acted with free will. We offered them alternatives; they refused. They hardly entertained any other possibilities. It seemed that the Republican leader was, from day one, intent on changing the rules if he didn't get his way.  Frankly, this is how so many of our Republican friends have approached the judiciary for a long time. For two decades, they have done whatever it has taken to move the bench to an ideological, far-right position. Independent experts have stated that we have a more conservative Supreme Court than we have had in a very long time. Nothing--not even the rules, not even the comity of the Senate--seems to stop them.  When the dust settles, make no mistake about it, it will have been the Republicans who changed the rules on the Supreme But we take no solace that history will put it on their shoulders because the consequences for the Senate and for the future of the Supreme Court will be far-reaching. The nuclear option means the end of a long history of consensus on Supreme Court nominations. It weakens the standing of the Senate as a whole as a check on the President's ability to shape the judiciary. In a postnuclear world, if the Senate and the Presidency are in the hands of the same party, there is no incentive to even speak to the Senate minority. That is a recipe for more conflict and bad blood between the parties, not less. The cooling saucer of the Senate will get considerably hotter.  The 60-vote threshold on controversial matters is a hallmark of the The majority leader has said so himself. It fosters compromise, it fosters bipartisanship, and it makes the Senate more deliberative. Sixty votes ought to be the epigraph of the Losing that standard on the Supreme Court, a hugely controversial matter, erodes the very nature of this body.  The 60-vote bar in the Senate is the guard rail of our democracy. When our body politics is veering too far to the right or to the left, the answer is not to dismantle the guardrails and go over the cliff but to turn the wheel back toward the middle. The answer is not to undo the guardrails--the rules--it is to steer back to the middle and get a more mainstream candidate.  With respect to the Supreme Court, the 60-vote threshold operates as a guardrail against judicial extremism. When 60 votes--typically a bipartisan supermajority--are required for confirmation, nominees tend to be in the judicial mainstream. The only nominee on the Court to be confirmed with less than 60 votes was Justice Thomas, who is widely recognized to be the most ideologically extreme Supreme Court It will mean the end of any pressure on any future President to nominate someone in the mainstream.  When it comes to the courts, the guardrails are being dismantled. There will be more 5-to-4 decisions, as our ranking member of the Judiciary Committee has pointed out. There will be less faith in the Supreme Court because it will be seen as a political body, an extension of our most divisive debates. As a result, America's faith in the integrity of the Court and the trust in the rule of law will suffer.  In conclusion, I am disheartened that we are here. In the sweep of history, the Senate has been the place where great, seemingly intractable disagreements in American politics finally give way to compromise, precisely because we have a set of rules that requires it. The story of the Senate is one of fierce debate but eventual cooperation. We tend to pull back when things get too heated because we all care about this institution and its role in our national life. In this case, the cumulative resentments from years of partisan trench warfare were too great. Instead of the Senate forcing us to change, Senators have decided to change the I worry a great deal about what that means for our future.  Twenty years ago, I think even the most partisan would say that the 60-vote threshold was basically inviolable. Today, it will be gone for all nominations, but at least not for legislation. My friend the majority leader has said he has no interest in removing the barrier for legislation.  I agree with him wholeheartedly, and I take him at his word.  I hope we can get together to do more in future months to ensure that the 60-vote threshold for legislation remains, but just as it seemed unthinkable only a few decades ago that we would change the rules for nominees, today's vote is a cautionary tale about how unbridled partisan escalation can ultimately overwhelm our basic inclination to work together and frustrate our efforts to pull back, blocking us from steering the ship of the Senate away from the rocks.  There is a reason it was dubbed the ``nuclear option.'' It is the most extreme measure, with the most extreme consequences. While I am sure we will continue to debate what got us here, I know that in 20 or 30 or 40 years, we will sadly point to today as a turning point in the history of the Senate and the Supreme Court; a day when we irrevocably moved further away from the principles our Founders intended with these institutions, principles of bipartisanship and moderation and consensus.  Let us go no further on this path.  I yield the floor.                             Cloture Motion  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

699,CORNYN,proceeding_id,topic-id,929,"Madam President, the Senate has just restored itself to an almost unbroken tradition of never filibustering judges.  We have actually restored the status quo before the administration of President George It was during that administration when some of our friends across the aisle, along with some of their liberal law professor allies, dreamed up a way of blocking President George Bush's judicial nominees, and that was by suggesting that 60 votes was really the threshold for confirming judges, rather than the constitutional requirement of a majority vote.  It has been a long journey back to the normal functioning of the United States Senate, and it is amazing that it[[Page S2391]]has taken a nominee like Judge Gorsuch to bring us back to where we were back around 2001.  We have been debating and discussing this nominee for a long time now, and the opponents of Judge Gorsuch have tried time and time again to raise objections to this outstanding nominee--a nomination that no one in the Senate opposed 10 years ago when he was confirmed to a position on the Tenth Circuit Court of They claimed he wasn't mainstream enough. They said this was a seat that really should have gone to Merrick They have even accused him of plagiarism. All of these arguments have no merit whatsoever and really represent desperate attempts to try to block this outstanding nominee. Their claims were simply baseless, and that much became even clearer as folks from across the political spectrum and newspapers from across the country urged our Democratic colleagues to drop their pointless filibuster and allow an up-or-down vote.  What also came to light is the type of man Judge Gorsuch is--a man of integrity, a man of strong independence; in other words, exactly the kind of person you would want to serve on the Supreme  They even claimed that Judge Gorsuch went out of his way to side with the big guy against the little guy, ignoring the fact that during his 10 years on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, where these judges sit on multi-judge panels, he was part of the majority decision 99 percent of the time, and 97 percent of those cases were unanimous in multi-judge panel decisions on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals--hardly radical. It actually is a remarkable record of a consensus-builder, someone who uses his great intellect, his education, and his training to build consensus on a multi-judge court--exactly the kinds of skills that are going to be so important for him to use on the Supreme Court of the United  As I said, ultimately today was the culmination of years of obstruction by our Democratic colleagues when it came to judicial nominees.  When I came to the Senate in 2003, the Democratic strategy was well underway to obstruct lower court judicial nominees from the George Bush administration.  Later, in 2013, when there was a Democrat in the White House and it suited them to do so, they decided to do away with the same tool they used and went nuclear, lowering the threshold from 60 to 51 majority vote for circuit court nominees and district court nominees.  It took a Gang of 14--7 Democrats and 7 Republicans--to try to work through the differences back around the 2006 timeframe, which resulted in half of President George Bush's nominees to the circuit court getting confirmed and half not being confirmed. The standard was adopted by the so-called Gang of 14 that only under extraordinary circumstances would the filibuster be used, but that agreement expired in 2013.  Well, the minority leader and his colleagues like to say that back then it was necessary to restore a majority vote. He did that just last He said: ``Our Republican colleagues had been holding back on just about all of so many lower-court judges, including the very important DC circuit'' court, that they were forced to engage in the nuclear option back in 2013. But the facts really belie what the Democratic leader claimed in terms of the necessity of going nuclear back then. In fact, prior to 2013, the Senate had confirmed more than 200 of President Obama's judicial nominees and it rejected just 2--more than 200 confirmed, 2 rejected. That hardly rises to a level of extreme obstruction or partisanship. That is a 99-percent confirmation rate for President  So let's make it clear just how this began. It started with Democratic obstruction under a Republican administration in 2001, and it is been continuing now under a new Republican administration in 2017. So we really have come full circle to restore the status quo before 2001, when our Democratic friends started down this path.  President Trump has, by all accounts, selected a judge with impeccable qualifications and the highest integrity. Not one of our Democratic colleagues has been able to offer a convincing argument against him, and that is why several of our Democratic colleagues have crossed the aisle to support his nomination, and I thank them for that. I think more would join if they didn't fear retribution from the radical elements in their own political party.  So today Republicans in the Chamber are following through on what we said we would do. We said we would let the American people decide who would select the next Supreme Court nominee and then we would vote to confirm that nominee. The American people, on November 8, selected President President Trump nominated Judge Neil And tomorrow we will confirm that nominee and deliver on that promise.  I yield the floor.

700,GARDNER,proceeding_id,topic-id,2353,"Mr.President, over the next several hours, we will have the final opportunity to debate the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice nominee Neil This has been a lengthy process this week, as we have heard from Senators on both sides of the aisle who have come to the floor and talked about their support or their opposition to Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme  I have had several opportunities over the past weeks and months to personally visit and speak with Judge Gorsuch, whom I have known from Colorado, the opportunity to listen to a number of my colleagues address the Chamber, to watch the Senate confirmation hearings in the Judiciary Committee--the day after day, it seemed, that that confirmation hearing proceeded--and of course we have gotten to know Judge Gorsuch over the past several years. We are proud that we have a Coloradan nominated to the Nation's highest Court and that he would be the second Coloradan to serve on the Supreme Court, the other one being Justice Byron Justice Byron White also led the NFL in rushing one year, and while Gorsuch will never live up to that part of the Supreme Court legacy for Coloradans, we know that Judge Gorsuch is an avid outdoorsman, a fly-fisher, expert-level skier, and somebody who understands public lands. I think having that kind of expertise and experience on our Nation's highest Court will serve this country well.  I think it is important to understand that his roots represent the roots that built the He is a fourth-generation Coloradan, somebody who hails from a State that is independent, that takes great pride in its libertarian streak, its love of the outdoors, recreational opportunities, understanding agriculture, energy. It is a State that really does have it all. From the Eastern Plains to the Western Slope, there is great beauty in our  Neil Gorsuch understands that. He served on a court, the Tenth Circuit Court, that is housed in Denver and represents 20 percent of the landmass of our Judge Gorsuch's family, as I mentioned, really does show the grit and determination of those who built the His grandfather was someone who worked in Union Station, someone who grew up driving trolleys back in the time when Denver was a trolley town. His other grandfather, of course, was a physician, and both were experts in their fields. One grandfather helped found a law firm, Gorsuch Kirgis, a very prestigious firm in  But it is Judge Gorsuch's experience, his high qualifications of academics that he brings to the Court, having received his degrees from Columbia, Oxford, Harvard, as I mentioned previously--the most important academic experience being the University of Colorado, where I think he spent at least some time in the summer attending, and also teaching a course as a professor at my alma mater, the University of Colorado School of This has all helped him build what he is today; that is, a very mainstream jurist, an incredibly exceptional legal mind, one of the brightest jurists this country has to offer, someone who is known as a feeder judge, providing clerks to the Supreme Court, and who has the respect of the Colorado legal community.  I want to talk about some of these things because I have come to the floor multiple times, and I have talked about his qualifications. I have talked about the people who know him best,[[Page S2392]]not the people in Washington, DC, but the people who have practiced in front of his court in Denver, the people who know him personally out in  Here is what those individuals have said. They believe that Judge Gorsuch deserves an up-or-down vote. Bill Ritter, former Democratic Governor for the State of Colorado, believes that Judge Gorsuch deserves an up-or-down vote. Now we will have it. We have invoked cloture. We will have a final debate on Friday night and a final vote on whether or not he should be confirmed.  People like Steve Farber, the cochair of the Democratic National Convention in 2008 in Colorado, have talked about the need to confirm Judge  So the debate that we enter now is not one of whether he will have an up-or-down vote. He is going to have an up-or-down vote. But it is whether we should confirm him, actually give him the ``yes'' vote.  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in favor of Judge Gorsuch's confirmation. Some of the arguments that I have heard over the past several weeks on the floor, listening to some of the arguments on the floor--it is quite interesting to me that some of the arguments we hear seem to be at odds with each other.  Presiding over the Senate yesterday, I heard people talk about how they don't think Neil Gorsuch will stand up to the They are concerned that he will not express the kind of independence the judiciary commands, that he will not be someone to stand up to the President of the United They often cite some of the comments or tweets that the President has made and then fail to mention the fact, though, that at the very time one of those tweets was mentioned, questioning the judiciary, Judge Gorsuch, in a meeting with one of our Democratic colleagues, actually had objections. He said he objected to the statements the President had made, expressing his independence, talking about how what he had heard was demoralizing--very much showing independence.  But the second argument you often hear, for those who have decided to oppose this mainstream jurist, is that they are afraid he won't show enough independence from the President, and then they say they are concerned about his language as it relates to the Chevron doctrine--whether Judge Gorsuch is going to be willing to overturn the Chevron doctrine.  I find those two arguments kind of interesting because, on one hand, you have an argument saying we are afraid he is not going to stand up to the President of the United States, and then, on the other hand, you have an argument saying that we are afraid he is not going to stand up to the administrative state of the President of the United States--because that is what the Chevron doctrine does; it gives great deference to the regulatory body, to the administrative state.  Here is another irony. The Administrator of the EPA in 1984 was Neil Gorsuch's mother, Anne Burford--the Administrator of the She was the first woman to serve as EPA Administrator who was the subject of the Chevron doctrine.  Not only is he willing to stand up to the President and the administrative state of the President, but he is willing to overturn a case that was a subject that his own mother was a subject to.  I have also heard comments from colleagues on the aisle that Judge Gorsuch is not a mainstream jurist. This argument, I think, can be dealt with in a couple of ways because there are some pretty good statistics to refute these arguments.  Ninety-seven. Ninety-seven percent is the number of times in the 2,700 opinions that he was a part of--97 percent represents the times that the decisions were unanimous. Judge Gorsuch did not serve only with conservative-appointed judges. He didn't serve with only Republican nominees. Judge Gorsuch served with Republican and Democrat nominees, appointments approved by the In 97 percent of the cases, Judge Gorsuch ruled--decided--in unanimous decisions.  The other statistic that I think is even more revealing, of course, as to whether Judge Gorsuch is a mainstream judge is 99 percent. Ninety-nine percent is the amount of times that Judge Gorsuch ruled with the majority of the court; he made decisions--opinions--with the majority of the court.  I heard a comment yesterday from a colleague who said that Judge Gorsuch was never intended to be a mainstream nominee. If Judge Gorsuch was never intended to be a mainstream nominee, do you think we would see a judge before us that has support from the 2008 Democratic National Convention Chairman? If Judge Gorsuch was never intended to be mainstream nominee, do you think we would have decisions by the Democratic Governor of Colorado, former Democratic Governor of Colorado, to demand or ask for an up-or-down vote? If Judge Gorsuch was never intended to be a mainstream nominee, do you think that the President would have nominated somebody who agreed 99 percent of the time with his colleagues on the bench, colleagues who came from appointments given by Republican Presidents and Democrat Presidents?  The arguments over whether Judge Gorsuch is going to be with the little guy or he spends too much time defending the big guy--well, let me again go back to the people who know Judge Gorsuch the best, who have practiced in front of his court. Here is a statement from a Denver attorney and Democrat on representing underdogs before Judge This is from the Denver Post: ``He issued a decision that most certainly focused on the little guy.''  Yet the story from the opposition here, out of 2,700 cases, is: Oh, my gosh, this is a person who has never defended the little guy. Well, here is somebody who has practiced in front of his court who absolutely believes he focused on the little guy.  So we have a judge who agrees with the majority of the court most of the time--99 percent of the time; 97 percent of the time it is a unanimous decision, and lawyers practicing in front of him believe that he represents the little guy. We have heard from leading Democrat voices in Colorado who support him. The ABA gave him its highest qualification, rankings, ratings. They believe it.  Then the question becomes, What are we looking for in a Justice? Maybe that is the biggest argument here. Maybe the argument should be about what are we looking for in terms of philosophy, ideology?  Well, we have seen his ideology and his philosophy in what he has testified before the Judiciary Committee, what he has stated in the past through writings. He is someone who is going to follow the law. He is someone who is going to take a decision where the law leads him, not somebody who is going to take an opinion or decision where his personal beliefs or politics take him. That is the kind of judge we want on the highest That is the kind of Justice we want--someone who is not going to decide a policy preference from the bench of the Supreme Court, not somebody who is going to take a look at a public opinion poll or someone who is going to take a look at a focus group and make a decision but someone who will rule by the law.  I have heard colleagues come to the floor and talk about their experiences where they were given decisions to read without being given the law. They were given just the facts of the case. They said: How would you have decided this case? Then they showed him the actual ruling, the actual holding in the case.  Some people believe, well, that is not the way we would have decided because we don't feel that was a good outcome; we don't feel that was the right policy.  It is not the job of a Justice to put their thumb on the scale of policy; it is the job of a Justice to be a guardian of the Constitution, to defend the Constitution, to follow the law and to decide cases based on the law not on feelings, politics, polls, public opinion.  We have a judge, nominated for Justice, who has said that a judge who agrees with every opinion that they have issued is probably a bad judge. He is paraphrasing other judges and Justices throughout our history. It is because he knows it is not his job to issue opinions or decisions or to decide a case based on being a Republican or It is not his job to decide a case based on whether he was nominated by President Trump or President Obama or President It is his job to look at the law, to leave policy decisions to the legislative branch. That is what we have to do. That is what Judge Gorsuch has said he will do.[[Page S2393]]  So these arguments just don't hold water. It doesn't hold water that he is not looking out for the interests of our citizens, because here clearly he is. Democrats who have practiced before him in court have said as much. The argument that he will not stand up to Trump administration--we know it; he said in front of our Democratic colleagues that he would stand up to the  He has said that he rejected attacks on the We also know that when it comes to the Chevron doctrine, which seems to be sacred ground now, that there are these ironic arguments taking place, because you want someone who will stand up to the administration, but then you are concerned that he is interested in or concerned that we have taken the Chevron deference--the doctrine of Chevron deference too far.  Now which is it? Do you want a judge who is going to stand up to the administration or do you want a judge who is not going to stand up to the administration? It sounds as though the arguments are trying to have it both ways.  The bottom line is that we know Judge Gorsuch to be a person who is eminently qualified, a mainstream jurist who has the respect and admiration of judges around the country, who has the admiration and respect of fellow jurists and legal professionals throughout Colorado, and we know that he will make this country proud. He is certainly going to make Colorado proud as he receives his confirmation to the Nation's highest  I hope, as we spend these hours debating, that we can realize this Senate should operate in a bipartisan fashion, that we should confirm judges who are clearly mainstream.

701,COONS,proceeding_id,topic-id,1731,"Mr.President, today is a day when many Senators are speaking about Judge Gorsuch and about the Supreme As I think many know, in the last week, in the Judiciary Committee hearings and in other settings, I have announced that I will vote against Judge Gorsuch on the final vote tomorrow. I believe I have made my reasons for my opposition clear. I have thoroughly reviewed and considered Judge Gorsuch's record and where he fits within American jurisprudence, and I have no second thoughts about my decision.  As I look around at what has just happened on this Senate floor, I am sick with regret. So I rise now to speak in defense of the  The Senate has been hailed by many, including our nominee to the Supreme Court, Judge Gorsuch, as the world's greatest deliberative body. Yet today I think one more blow has been struck at that title and reality.  The late Senator Robert Byrd, who served in this Chamber for 51 years, would famously remind new Senators that ``in war and in peace, [the Senate] has been the sure refuge and protector of the rights of the states and of a political minority.''  Of course, although Senator Byrd was the longest serving Senator, as a Delawarean, I grew up in the tradition of Senator Joe Biden, a 36-year veteran of this body who left its ranks only to ascend to the Vice Presidency and spend 8 more years as its Presiding  Since I have had the honor of assuming Senator Biden's former seat, I have committed to following his example of working across the aisle, through Republican and Democratic administrations, with whoever is willing to roll up their sleeves and get to work for the American people. I know my colleagues share in this foundational commitment to serve our constituents and country.  As I look around at what just happened on this floor, with too little discussion of its lasting consequences and too little visible concern or even emotion, I must ask the question: Where are we headed?  You can't see it, but around this Chamber are white marble statues, busts of former Presiding Officers, of former Vice Presidents of the United They are in the halls outside this They are at the upper level of this Chamber, in the All the former Vice Presidents are memorialized in white marble busts.  Former Vice President Adlai Stevenson, the grandfather of the Illinois Governor who ran for President in the middle of the 20th century--former Vice President Adlai Stevenson, when he delivered his farewell address to the Senate on his last day in office as the Presiding Officer of the Senate in 1897, said:       It must not be forgotten that the rules governing this body      are founded deep in human experience; that they are the      result of centuries of tireless effort . . . to conserve, to      render stable and secure, the rights and liberties which have      been achieved by conflict.       By its rules, the Senate wisely fixes the limits to its own      power. Of those who clamor against the Senate and its mode of      procedure, it may be truly said, ``They know not what they      do.''       In this Chamber alone are preserved, without restraint, two      essentials of wise legislation and of good government--the      right of amendment and of debate.  It was exactly that right, those rules that were assaulted today, but they have been under assault for a long time.  In recent days, I have reached out to my Republican and Democratic colleagues, trying to see if there was some way we could reach a reliable consensus agreement to safeguard these institutional values and avoid the events of today and tomorrow.  I told my colleagues that I was not ready to end debate on Judge Gorsuch's nomination until we could chart a course for the Senate to move forward on a bipartisan basis when considering future Supreme Court nominations.  I think for us to get to any constructive conversation about moving this Senate forward requires owning the role that all of us--each of us has played over our time here, whether a few years or decades, in bringing us to this point.  I, for one, will say I have come over time to regret joining my Democratic colleagues in changing the rules for lower court nominations and confirmations in 2013. Of course, I could give an entire speech on the obstruction that led us to that point. I could document the Republican and Democratic deeds and misdeeds of the last Congress and the Congress before that and the decade before that.  As my more seasoned and senior colleagues demonstrated in the Judiciary Committee deliberations, those who have served here longest know best the record of grievance of Congresses in decades past.  I anticipate that many of my colleagues will come to regret the decisions and actions taken today in this Congress and in Congresses ahead. Instead of focusing on that shared regret, I want to work together not to continue to tear down the traditions and rules of the Senate but to find ways to strengthen and fortify and sustain them.  I worked to try to find a solution to get past this moment on the brink. I wanted to ensure our next Supreme Court nominee would be the product of bipartisan consultation and consensus, as was safeguarded for years by the potential of the 60-vote margin. I wanted certainty that the voice of the minority would still be heard when the next vacancies arise. Among many, this effort to forge consensus was met with hopelessness or even hostility.  Back home, thousands of constituents called my office, urging a vote against Gorsuch and urging I support the filibuster. Some even urged me to stop talking about any sort of deal. In fact, back home in Delaware, some national groups ran ads against me when there was even a rumor of a hint that there might be conversations about avoiding this outcome.  There were even Senators on both sides of the aisle who told me that an agreement was impossible. They said any agreement is based on trust, and we simply do not trust each other anymore.  Given the events of the last years, the disrespect and mistreatment of Merrick Garland, the course of the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch, I can understand how there is a raw wound right now in this Chamber, where each side feels the other has mistreated a good and honorable and capable nominee for the Supreme  Let me say my last point again. Senators on both sides told me we could not find a durable compromise because we do not trust each other anymore. If we cannot trust each other anymore, then are there any big problems facing this country which we can address and solve?  This morning, I gave an address at the Brookings Institution about the[[Page S2394]]threat Russia poses to our democracy, to our allies, to our national security, and to the endurance of our If that threat is not something that deserves determined, bipartisan effort, I don't know what is.  There are many threats to our future I could lay out today, but let me simply emphasize that in the absence of trust, this body cannot play its intended constitutional role, and without trust, we will not rebuild what is necessary to sustain this body.  Everyone likes to point the finger at the other side as the source of this distrust. The reality is, there is abundant blame to go around.  Folks like to remember the good old days when Justice Scalia was confirmed by this body 98 to 0, when Justice Ginsburg was confirmed 96 to 3, but if we look at our five most recent nominees to the Supreme Court who got votes, you can see a clear trend: Nine Senators, all Republican, voted against Justice Then 22 Senators voted against Justice Then 42 Senators, mostly Democrats, voted against Justice For President Obama's nominees, Justices Sotomayor and Kagan, more than 30 Republican Senators opposed each one. Only nine Republican Senators voted for Sotomayor, and only five Republicans voted for Justice We have been on this trajectory--both parties--for some time.  Then, of course, we have Chief Judge Merrick Garland, the first Supreme Court nominee in American history to be denied a hearing and a vote, and we have Judge Gorsuch, the first to be the object of a partisan filibuster on this floor.  We did not get here overnight. We have become increasingly polarized. How can we work together to repair this lack of trust so we can face the very real challenges that face our Nation?  My own attempts of recent days--although I was blessed to be joined by Senators of good will and good faith and great skill in both parties--were ultimately not successful. I wish I had engaged sooner and more forcefully. I wish I had been clearer with my colleagues how determined I was to seek a result, but this doesn't mean I am disappointed that I tried, and it also doesn't mean I am going to stop. I am not going to stop trying to fix the damage that has been done, trying to find a better pathway forward.  I ask my colleagues: If you know what you have done today, then what will we do tomorrow? How could we avoid the further deepening, corrosive partisanship in this body? What past mistakes can each of us own up to? What steps can we take to mend these old wounds? What more can we do to move forward together?  We sometimes talk about the dysfunction of this body as if it is external to us, as if we bear no accountability for it, but at the end of the day, here we are: 100 men and women sent to represent 50 States of this Republic and 325 million people. In many ways, we have all let them down today.  I can tell you what I am going to do tomorrow. I commit to working with anyone who wants to join me to try to strengthen and save the rules and traditions of this body and its effectiveness as an absolutely essential part of the constitutional order for which so many have fought and died. It is what all of our predecessors would have wanted.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from                      Thanking Senators and Staff  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt3-PgS2383-5.txt
702,ISAKSON,proceeding_id,topic-id,826,"Mr.President, I will be brief. I also want to make sure I don't take advantage of the personal privilege I have as a United States Senator, but I am going to anyway.  I want Senator Coons from Delaware to pause for just a second.  I want to thank every Member of the Senate, Republican and Democrat, and the staff of the Senate for the many kindnesses they have extended to me in the last 4 months during my injury and my recovery. I am on the way back home, in large measure, because of the support of the Members of the United States I am very grateful for that and the staff who have allowed that to take place. I say thank you very much.  Notwithstanding what your politics are or what your partisanship is or anything else, this is a great institution and a great body because it is made up of great people.  To that end, my friend Senator Coons from Delaware made an excellent speech, which I am going to adopt as my speech, since I don't have the strength to stand as long as I would like to, to talk about an issue so important. We do need to open all our minds and our hearts in the days ahead to make sure we know what direction we are going as Members of the Senate, regardless of our party and notwithstanding our partisanship.  Neil Gorsuch, from everything I have seen--and I probably have seen more than anybody because I have been watching it on TV while I have been recovering. You guys have had to do it in debate. I have seen the real thing.  His record, his testimony, the way he presented himself, the way Senator Grassley and Senator Feinstein allowed that hearing to go forth, I know we have a good man as a nominee to be a Supreme Court Justice of the United States, but the issues and the divide on the cloture, on a simple majority, and the rule change of 2013, and what has happened in the past, now has us in a position where we slowly but surely are moving to be a body that is another House of Representatives, not the United States  The majority rule is a great philosophy. The majority winning is always a great philosophy, but I used to have a teacher who taught me. She said: If four equals the majority, three equals zero, but you always need to listen to the other three because sometimes they may be right. I think that is a good lesson for us today, and that was a grammar school teacher.  If there are seven voting members, four does equal the majority, but three doesn't equal zero because the rest still count.  As we move forward in the days ahead and judge other issues, whether they be partisan issues in terms of regular debate and general legislation, whether it be issues over the confirmation of judges or Secretaries or whatever it may be, let's be thoughtful, so that, not as a criticism of the House, but as a compliment to our Founding Fathers, we don't become a second House and later a unicameral body, majority rule and mob rule, and eventually waive rules, where passions overrule common sense and all of a sudden you find yourself digging your way out of a hole that you have created, rather than building the dreams you have always wanted to do.  I commend the leadership of both parties for exercising their political and partisan desires. I commend each Member for being here to take part in this debate today and being a part of it. That is what America is all about.  Somewhere down the line, there is going to be something that is going to happen that is going to cause a resurrection of the debate that we have had today and another road to cross on which way we go in the future. The more we move away from a Senate that is a deliberative body, that is a dignified body, to a body that makes sure it knows where it is going before it moves forward, we won't be better off. If we move toward a body that is a rubberstamp of the House or a unicameral government of legislation, we will never be the United States of America our Founding Fathers intended us to be. That is what I believe, and that is what I think the end of this will be.  To all our Members, I compliment them on everything they have had to say and have done.  Judge Gorsuch, I am so proud to have someone like that who will hopefully serve on the bench of the U.Supreme Court with distinction.  To all of us, our job is not finished.

704,WYDEN,proceeding_id,topic-id,3357,"Mr.President, I don't wish to turn this into a bouquet-tossing process, but I think it is very clear that Senators on both sides of the aisle are very, very pleased to see our friend[[Page S2395]]from Georgia back today. We are wishing him health and We look forward to his full and complete recovery. We are so glad to have him here.  I am also pleased that Senator Coons is on the floor, because I think it would be fair to say that Members on both sides of the aisle who have watched how Senator Coons has conducted himself throughout this extraordinarily contentious debate would say that Senator Coons makes all of us very, very proud.  It is no secret that he has tried repeatedly to bring both sides together, and he and I have talked often about this. I think there are going to be opportunities for finding common ground on important legislation, breaking out of this gridlock that we all understand is not what the Senate is all about and forging toward more mainstream topics. When we get there, to a great extent, it will be because of the thoughtful comments of my friend from  Mr.President, the Senate is going to act on one of its most sacred and important constitutional duties, the advice and consent on the nomination of the next Associate Justice of the Supreme  The long tails of these Supreme Court debates stretch through generations and shape our government deep into the future. The choice the Senate makes in this extraordinary debate will have a profound impact, from the broadest governing statutes down to the most specific particulars of the law that affect our daily lives.  There are several issues that are particularly relevant to this nominee that have gotten short shrift. I am talking about secret law, and warrantless wiretapping, death with dignity. I intend to discuss these issues shortly.  I would like to begin, however, by stating that whether one supports or opposes Judge Gorsuch, our job would have been easier had the judge been more forthcoming in his testimony before the Judiciary He chose, however, not to do so. So what the Senate has to go by instead is the judge's lengthy record of adhering to a rigid and far-right philosophy that is packaged in the branding of so-called originalism.  The originalist says that our rights as a people are contained within and linked to our founding documents. But that viewpoint is plainly incorrect. In practice, originalism becomes a cover for protecting the fortunate over the poor, corporations over individuals, and the powerful over virtually every other It is a political agenda that masquerades as philosophy, an agenda whose sole intent is reserving power for those in power and limiting the recognition of the rights reserved to the people.  Far from endorsing such a creed, our Constitution is actually a document of constraints, constraints that bind the government, not the people. The full scope of our fundamental rights as a people, as Justice Harlan once wrote, ``cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution.'' The exact concept is written into the Bill of Rights itself. The Ninth Amendment says: ``The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.''  James Madison, the founder so significant that Americans are said to live in a ``Madisonian Democracy,'' was outspoken about the dangers of future readers or interpreters thinking that the fundamental rights contemplated by the Framers were limited to the Constitution or Bill of  So our founding document and its Framers made clear that rights were not enumerated by the Constitution; they were retained by the people. Individual liberties, from personal privacy to a woman's right to vote, the choice of contraception and abortion, interracial marriage, same-sex marriage, equal protection of the law--these liberties and, let me emphasize, many, many, many more have always existed. In fact, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights were silent on much of what Americans consider fundamental to a free people. That silence left the door open for the courts, as we shed the prejudices of a darker age, to recognize the true meaning of the words ``all men are created equal'' and ``inalienable rights.''  The process has been painfully slow. The Constitution, like any document composed by politicians, is fraught with original sin. For example, the three-fifths compromise was a shameful device of political accommodation. Through long stretches of our history, political agendas have left many individual rights unrecognized or unprotected by the courts. They ruled in favor of the powerful and against the disadvantaged and the disenfranchised, often with the justification that their rulings adhered to the text of the  Nowhere did the Constitution expressly deny women the right to vote, but the Supreme Court ruled against Virginia Minor in 1875. The Federal Government was not expressly granted a right to intern residents of Japanese descent, but the Supreme Court allowed it in There was no constitutional basis on which to deny people of different ethnicities the right to marry. On those issues and more, our judges were wrong. Supreme Court Justices were wrong. In the service of the economic, political, and religious powers that be, the Court has defended slaveholders, denied the franchise, permitted racial, sexual, and other discrimination, and routinely--routinely--elevated the power of the State over individual liberties. Any defense of those rulings as adhering to the text of the Constitution is just plain wrong.  Let's look more closely at women's voting rights. In Minor v. Happersett, the Supreme Court found that women did not have the right to vote because that right was not expressly stated anywhere in the In a unanimous decision, the Court took the absurd position that a document predicated on voting, organized by voting, and dependent on voting for any amendment, still did not protect the right to vote for all citizens. Such is the intellectual bankruptcy of a long legal tradition sustained by its defense of the status quo.  The 19th Amendment was a response to the abridgement of a fundamental right by political parties and their dependent courts, but it did not create a new right. It was a long overdue fix made necessary by an originalist court.  If there is a national evolution that extends protection of rights and liberties to disenfranchised and oppressed people, it is because with time, our wonderful country tends to correct its wrongs. It did so with a Civil War and the amendments that followed. It did so with women's suffrage and the Brown decision. It did so more recently with the Obergefell v. Hodges decision. Historically, our country has gradually recognized fundamental rights and liberties.  ``Recognition''--I use that word intentionally. It is recognition because there are no new rights, per se. They are inalienable, and those rights are not limited to those spelled out in the A jurist governed by that principle would respect individual rights, but that simply isn't the viewpoint taken by many so-called originalists on the far right today.  The rightwing originalism looks, in my view, a lot more like the judicial philosophy that trampled on the rights of Americans in days past--a philosophy that throughout our history has left many Americans marginalized, disenfranchised, and oppressed by the  Unfortunately, after listening very carefully to Judge Gorsuch present his views and after reviewing his writings, including some I will mention that specifically talk about my home State, I have no faith that Judge Gorsuch would be any different from this philosophy that I mentioned that has left so many Americans marginalized in our country.  Judge Gorsuch not only has a long record of conservative activism in the courtroom, but he has demonstrated an out-and-out hostility toward the right of individuals to make decisions about their own lives and their own families without interference from the In one troubling instance, he went so far as to author a book attacking death with dignity. This of course has been a matter that historically has been left to the States, and the people of my State twice approved death-with-dignity ballot measures and our death-with-dignity laws have been in place for nearly 20 years. The Supreme Court upheld it more than a decade ago in a case known as Gonzalez v. But[[Page S2396]]Judge Gorsuch's record and his own words put the will of millions of Oregonians in question.  Nothing in the Constitution gives the Federal Government the power to deny suffering Oregonians the right to make basic choices about the end of their lives. There is nothing in the Constitution that gives the Federal Government a power to deny people in my State the right to make those emotional, difficult, wrenching decisions about end of life. It is a private matter between individuals and doctors, and when politicians attempt to force regulations through the back door by going after doctors and their ability to prescribe, in my view that is an obvious over-the-line Federal infringement. But my guess is there are probably going to be some folks on the far right that are going to try that route again.  Nothing Judge Gorsuch said in his confirmation hearing gave me any indication that he respects the death-with-dignity issue as settled law or that he would rule against Federal abuse of power to intrude on a private choice. The bottom line is that Judge Gorsuch is locked into an extreme rightwing viewpoint on this issue.  And there is more. As I have listened to this debate and, particularly, the number of comments that some of those who have espoused the views that concern me so much come back to, part of this is that they are always talking about States' rights. States' rights--that will be the altar that we really build our views and philosophies around. I will state, however, that when we listen to some of what they are having to say about States' rights, what they are really saying is that they are for the State if they think the State is right. That is not, in my view, what fundamental rights--particularly, ones that have been afforded to States--ought to be all about.  As I indicated, I think his views with respect to death with dignity really do involve a Federal abuse of power in its intruding on private choices, but there are other issues that concern me as well.  He has made it clear, in many instances, that he favors corporations at the expense of the working people. He has sided with insurance companies to deny disability benefits to people with disabilities, with large companies to deny employees basic job protections, and has even written that class action lawsuits are just tools for plaintiffs to get ``free rides to fast riches.''  No example better illustrates this tendency--and my colleagues have talked about it--than the case of the truckdriver in TransAm Trucking v. Department of In this case that leaves one practically speechless, Judge Gorsuch sided against a truckdriver who was fired for leaving his freezing cold truck when his life was in danger.  I have another significant concern about Judge Gorsuch that came up in the context of his confirmation hearings. It is something that, I think, a lot of Americans and even those in government are trying to get their arms around. I have been on the Intelligence Committee since the days before 9/11, and one of the things we have come to feel strongly about is the danger of what I call ``secret law.'' I want to make sure people know exactly what I am talking about when I describe ``secret law.''  In the intelligence world and in the national security sphere, operations and methods--the tactics used by our courageous men and women who are protecting us and who go into harm's way to protect our people--always have to be secret. They are classified. They have to be because, if they were to get out, we could have Americans die--the people who do all of that wonderful work and, possibly, millions more. Sources and methods have to be secret, but the law and our public policies ought to always be transparent.  The American people need to know about them because that is how we make informed decisions in our wonderful system of government. Voters are given enough information to make the choices. Sources and methods and operations have to be secret, but the law and political philosophies have to be public.  Judge Gorsuch, as a senior attorney in the Department of Justice, was a practitioner of secret law. As I indicated, the public is not going to know about secret operations; we protect them. But trust in government and in our legal system cannot survive when Americans understand that the law says one thing and then the government or a secret court says that it means another. Secret law prevents the people from knowing whether their fundamental rights are being infringed by an unaccountable, unconstrained government that is aided by compliant courts.  Secret law also keeps the Congress in the dark. Congress's job is to represent the people and oversee the government. Congress, barring rebellion, is the only recourse of a free people against an executive-judicial alliance of secrecy that infringes their liberties. It is my view that secret law makes a mockery of the oath that Members of Congress, Justices, and each Senator here has taken to serve, protect, and defend our Secret law is fundamentally corrosive to the rule of law in  As we learned during his confirmation hearings, Judge Gorsuch was a supporter of secret law. In 2005, the CIA was conducting a secret torture program. In May of that year, the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel determined, secretly, that torture techniques, such as waterboarding, were legal. Somehow, it deemed them consistent with statutory prohibitions on torture and the This was extraordinary, willful, faulty legal analysis. It was entirely inconsistent with how the Congress and the public would read the law or the  Then our distinguished colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, who knows a little bit about these issues in his having been subjected to them in the defense of our country, passed the Detainee Treatment Senator McCain understood, in having fought for our country--given fully of himself--that our government had to find a way out of this problem. The McCain law prohibits the cruel and inhumane or degrading treatment that has been at issue here.  By any measure, both the law--the language of the law, the clear intent of the Congress--and the context in which it was passed would leave every American to understand that a decision had been made by their elected officials to limit the power of government. Yet Judge Gorsuch, then an employee of the Bush administration's, had a solution.  In December of 2005, he wrote to the author of the Justice Department's opinion, Mr.Bradbury, about a Presidential signing statement that would magically transform the McCain law into an endorsement of torture. What Judge Gorsuch wrote was that the McCain amendment that prohibited cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment was best read as, essentially, codifying existing interrogation policies. In other words, according to Judge Gorsuch, John McCain's law--the one that passed 90 to 9 in the U.Senate--endorsed torture when it did just the opposite.  The issue came up in his nomination hearing. Judge Gorsuch's explanation was that he was making the recommendation as a lawyer who was helping his client, which was the administration. I have to say, if there is one thing we have learned, this ``just following orders'' defense has gone on for far too long in this city. It is a small and feeble excuse and is unbecoming of a judge who has been nominated to the highest Court in the land. A judge who justifies government violations in the law and the Constitution just so his boss can say ``I was following the advice of counsel'' is making a choice to do wrong.  The McCain amendment--what we passed here in the Congress--did not green-light torture. It did not codify torture, period. Anybody who has ever heard John McCain talk about this issue and describe his personal, horrifying experiences with torture knows that it, certainly, could not have been his intent when writing the bill.  Any lawyer, especially one secretly advising the government, first has an obligation to the law and the Judge Gorsuch's failure to recognize that principle and his choice to do wrong, in my view, disqualifies him from having a seat on the U.Supreme  Torture is not the only illegal program on which Judge Gorsuch has left his fingerprints. After news broke of the illegal, warrantless wiretapping program, Judge Gorsuch helped prepare[[Page S2397]]testimony for the Attorney General, which asserted that these authorities are vested in the President and are inherent in the office.  It added: ``They cannot be diminished or legislated away by other co-equal branches of the government.''  If that were the case, then no action taken in this area by the elected representatives of the people would have any weight. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which has existed since the 1970s, would just be some kind of advisory statement. Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which we are going to debate this year, would be little more than wasted paper. Then the USA FREEDOM Act, which ended the bulk collection of law-abiding Americans' phone records, might as well have never been signed into law.  Voting for those bills and voting to confirm Judge Gorsuch call into question any Member's commitment to those laws that we passed.  In response to a question during his nomination hearing, Judge Gorsuch said that he did not believe the Attorney General's testimony and that, again, he was only acting as a scribe, as a speechwriter. As such, he absolved himself of responsibility for his actions. Again, I think that it is just wrong to use this as an excuse. Like the endorsement of torture, assertions of Presidential authority to override congressional limits on warrantless surveillance rip at the fabric of the rule of law. Judge Gorsuch, a man who chose to get up and go to work every day for individuals who were violating the law, had the power to say no, but he would not make that choice.  Colleagues, the Senate is voting to confirm an individual to a lifetime position on the Supreme What Judge Gorsuch has stood for and against over the course of his legal career is all we have to go on in this debate, and we will have to reflect on it. A history of support, in my view, for secret, illegal, and unconstitutional programs is an unacceptable record for someone who is seeking a place on the Supreme  I have reminded this Senate of how, time and again, the Supreme Court has rubber-stamped the excesses of our executive and legislature over the years rather than defended individual liberty. That is the record--the Supreme Court rubbing-stamping the excesses of the executive and legislature rather than protecting the individual liberties of the American people.  It is my view that it is our job as Senators to ensure that the Supreme Court does not repeat the errors of yesterday--enshrining disenfranchisement and discrimination and denying equal protection of the law based on prejudice and political agendas. I believe that the only way to prevent this abuse is to appoint judges who recognize that the judiciary is a bulwark against any attempt to infringe on our unalienable rights.  The bottom line for me, colleagues, is whether Judge Gorsuch recognizes that rights are reserved for the people.  There is no respect for individual rights and liberty to be found in a viewpoint that allows for secret law to justify torture, that favors the powerful over the powerless, or that tramples on the rights of Americans to determine the courses of their own lives. Unfortunately, we have learned over the last few weeks that this is Judge Gorsuch's record.  I oppose his nomination. I urge my colleagues to do the same.  I yield the floor.

We will be confirming a Justice to the Supreme Court who is supremely qualified, who is a mainstream judge, who respects the rule of law and the Constitution, and who will rule impartially from the bench--someone who will call balls and strikes. That is what I believe the American people look for when they look for a Supreme Court  While it was always clear that some Democrats would oppose any Supreme Court candidate the President nominated, I had hoped that partisanship would be at least somewhat limited. I had hoped the Democrats would want to preserve the Senate's nearly 230-year tradition in confirming Supreme Court Justices by a simple-majority vote. And I had hoped that more than a handful of Democrats would join us to confirm one of the most, as I said, supremely qualified judges in my memory. That is not what happened. Despite Judge Gorsuch's qualifications, despite the support for his nomination from both liberals and conservatives, the vast majority of Senate Democrats were determined to block this confirmation.  Of course, it wasn't really ever about Judge It is not that Democrats were determined to block his confirmation; it is that they were determined to block any confirmation.  Democrats tried to offer reasons to oppose Judge Gorsuch, but they struggled to come up with anything plausible. The Senate minority leader actually came to the floor and tried to argue that he was worried that Judge Gorsuch would not be ``a mainstream justice.''  Over the course of 2,700 cases on the Tenth Circuit, Judge Gorsuch has been in the majority 99 percent of the time--99 percent. In 97 percent of those 2,700 cases, the opinions were unanimous. So I would love to hear an explanation for how exactly a judge who has been in the majority 99 percent of the time is out of the judicial mainstream. Was the minority leader attempting to argue that all of the judges on the Tenth Circuit, including those appointed by Democratic Presidents, are out of the mainstream?  The fact is that Democratic opposition to Judge Gorsuch had nothing to do with his qualifications. I doubt that any of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle really think that Judge Gorsuch is out of the mainstream or that he lacks the qualifications of a Supreme Court Justice, but they opposed him anyway.  If they opposed a judge with a distinguished resume and a reputation as a brilliant jurist; if they opposed a judge who is known for his fairness and impartiality; if they opposed a judge whose nomination has been repeatedly supported by liberals, as well as conservatives; if they opposed a judge who unanimously received the highest possible rating from the American Bar Association--a rating, I might add, that the minority leader once called the ``gold standard'' for judicial nominees; if they opposed a judge a number of them supported 10 years ago, then it is abundantly clear that their opposition wasn't about this judge but about any judge this President nominates. Thus, Republicans were left with no real alternative but to act to preserve the Senate's tradition of giving Supreme Court nominees an up-or-down vote. This wasn't my preference. I preferred to leave room for a minority to block a judge who is truly not fit for office. But it was the only alternative we were left with if we wanted to confirm anyone to the Supreme  Historically, confirming judges was not a partisan process. During the George Bush administration, however, Democrats decided they were going to change that. They were mad back then too--mad that a Republican President was in charge. Apparently, modern-day Democrats are not reconciled to the fact that in our system of government, it is not always the Democrats who win.  Anyway, the Democrats were mad, and they decided that the historically bipartisan process of confirming judicial nominees was going to change. Their 2003 filibuster of Miguel Estrada, who had been nominated to a seat on the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, was the first time a judicial nominee who enjoyed clear majority support was not confirmed because of a filibuster.  Democrats ultimately successfully filibustered no fewer than 10 Bush nominees to appellate courts. That was a massive reversal in Senate history. Suddenly the normally smooth process of confirming a President's judicial nominee had been turned into an exercise in partisanship.  Ten years later, Democrats struck again when they employed the nuclear option to ensure that they could pack the DC Circuit--despite the fact that at the time, when the current minority leader announced that Democrats would ``fill up the D.Circuit one way or the other,'' Republicans had blocked just two of President Obama's circuit nominees and had confirmed 99 percent of his judges. So 215 were confirmed out of 217 under President Obama up to that point.  And now here we are today. Democrats are again mad that they lost an election, that they can't control the nomination process, and they once again turned to ``no-holds-barred'' partisanship. They made it clear that no Republican nominee would ever make it to the Supreme Court; thus, we had to act to ensure that Supreme Court nominees can receive an up-or-down vote going forward.  In the Senate's nearly 230 years, the filibuster has been used to block a Supreme Court nominee exactly once--one time. Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas's nomination to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court was blocked by a bipartisan coalition, in part over ethical concerns. That is how strong the Senate's bipartisan tradition of an up-or-down vote on Supreme Court nominees has been--230 years, one time, and it was bipartisan. I am deeply sorry that the Democrats were determined to end that tradition.  Judge Gorsuch should never have faced the threat of a filibuster. There was no reason--no reason other than the most flagrant partisan politics--to block this supremely qualified nominee from the Supreme  As I said, I look forward to tomorrow and to this final vote where we will have an opportunity to confirm to the Supreme Court this well-qualified, mainstream nominee who fundamentally respects the rule of law and the Constitution of the United States and will act impartially as a Justice for the American people.

708,SHELBY,proceeding_id,topic-id,905,"Mr.President, I wish to address the Senate for a few minutes about the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch, which is the topic of the day and has been the topic for weeks. It probably has been said, but I am going to go through some of it again.  Judge Gorsuch is a native of Denver, CO, where he currently resides with his[[Page S2399]]wife Louise and their two daughters. He is currently 49 years old.  I want to talk about some of his credentials. Judge Gorsuch received his bachelor of arts degree from Columbia University in 1988, his juris doctor from Harvard Law School in 1991, and a doctorate in legal philosophy from Oxford University in the UK in 2004.  At Columbia, he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, a Truman scholar at Harvard Law School, and a Marshall scholar at  Following law school, Judge Gorsuch served as a law clerk to Federal appellate judge David Sentelle and then to Justice Byron White of the U.Supreme Court and Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy of the Supreme  In 1995, Judge Gorsuch entered private practice as an associate of Kellogg, Huber, Hansen, Todd, Evans & Figel, and he was elected partner in that law firm in 1998. His practice focused on general litigation in both trial and appellate matters.  Judge Gorsuch left private practice in 2005 to serve as the Principal Deputy to the Associate Attorney General at the Justice Department in  President George Bush nominated Judge Gorsuch to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, located in Denver, on May 10, 2006. He was confirmed in the Senate by a voice vote on July 20, 2006.  We talk about qualifications for judges. I want to share some of his. Judge Gorsuch has served over a decade on the U.Court of Appeals for the Tenth He has an outstanding judicial record that speaks for itself. He has participated in over 2,700 appeals on the Tenth Circuit, and 97 percent of them have been unanimously decided. In those cases, he was in the majority 99 percent of the time.  Of the approximately 800 opinions he authored on the Tenth Circuit, 98 percent of his opinions were unanimous, even on a circuit where 7 out of the 12 active judges were appointed by Democratic His opinions on the Tenth Circuit have the lowest rate of dissenting judges at 1.5 percent. That is unheard of. Out of the eight cases he has decided that were reviewed by the U.Supreme Court, seven were affirmed and one was vacated.  Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2006 was met without opposition, and he was confirmed by voice vote.  Notably, Senators serving during this time include a lot of my former colleagues: then-Senator Barack Obama, Senator Joe Biden, Senator Hillary Clinton, Senator John Kerry, Senator Harry Reid, and 12 other current sitting Democratic Senators in this body, including the minority leader, Chuck  In March, the American Bar Association, ABA, unanimously gave Judge Gorsuch a ``well qualified'' rating, their highest possible mark. Minority Leader Schumer and Senator Leahy have both previously referred to the ABA as the ``gold standard by which judicial candidates are judged.''  In the area of jurisprudence, Judge Gorsuch has a mainstream judicial philosophy, which he clearly articulated during the Senate Judiciary's confirmation hearing.  I believe his record is unequivocal in that he believes judicial decisions should be based on the law and the Constitution and not personal policy preferences. He has a deep commitment to the Constitution and its protections established by our Founding Fathers, including the separation of powers, federalism, and the Bill of Judge Gorsuch's decisions demonstrate that he consistently applies the law as it is written, fairly and equally to all individuals.  Additional information about Judge Gorsuch: The American people deserve to have their voices heard in selecting Justice Scalia's replacement. This is what we are doing.  Some of my colleagues intend to oppose Judge Gorsuch based solely on the fact that they disagree with the outcome of the Presidential election.  During President Trump's campaign last year, he clearly defined the type of Justice he wished to nominate to the current vacancy. He even published, as you will recall, a list of 21 judges who possessed what he believed are the necessary qualifications to serve on the U.Supreme  Following Judge Gorsuch's nomination, he sat for over 20 hours of questioning in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee in the Senate--the longest hearing of any 21st-century nominee. Additionally, he was given 299 questions for the record by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. This also is the most in recent Supreme Court confirmation history.  Simply put, I believe this is the most open and transparent process in choosing a Supreme Court nominee ever conducted by an administration. By filibustering this nomination, some of my colleagues are breaking a nearly 230-year tradition of approving Supreme Court nominees by a simple-majority vote.  I believe the American people spoke clearly when they elected President I believe this is the American people's seat, and I believe Judge Gorsuch is an exceptional choice for the Supreme He deserves an up-or-down vote, and that is why I believe we are getting ready in the next few hours to confirm him.

710,BLUMENTHAL,proceeding_id,topic-id,1434,"Mr.President, as we finished the vote just hours ago, I could not help but notice a number of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle high-fiving each other. That image stays with me as I stand here now. It saddens me. There is no cause for celebration in what happened in the Senate just hours ago. No one should sleep well tonight. No one should underestimate the magnitude of what happened here. Damage was done to our democracy, in fact, to the institutions that are the pillars of our democracy--the United States Supreme Court and the Senate itself.  Today is, indeed, one of my saddest days in the Sadder than anything is the damage that has been caused to the Supreme Court by eroding and undermining trust and respect for an institution that has power only because of its credibility with the American people. It has no armies or police force; all it really has is the confidence and respect of the American people.  Today, raw political power has been exercised to break the rules and norms of this body so that a nominee could be confirmed. The only way that he could be confirmed was, in fact, to wreck the rules, a nuclear option that will have enduring fallout and rippling repercussions, perhaps for years come.  For myself, I would state unequivocally that I hope we will work together on issues where we have common ground, where we can reach common solutions on infrastructure, on tax reform, on immigration issues.  No one should make light of the potential fallout, as there is in any nuclear explosion, from this action today.  The Senate has broken with decades of bipartisan practice when it comes to the U.Supreme The practice and the tradition was that Presidents of either party would consult with Members of both parties in this body before making a nomination so as to ensure a mainstream nominee, and that nominee would be in the mainstream even before his or her selection so that there was some modicum of comity and so that respect for this body, as well as the courts, would be preserved.  My concern is that the contagion of partisanship will infect the court system as a whole. All of the nominations to lower courts, as well as the appellate courts, will be affected.  My hope is that we can avoid that truly cataclysmic outcome, a nuclear explosion, in some ways even more deafening and damaging than the one used today would be because our courts are the bulwark of our democracy. An attack on our courts is an attack on the only check we have against tyranny and autocratic erosion of those rights. That is why the nonpartisanship of our courts is so important.  The Supreme Court, of all our courts, should be above politics. In fact, that is why the 60-vote rule for the Supreme Court was so important. The Supreme Court is different: nine Justices appointed for life to the highest Court in[[Page S2400]]the land. In some ways, it is an anachronism in our democracy--unaccountable, unelected, sitting for life with the power to strike down actions of elected representatives and an elected Executive by issuing words on paper without the direct means to enforce them, depending only on respect and credibility from the American people. To approve nominees by a razor-thin majority is a disservice to the Court and to our democracy.  Supreme Court Justices do more than just follow the law; they have to resolve conflicts in the law and differences among the lower courts where they disagreed and, in fact, ambiguities in the statute, where there is lack of clarity, where this body is unable to reach consensus and, in effect, decides to agree, to the extent it can, and leave some question to administrative agencies, which rightly are entitled to respect, as they implement the law.  Confidence and trust are essential, and we have undermined it today. Our Republican colleagues have gravely damaged it by the actions taken today.  I have urged my colleagues to reject Neil Gorsuch because I believe he is out of the mainstream, because he failed to answer questions about whether he agreed with established core precedents essential to rights of privacy and equality under the law, because he has a judicial philosophy that would involve substituting judgments of courts for administrative agencies and banning the Chevron doctrine, and because he favored in many of his actions, opinions, writings the interests of corporations over individual rights.  We have debated the merits of this nominee. I believe that his repeated evasion of the questions that were put to him leaves us with the inescapable conclusion that he passed the Trump test; that he is not a neutral caller of balls and strikes; that he is, in fact, an acolyte of the of the rightwing groups that screened and suggested his name; and that he would carry out not only the Trump litmus test to overrule Roe v. Wade, strike down gun violence provisions, but also other unknown decisions that would implement that far-right conservative agenda. We can debate whether that view is right or wrong.  Today is one of my saddest days in the It goes more to the institutions that have been demeaned and degraded: the U.Senate and the Supreme My hope is that maybe it will be a turning point. Maybe we can reconstruct the sense of bipartisanship and comity that existed for so many years. Many of my colleagues on the other side have expressed to me their misgivings about what was done today.  The obstruction of Merrick Garland's nomination was, as one of my colleagues put it, ``the filibuster of all filibusters.'' It was another step in a continuing progression, culminating in today's outcome that very much betrays the spirit and values of a bipartisan selection of Supreme Court nominees because the highest Court in the land is different.  I had the extraordinary honor to clerk for a Justice on the U.Supreme Court, Harry Blackmun, who was appointed by a Republican, President Richard He grew as a Justice and surprised a lot of people. He, no doubt, surprised the President who appointed him. And that is what happens to really extraordinary men and women who serve on our courts as well as in the U.Senate; they grow in the job.  Choosing a U.Supreme Court Justice is one of the most solemn and important duties that a President has, and confirming her or him is one of the most important tasks we have in this body.  Even at the most difficult and contentious times, as I served then as a law clerk and as I have litigated since then for several decades, I have never doubted that judges were working in good faith to uphold the rule of law. Whether they ruled my way or not, I believed that we were working to try to be above partisan politics and uphold the rule of law and do the right thing to follow the law.  The Supreme Court does more than follow; it leads. Today's vote is a significant challenge to that principle and perhaps the most difficult that we have seen in recent history. It threatens to exact profound damage on the confidence and trust the American people have in the Supreme Court and perhaps in the courts overall, and that is a danger for all of us.  In my view, when the history of this time is written, there will be two heroes: the free press that has uncovered abuses and wrongdoing despite opposition from many powerful forces, and our independent judiciary that has upheld their right to do it and, also, the rights of countless Americans in many areas of law.  Today's action threatens those two institutions in our society. It undermines our rules. It would not have happened without a choice made by the Republican leadership that they were willing to break the rules to achieve this result.  I am determined to try to move forward in a positive way, in legislation as well as in protecting and enhancing our courts, giving them the resources they need to do their job--and law enforcement, the resources needed to uphold the rule of law.  We cannot hold the Supreme Court hostage to any ideology, and that is a lesson from today and from the past year that we should all heed.  Mr.President, I will continue to talk about this topic because I believe it is so profoundly important to our Nation, but for now, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Cassidy).

711,GRAHAM,proceeding_id,topic-id,914,"Mr.President, when they write the history of our times, I am sure that when it comes to Senate history, this is going to be a chapter, a monumental event in the history of the Senate not for the better but for the worse. After we are all long dead and gone, somebody may be looking back and trying to figure out what happened or what motivated people.  I am going to tell you what has motivated me since I have been in the Senate: an understanding that the job of a Senator, when it comes to advice and consent, is not to replace my judgment for that of the President, not to nullify the election, but to be a check and balance to make sure that the President of either party nominated someone who is qualified for the job and is capable from a character point of view of being a judge for all of us, having the intellect, background, judgment, experience to carry out the duties of a Supreme Court  When President Obama won the White House, I suspected that he would pick judges who I would not have chosen, based on our different philosophies of liberal-conservative jurisprudence.  This is what Greg Craig, the former White House Counsel in the Obama administration, said about Elena Kagan, who is now on the Court: ``Kagan is . . . a progressive in the mold of Obama himself.''  This is what Vice President Biden's Chief of Staff Ronald Klain said about Elena Kagan: ``Elena Kagan is clearly a legal progressive . . . [and] comes from the progressive side of the spectrum.''  I think that was an accurate description of her and Sonia Sotomayor, who both are progressive Justices who come from the progressive side of the judicial spectrum. Both are highly qualified, capable women who had stellar legal records. Even though they had outcomes I did not agree with, they were certainly in the mainstream. Both had been judges. I think he chose people I would not have chosen, but they were really highly qualified.  I was the only member of the Judiciary Committee on the Republican side to vote for either Justice Kagan or Justice Sotomayor because I used a standard that I thought was constitutionally sound. I am not telling any other Senator what they should do. I am just trying to explain what I did. In the Federalist Papers, 76, written April 1, 1788, Mr.Hamilton said:       To what purpose then require the co-operation of the      Senate? It would be an excellent check upon a spirit of      favoritism in the It would portend greatly to      prevent the appointment of unfit characters from state      prejudice, from family connection, from personal attachment,      and from a view to popularity.  So, from Hamilton's point of view, it was a check and balance against a crony or unqualified person, someone who was popular but not qualified for the job, somebody who was supported because they were close to the President and not qualified for the job, someone who was appointed because they were a favorite son of a particular That would not be fair to everybody else. When you look at the history of the advice and consent clause,[[Page S2401]]it is pretty clear that the Founding Fathers did not have in their minds that one party would nullify the election when the President of another party was chosen by the people when it came to Supreme Court confirmations because they chose somebody they did not agree with philosophically.  I voted for Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, knowing they come from the progressive judicial pool. Neil Gorsuch is one of the finest conservatives that any Republican President could have chosen, and he is every bit as qualified as they were. His record is incredible--10\1/2\ years on the bench, 2,700 cases, and 1 reversal. He received the highest rating of the American Bar Association, ``well qualified,'' just like Sonia Sotomayor and Elena  To merit the committee's rating of ``well qualified,'' a Supreme Court nominee must be a preeminent member of the legal profession, have outstanding legal ability and exceptional breadth of experience, meet the very high standards of integrity, professional competence, and judicial temperament. The rating of ``well qualified'' is reserved for those found to merit the committee's strongest affirmative endorsement. By unanimous vote on March 9, the standing committee awarded Judge Gorsuch this highest rating of ``well qualified,'' just like they did for Sonia Sotomayor and Elena He has 2,700 court decisions, 1 reversal, and praise from all areas of the law--left, right and middle. The ABA report of 900 cases describes a very thoughtful man, an incredible judge, and a good person. So I don't think anybody could come to the floor and say--even though they may disagree with the outcome--that Judge Gorsuch is not qualified, using any reasonable standard, to be chosen by President He is every bit as qualified as the two Obama appointments. So, clearly, qualifications no longer matter like they used to.  Antonin Scalia--whom Judge Gorsuch, hopefully, will soon replace as Justice Gorsuch--was confirmed by the Senate 98 to 0. Ruth Bader Ginsburg was confirmed 96 to 3. I would argue that you could not find two more polar opposite people when it comes to philosophy than Justice Ginsburg and Justice They became very dear friends, but nobody in their right mind would say there is not a difference in their judicial philosophy.

712,KENNEDY,proceeding_id,topic-id,1327,"Mr.President, Senator Graham, my fellow Senators, our constituents in the Gallery, a lot of what has gone on today may seem very complicated. We have heard a lot of terms being thrown around: cloture, the nuclear option. Yet, really, the question that we were faced with today in the Senate was very simple, and it continues to be pretty simple and straightforward, in my judgment: Should we have an up-or-down vote on the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be an Associate Justice of the U.Supreme Court?  Earlier today, the Senate voted to do that. I think it is very important for the American judicial system and for the American system of democracy that the U.Senate be allowed to vote on Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the U.Supreme It was not enough to only vote on a motion to end debate; we also needed to be allowed to vote on the actual nomination with ``yes'' or ``no.''  Unfortunately, our friends on the Democratic side of the aisle decided to filibuster in order to make it impossible for us to vote on this crucial nominee without modifying the rules of the U.That is what we did earlier today. I do not know that anybody did it happily, but certainly a majority of the Senate believed that the American people deserved an up-or-down vote, yea or nay. Stand up and be counted in front of God and country. Do you want Judge Neil Gorsuch to be on the Supreme Court, or do you not? That vote is going to take place tomorrow afternoon.  The Constitution reads that the President of the United States of America ``shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate shall appoint . . . judges of the Supreme Court.'' I do not need to tell you that this is an extremely important part of our separation of powers. It is vital to our protecting the integrity of the Supreme Court, the work that all of us do--not just members of the Judiciary Committee but every Member of the Senate--in vetting our nominees and making sure they are qualified and independent, as is Neil He is enormously important for the protection of liberty itself.  Let's not ever forget what we are protecting. We are protecting justice, and we are protecting liberty. We are not supposed to be protecting a certain point of view. We are not supposed to be protecting a certain policy preference. We are not supposed to be protecting a certain political party.  I hope tomorrow, when we finally get the opportunity to vote up or down on Neil Gorsuch for his membership on the greatest tribunal in the history of civilization, in my judgment, the U.Supreme Court, that we will consider his nomination in light of how it will affect our country, not our party. When we look at his nomination from that perspective and leave the politics of the last few years in the rearview mirror, I think we can analyze his nomination with a lot more clarity.  Alexander Hamilton, whom I think most Americans admire, said in Federalist 78 that the Court has ``neither force nor will but merely judgment.'' I think that is what we are all looking for--or should be--in a nominee to any court but especially to the[[Page S2403]]U.Supreme We are not looking for somebody with a certain policy preference. We are not looking for people with ideas of how the law can be improved because the role of a judge is not to make law, it is to interpret the law as made by the legislative body as best that judge can understand it. That is why we need someone like Neil Gorsuch, in my estimation, who has good judgment.  I sit on the Judiciary I have spent 20 to 40 hours with Neil Gorsuch or with people who know him well, in hearing their testimony. I have read his opinions. As far as I am concerned, he is as good as it gets. I cannot imagine that President Trump could have picked better.  He is a thoroughbred. He is a legal rock star. If you read his opinions, you will see that he is painstaking in his application of the law to the facts before him. He writes beautifully. His communication skills are absolutely amazing. His analysis and analytical rigor are clear and concise. His decisions are wise and disciplined, and he is faithful to the law. He is an intellectual, not an ideologue. He is a judge, not a politician. He is whip-smart, has clear writing, is a strict constitutionalist, likes snow skiing, fly fishing, and is a fourth-generation I think he will serve every person in our country well as a member of the Supreme That is why I am supporting him.  Let me say one final thing. I do not think there is any vote that will be more important than the vote we will take tomorrow on a President's nomination to the U.Supreme Court, so I want to choose my words carefully. Not a single, solitary vote is more important than that vote we will take tomorrow. That is not to say that there are not other important issues before this body. That is why I think it was so important today that we decided to vote up or down on Judge Gorsuch so that we can move on to those other important issues--jobs, jobs, jobs; designing a healthcare delivery system that looks like somebody designed it on purpose, which our Acting President has worked so hard on; infrastructure; elementary and secondary education; a skilled workforce. I could go on.  There is an enormous amount of pain in America today. There are too many Americans who are not participating in the great wealth of America--not economically, not socially, not culturally, and not spiritually. We have been elected in the Congress to do something about that.  I talk to people in my State every day, and I know the Presiding Officer does too. The people of Louisiana are fun-loving, God-fearing, and plain-talking, and this is what they tell me: Kennedy, this country was founded by geniuses, but sometimes I think it is being run by idiots.  They say: Kennedy, we look around our country today, and here is what we see. We see too many undeserving people at the top--I want to emphasize ``undeserving'' because I don't want to paint with too broad a brush--who are getting bailouts, and we see too many undeserving people at the bottom who are getting handouts. We are in the middle, and we get stuck with the bill. We cannot pay it anymore, Kennedy, because our health insurance has gone up, our kids' tuitions have gone up, and our taxes have gone up. I will tell you what has not gone up--our income.  These are real people with real problems, and they sent all of us here because they are real mad and they expect us to do something about it.  The sad truth is that our children's generation is at risk of becoming the first in America, unless this body does something, to be worse off than their parents' generation because in our country today, for too many Americans, it is harder than ever to get ahead. That is why so many Americans feel stuck. They feel like the hope and change they were promised has become decline and uncertainty, and they are looking to us to do something about it.  So let's vote. Let's vote tomorrow. I understand reasonable people disagree. I understand unreasonable people can disagree too. But I am going to vote for Neil Gorsuch to be an Associate Justice of the U.Supreme Then I am going to ask this body to move on to other important issues that are keeping moms and dads awake at night when they lie down and try to go to sleep.

He has handled with a lot of care and fairness the issues that have come before him.

He testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee and wrote an op-ed piece in the New York Keep in mind, when you listen to this--this is a quote from an op-ed piece in the New York Times, and one of the individuals from the administration of President Obama said this: ``His years on the bench reveal a commitment to judicial independence--a record that should give the American people confidence that he will not compromise principle to favor the President who appointed him.''  That comes from an Obama appointee.  Not only is he well liked, but he also has an impressive resume, serving as law clerk to two different Supreme Court He attended Columbia, Harvard, Oxford, and it doesn't get any better than that. It is clear he has the qualifications, and as recently as the last administration, that was really all you needed to be confirmed to be on the U.Supreme  What the Democrats have done to block his nomination has never been done before. This is significant. People don't realize--people who are maybe critical of some of the procedures that were taking place, they forget the fact that there has never been, in the history of America, a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nomination--there has never been. This will be the first time this happened.  I support the majority leader in changing the rules in the face of this unprecedented action by a minority party. There is really no reason for their filibuster of this highly qualified individual, other than partisanship and catering to their liberal base. Changing the rules for Supreme Court nominations had to be done, and if the situation were reversed, the Democrats would have done the same thing in a heartbeat, as we saw in 2013 when they did the same thing.  Judge Gorsuch deserves to be on the Supreme He does not deserve to be blocked because people are upset that we observed the Biden rule; that is, not providing for any action on a nominee for a Supreme Court vacancy once the election season is underway--and they lost the election.  Now, that is Joe Biden, not Jim Inhofe.[[Page S2404]]  In addition to his impeccable job and experience and educational background, he is perhaps best known for his defense of religious liberty, including a role in the dispute during the Obama administration that required employers to provide abortion-inducing drugs to their employees as part of their health insurance. One of these employers was Hobby  Everyone knows who Hobby Lobby is, but not everyone knew them back when I knew them. I knew them back in the 1970s, when the Green family, who started Hobby Lobby, were actually operating out of their garage, making picture frames, and look at them today. I have known them for a long time. They started out their whole business with a $600 loan. Now they have over 700 stores across the United States and are the largest privately owned arts and crafts store in the world.  Judge Gorsuch and the Supreme Court agreed with Hobby Lobby and upheld their religious liberty rights. I am going to read to my colleagues his concurring opinion. It is very profound. Judge Gorsuch wrote, after they made the determination that Hobby Lobby did not have to give these drugs to their employees:       It is not for secular courts to rewrite the religious      complaint of a faithful adherent, or to decide whether a      religious teaching about complicity imposes ``too much''      moral disapproval on those only ``indirectly'' assisting      wrongful conduct. Whether an act of complicity is or isn't      ``too attenuated'' from the underlying wrong is sometimes      itself a matter of faith we must respect the faith.  Now, that is what he wrote in Hobby  In a very similar situation around the same timeframe, there was a case that is known now to be the Little Sisters of the He joined in an opinion defending the rights of nuns not to be forced to pay for abortion-inducing drugs in their healthcare plans. This is another profound statement he made. He said: ``When a law demands that a person do something the person considers sinful, and the penalty for refusal is a large financial penalty, then the law imposes a substantial burden on that person's free exercise of religion.''  It is not just petitioners of the Christian faith whom Judge Gorsuch has sided with. He upheld the religious beliefs of a Native American prisoner and of a Muslim prisoner who found their ability to practice their faith restricted in one manner or another.  He comes to his decision not because he is seeking some predetermined outcome; he comes to his decisions because that is where the facts of the law and the Constitution lead him.  For example, in the Lynch case--another Oklahoma case--Gorsuch referred to Chevron deference as ``a judge-made doctrine for the abdication of the judicial duty.''  Chevron deference is the judicial rule that requires judges to defer to an agency's interpretation--we are talking about a bureaucracy--an agency's interpretation of the law if the law is considered ambiguous or unclear and if the agency's interpretation is reasonable. This defense to the agency gives them a lot of authority, a lot of power. Moreover, it can provide a lot of uncertainty to the regulated community.  As Judge Gorsuch wrote, Chevron deference allows agencies to ``reverse its current view 180 degrees any time based merely on the shift of political winds and still prevail [in court].''  I know a little bit about this. I spent a lot of years being the chairman of a committee called the Environment and Public Works During the Obama years, we had a bureaucracy that was trying to change the law instead of following the law. It was exactly what Judge Gorsuch was talking about in this case when he talked about the Chevron deference, giving deference to a bureaucracy. You can imagine being in business, especially a heavily regulated one, that has to worry that every 4 to 8 years the rules might change then and how do you plan to make your plans.  I think Gorsuch's opinion on Chevron deference is an important debate to have. Do we, as a coequal branch of government, continue to give up our powers to the administrative state or do we take our power back and write laws as they should be implemented? Furthermore, does the judicial branch, as a coequal branch of government, continue to give up their power of interpretation to the administrative state?  These are important, fundamental questions that should be addressed, and I am glad the Gorsuch nomination has brought these cases to light.  Although Judge Gorsuch was nominated by a Republican President, this doesn't mean my colleagues on the other side of the aisle should have any concern about Judge Gorsuch's decisionmaking ability. This is important to point out because being a judge is not about making decisions that are in the best interests of any political party but really about making decisions based on facts and the law and the Constitution without bias.  During his confirmation, Judge Gorsuch stated his judicial philosophy, saying:       I decide cases . . . I listen to the arguments made. I read      the briefs that are put to me. I listen to my colleagues      carefully and I listen to the lawyers in the well . . .      keeping an open mind through the entire process as best I      humanly can and I leave all the other stuff at home. And I      make a decision based on the facts and the law.  Who can argue with that? He has proven over a period of time that he will do that.  Through the whole debate, it has become evident that the Democrats were asking him to rule in favor of causes and not to follow the law, which is what a judge does and should do.  Regarding the roles and balance of our government, Gorsuch is what a judge should be. He believes Congress should write the laws, the executive branch is to carry them out, and the judicial branch is to interpret the laws. The confirmation of Judge Gorsuch will shape our Nation for generations to come, and all of us will be able to benefit from his wise decisions.  I am looking forward to confirming Judge Neil It is going to happen tomorrow, and then all of this will be over. I am proud to give him my vote. Justice will be well served as such.

Only because the court had gotten such significant criticism did it reverse its decision. Apparently even the very shaky President of Venezuela, Maduro, weighed in to get them to reverse their decision. Now, isn't that something? This is supposed to be a democracy. Yet it is being run as a dictatorship, where even the judicial branch goes and does something crazy and the President of the country gets up and tells them: You had better reverse yourself; there is too much criticism.  This is the nonsense that is going on in Of course, what went on last week further undermines Venezuela's so-called democracy, and it is only the latest in President Maduro's creeping dictatorship. That is what it is.  He has repeatedly and violently suppressed protesters and jailed his political opponents in violation of any understanding of human rights. He has used that same Supreme Court to block members of the National Assembly from taking office, and he has used that Supreme Court as a rubberstamp to overturn the laws that the National Assembly does that he doesn't like. Isn't it a sad state that Venezuela has reached?  The President has also thwarted opposition efforts to recall him, President Maduro, in a national referendum. In so doing, he was able to appoint a Vice President with ties to Hezbollah, and now a Vice President it appears that he has sanctioned for drug trafficking.  Meanwhile, the poor Venezuelan people suffer the consequences of the political, humanitarian, and economic[[Page S2405]]crisis. Venezuelans are dying because of severe shortages of food and medicine and other products. The economy is in freefall, and crime and corruption are rampant.  Last year, 18,000 Venezuelans sought asylum in the United States--more than any other nationality. The United States stands clearly on the side of the Venezuelan people in calling on President Maduro to cease undermining democracy, release all political prisoners, respect the rule of law, and respect human rights.  There obviously is no sign that he is going to be doing this. What should we do? First of all, we ought to get our Secretary of State to work with the international community, including the Organization of American States, to help resolve this crisis and alleviate the suffering of the Venezuelan people.  That is the first order of business, to try to eliminate the suffering of people. It is all so true; whenever a dictator takes control, as has happened in Venezuela, it is the people who suffer first.  Additionally, I am suggesting and I am calling on the administration to fully enforce and, where appropriate, expand the sanctions on those responsible for continued violence and human rights violations that are perpetrated against the people.  It is very interesting. A lot of these so-called big guys in Venezuela love to travel. They love to have bank accounts. They love to come to They love to have U.bank accounts. Let's slap some severe economic sanctions on these guys. The situation is increasingly dire, and we must stand with the Venezuelan people in their struggle for democracy and human rights.

717,NELSON,proceeding_id,topic-id,625,"Mr.President, while we have a lull in the debate, I want to take an opportunity to talk about healthcare. Since we had an utter inability of the House of Representatives to come together on any kind of healthcare bill, this Senator would suggest that instead of the mantra ``repeal and replace,'' since now that seems to be dead, why don't we take the existing law that has provided a lot of things for the average citizen? For the average person in my State of Florida, it means a great deal to have the availability of health insurance, which they never had and can now afford.  There need to be fixes to the law known as the Affordable Care Act that was passed several years ago. Indeed, one of those fixes could be a kind of ``smoothing fund,'' that as the insurance companies vie for this business on the State exchanges, they would be able to have this fund as a resource for them to get over some of the humps--also, certainly for some of the insureds.  Just because you are at 400 percent of poverty and therefore no longer eligible for some of the subsidies to enable you to buy health insurance--and, by the way, for a single individual, that is only about $47,000 a year of income--the person who makes $47,000, $50,000 a year can't afford to go out and spend $8,000, $10,000, $11,000 on a health insurance policy.  We need to adjust that--in other words, fix that as well. There needs to be an additional fix of a subsidy for the people who are just over 400 percent of poverty. To translate that another way, for a family of four, that is only about $95,000 a year. On a tight budget like that, they simply can't afford health insurance. They need some help.  With a few little fixes like that to the existing law--the Affordable Care Act--we could get this thing tuned up and, indeed, continue to provide what we need in order for people to have healthcare.  One other fix: There are about 4 million people in the country who, if their State legislatures and their Governor would expand Medicaid--and some of those Governors are now expressing interest in doing this--under the Federal law up to 138 percent of poverty, 4 million more people would be covered with healthcare. In my State of Florida alone, there are 900,000 people who otherwise would be getting healthcare who do not because the government in the State of Florida has refused to expand Medicaid coverage up to 138 percent of poverty.  How much is that? For a single individual, that is someone making about $16,000 a year. A person like that can't afford health insurance. A person like that can't afford any kind of paying for any healthcare.  What happens to them? When they get sick, they wait and wait to try to cure themselves because they can't pay a doctor. When the sickness turns into an emergency, they end up in the emergency room and then, of course, it is uncompensated care and the hospital eats it. The hospital, of course, passes that uncompensated care on to all the rest of us who are paying our premiums on health insurance.  It makes sense to do this. With a few fixes, we would be able to tune up the existing law to provide the healthcare that most of us want to provide. It seems to me that it is common sense, and it is common sense that can be done in a bipartisan way. It is my hope and my prayer that the Senate and the House will come together and ultimately do this.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from Rhode  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt3-PgS2383-5.txt
718,REED,proceeding_id,topic-id,1451,"Mr.President, the Senate has decided on a purely partisan basis to resolve the impasse of Judge Gorsuch's nomination by invoking the so-called ``nuclear option.'' For the first time in our history, nominees to the Supreme Court of the United States may advance from nomination to confirmation with a simple majority vote in this body.  I have heard many of my colleagues ascribe blame equally to both sides, and I have heard analysts and experts say the same. One can question that diagnosis, as some very respected scholars like Norm Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute and Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institute have demonstrated that our political polarization over the last several years, and hence our current impasse, has been driven predominantly by the ever more conservative ideology of the Republican Regardless, here we are.  The Gorsuch nomination lacks the traditional level of support required for a Supreme Court seat, and the majority leader has chosen a step that Democrats clearly and emphatically rejected when we needed to confirm nominees with broad support but were blocked because they were submitted by President  I had hoped it was not too late for cooler heads to prevail. Unfortunately, adherence to the principle of 60 votes for consideration of a Justice of the Supreme Court and indeed the existing rule in the Senate was ignored, and we are at this impasse.  Since many have drawn a false equivalence between the last so-called ``nuclear option'' vote of several years ago and what occurred today, let me take a moment to explain, for my part, why I very reluctantly supported a change to the Senate precedent for nominees other than the Supreme Court in 2013.  During President Obama's tenure, Republicans necessitated more cloture votes than were taken under every previous President combined. Let me repeat that. During President Obama's tenure, Republicans necessitated more cloture votes than were taken under every previous President combined, from George Washington to George In numerical terms, Republicans demanded a cloture vote 79 times over just 5 years. In contrast--from the Founding Fathers all the way through George Bush--the Senate only faced that situation 68 times. Republicans obstructed Obama nominees more in 5 years than the United States Senate obstructed all nominees combined over the course of more than two centuries.  The bitter irony, of course, was that after a nominee would break through, Republicans often would vote overwhelmingly to confirm the very nominee they so adamantly delayed. It was clear their sole guiding principle was obstruction and delay.  Judges nominated by President Obama faced some of the longest median and average wait times under the five most recent Presidents, and President Obama tied with President Clinton for the fewest number of circuit[[Page S2406]]court nominees confirmed during that same period. All that time, judicial vacancies stacked up. Justice was delayed and denied. Critical public service roles went unfilled, and the American public came to regard Congress as a place where nothing of substance can occur.  It was under those dire and unprecedented circumstances that I reluctantly joined my colleagues to change the filibuster rules for executive nominations and judicial nominations, other than the Supreme Court--very consciously excluding the Supreme Court, which at that time was recognized as appropriate by all my Republican colleagues. But there really is no equivalence between that decision and what the majority did today.  Even in 2013, at the height of Republicans' partisan attacks on President Obama, Senate Democrats believed the Supreme Court was too important to subject to a simple majority vote. The Supreme Court is a coordinate branch of our government, and its lifetime appointees have final authority to interpret the We understood then--as we do now--that the traditional 60-vote threshold to conclude debate on the highest Court in our nation was too important to the consensus-driven character of this body to sacrifice.  I think we also have to acknowledge that a President already has nominated a consensus choice capable of earning 60 votes to a seat on the Court, and that nominee was Chief Judge Merrick The unprecedented treatment he received by the majority has already made this one of the most infamous and politicalized Supreme Court nominations in American history. It is all the more disconcerting that Judge Gorsuch witnessed Judge Garland be treated so poorly but now seems to feel entitled to his seat on the Court, even if the Senate must change its precedence to give it to him.  I already addressed this body about my deep concerns regarding Judge Gorsuch's judicial record of ideological activism and championing the powerful over the powerless, but it is worth going into greater detail on one of his opinions that is emblematic of this, and that has recently come to the fore.  In 2008, Judge Gorsuch heard what is referred to as the Luke In that case, the parents of an autistic child sought reimbursement from a school district for the cost of specialized education because the school had not provided adequate accommodations for the child under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act or The case presented heart-wrenching facts that are too familiar for families affected by disabilities such as autism. The child, Luke, experienced severe behavioral issues in public and at home. His parents sought advice from the best sources available to create the most effective atmosphere for him to make progress in school. Ultimately, they recognized the public school Luke had attended could not provide the learning atmosphere required by the law for So they placed him in a different school setting.  Luke's parents exercised their rights under The Colorado Department of Education, the Colorado Office of Administrative Courts, and a Federal district court all agreed that the law entitled them to reimbursement from the school district that was not able to provide an adequate learning environment for This should have been the end of the matter, but when the school district appealed the case to the Tenth Circuit, Judge Gorsuch's decision reversed all these factfinders to hold in favor of the school district.  In order to reach his conclusion, Judge Gorsuch went to great lengths--picking and choosing passages from previous decisions--to weave a new standard that essentially eviscerated the protections under His strict interpretation of this landmark law utterly ignored congressional intent and created a new precedent that schools need only provide ``merely more than de minimis'' or, in plainer terms, just a little bit more than zero educational opportunity for children with disabilities. The immediate result of this decision was to force Luke back into an inadequate learning environment and leave his parents with yet another unexpected financial hardship. At the same time, Judge Gorsuch's new legal standard threatened to degrade the quality of education for children with disabilities all across the country.  The good news for Luke's family--and for so many others--is that the Supreme Court of the United States intervened in a rare unanimous opinion, reversing Judge Gorsuch's position--ironically during his confirmation hearings. The Nation has been spared the potential harm that could have resulted from lowering expectations for schools nationwide and leaving families like Luke's without sufficient recourse.  Yet as my colleagues and I have pointed out at every turn of this confirmation process, this is far from the only decision by Judge Gorsuch that is widely outside the mainstream of modern jurisprudence. He is not--and was never intended to be--a consensus nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme It should not come as a surprise, therefore, that this body is divided over his nomination to the highest Court in the land, and Judge Gorsuch could not earn enough support under the 60-vote threshold.  The filibuster was intended to be an institutional safeguard that protects the minority by requiring broad consensus for major decisions by this body. It should be equally apparent in this circumstance that the filibuster did its job. A large minority of this body viewed Judge Gorsuch as too extreme for the Supreme Court, and that minority blocked cloture on his nomination. There was no national emergency, no danger, no serious consequence whatsoever that prevented the majority from reversing course and working with Democrats and the President to find a consensus nominee. In one day, the majority has lessened the distinction between our Chamber and our colleagues across the Capitol, all the while lowering ourselves further in the eyes of the Nation and opening the door to an even more polarized judiciary.  I regret that this is the case, and I hope this body can turn back from the course we find ourselves on today.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Yesterday, I came to the floor to speak about the path that brought us to this point. As I discussed, way back in 2001, the current minority leader and some of his allies on the far left hatched a plan to, in their words, ``change the ground rules'' with regard to lower court nominees. I noted a New York Times article describing the Democratic senatorial caucus retreat, where the new approach to nominees was discussed; in other words, where they discussed the strategy for changing the ground rules of how judges are considered by the United States  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the May 1, 2001, New York Times article entitled ``Washington talk; Democrats Readying for Judicial Fight,'' and the April 5, 2017, story from the Washington Examiner entitled ``The Gorsuch Plagiarism Story is Bogus.''

Forty-two of the Senate's 50 Democrats attended a private      retreat this weekend in Farmington, Pa., where a principal      topic was forging a unified party strategy to combat the      White House on judicial nominees.       The senators listened to a panel composed of Laurence      Tribe of Harvard Law School, Cass Sunstein of the      University of Chicago Law School and Marcia Greenberger,      the co-director of the National Women's Law Center, on the      need to scrutinize judicial nominees more closely than ever.      The panelists argued, said some people who were present, that      the nation's courts were at a historic juncture because, they      said, a band of conservative lawyers around Mr.Bush was      planning to pack the courts with staunch conservatives.       ``They said it was important for the Senate to change the      ground rules and there was no obligation to confirm someone      just because they are scholarly or erudite,'' a person who      attended said.       Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader,      then exhorted his colleagues behind closed doors on Saturday      morning to refrain from providing snap endorsements of any      Bush nominee. One senior Democratic Senate staff aide who      spoke on the condition of anonymity said that was because      some people still remembered with annoyance the fact that two      Democratic senators offered early words of praise for the      nomination of Senator John Ashcroft to be attorney general.       Senators Robert Torricelli of New Jersey and Joseph      Biden of Delaware initially praised the Ashcroft      selection, impeding the early campaign against the      nomination. Both eventually acceded to pressure and voted      against the nomination.       The current partisan battle is over a parliamentary custom      that Republicans are considering changing, which governs      whether a senator may block or delay a nominee from his home      state. Democrats and Republicans on the Judiciary Committee      have not resolved their dispute over the ``blue-slip policy''      that allows senators to block a nominee by filing a blue slip      with the committee.       On Friday, Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the ranking      Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, and Mr.Schumer sent a      letter to the White House signed by all committee Democrats      insisting on a greater role in selecting judges, especially      given that the Senate is divided 50-50 and that the      Republicans are the majority only because Vice President Dick      Cheney is able to break any tie.       Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader,      told reporters today that he believed ``some consideration      will be given to Democratic input, but I don't think they      should expect to name judges from their state.''       Mr.Lott said he expected that Democrats might slow the      process but, in the end, would not block any significant      number of nominees.       Behind all the small-bore politics is the sweeping issue of      the direction of the federal courts, especially the 13      circuit courts that increasingly have the final word on some      of the most contentious social issues. How the federal bench      is shaped in the next four or eight years, scholars say,      could have a profound effect on issues like affirmative      action, abortion rights and the lengths to which the      government may go in aiding parochial schools.

These passages are      factual, not analytical in nature, ``Abigail Lawlis Kuzma,      who serves as chief counsel to the Consumer Protection      Division of the Indiana Attorney General's office, said in a      statement made available to the Washington       Her remarks came soon after two reports alleged Tuesday      evening that President Trump's Supreme Court nominee had      ``copied' passages in his 2006 book, ``The Future of Assisted      Suicide and Euthanasia.'' The reports alleged he also lifted      material for an academic article published in 2000.       The charge, which involves Gorsuch repeating medical terms      and not original concepts or ideas, is weak, at best.       ``[The similar] passage are factual, not analytical in      nature, framing both the technical legal and medical      circumstances of the `Baby/Infant Doe' case that occurred in      1982,'' Kuzma explained. ``Given that these passages both      describe the basic facts of the case, it would have been      awkward and difficult for Judge Gorsuch to have used      different language.''       BuzzFeed was first to report on the similarities between      Gorsuch and It published a story Tuesday headlined,      ``A Short Section in Neil Gorsuch's 2006 Book Appears To Be      Copied From A Law Review       Politico followed suit publishing a story titled,      ``Gorsuch's writings borrow from other authors.''       Other newsrooms, including the Huffington Post, Business      Insider and New York magazine, moved quickly to repeat the      charges against       Politico bolstered its charge with quotes from multiple      academic experts, including Syracuse University's Rebecca      Moore Howard, who, interestingly enough, is quite open about      supporting former President Barack       However, several professors who worked closely with Gorsuch      during the period in which he produced much of the work in      question said the hints and allegations against the judge are      nonsense.       ``[I]n my opinion, none of the allegations has any      substance or justification,'' Oxford University's John Finnis      said in a statement made available to the ``In all      four cases, Neil Gorsuch's writing and citing was easily and      well within the proper and accepted standards of scholarly      research and writing in the field of study in which he was      working.''       Georgetown University's John Keown, who reviewed Gorsuch's      dissertation, said elsewhere in a statement: ``The allegation      is entirely without foundation. The book is meticulous in its      citation of primary sources. The allegation that the book is      guilty of plagiarism because it does not cite secondary      sources which draw on those same primary sources is, frankly,      absurd.       Indeed, the book's reliance on primary rather than      secondary sources is one of its many strengths.''       Further, actual attorneys disagree that Gorsuch plagiarized      anything.       ``People unfamiliar with legal writing, or even writing,      may be unfamiliar with how citations work,'' Attorney Thomas      Crown explained Wednesday.'' When I cite to a case or      statute, if I am quoting verbatim, I give a direct quotation,      with apostrophes and everything, and then the source. If I am      summarizing, sometimes even using the same words, I follow      with the direct citation. The Bluebook, which is the legal      style Bible, is for law reviews and some appellate and trial      courts, and has more specific rules.       ``I mention this because this is standard across numerous      fields, not just law, and only illiterates . . . are      shocked,'' he added. ``Different field with different      standards and forms; but even most academics believe that a      good synopsis with citation isn't plagiarism.''       In conclusion, he wrote, ``I don't want to ruin a perfectly      good five-minute hate, but this isn't even close to      plagiarism.''  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt3-PgS2383-5.txt
721,GRASSLEY,proceeding_id,topic-id,1020,"After a brief time in the majority, Senate Democrats were back in the minority in 2003--so approximately 2 years after they had this strategy. It was at that time the Senate Democrats began an unprecedented and systemic filibuster of President George Bush's circuit court nominees.  Then the tables turned. President Obama was elected, and Republicans held the Senate minority. At that time, even though many of us did not like the idea of using the filibuster on judicial nominees, we also recognized that we could not have two sets of rules--one for Republican Presidents and one for Democratic  Our party defeated two nominees for the lower courts by filibuster and denied cloture to three of President Obama's nominees to the DC Circuit Court of But the other side did not appreciate being subject to the rules that they first established and started using in 2003 to filibuster judges. So at that point, in 2013, they decided to change the rules of the  By the way, they changed the rules by breaking the rules. I say that because the rules of the Senate say it takes a two-thirds vote to change the[[Page S2408]]rules of the Senate, but they changed it by a majority vote. Now at that time, as we all know, Majority Leader Reid changed the rules for all Cabinet nominations and lower court nominees. To say that my colleagues and I were disappointed is a gross understatement.  The majority claimed that they left intact the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees. But my view back in 2013, when they did that, was that the distinction Majority Leader Reid drew between lower court nominees and Supreme Court nominees was not a meaningful one. My view, in 2013, was that Majority Leader Reid had effectively eliminated the filibuster for both lower court nominees and the Supreme  Here is the reason. There are two circumstances where this issue might conceivably arise: either you have a Democrat in the White House and a Democrat-controlled Senate or you have a Republican in the White House and a Republican-led  In the first, there was a Democrat in the White House and the party led by Leader Reid and Leader-in-Waiting Schumer was in the majority. If for some extraordinary reason Senate Republicans chose to filibuster the nominee, there is no question that a Majority Leader Reid or a Majority Leader Schumer would change the rules.  Now, I do not believe that this particular circumstance would ever arise, because our side does not believe in filibustering Supreme Court nominees. I have never voted to filibuster a Supreme Court nominee, not once. I think I have a pretty good sense of the rest of our caucus. Our side just does not believe in it. It is not much more complicated than that simple commonsense statement I just made.  Of course, even if for some extraordinary reason our side did choose to filibuster a Supreme Court nominee, we do not have to speculate as to whether the other side would have changed the precedent with respect to the Supreme Last year, when everyone thought that Secretary Clinton was going to win the election, their own Vice-Presidential candidate said that they would change the rules if they needed to if we had a Republican filibuster.  Then, of course, the other circumstance where this issue would arise is what we have seen this very day--a Republican in the White House and a Republican-controlled We saw this very day that the minority was willing to take that last step and engage in the first partisan filibuster in U.history.  As I have repeatedly discussed, because they were willing to do it with a nominee as well-qualified as Judge Gorsuch, it proved, without a shadow of a doubt, that they would filibuster any one submitted by this Republican That is why, on the day that Majority Leader Reid took that unprecedented action in 2013 to break the Senate rules to change the Senate rules, I spoke on the floor.  I concluded my remarks this way. So I want to quote myself:       So the majority has chosen to take us down this path. The      silver lining is that there will come a day when the rolls      are reversed. When that happens, our side will likely      nominate and confirm lower court and Supreme Court nominees      with 51 votes, regardless of whether the Democrats actually      buy into this fanciful notion that they can demolish the      filibuster on the lower court nominees and still preserve it      for the Supreme Court nominees.  That is what I said when Reid took that extraordinary step. So though I am extremely pleased that we will confirm such an exceptional nominee to the Supreme Court in the next day or so, I am, of course, disappointed with what we were forced to do to get it done. Sadly, I cannot say I am surprised. I think my surprise, or the fact that I can't be surprised--you can tell it from what I said back there, what I just quoted from the 2013 speech that I gave.  I knew when Majority Leader Reid did it in 2013 that this is where we were headed. That is where we ended earlier this afternoon. But the bottom line is that you cannot have two sets of rules. You cannot clothe yourself in the tradition of a filibuster while simultaneously conducting the very first partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee in history. You cannot demand a rules change only when it suits the Democratic Members of this body.  You just can't have it both ways. You can't use the Senate rules as both a shield and a sword. But I must say, the one thing that does not disappoint me is this: The nominee to take Justice Scalia's seat is eminently qualified. He will apply the law faithfully without respect to persons. He is a judge's judge. Come some time tomorrow, we will all start calling him Justice  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Blunt).

723,WICKER,proceeding_id,topic-id,1889,"Mr.President, I rise to express my strong support for Judge Neil Gorsuch, to say that I will proudly vote in favor of his confirmation tomorrow, and to express my confidence that history will judge this nominee to be an outstanding Associate Justice of the Supreme I hope he serves a long and distinguished career and believe he will. I think Justice Neil Gorsuch will turn out to be a credit to the Supreme Court, to the President who nominated him, and to the Senate that will confirm him tomorrow.  It is unfortunate that we have had quite a bit of discussion about procedure and the process that has gotten us to this vote, which will take place tomorrow afternoon.  I had a conversation with one of my Democratic colleagues yesterday afternoon as we were leaving the Capitol This is a person with whom I have worked on issues and for whom I have great regard. I asked him how he was doing, and he said: Well, I am just getting ready for the United States Senate to be forever changed.  I paused for a moment, and I said: How can it be that two reasonably intelligent Senators of good will can look at the same factual situation and see it so differently? I think my colleague did agree that, indeed, the situation we have is what has led us to our proceedings today.  I do believe my colleagues on the other side of the procedural issues today are people of good will who are trying to do the right thing by their country on this issue, just as I have been.  Let's look first of all at the candidate himself, and then I might take a moment or two to talk about what we have already done. That decision has been made. Let's talk about Neil Gorsuch, about this outstanding future Supreme Court Justice who I believe will be sworn in tomorrow or the next day.  Is Neil Gorsuch qualified? Really, can anyone contest that he is highly qualified? He is perhaps one of the most qualified people ever to have been nominated by a President for the High He has degrees from Columbia, Harvard Law, and Oxford He has received the American Bar Association's highest rating, the gold standard that we look at when it comes to judging nominees for the Federal bench up to and including the High He served for 10 years with distinction on the Tenth Circuit Court of Clearly, he has got the qualifications, and clearly, he is among that group of qualified individuals that the President promised to look at back during the campaign and promised to send that type of individual over to the Supreme I really don't think there is much that can be said to contradict the fact that Neil Gorsuch is qualified and highly qualified.  So now let's ask if Neil Gorsuch is somehow out of the broad judicial mainstream. Again, I think it is clear that, based on his history, based on his testimony, and based on his rulings up until now, he is part of the broad judicial mainstream that will put him in good company on the Supreme Court and makes him a worthy successor to Justice  First of all, he has earned the praise of both conservatives and liberals. He has even won the endorsement of President Obama's former Acting Solicitor General, who wrote in the New York Times, ``If the Senate is to confirm anyone, Judge Gorsuch who sits on the U.Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Denver should be at the top of the list.'' So thank you to the[[Page S2409]]former Acting Solicitor General for going beyond ideology and political philosophy and saying a true statement that Judge Gorsuch is outstanding and should be at the top of the list.  Editorial boards across the country have touted Judge Gorsuch's credentials and temperament. The Denver Post, his hometown newspaper, wrote an editorial praising his ability to apply the law fairly and consistently. Of course, there has been newspaper after newspaper from the right and left across this country who come down on this side of the issue saying that Judge Gorsuch should be confirmed.  Let's look also--and this has been pointed out so often that you wonder if you should say it again, but Judge Gorsuch on the Tenth Circuit has participated in 2,700 cases, he has written over 800 opinions, and has been overruled by the Supreme Court one time. Is this a judicial radical? I think not.  I think this is someone who is demonstrated to be in the judicial mainstream--one reversal by the Supreme Court out of 800 written decisions and 2,700 votes cast on panels with the Tenth He has almost always been in the majority some 99 percent of the panels he served on, he was in the majority of those opinions, and 97 percent of those decisions were unanimous. This is hardly some radical pick as some might have suggested.  Has the process been unfair? We have heard a lot about this. A lot of my dear friends on the other side of the aisle feel aggrieved for sure. They feel that Judge Garland, the nominee of President Obama in 2016, was treated unfairly. I would simply make this observation, and the American public can decide if this was unfair.  This is a vacancy that came up during a heated, hotly contested Presidential year. There is really no doubt that, under similar circumstances, had the roles been reversed and had a Republican tried to nominate a nominee in the last year of his 8-year term, that a Democrat majority in the Senate would have done exactly as we did.  I am not guessing when I say this because the Democratic leaders of previous years have said as much. No less than Joe Biden--who was a former chairman of the Judiciary Committee and later on became Vice President for 8 years--no less than Joe Biden said exactly the same. It almost became the Biden rule. Republican Presidential nominees taken up during the final year of a term will not be considered by a Democratic So the shoe was on the other foot, and we acted the same.  So we will leave it up to the American people to decide whether Judge Garland was treated unfairly. I do not believe he was. As a matter of fact, I felt very comfortable during 2016 saying that who fills a Supreme Court seat is so important, such a significant and long-lasting decision, that the American people deserve to be heard on this issue. I felt comfortable making the Presidential election largely about what the Supreme Court would look like over the coming years.  There is no question about it, the American people got to decide in November of 2016 whether they would like a judge in the mold of Justice Scalia whose seat we were trying to fill or would they like a judge in the mold of Judge Garland who President Obama was seeking to put in place. So I make no apology for saying to the American people, You get to decide in this Presidential year what sort of Supreme Court you want. The American people made that decision, and I am comfortable with that.  I was asked today by several members of the press about the change in the rules that I voted for today. It is not a situation that makes me overly joyed. It is not my idea of a good time to overrule a precedent and to substitute another one in its place. You would rather not do that if you are a U.Senator; but the fact is that it puts us back into a place that we were for 200 years in this  From the beginning of this Senate, 1789 through 1889, through 1989, up to and including 2003, there was no filibuster at all on Supreme Court There was no partisan filibuster at all in Supreme Court Justices, and no judge had ever been denied his position because of a partisan filibuster at any level--Federal judge, circuit level, or Supreme  That changed in 2003, and with the Miguel Estrada nomination, our Democrat friends stopped a qualified judge from going on the Federal appeals court. That was the beginning of an unfortunate 14-year experiment in judicial filibusters. It is not a filibuster that I think--it is not a precedent or experiment that I think this Senate can be very proud of, but it took place over a relatively short period of time over 14 years, and it ends it today.  As of today, the U.Senate is back where it was for over 200 years in the history of this Senate and the history of our Republic without the ability to stop a judge on a partisan filibuster. In fact, this fact cannot be contradicted. There has never been in the history of our country, even in this past decade and a half of having the possibilities of a Supreme Court filibuster, there has never been a Supreme Court nominee in the history of our republic stopped by a partisan filibuster.  Today that 225-year or so precedent would have ended had we not acted to change the rules back to where we are back to fundamental principles. I was not willing to see Judge Neil Gorsuch be that first nominee stopped by a partisan filibuster in the history of our country. I was simply not willing to do that.  We now must proceed to the rest of our business. We will confirm Judge Gorsuch tomorrow. I think he will serve well. Then we have work to do. We have other nominees to consider, and then we've got an agenda that we need to tend to for our people.  I am encouraged by the exchange of the first early steps of goodwill after this divisive process. Indeed, there was an article in one of our publications today that talked about a healthy feeling now in both caucuses, that we have got to put this procedural episode behind us, this crisis behind us and legislate.  I am glad to hear that sort of bipartisan talk coming from the other side of the aisle. Another of my friends across the aisle said, ``We're not looking for dilatory procedures,'' he said. ``When there are things where we can work together, we're looking for that.''  I am encouraged--even encouraged that my friend who I was talking to yesterday afternoon will conclude that we have not forever changed the Senate in a negative way, that we are, in fact, back to where we were before 2003 and getting things done.  In the end, this is about an individual who is qualified. It is about a vacancy that needs to be filled. I for one am highly comfortable that the President, in Neil Gorsuch, has put forth an outstanding, eminently qualified judge and that he will serve us well. My vote tomorrow in favor of confirmation will be cast enthusiastically and proudly, and I think that it will stand the test of time.  I thank the Presiding Officer very much, and at this time, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

725,RUBIO,proceeding_id,topic-id,3046,"Mr.President, tomorrow morning or tomorrow afternoon at some point, we will, I believe, vote to confirm Judge Gorsuch to be a Justice to the U.Supreme There is so much that has been said about him and his qualifications. I have been listening to the speeches all week. Even headed to the committee hearing, I think so much had been said about him. This is a mainstream candidate. This is a mainstream judge. He is someone who voted with the majority 99 percent of the time during his time on the bench. He is someone who 97 percent of the time, in 2,700 cases, was a part of rulings that were unanimous. He most certainly, I believe, is someone who believes the Constitution should be interpreted according to its original intent of the writers, but he is certainly not someone outside the mainstream of American legal thinking, and he is certainly eminently qualified. It is interesting in that you see a broad array of individuals come forward and talk about his qualifications.  I also thought it was interesting that there really was no coherent reason for[[Page S2410]]opposing him. There are a lot of different opinions on the floor that claim he would not commit to certain decisions that people would like to see him make on the That would be true of virtually everyone who has been nominated to the Court over the last quarter century.  There is no doubt that he is someone who has certain beliefs and views about the Constitution that are reflective of the President's party, but that is what elections are about. Obviously, the great people whom President Obama appointed reflected his thinking. That is our system.  A lot of the attention, though, in this debate has been about the process that brought us here. There has been tremendous consternation about the change that no longer would there be a requirement of 60 votes in order to end debate. I think a lot of people have a fundamental misunderstanding of what has happened and how we have gotten here, and I thought it was important for the people of Florida and others who may be interested to know how I approached it, because it was something that I am not excited about or gleeful about or happy about. I would say that is probably the sentiment of most of the people here in the Yet it happened anyway.  I saw a cartoon by one of these editorial cartoonists; I am not quite sure who it was. It had this picture of both sides basically saying: This is terrible, but we are going to do it anyway.  I think it is important to understand, first and foremost, about the It is unique. There is no other legislative body like it in the world. Unlike most legislative institutions, it does not function by majority rule. It actually requires a supermajority to move forward. That was by design; it was not an accident.  The people--the Founders, the Framers--created a system of government in which they wanted one branch of the legislature to be very vibrant, active, representative of the people. They represent districts, and they have 2-year terms. Then they created another Chamber which was different in nature. At the time, the U.Senate was designed, first of all, to represent the Where the House was the people's House, the Senate was the place the States were represented.  The other thing they wanted to design was a place that was at some level possibly immune from the passions of the moment. They wanted a place where things would slow down for a moment, where we would take a deep breath and make sure we were doing the right thing. It was a wise course.  Our Republic is not perfect, but it has survived for over two centuries. In the process, it has given us the most dynamic, most vibrant, and, I believe, the most exceptional Nation in all of human history. While not perfect, the Senate has been a big part of that endeavor.  By the way, at the time, Senators were elected by the legislature; they were not even elected by people. Of course, that changed. I am not saying we should go back, but that is the way it was.  That Senate was also unique because it had this tradition of unlimited debate. When a Senator got up to speak, they got to debate as long as they wanted, and no one could stop them. Then, at some point, that began to get a little bit abused, so they created a rule that required a supermajority, and that supermajority was further watered down. Then we arrive here, over the last 4 years, to see what has happened.  Basically, what happens now is that there are two ways to stop debate, which is as a result of a procedure that was undertaken on the floor first by Senator Reid when he was the majority leader and now by the majority leader today on what is called the Executive Calendar, where there are nominations for the Cabinet, Ambassadors, the sub-Cabinet, courts, and now the Supreme 1 is by unanimous consent, when everybody agrees to it, or, 2, through 51 votes, a majority vote.  I think that is problematic in the long term, not because of Judge Neil Gorsuch, for I believe that in any other era and at any other time, he would not have just gotten 60 votes or even unanimous consent to stop debate; I think he would have gotten 60-plus votes, maybe 70 votes, to be on the I think it is problematic because we do not know who is going to be the President in 15 years or what will be the state of our country. Yet, by a simple majority, without talking to a single person or getting a single vote from the other party or the other point of view, they are going to be able to nominate and confirm and place someone on the bench of the Supreme Court--to a lifetime appointment to a coequal branch of government--without even consulting with the other side. I think, long term, that is problematic--in the case of Neil Gorsuch, not so much, but for the future of our country, I think it could be problematic.  The argument has been made that this has never been used before, so all of the stuff brings us back to where we once were. I think technically that is accurate, but this is not exactly where we once were. Where we once were was that there were people who worked here who understood they had the power to do this. They got it. They understood that if they had wanted to, they could have forced the 60 votes. They understood they had the power to do it, but they chose not to exercise it. They chose to be judicious because they understood that with the power, there comes not just the power to act but sometimes the power not to act, to be responsible, to reserve certain powers for extraordinary moments when it truly is required. And over the years, it has been abused.  This is not going to be a speech where I stand up here and say that this is all on the Democrats, although I most certainly have had quarrels over some of the decisions that have been made by the other side of the aisle. I think it is a moment to be honest and say that we all have brought us here to this point, both sides, and it has required us to do this.  The reason I was ultimately able to vote for the change today is that I am convinced that no matter who would have won the Presidential election and no matter which party would have controlled this Chamber, that vote was going to happen. Both sides were going to do this because we have reached a point in our politics in America where what used to be done is no longer possible, and that has ultimately found its way onto the floor of the U. Rules are rules, and ultimately the Republic will survive the change we have seen here today. I think the more troubling aspects are the things that have brought us to this point.  A couple of days ago, while at a lunch with my colleagues, I said that one of the things, I think, we are going to have to accept is that, quite frankly, the men and women who served in this Chamber before us--20, 30 years ago--were just better than we are. They were human beings who, quite frankly, had deeply held beliefs. I do not know of any Member of this Chamber who was more conservative than Barry Goldwater or Jesse I do not know any Member of this Chamber who was more progressive or liberal than Hubert Humphrey or Ted Kennedy or others. Yet somehow, despite their deeply held principles, these individuals were able to work together to prevent what happened here today.  The fact is, for both sides, that is not possible anymore. Today, our politics require us to use every measure possible, even if it is for symbolic purposes. That is just the way it is. That is more of a reflection of our political process than it is of the  I have seen these articles that have been written of ``the end of the Senate'' or ``the death of the Senate.'' It is a little bit of an exaggeration, but I think it is actually just reflective of the fact that this is the way politics has become, that as a nation today, we are less than ever capable of conducting a serious debate about major issues in the way we once were able to do. I think everyone is to blame.  I think the way politics is covered is to blame. Today, most articles on the issues before us are not about the issues before us; they are about the politics of the issues before us. Today, most of the work that is done in this Chamber and in the other Chamber has more to do with the messaging behind it than it does with the end result of where it will lead us. That is just the honest fact.  Before people start writing or blogging: Well, look at all of these other times when the Senator from Florida--when I did some of these things--I admit it. I do not think there[[Page S2411]]is a single person here with clean hands on any of this. I admit that I have been involved in efforts that, looking back on some of these things, perhaps, if we knew then what we know now, we would have done differently. I think it is important in life to recognize and learn from those experiences and to adapt them to the moment before us.  I think, moving forward, the biggest challenge we will face in the country is that our issues are not going to solve themselves. They will require people from very different States, very different backgrounds, and very different points of view to be able to come together and solve some pretty big deals. It is ultimately not about silencing people or having them compromise their principles but about acknowledging that in our system of government, we have no choice but to do so. We have no choice.  I think it also requires us to take a step back and understand that the people who have a different point of view than ours actually believe what they are saying. They hold it deep, and they represent people who believe what they are saying. I say this as someone who will admit that, in my time of public service, perhaps I have not always applied that as much as I wish I had. I try to. You certainly live and learn when you get to travel the country and meet as many people as I did over the last couple of years. I certainly think that impacts us profoundly.  I have a deeply held belief in limited government and free enterprise and a strong national defense and the core principles that define someone as a conservative. But I have also grown to appreciate and understand the people who share a different point of view--perhaps not as much as I hope to one day be able to understand and respect it, but certainly more than I once did, simply because the more people you meet, the more you learn about them, and the more you learn and understand where they are coming from.  Are we capable as a society to once again return to a moment where people who have different ideas can somehow try to figure out how to make things better, even if the solutions are not perfect? I hope so, because the fate of the most important country in human history is at stake. Are we capable of once again having debates, not that aren't vibrant and not that from time to time people may say things or even do things that they may regret, but certainly ones that at the end of the day are constructed for the purpose of solving a problem, not winning an election. I hope so, because if we don't, we will have to explain to our children why we inherited the greatest country in human history and they inherited one that is in decline.  I don't mean to exaggerate, because ultimately this is a rule change. We don't vote on the Supreme Court every day, every week, every month. Sometimes we don't vote on it for long periods of time. But I think it exposes a more fundamental challenge that we face today in American politics, and that we better confront sooner rather than later, and that we should all confront with the understanding and the knowledge that none of us come to it with clean hands.  We were reminded again this week by the images that emerged from Syria of what a dangerous world we live in, and we are reminded that the threats remain.  I ask people tonight--no matter who you write for, who you blog for, what political party you are a member of, or whom you vote for in November--to ask yourself a question and to be honest about the answer. If, God forbid--and I mean this, God forbid--there were another 9/11-style attack on the United States, how would we honestly react? Because September 11 was a scary day, and on that day I remember there weren't Democrats or Everyone was equally frightened and everyone was equally angered. There was a sense of unity and purpose that we had not seen in a long time and have not seen since.  I honestly believe, sadly, that if today there were another 9/11-style attack on America, one of the first things we would see people doing is blaming each other, saying whose fault it was. You will have some people saying: Well, this terrorist attack happened because President Obama didn't do enough to defeat the terrorists. And others would say: It happened because the Republicans and the new President, President Trump, has not done enough, or has done things to provoke them. I honestly believe that. I think that is what the debate would look like. I hope I am wrong.  Just think about how far we have come in almost 20 years, 15 years. That is the kind of debate I believe we would have. Think about how destructive that is.  I also think we would see a plethora of crazy, fake stories about what was behind it. And here is the craziest part: Some very smart and educated people would believe those stories because we have reached the point now where conspiracies are more interesting than facts.  I know that people may see this and say: Oh, I think you are exaggerating. Maybe, I hope so. But I honestly think that we are headed in a direction that is actually making us--not us the Senate, but us, Americans--incapable of confronting problems.  I will just say this. What I really hope will happen soon is that we are going to get tired of fighting with other Americans all the time, that we will finally get fatigued with all of this constant fighting against other Americans are not your enemies. Quite frankly, I hope we have no enemies anywhere in the world, other than vicious leaders, and we hope to be a part of seeing taken them out of power at some point for the horrible things they do. I hope we will reach a point where people are saying, I am just tired of constantly fighting with other We will have differences and we will debate them. Thank God that we have been given a republic where we have elections every 2 years and where we can have these debates. But, in the interim, whether we like it or not, none of us is going anywhere.  The vast and overwhelming of majority of Americans will live in this country for the rest of their lives. This is their home and this is their country. We are going to have to figure out how to share and work together in this unique piece of land that we have been blessed with the opportunity to call home. If we don't figure out a way to do that soon enough, then many of these issues that confront America will go unsolved, and not only will our people pay a price and our children pay a price, but the world will pay a price.  So I know that is a lot to say about a topic as simple as a rule change and ultimately a vote for the Supreme Court, but I really think it exposed something deeper about American politics that we had better confront sooner rather than later, or we will all live to regret what it leads to, and that is the decline of the single greatest Nation in all of human history.  With that, I yield the floor.

It is very hard to misunderstand what he is saying.  Coach Staley: Absolutely, positively, unequivocally the best women's basketball coach, in my opinion, ever, against UCONN--ever. Dawn Staley, 20 years ago, came within a single point of winning a national championship as a player. Can you just imagine being a single point short? And this must feel like redemption for our coach.  We are so proud of the fact that both of our coaches are producing student athletes, learning academically, striving on courts but prepared for life, for living. So we are excited about that.

Much more, Senator Scott and I both had a chance to interact with him on a number of occasions. I don't mean to single them out among all of the other suspicious athletic accomplishments in South Carolina that are certainly worth noting, but I would say, with Frank, one of the things that really impresses me is not what he does with these young men on the court but the kind of influence he is in their lives off the court and the impact he has.  He was a high school coach in Miami and won State championships there. He comes from a hard-working family of Cuban exiles who made their home in South So we are very, very proud of what he has achieved. But what I am most proud of is the way Coach Martin has been able to influence those young men.  He did defeat the Florida Gators to make it to the final four, and I was not happy about that.

744,LANKFORD,proceeding_id,topic-id,1982,"Mr.President, I have listened over the last several weeks to accusations and a type of smear campaign, quite frankly, of a good judge and a good man: Neil  It is remarkable to me to see that the debate has become more about character destruction than it has been about policy differences. I understand there are policy differences, but why does it have to come to this?  In the past few weeks, I have heard on this floor that Neil Gorsuch shouldn't be a Justice on the Supreme Court because he has no independence from President  2, I have heard he was handpicked by far right groups like the Federalist Society, a group of legal minds committed to the original interpretation of the Constitution--clearly, a scandalous group of radicals.  I have heard that Judge Gorsuch supports torture, he is against privacy, he hates truckers, he will step on the little guy, he will help only big corporations, he is just not mainstream, and I have heard that he shouldn't be selected because he was not approved first by the Democratic Senate leadership.[[Page S2413]]  All of these reasons have been given for a historic change in Senate tradition not to give a Supreme Court Justice an up-or-down vote. Block him on a procedural motion; for the first time ever, block a Supreme Court Justice on a procedural motion with a partisan vote.  Let me take these one at a time as I walk through this.  1, I heard constantly that he is not independent enough from President As far as I know, he had never even met President Trump before. This didn't seem to be a standard, to be independent from the current sitting  Let me give an example: Justice Elena Kagan, who is clearly qualified as a legal mind, but I would say Republicans have serious policy differences with her. Justice Kagan was allowed to have an up-or-down vote. This body did not have a standard that they had to be independent from the If they had a standard like that, Justice Kagan would have never been on the bench. Why do I say that?  On May 10, 2010, President Obama nominated Elena Kagan to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme From 1997 to 1999, she served as Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and was Deputy Director of the Domestic Policy Council for President In 2009, she was confirmed Solicitor General of the United States for President She worked for President Obama in the Obama White House as his Solicitor General and then was taken directly out of the White House and put on the Supreme  I would say that is not independent from the So this mythological new standard that any Court Justice nominee needs to be independent from the President clearly wasn't in place when Elena Kagan was being heard.  It is also interesting to me that one of the most talked about decisions from Judge Gorsuch was a Chevron decision that he put out. The whole crux of that decision was the independence of the executive branch, the legislative branch, and the judicial branch. Let me just read a few paragraphs from the decision he wrote. He wrote this:       For whatever the agency may be doing under Chevron, the      problem remains that courts are not fulfilling their duty to      interpret the law and declare invalid agency actions      inconsistent with those interpretations in the cases and      controversies that come before them. A duty expressly      assigned to them by the APA [Administrative Procedures Act]      and one often likely compelled by the Constitution itself.      That's a problem for the judiciary. And it is a problem for      the people whose liberties may now be impaired not by an      independent decisionmaker seeking to declare the law's      meaning as fairly as possible--the decisionmaker promised to      them by law--but by an avowedly politicized administrative      agent seeking to pursue whatever policy whim may rule the      day. Those problems remain uncured by this line of reply.  In other words, the judiciary needs to have oversight of the executive agency in what they put out as far as agency rulings, not allowing the White House or any agency to just make any decision they like. He continued writing:       Maybe as troubling, this line of reply invites a nest of      questions even taken on its own terms. Chevron says that we      should infer from any statutory ambiguity Congress's      ``intent'' to ``delegate'' its ``legislative authority'' to      the executive to make ``reasonable'' policy choices. But      where exactly has Congress expressed this intent? Trying to      infer the intentions of an institution composed of 535      members is a notoriously doubtful business.  In all the accusations that he is not independent of the President, in one of his most famous opinions, he declares that we absolutely need to have independence from the White House--of any White House--and have a clear separation of powers between judiciary, legislative, and executive. That actually does not stand up to simple muster. So the first thing falls: no independence from the  The second issue which came up often was that he was handpicked by far-right groups. There were all these groups that handpicked him, so somehow that made it horrible that these different groups would actually try to support him.  I go back to Justice Again, that wasn't the standard at that time, and I could use numerous judges through that process. Elena Kagan was supported by the AFL-CIO, by the Human Rights Campaign, by numerous environmental groups like WildEarth Guardians, Sierra Club, and the National Organization for She had a lot of different liberal or progressive groups that were very outspoken in support of and helping to push her nomination.  There is nothing wrong with that. She was a nominee who was actively engaged in White House politics; she was actively engaged in Democratic campaigns. Before that, as far as working for the Dukakis campaign, she was a Democratic activist, and it was well known. That did not preclude her from getting an up-or-down vote for the Supreme Court because she is sitting on the Supreme Court today. There was no cloture vote mandate or requirement for a 60-vote threshold as there was pushed by this minority.  This issue that somehow you can't be handpicked or that having some groups that would support you from the outside somehow precludes you from being a serious consideration is not legitimate, and everyone knows it.  I have also heard individuals out there saying that he is for torture, he is against privacy, he hates truckers, he will step on the little guy, he is only for big corporations, and he is not mainstream.  Here is the problem: When you actually look at the history, it is very different from that. Of the 2,700 cases that Judge Gorsuch has been involved in, in the 10\1/2\ years he has been on the Tenth Circuit, he has been overturned in his opinions once--once in 2,700 cases; 97 percent of the time his cases were settled unanimously, and 99 percent of the time he voted with the majority.  Lest you don't know the Tenth Circuit as we know the Tenth Circuit in Oklahoma, because it is the circuit court for our State, the majority of the judges on the Tenth Circuit are judges selected by President Carter, President Clinton, and President They hold the majority in the Tenth So to say that he voted with them in the majority 99 percent of the time would be to say that the Carter, Clinton, and Obama appointees also apparently had these radical ideas. It is just not consistent with the facts.  Then I have heard of late that the President should have engaged with Senate leadership on both sides of the aisle to be asked for their approval of the nominee before that nominee was ever brought. Well, I don't know if that has ever been a requirement. There have been times that Presidents in the past have had conversations with people on both side of the aisle. Fine, but it is certainly not a requirement of the Constitution, and it certainly doesn't preclude a nomination.  It is interesting to me that Judge Gorsuch offered to meet with 100 Senators one-on-one, face-to-face. Only 80 of them accepted his offer; 20 of them refused to even meet with him face-to-face. He did 4 days of hearings in the Judiciary Committee, 4 solid, long days, where he answered every possible question he could answer.  He has had extensive background checks. Everyone has gone through every piece of everything they could find that has ever been written. In fact, the latest new accusation is they found a couple of places where what he wrote seemed to look strangely like something else someone else wrote--which, when I saw it and read the side-by-side on it, I thought: He forgot to do an annotation and a footnote in the 800 opinions he has written. In the tens of thousands of annotations that he did, he didn't do a couple of them. Somehow that doesn't seem to rise to the level that he shouldn't be on the Supreme Court--that in the tens of thousands of annotations he put there, he might have missed a couple.  I would challenge anyone serving in this body, to say: You can serve only if you have never missed a single footnote on any paper you ever wrote. I would say: Those who live in glass houses probably shouldn't throw stones because we have all had times like that.  He is a solid jurist. I believe he will do a good job. In the time I sat down in his office, we looked at each other face-to-face, and I went through multitudes of hard questions with him, trying to determine his judicial philosophy, seeking one simple thing: Will you interpret the law as the law--not with personal opinion but as the law.  This body is about opinions. This body is about listening to the voices all across our States and trying to make[[Page S2414]]good policy. Across the street at the Supreme Court, it is about one thing: What does the law say and what did it mean when it was written?  The Constitution and law were not living documents. They do live in the sense that if you want to make changes in the Constitution, you amend the Constitution and you make changes to it. You can't suddenly say it meant one thing one day but culture has changed and now it means something new.  If you need new law, this body passes new law. Across the street, they read the law and ask: What does it mean? It is that straightforward.  I look forward to having a jurist on the Supreme Court as an Associate Justice who says: I may not even like all my opinions and you may not like all my opinions, but I am going to follow the law, and what the law says is what we are going to do.  I think that is the best we can ask from a Supreme Court Justice, and I think it is a fair way to be able to get him an up-or-down vote. I have to tell you, I am profoundly disappointed that the Senate, to get a simple up-or-down vote, had to go through all of this just to be able to do what we have always done. Regardless of background or preferences or policy or politics, this body has always said the President, for his nomination, should get an up-or-down vote when they go through the process.  We are going to do that tomorrow. We will put Judge Gorsuch on the bench, and we are ready for him to go to work.  Mr.President, I yield back.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

746,PERDUE,proceeding_id,topic-id,1860,"Mr.President, it is humbling to be on the floor of the U.Senate with colleagues like Senator Lankford from It is an honor to listen to his words, to his heart, on an issue like today because this is, I believe, a historic day.  On January 31 of this year, I had the great honor of being invited to the White House when President Donald Trump announced his nominee for Associate Justice of the U.Supreme Court, Judge Neil It was a professional rollout of this nomination, but it spoke more to the man, the individual, Judge Gorsuch, than it did to the circumstance surrounding it.  Today, I want to again discuss Judge Gorsuch's nomination and the 200-plus years of historical precedent put on the line today. As an outsider of this political process, it is clear to me what is going on here. It really has nothing to do with Judge  The minority party today abandoned 230 years of tradition because of politics, in my opinion. Never before in the U.history has a purely partisan filibuster killed a Supreme Court nomination. Never before, in the history of our country, has a partisan filibuster killed a district judge nomination. Never before, and until 2003, has a partisan filibuster killed a circuit judge nomination. Mr.President, 2003 was the first time in our history that the rules of the Senate were used in a purely partisan way to stop a judicial nomination.  In 2003, the Democratic Party threw out over 200 years of precedent when it comes to circuit judge nominees and killed a circuit judge nomination. Today they attempted to do the same thing when it comes to a nominee to the highest Court in the United  It should be noted Republicans did not attempt to do this to either Justice Sotomayor or Justice Kagan when they were nominated by President Obama a few years ago. Throughout our history, even the most controversial Supreme Court nominees have gotten an up-or-down vote, a simple majority vote. On that note, I also wish to point out there is no longstanding rule or tradition that a Supreme Court nominee must obtain 60 votes to be confirmed.  Judge Clarence Thomas was confirmed by a narrow 52-to-48 margin. Even though a single Senator could have required 60 votes to invoke cloture, and none did. Likewise, Justice Samuel Alito was confirmed by a 58-to-42 margin. Again, no Senator required 60 votes to invoke cloture. Neither of those nominees were filibustered to death. They got an up-or-down vote.  Mainstream media outlets have repeatedly fact-checked the minority party on this. For example, last week the Washington Post said: ``Once again: There is no `traditional' 60-vote `standard' or `rule' for Supreme Court nominations, no matter how much or how often Democrats claim otherwise.''  Even PolitiFact has repeatedly pointed out that ``Gorsuch, like all other Supreme Court Justice nominees, needs only a simple majority to be confirmed by the Senate.''  Clearly, outside of this body, it is recognized in the media, and on both sides of the aisle for that matter, that there is no such thing as a 60-vote standard when it comes to the nomination and confirmation of Supreme Court  Additionally, the notion that the minority party filibustering Judge Gorsuch's confirmation is the same as our not allowing a vote last year, that logic doesn't hold up.  Last year, I joined many of my colleagues on the Senate floor in explaining why we felt it best not to give advice or consent on the nomination of a Justice to the Supreme Court during a Presidential election year. The integrity of the process, clearly outlined in article II, section 2, of the Constitution was at stake. It was about the principle, not the individual. Unlike the argument that it is tradition for a Supreme Court nominee to receive 60 votes, there is actual precedent for the position we took last year on President Obama's Supreme Court nominee.  Former Vice President Biden, former Minority Leader Reid, and many other Members of both parties have agreed that the political theater of a Presidential election year should not influence the process.  The last time a Justice was nominated and confirmed by a divided government in a Presidential election year was 1888. Clearly, there is more than 100 years of precedent for the position we took last year in not giving advice and consent.  We took a position that was consistent with more than 100 years of actions and comments from Members of both parties. Let's just get over that. This year stands on its own, independently. The time for debate on this issue has come and gone.  Furthermore, it is obvious that what is at issue here is not Judge Gorsuch's qualifications. In 2006, Judge Gorsuch was confirmed to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals by a voice vote in this body with no opposition. Again, no opposition on the floor of the U.Senate, just 10 years ago.  Then-Senator Biden did not object, then-Senator Reid did not object, then-Senator Clinton did not object, and, yes, then-Senator Obama did not object. Twelve current Members of this body, including the current senior Senator from New York, the senior Senator from Illinois, the senior Senator from California, did not object to Judge Gorsuch's confirmation in 2006.  It is a simple fact, they had the opportunity to raise an objection, and they did not do it. It is obvious that what is going on here has nothing to do with Judge Gorsuch's qualifications. What is at issue is nothing but pure, unadulterated politics.  This is exactly why I ran for the U.Senate, having never been involved in politics. This is what makes people home very nervous about the gridlock in this body. This is why President Trump still cannot meet with his full Cabinet today, months after he was sworn in as our This is the very cause of gridlock that I believe is causing the dysfunction in  As I said, Judge Gorsuch was confirmed unanimously by voice vote with no opposition in 2006. Judge Gorsuch is a principled jurist who is steadfast in his commitment to defending and upholding the  In my private meetings with him, I have been very impressed that this is his starting and finishing point: He is there to interpret the law, not to be an activist for his own personal opinion. He boasts a unanimous seal of approval from the gold standard, the American Bar  Throughout his extensive career in both the public and private sectors and through hour after hour of testimony, Judge Gorsuch has demonstrated an impartial commitment to the rule of law. This is another area in which legal[[Page S2415]]minds from both sides of the aisle agree.  Harvard Law School Professor Noah Feldman, himself no conservative, called it a ``truly terrible idea'' to try to force Judge Gorsuch, or any judge for that matter, to base their decisions on the parties involved. Beyond a shadow of a doubt, I know that Judge Gorsuch fully understands that the job of a judge is to interpret, not make, the law.  As he himself said, ``A judge who likes every result he reaches is very likely a bad judge, reaching for results he prefers rather than those the law compels.''  This commitment to impartiality, regardless of those involved in individual cases, is further evidence his nomination should be confirmed rather than filibustered to death like we have seen today.  Judge Gorsuch's record is evidence enough that he is an impartial judge committed to the The opposition has said he is outside the mainstream. That also doesn't hold up.  In 97 percent of his 2,700 cases, judges who also heard the cases unanimously ruled with Judge In 99 percent of his cases, he was not a dissenting vote. The other side is consistent in saying he is not mainstream. Seriously? How much more mainstream does he have to be?  To that point, Judge Gorsuch has drawn praise from both liberals and conservatives alike. Former President Obama's Acting Solicitor General called Judge Gorsuch ``an extraordinary judge and man.''  He is not alone in that assessment of Judge Mainstream media outlets across the country have praised this nominee to the Supreme Recently, the USA Today Editorial Board wrote: ``Gorsuch's credentials are impeccable . . . he might well show the independence the nation needs at this moment in its history.''  The Washington Post's Editorial Board wrote:       We are likely to disagree with Mr.Gorsuch on a variety of      major legal questions. That is different from saying that he      is unfit to serve.  The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board wrote: ``No one can replace Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court, but President Trump has made an excellent attempt by nominating appellate Judge Neil Gorsuch as the ninth justice.''  As I have noted, the minority party's move to filibuster Judge Gorsuch is not rooted in any actual precedent in the U.It also clearly has nothing to do with Judge Gorsuch himself. By any and all objective measure, he is a mainstream, well-qualified nominee to the U.Supreme  That is a point agreed upon by liberals and conservatives alike. Yet here we are still today throwing out almost 230 years of tradition, purely because of politics. This body must rise above the self-manufactured gridlock.  Our last President, according to constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley, created a constitutional crisis. It was caused by shutting down the Senate and creating the fourth arm of government, the regulators, and threatening the very balance of our three-branch system. It allowed the former President, through regulatory mandates and Executive orders, to basically fundamentally change the direction of the country without  Given this threat to the Constitution, at this point in our history, we absolutely need a jurist on the Supreme Court who will bring a balanced view and impartial commitment to the rule of law. It is imperative we confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch tomorrow--a principled, thoughtful jurist--to the U.Supreme  If we can't confirm this individual, who is absolutely in the middle of the profile agreed to by past Democrats and Republicans alike, who in the world will we ever be able to confirm?  Seriously, if we can't get together on this individual, who is in the mainstream in the middle of the profile? How in the world are we ever going to save Social Security, Medicare, all the other critical issues that are before this body? Bipartisan compromise is what this body was built on. I call on my colleagues to put self-interest and even party interest aside for the Nation's interest.  I count it an honor to be in this body. It is a sobering responsibility, but I am very optimistic when men or women of the character of a Neil Gorsuch are willing to go through this grueling exercise that we put them through in order to serve. Because of that, I am proud tonight to be a part of a majority that stood up and precluded this from happening.  I am so excited that tomorrow we will confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch as the next Associate Justice to the United States Supreme  I yield back my time.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Young).

747,PORTMAN,proceeding_id,topic-id,2583,"Mr.President, I rise today to express my strong support again for Judge Neil I spoke on the floor the other day about Judge I just heard my colleague from Georgia talk about him, and he did a terrific job.  This guy, Neil Gorsuch, is the right person for the job. He is qualified. He is smart and he is fair, and a bipartisan majority of the Senate will vote for this worthy candidate tomorrow. Let me underscore that. A bipartisan majority of the Senate will vote for this worthy candidate tomorrow. He will end up getting on the  I must tell you that I regret that some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle refused to provide him that up-or-down vote without going through the process we had to go through today. As someone who has gone through two Senate confirmations myself, I know they are not always easy. But I will tell you, it is a whole lot better for this institution and our country when we figure out ways to work together--in this case, to continue a Senate tradition of allowing up-or-down votes.  I like to work across the aisle. I have done that through my career. I can point to 50 bills I authored or co-authored that have become law in the last 6 years. They were bipartisan, by definition, because they got through this body and were signed into law by President I have voted for President Obama's nominees before President When President Obama had a well-qualified judge here on the floor, I voted for that judge. I voted for Loretta That was not an easy vote. I took heat for it back home because I thought she was well-qualified. I think that is what we ought to do in this body.  I am disappointed in the situation we are in. I think we could have followed more than 200 years of Senate tradition and not allowed for a partisan filibuster to try to block this nomination. We chose not to do that in this body. Never in the history of this body has there been a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court judge--never. Some of my colleagues said: How about Abe Fortas? That was several decades ago, and that was bipartisan. Abe Fortas was a Supreme Court Justice who had some ethics issues, and he actually dropped out of trying to get the nomination because of it. But never have we stood up as Republicans--or stood up as Democrats--and blocked a nominee by using the filibuster. It has just not been the tradition.  Instead, it has been to allow an up-or-down vote--a majority vote. There are two Justices on the Supreme Court right now who got confirmed with less than 60 votes. One is Clarence Thomas--probably the most controversial nominee in the last couple of decades, I would say. I wasn't in the Senate then, but I was watching it, as many of you were. It was certainly controversial, yet he got to the Court with 52 votes. Justice Alito was confirmed by 58 votes only 10 years ago. So these nominees were not filibustered.  By the way, President Obama's nominees, Elena Kagan and Justice Sotomayor, were not filibustered by They were given an up-or-down vote. In the history of the Senate, 12 nominations have been defeated on the floor, but, again, never a successful partisan filibuster. Even Judge Robert Bork--some of you remember that nomination. It was very controversial. His nomination was defeated in 1987. He was a Reagan appointee. But he wasn't filibustered. They had an up-or-down vote, and he was voted down.  So what are these objections to Judge Gorsuch that would rise to that level where we want to say that over 200 years of Senate tradition ought to[[Page S2416]]be shunted aside and we ought to stop this man? What are those objections? I must say that I have listened to the floor debate and talked to some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I made my case. They made their case. I just don't see why this man is not qualified. He was a law clerk for two Supreme Court He served in the Justice Department and had a distinguished career there. He was also a successful lawyer in the private sector. And of course, he has been a Federal judge for a decade. So we can look at his record.  My colleague from Georgia just talked about that record. It is why the American Bar Association--a group not known to be a conservative body--decided that he was ``well qualified.'' They unanimously declared him to get their highest rating of ``well qualified.'' This is what they said about him. They said:       Based on the writings, interviews, and analyses we      scrutinized to reach our rating, we discerned that Judge      Gorsuch believes strongly in the independence of the judicial      branch of government, and we predict that he will be a strong      but respectful voice in protecting it.  That is why the American Bar Association gave him their highest rating. Not qualified? By the way, nobody objected--nobody--for any reason, to his nomination to serve as a Federal judge, to be a circuit court judge, a level right below the Supreme Court, back in 2006. Not a single Senator objected. By the way, those Senators included Senator Hillary Clinton, Senator Barack Obama, Senator Joe Biden, and a number of Senators, of course, who are still here today with us, who chose to filibuster this nomination. So I don't know.  I heard some of my colleagues talk about some of his decisions. They have picked one or two of his decisions as judge over the past 10 years and said they didn't like the outcome, and that is why he is not qualified to sit on the Supreme I have a couple of concerns with that argument. One, Judge Gorsuch has decided over 2,700 cases. I am sure we can all find one or two of these we didn't like. That is true for any judge. As I said, I voted for a number of President Obama's nominees, and I voted against others based on the merits and based on their qualifications. It didn't mean I agreed with them--trust me--or disagreed with them on everything. The odds are very good that you agree with Judge Gorsuch's decisions a lot more than you disagree with them. You know why I say that? Because the odds are really good that you agreed with them. Let's try 97 percent, because 97 percent is the number of his decisions that were unanimous with the other judges on a three-judge panel. So 97 percent of the time, his decisions were unanimous.  Who is on these three-judge panels? Well, it is usually bipartisan in the sense that it is nominees who have been nominated by different Presidents of different parties. In the case of his circuit court, there is Judge Paul Kelly, who was appointed by President George H.There have also been several of his colleagues who were appointed by President Bill Judge Gorsuch even mentioned in his testimony that he was on judge panels. He presided with Judge William Holloway, who was appointed by President Lyndon So these three-judge panels tend to have judges that were appointed by Republicans and Democrats alike--97 percent of the time unanimous. And 98 percent of the time, his decisions were in the majority.  So again, I think the odds are pretty good that we are going to agree with Judge Gorsuch a lot more than we disagree when we look at his cases. He is a consensus builder. He is a guy who figures out how to come to a decision people agree with on different sides of the aisle, and from different points of view. That is what his record his. Actually, that doesn't surprise me at all, because he clerked in the Supreme Court for two One was Byron White and the other was Justice Anthony Those are two Justices who get a lot of heat. Byron White did, and Anthony Kennedy does--from both sides. Why? Because they tend to be in the middle. They write a lot of decisions that are consensus decisions. They tend to be that fifth vote on a 5-to-4 decision. That is whom he clerked for.  To note that somehow this guy shouldn't be confirmed for the Supreme Court because of one or two decisions just doesn't seem to be legitimate to me. This is a guy who had thousands of decisions, and the vast majority were 98 percent or 97 percent unanimous. He had one decision that was appealed to the Supreme Court because the litigants must have thought he was wrong. They took it to the Supreme Court to correct him. What happened? The Supreme Court affirmed it. They agreed with Judge  I don't know whom you could find out there among judges who has a stronger record. In every case, somebody wins and somebody loses. I get that. Think about this: Out of Judge Gorsuch's 180 written opinions, only one has ever been appealed to the Supreme Court--wow. And they agreed with his ruling.  He made it clear he makes decisions not based on the outcome he likes, but based on what the law says. He thinks his job on the court for the last decade--and going forward--is to actually look at the law and decide what the law says and what the Constitution provides, not what he wants.  I think that is the kind of judge we would want--particularly those of us who are lawmakers, right? We are the ones writing the laws. We would hope that would be respected and that judges wouldn't try to legislate. This is what he said in his testimony:       A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a      bad judge . . . I have watched my colleagues spend long days      worrying over cases. Sometimes the answers we reach aren't      ones we would personally prefer. Sometimes the answers follow      us home and keep us up at night. But the answers we reach are      always the ones we believe the law requires.  Interesting perspective. He is saying: Hey, if you like all your decisions, you are probably not a very good judge because your personal beliefs aren't always going to be consistent with what the law says or the Constitution says.  He goes on to say:       I've ruled for disabled students, for prisoners, for the      accused, for workers alleging civil rights violations, and      for undocumented immigrants. Sometimes, too, I've ruled      against such persons. My decisions have never reflected a      judgment about the people before me, only a judgment of the      law and the facts at issue in each particular case.  Again, it seems to me that is the kind of person you want on the court. Making a decision as a judge is not about ruling in favor or against somebody because you like them or don't like them. It is about applying what the law says. As he said in his testimony recently, his philosophy is ``to strive to understand what the words on the page mean . . . [to] apply what the people's representatives, the lawmakers, have done.'' That is us. That is the That is people who are elected back home by the people who expect us to be the elected representatives and to listen to their concerns and then vote. Those laws should not be rewritten by the judiciary. That is the approach he takes. I would think any legislator would want to ensure the laws we pass are applied as written. Much more importantly, that is what people want too. That is what people should insist on. We want our votes to count. We want our voices to be heard.  President Lincoln warned in his first inaugural address that if judges legislate from the bench, ``the people will have ceased to be their own rulers.''  ``The people will have ceased to be their own rulers'' if judges legislate from the bench.  I think President Lincoln was right. When judges become legislators, the people do have less of a voice. Judge Gorsuch himself summed it up. He said: ``If judges were just secret legislators, declaring not what the law is but what they would like it to be, the very idea of government by the people and for the people would be at risk.'' I think that is the deeper issue here.  Again, I think he is the kind of judge we should want. Judge Gorsuch and I had the chance to sit down and talk about this philosophy. We talked about his background and his qualifications. I asked him some very tough questions, as he got asked during the Judiciary Committee nomination process. His hearings were something that all Americans had the opportunity to watch. He did a great job, in my view, because he did focus on how he believes that his job is not to allow his personal beliefs to guide him but, rather, upholding the law as written and the Constitution.[[Page S2417]]  I think that approach is a big reason he has earned the respect of lawyers and judges from across the spectrum, by the way. If you look at the people who say this guy is a great judge, it goes all the way across the political spectrum.  Professor Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School, an advisor to former President Obama, said Judge Gorsuch is ``a brilliant, terrific guy who would do the Court's work with distinction.'' Those of you who know Laurence Tribe, he is well-regarded, considered to be a liberal thinker on many issues. But he has looked at the guy, and he has looked at his record. He knows him. He says he is brilliant, terrific, and will do the Court's work with distinction.  Neal Katyal--you have heard about him. He was the Acting Solicitor General for President Obama, a guy who knows a thing or two about arguing before the Supreme He said Judge Gorsuch's record ``should give the American people confidence that he will not compromise principle to favor the President who appointed him. . . . He's a fair and decent man.''  This goes to what the ABA said about him: He will protect the independence of the judiciary.  Look, he is smart, no question about it. You saw him answer those questions. You have seen his record. He is qualified, as we talked about. He is certainly a mainstream judge, when you look at his opinions--98 percent of the time in the majority, 97 percent of the time unanimous. Three-judge panels. He has the support--the bipartisan support--of a majority of the  By the way, the American people, as they have plugged into this, also think he ought to be confirmed. There is a recent poll by the Huffington Post, which is not considered a conservative newspaper or entity. They said the people want us to confirm Neil Gorsuch by a 17-point margin. Why? Because they watched this. They looked at the guy. They saw the hearings. They looked at his record. People believe he is the right person to represent them on the Supreme  So, again, while I am disappointed this process has become so polarized and divisive here in this body, I am glad to see this good man take a seat in our Nation's highest I believe he deserves our support.

754,CARDIN,proceeding_id,topic-id,1287,"Mr.President, this week, I introduced, along with Senators Perdue, Feinstein, Rubio, Blumenthal, Collins, Merkley, Booker, and Leahy, the Combating Global Corruption Act of 2017.  Global corruption is a fundamental obstacle to peace, prosperity, and human rights. It is fueling transnational criminal networks and violent extremism, and combatting it should be elevated and prioritized across our foreign policy efforts.  I know my colleagues understand the crucial importance of addressing corruption because it undermines public confidence in government institutions and fosters resentment and instability. There is growing recognition across the United States and around the world that corruption is a serious threat to international security and stability. The countries and names might be different, but the characteristics and the impact on innocent people are the same.  The bribery scandal surrounding the huge Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht has tarnished politicians and governments from Peru to Columbia to Rampant corruption in oil-rich Angola is depriving children of a quality education and contributing to the highest child mortality rate in the world. While progress is now being made, extensive corruption in Afghanistan resulted in billions of dollars of assistance winding up in the pockets of crooked elites.  The connections are clear: Where there are high levels of corruption, we find fragile states, political instability, and people suffering from hunger and violence.  Corruption is a global problem, but its consequences take the harshest toll at the local level, and it is very tough to fight. The problem of corruption, and the disruption and suffering it causes, involves many corrupt actors, from government officials to businessmen, from law enforcement and military personnel to street gangs. Corruption is a system that operates via extensive, entrenched networks in both the public and private sectors.  We know that corruption is the lifeblood of Vladimir Putin's Russia, and it is the glue for his regime's survival. Parasitic at home, deeply corrupt regimes like Putin's seek to enrich themselves, hollow out their own countries' institutions, and subvert rules-based democratic states abroad. An anticorruption platform run by opposition activist and aspiring, Presidential candidate Alexei Navalny recently released information uncovering four mansions, an Italian vineyard, yachts, and other high-value assets reportedly held by Prime Minister Dmitry Anticorruption demonstrations, in Moscow, Petersburg, and across the country in recent weeks reflect the ongoing resistance of the Russian people to government corruption. Hundreds were arrested. Prominent anticorruption activist Ildar Dadin, who has already spent over a year in prison for earlier protests, was among those arrested.  Corruption feeds the destructive fire of criminal networks and transnational crime. Citizens lose faith in the social compact between governments and the people. In Venezuela, we have seen how rampant corruption has collapsed the country's economy, sparked a humanitarian crisis, and produced chains of money laundering that span several continents. The ongoing crisis there now threatens to collapse the last few remnants of the rule of law.  Corruption also fuels violence by security forces. South Sudan's kleptocrats have either failed to pay or delayed salary payments to their soldiers who have in turn taken out their rage on innocent civilians, attacking them, looting and burning their homes, and engaging in other violent criminality.  We should take heart that in just the past 2 years, popular protests against corruption have broken out in Iraq, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Guatemala, Honduras, Lebanon, Malaysia, Moldova, and In Romania, efforts to weaken anticorruption laws there prompted an estimated 500,000 protesters to take to the streets last month, even after the government repealed its decree, showing the degree to which citizens are fed up with graft and determined to push back. These were the largest demonstrations since the fall of communism.  Some victims express their frustration through peaceful protest, but not all. The revolutions of the Arab Spring and Ukraine began, in part, as determined anticorruption protests.  In every country where protests erupted in 2011, demonstrators condemned the corruption of detested ruling elites and demanded accountability and the return of looted assets. These[[Page S2419]]revolutions have degenerated into some of the chief security challenges we confront now--Russian aggression in Ukraine, 6 years of slaughter in Syria, the implosion of Libya, a brutal war in Yemen, the fraying of Iraq, and an expanding insurgency in  Official corruption fuels radical extremism and terrorism, too; it gives credibility to militant religious extremists and helps them gain recruits and increasing footholds in Afghanistan and Iraq to Pakistan, Central Asia, the Sahel, and West It may seem like a spurious example, but it can be persuasive to a young Nigerian man whose sister was molested by a teacher as the cost for attending school.  Let's be clear-eye. Any fight against corruption will be long-term and difficult. It is a fight against powerful people, powerful companies, and powerful interests. It is about changing a mindset and a culture as much as it is about establishing and enforcing laws.  As my colleagues and constituents know, my attention has long been focused on fighting corruption. I introduced the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act to target human rights abusers and corrupt individuals around the globe who threaten the rule of law and deny fundamental freedoms, but the problem is so big--we simply have to do more.  This is why this week I introduced with bipartisan support the Combating Global Corruption Act of 2017 in the U. We must meet the scale of entrenched corruption with greater resolve and commitment. To do that, I believe we must focus on three things which I will lay out in my legislation.  First, we must institutionalize the fight against corruption as a national security priority. In my bill, the State Department will produce an annual report, similar to the Trafficking in Persons Report, which takes a close look at each country's efforts to combat corruption. That model, which has effectively advanced the effort to combat modern day slavery, will similarly embed the issue of corruption in our collective work, so that we hold governments to account.  The bill establishes minimum standards for combating corruption--standards that should be every government's duty to its citizens. These include whether a country has laws that recognize corrupt acts for the crimes they are--violations of the people's trust--and that come with serious penalties for breaking that trust; whether an independent judiciary decides corruption cases, free from influence and abuse; whether there is support for civil society organizations that are the watchdogs of integrity against would-be thieves of the state. This bill aims to build anticorruption DNA into the basic functions of government.  Second, the bill would improve the way we look at our own foreign and security assistance, and promote more transparency--let in some daylight. For countries that fall short on their corruption efforts, the bill calls for an assessment of the risk of corruption for our foreign assistance and steps to combat corruption, including the ability to claw back any funds diverted from their intended purpose and terminate compromised programs. American taxpayers should know how our foreign assistance is spent, and they should feel confident that we are doing the kind of risk assessments, analysis, and oversight that ensure our assistance to other countries is having the effect we want it to have.  Third, the bill consolidates information about anticorruption efforts abroad and puts it online, where citizens can see the numbers and the programs. That kind of transparency is essential to open government, but in my experience, it also has the effect of making us better at self-policing our work. We can use the data to capture redundancies and analyze trends, improving our decisionmaking.  I urge my colleagues to join me and the bipartisan cosponsors of this legislation in this effort. The success of our diplomacy, and the ultimate impact of our international security efforts depend on it.  Thank you.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-04-pt3-PgS2418-2.txt
756,CASEY,proceeding_id,topic-id,413,"Mr.President, the easiest way for workers to save the additional money they need for retirement is through work-based retirement plans. When workers have access to work-based plans, the vast majority of them choose to participate, but many Americans do not work for an employer that offers such a plan. According to AARP, 55 million private-sector workers ages 18 to 64 had no ability to save for retirement through an employer-sponsored plan in 2013. Of those workers, 2.2 million lived in Pennsylvania  In response, numerous States and multiple cities have considered programs that would give residents better access to retirement savings accounts, and multiple States have already passed laws putting such programs in place: Our Republican colleagues are trying to nullify efforts by these States and cities, rolling back their efforts to give their citizens better access to retirement savings accounts.  It is both surprising and disappointing to see this opposition mounted against a measure we should all be able to support--enhancing access to retirement savings. In undermining these programs, Republicans will be denying access to safe, low-cost retirement savings vehicles.  A recent study looking at just the city of Philadelphia found that roughly half of Philadelphia workers between the ages of 25 and 64 did not have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan at work. Further, 20 percent of Philadelphians over the age of 65 are poor, compared to 9 percent nationwide; 30 percent of Philadelphians over the age of 65 have incomes between 100 and 200 percent of poverty.  One of the most important elements of economic security for the middle class is retirement security. Millions of Americans ask, ``Will I have enough money saved to retire and retire comfortably?'' The answer to that question for too many Pennsylvanians is no. Looking at these facts, Philadelphia took action and began exploring ways to expand access to saving for our workers. Through these resolutions, Republicans will severely undermine the efforts of cities and States to expand access to retirement savings vehicles to the citizens by facilitating IRA retirement savings through private employers.  The programs States and cities are pursuing are simple, low-cost, and voluntary. Most would simply require that employers that do not currently offer a plan facilitate voluntary employee contributions to an Individual Retirement Our State and local governments are our idea incubators. Many of our States and cities, including Philadelphia, want to make it easier for workers to save for retirement. In repealing this guidance, Republicans are hindering that effort.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-04-pt3-PgS2418.txt

764,CARPER,proceeding_id,topic-id,789,"Mr.President, it is with great pleasure that I rise today, on behalf of Delaware's congressional delegation--Senator Chris Coons, Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester, and myself--to honor the exemplary service of Delaware Supreme Court Justice Randy His talent and expertise is admired by both Republicans and Democrats alike. Justice Holland was the youngest person to serve on the Delaware Supreme Court when he was appointed and confirmed by Delaware Governor Mike Castle in 1986. I had the honor of reappointing him to a second 12-year term when I was Governor of Delaware in 1999. Then, in March 2011, he was reappointed again by Governor Markell and unanimously confirmed by the Senate for an unprecedented third 12-year term. His length on the Delaware Supreme Court--30 years and the longest in history--is a result of his broad knowledge of the law and of our State and the respect and professionalism he upholds on and off the bench.  Delaware's supreme court has a reputation for handling complex disputes in a knowledgeable, reliable, and expedient way. It is no doubt that Justice Holland was an integral part of making Delaware's highest court one of the[[Page S2422]]most respected in the Nation and highly regarded internationally. Over the course of three decades, Justice Holland has written more than 700 opinions and several thousand orders and gained the reputation as an expert in Delaware's constitutional law. He has done this all with a unique sense of humility and respect for others, something that fellow judges and attorneys have and will continue to emulate. He is the embodiment of the ``Golden Rule,'' always treating others the way he would like to be treated.  It is perhaps his homegrown knowledge of Delaware and his experience as a general practitioner of the law that allowed Justice Holland to make his mark in the Supreme He grew up in Milford, DE, and went on to graduate from Swarthmore College, University of Pennsylvania Law School, and the University of Virginia Law Before joining the bench at age 39, Justice Holland was a partner at Morris, Nichols, Arsht and Tunnell in Georgetown, DE, where he was known for his ability to draw clients from all over the State on issues ranging from corporate and contract law to zoning and real estate transactions. During this time, he had the opportunity to appear before almost every judge in every court of the It was this wide breadth of knowledge that made him an excellent choice for Delaware's supreme court, even though he had no judicial experience at all.  Justice Holland's colleagues describe him as a mentor and a role model and have relied on him throughout the years for his institutional knowledge of Delaware and the court. This especially came into practice during an unprecendeted turnover in the Delaware Supreme That turnover allowed Governor Jack Markell to appoint four justices, including the chief justice, to the five-officer court. Justice Holland's help and guidance to his colleagues throughout this transitional time proved vital as they became acclimated to their new roles.  When Justice Holland was not in his role as an officer of the court, he was writing. Regarded internationally as an author and historian, Justice Holland has written, coauthored, or edited nine books including ``Delaware Supreme Court Golden Anniversary,'' ``Delaware Constitution of 1897,'' ``The First One Hundred Years,'' ``Magna Carta: Muse & Mentor,'' ``Delaware's Destiny Determined By Lewes,'' and ``Delaware Corporation Law, Selected Cases.'' He has also published several law review articles, primarily dealing with judicial ethics and legal history.  Over his three decades on the Delaware Supreme Court, Justice Holland has received numerous awards, including the 2014 American Inns of Court Powell Award for Professionalism and Ethics, 2012 First State Distinguished Service Award, and the 2011 Dwight Opperman In 2004, he was elected to be an Honorable Master of the Bench by Lincoln's Inn in He was also recognized by members of our Nation's highest court--Chief Justices William Rehnquist and John Roberts--when they appointed him as the State judge member of the Federal Judicial Conference Advisory Committee on Appellate  On behalf of Senator Coons and Congresswoman Blunt Rochester, let me express our heartfelt thanks to Justice Holland for his service to our State and judicial system.

766,GRASSLEY,proceeding_id,topic-id,310,"Mr.President, today I wish to pay tribute to fellow Iowan Judge Edward ``Nick''  Judge McManus died earlier this month at the age of 97.  He has a long and deep history in Iowa politics and judicial activities.  When I first entered the State legislature, Judge McManus was known as Lieutenant Governor He also served in the Iowa  In 1962, President John Kennedy appointed him chief judge of the Northern District of Iowa where he served for 23 years when he took senior status. His ascension to this position made him the first native-born Iowan appointed to the Federal Northern District Court of He remained on the bench for a total of 55 years and was still taking cases at the time of his death.  He was proud of his service on the court and the modernization of the court he started in 1962.  Upon Judge McManus's death, current acting U.Attorney Sean Berry told the Cedar Rapids Gazette, ``The changes implemented by Judge McManus left an indelible and positive impact on the efficient administration of justice for all litigants in the federal court.''  He took great pride that the only time he had a backlog of cases was the first 100 that were there when he took the job. He took very seriously the Bill of Rights Sixth Amendment where it says ``the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial.''  His longtime assistant, Deb Frank, may have said it best, ``I know he loved to work. He loved what he was doing. I think it's just the whole idea of coming to the office every day and doing what needed to be done.''  Barbara and I send our sincerest condolences to Judge McManus's five sons, two step-sons, other family members, and friends.  He served our State and our country with great distinction and will be missed.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-04-pt3-PgS2421.txt
769,CASEY,proceeding_id,topic-id,488,"Mr.President, I rise to pay tribute to Thomas Starzl, the pioneer in the field of organ transplantation who impacted the lives of thousands directly and indirectly. Starzl died on March 4, 2017, 1 week shy of his 91st birthday.  To say Stazrl was a remarkable surgeon, researcher, or physician does not begin to describe this man or the contributions he made. He was a visionary who created and then transformed an entire field of medicine. He performed the first liver transplant in 1963, the first heart-liver transplant in 1984, and led a team conducting a five-organ transplant in 1987. In 2007, at the age of 80, Starzl visited with me to seek research funding for the hand transplant program at the University of He never stopped envisioning what more could be done or striving to achieve it.  The late Senator Robert Kennedy once said, ``only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly.'' Starzl was not afraid to fail, and through his determination and the innovation and advances he brought forth, organ transplantation preserved human life, and the University of Pittsburgh became the busiest transplant center in the world. Knowing that the actual surgery is only one part of a successful transplantation, Starzl worked to develop immunosuppressant therapies and played a role in creating tacrolimus, which remains the most widely used immunosuppressant drug in the world. He also believed that it was his obligation to train the next generation of transplant surgeons. Today approximately 90 percent of transplant centers are headed by surgeons Starzl directly trained or by surgeons who learned from surgeons Starzl trained.  Over his decades of service, Starzl profoundly impacted many lives and families, including my own. Our family will always be grateful for the extraordinary care Starzl provided for my father, during his second term as Governor of In June of 1993, Starzl oversaw Governor Casey's exceedingly rare heart and liver double transplant surgery. My family cherished the 7 additional years we had with my father.  Among the many accolades Starzl received was being ranked 213th in the book ``1,000 Years, 1,000 People: Ranking the Men and Women Who Shaped the Millennium.'' Published in 1998, this book named the people who had the greatest impact on the world over the previous 1,000 years. Starzl's inclusion speaks to the enormous impact he had on so many lives.  Starzl's passing leaves a void, but we know the foundation he built for organ transplantation will endure through the many lives he saved, the surgeons he trained, and the high standards he set for quality of care. In the statement released by his family, it was noted that he ``was a force of nature that swept all those around him into his orbit, challenging those that surrounded him to strive to match his superhuman feats of focus, will and compassion.'' His ``superhuman feats'' will remain an inspiration for those in the medical profession and beyond.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-04-pt3-PgS2422.txt

DHS's acquisition process has long faced problems resulting in waste, delays, and under delivery of performance objectives.

According to a GAO report released today, DHS's acquisition process remains a high-risk issue, susceptible to cost overruns and schedules delays. These issues reduce buying power and force security employees to wait for new capabilities.

Mr.Speaker, I have introduced a resolution, 41, that will not only remember World War I, but also honor those veterans who served. While those brave people are no longer with us, we must never forget those who defended and protected freedom.  Many of us in Congress, as well as citizens all over this country, are relatives of World War I veterans. Many like myself had a grandparent who fought for this Many lost their relatives to this war, while many relatives returned from war forever changed. Over 116,000 were killed, over 200,000 wounded, and over 70,000 suffered the effects of inhaling chlorine gas dispelled by German military.  My grandfather was one of the 70,000, and he, like many, could not cope with the effects of gas-damaged lungs and the psychological burden of war. At the age of 34 in 1926, he committed suicide. My father, an only child, was only 13. I am not unique in this situation, as many families tragically suffered the same fate. That is why we must continue to remember and honor World War I veterans and their families.  I want to thank Colonel Charles Bowery, Jr., executive director, U.Army Center of Military History, and his staff for the many months of work organizing this national remembrance.  This week across the country, we will begin a yearlong celebration marking the 100th anniversary of World War This Friday, the North Carolina Museum of History will hold a ribbon-cutting ceremony to mark a year celebrating those who served from North My wife and I will be in attendance.  Additionally, Mr.Speaker, I would like to remind Congress that on April 10, 11, and 12, PBS will be airing a three-part series titled ``The Great Night'' at 9 p.m. eastern standard time. I think it will be a very informative television program on the history of our country, but also the history of World War  In returning to this resolution, Mr.Speaker, I again want to thank the United States Army for taking the lead in educating the American people about World War I and those who gave so much during it.

801,GUTIERREZ,proceeding_id,topic-id,871,"Mr.Speaker, if Donald Trump is going to be successful as a President--successful from his point of view; not the point of view of the American people, or history, or the rest of the world, or the point of view of people who like peace and freedom, but from his point of view--then he is going to have to rely on fear.  He got elected by creating fear about immigrants, Mexicans, and Latinos, calling us rapists and criminals. He got elected by creating fear about President Obama, the Blacks, thugs, and big cities.  He got elected by creating fear among Americans about the big, scary world out there with threats from ISIS, al-Qaida, and But for some reason, he left out things like the fear of Russia or his buddy and friend,  And if President Trump is going to enact his agenda of deportations, building a wall, and making it impossible for people to come to the United States with visas, he needs to use fear as well. For example, he feels he needs to publish a list every week of the crimes that were committed by immigrants to scare Americans into fearing our community.  And Trump needs to use fear in another very important way. He needs to scare the immigrant community.  Why?  Because he knows he doesn't have the money, the manpower, or the time to drive 11 million men, women, and children who are undocumented out of this country. He doesn't have enough jails, ICE agents, or airplanes to deport[[Page H2700]]11 million people. That is the population about as big as the State of Illinois, and such a max exodus will not be easy.  So what do they do?  They use fear. Trump has to make immigrants scared to leave their houses. Trump has to make parents scared to take their kids to school. Trump has to make doctors' offices, courthouses, police stations, and fire departments places where immigrants are afraid to go.  Trump has to make sure that undocumented immigrants who are raising children--most of whom are American citizens--in families who have lived in the U.on average for more than a dozen years, and who own homes, cars, and businesses, he has to make them so afraid that they want to leave this country.  It is a Presidency and a Presidential policy agenda that relies on fear and bullying to achieve success--or what people who surround Trump define as success, at any rate.  How do Americans respond to fear? Do we hide in our homes and isolate ourselves and run?  No, that is not what people do in the United States of America, and we never will. We stand up and we stand together and confront fear.  So on May 1, millions of Americans are going to stand up. We are going to stand together and we are going to rise up.  May 1 is an international day to recognize the contributions of working people, and it is observed as Labor Day in much of the world. This year, it will be a day to honor working people of all types, but there will be a special emphasis this year on immigrants working and living in the United  In 42 cities in 33 States, from Milwaukee to Seattle, to LA, to Chicago, to Boston, cities and towns will hold activities, marches, rallies, and workshops to lift up immigrant communities and demonstrate the solidarity between Americans and immigrants.  This is a campaign to galvanize broad support for immigrants, so this is not going to just be a Latino thing or an immigrant thing. Churches, mosques, and congregations are going to rise up. Unions, students, teachers, and working men and women are going to rise up on May 1.  Let's be clear, when we marched for women in massive numbers the day after the inauguration, it was not just women marching. When we came to the airports to stand up for American values and against Trump's Muslim ban, it was not just Muslims standing up for American values. It was a lot of the rest of us, too.  So if you care about justice, rise up with us on May 1. If you think a man should be able to use a men's bathroom, even if his birth certificate says he was born a woman, rise up with us.

However, like so many around the Nation, Carlos got involved with drugs during his time at school and even spent some time in jail. But with the strength and support of his family, he began receiving treatment, and his life improved.                              {time}  1030  He helped others by volunteering at a recovery house. He brought people suffering in similar situations into treatment programs.  In early December, Carlos walked his mother, Pamela, down the aisle for her wedding. He was getting ready to go back to school. He had a steady job, and he had a girlfriend. It would seem to so many that Carlos' battle with addiction was heading in the right direction--a needed point of hope in a war that has caused so much devastation.  Then on December 23, just 2 days before Christmas, two police detectives showed up at Pamela's door to tell her the devastating news that no mother can prepare for: Carlos had overdosed on a drug laced with fentanyl, and he was unable to be saved.  Mr.Speaker, Carlos' life and his death cast light on the fact that addiction is nothing short of a chronic disease.  I share this story with Members of this Chamber because last week Carlos' mother, Pamela, visited the White House to share her family's personal experience as the President established the Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis, a worthy effort that deserves our support.  The fact is our Nation's opioid crisis transcends politics, and so must our response. I applaud the President's executive order to investigate the roots of this epidemic and outline tangible actions we can take to fight back.  Any response to this challenge must treat the whole person, not just the addiction. We must focus on the underlying issues driving people to seek opioids, while increasing the accessibility and affordability for prevention, for education, for treatment, and for recovery of this disease.  As Pamela shared, every life is a precious life, and every life is worthy of being reclaimed. I agree. I believe everyone in this Chamber agrees as well.  Let's get to work together to support these brave families that need our help.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-05-pt1-PgH2702-2.txt

813,KHANNA,proceeding_id,topic-id,481,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to express my deep concern with the recent FCC decision that strips Charter Communications of the requirement to provide broadband in a competitive manner.  When Charter merged with Time Warner, there was a regulatory review, and the requirement was that Charter would actually provide broadband in areas that would improve competition. Just yesterday, the Chairman revoked that regulatory decision and said that Charter doesn't have to provide broadband in an area where some other competitor is providing broadband.  Now, why does this matter? Americans already pay three to four times more for access to the internet than our European counterparts, and that is absurd. We invented the internet. We built the technology that fuels the internet. We should have the cheapest prices.  So why don't we have cheaper prices? It is because four or five monopolies basically provide the internet service for everyone. You have Verizon, AT&T,  What is the solution? We need more competition.  But what is this FCC Chairman doing? He is having policies that are going to lead to less competition, basically carving up the map of this country and saying: You can only provide service here.

Mr.Speaker, we need an FCC that is going to promote competition, that is going to go after monopolies, that is going to put American citizens ahead of corporate profits. If anything, we need a country that is going to have universal broadband, universal internet access.  Just like we talk about having a universal right to health care, just like we talk about a universal right to college, we can't live in a society where everyone can't have access to the internet. The jobs of the future are going to require it, and it ought to be a bipartisan issue to have universal access to the internet at the cheapest prices, cheaper than any other country, not five or six times more expensive than other countries, given that all of the technology was developed here in the United  And one final point. Noah Smith and Heather Boushey and others have talked about what really will create the jobs of the future, and they have written about having universities and colleges spread out across this country.

We need college towns across America, and if we did that, if we expanded our universities, if we expanded research, if we expanded broadband in a competitive place, we could create the jobs of the future all across this great country.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-05-pt1-PgH2702.txt

After hearing veterans tell horror story after horror story of long wait times, canceled appointments, and having to travel miles to distant cities to get treatment, Congress got something right when they passed the Veterans Choice and Accountability Act in 2014.  It created the Veterans Choice Program that allows any veteran who is unable to obtain an appointment with the VA within 30 days or has to travel more than 40 miles to a VA facility for care to see a private doctor who can see them faster and closer to home.  Though the implementation of the Veterans Choice Program has not been without hiccups, it is proving very helpful for getting veterans faster, more quality care.  I hear time and again from veterans in the district that I represent that this is working for them.  Soon, in fact later today, the House will vote on H.369, to eliminate the sunset of the Veterans Choice Program and ensure the program continues after August 7.

857,BUCK,proceeding_id,topic-id,3530,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation. H.1219, the Supporting America's Innovators Act of 2017, will allow America's small businesses to thrive, creating jobs, developing incredible products and services, and growing our Nation's economy.  Starting a business, designing a product, developing a service, these projects often require upfront capital. For entrepreneurs and startups in this country, access to capital is one of the biggest hurdles they will face. Without it, they may not have the cash on hand for research and development, the funds to make payroll at the end of the month, or the raw material needed to start production.  Mr.Speaker, H.1219 seeks to provide more sources of funding for our small businesses by raising the cap that requires a group of investors to register as an investment company. This change in the law is important. It allows angel funds, which are basically a pool of accredited investors, to permit up to 250 investors in one fund as opposed to the 100 permitted by current law.  As long as the fund does not exceed $10 million in capital commitments, it would be considered a qualified venture capital fund that is exempt from costly registration with the  Angel funds allow individuals who may not otherwise invest in startups to join together and direct their investment dollars to promising young companies. Without raising the cap on the size of these funds, we may be pushing potential investors out of the market.  Small businesses, in their earliest stages, often have nowhere to turn for credit. While banks have historically been a source of funds, in recent years, small business loans from banks have declined. That is where these groups of individual investors come in. In many cases, they are providing just enough cash to push businesses off the ground to the next level of funding; but by overregulating groups of angel investors, we are blocking significant sources of capital from ever reaching startups.  We need to wisely regulate in this country, and this legislation doesn't eliminate the need for larger investment funds to register with the It simply raises the cap for smaller groups of individuals to contribute a limited amount of funds to the American small business community. For businesses on the receiving end, these funds may be the difference between success and bankruptcy.  Thankfully, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act has already raised the cap requiring companies to register with the SEC from 500 investors to 2,000 investors. By allowing small companies[[Page H2709]]to seek more individual investors, these businesses can expand the number of individuals who have a stake in the company's future, the number of individuals who will ensure the venture succeeds.  H.1219 is a natural complement to the JOBS Act, allowing those potential investors to more easily join their resources to efficiently and successfully invest in America's small businesses. In fact, the current limit on the number of investors who can join together, set by the Investment Company Act of 1940, is a relic from nearly 80 years ago. In the past 80 years, our financial market and our economy have drastically changed. The barriers to entry for small businesses in many industries are lower than ever.  Just yesterday, I spent time with Etash Etash is a young man from my district who won the Congressional App Already, in high school, he takes computer science classes and codes smartphone apps. He even started a club to teach others programming.  He and students like him have many of the skills needed to start a small business. They have the ability to create software programs that consumers want and need. They may start small, they may start in high school, but they hold great potential.  Many individual investors may see that potential. This bill allows those investors to make a down payment on the future of these young entrepreneurs. Without growing the sources and amount of capital available to these businesses, we will end up stifling the innovation and entrepreneurial spirit that our country is known for.  Our Nation is successful because Americans are innovators and hard workers. Those Americans who start businesses embody this spirit. We are not here asking for the government to help these people succeed. No, these individuals are fully capable of building businesses on their own. But we are here asking the government to step out of the way so that our fellow citizens can help American small businesses succeed.  This rule and the underlying legislation should not be controversial. Last Congress, similar legislation passed the Financial Services Committee by a vote of 57-2. It then passed the House by a vote of 388-9.  Yesterday, I came to the House floor and spoke about the importance of passing bipartisan bills. Many Americans see their Capital awash in partisanship and bickering. They suffer under poorly crafted policies, while politicians in D.fail to find consensus on legislation that would help. They wonder why politicians who talk about bipartisanship on the campaign trail can't come together in Washington to pass commonsense legislation.  The challenge before us is to find solutions to our Nation's problems that overlap the principles held by both parties. That is why this bill is refreshing. It stands as an exemplar of the sort of consensus-driven legislation that can earn America's trust.  Everyone can agree that innovative companies help the American economy grow and add to the quality of life in our Everyone recognizes how important access to capital is for small businesses.  This bill was reported out of the Financial Services Committee with overwhelming support. I ask now that the entire House support the rule and this underlying legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  (Mr.McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, this is the 28th closed rule we are considering in Let me repeat that. This is the 28th closed rule that we are considering in this That means that 64 percent of the rules that the Republican leadership has brought to the floor this year have been completely closed, with no opportunity for Democrats or Republicans to offer their ideas to expand upon or improve the legislation.  Under a closed rule, you can't even offer an amendment to fix a typo. If somebody is in their office listening to the debate on this bill and has an idea on how to improve it, they are denied that opportunity to offer any amendments on the floor--in short, no amendments.  Mr.Speaker, this place is called the people's Maybe it should be called the Russia House because this is the way they legislate in Russia, completely closed, no opportunity for different ideas to be brought before the Congress and debated.  I have never, in all my years in Congress, experienced a more authoritarian approach to legislating than I have in this I have never encountered a more closed Congress than this Congress is.  This is not right, and it should not be considered normal. Not only Democrats should be outraged, but Republicans ought to be outraged as well.  You know, I wish my Republican friends had learned something from the collapse of their healthcare bill a few weeks ago. They rushed to the floor a bill cobbled together in the dark of night, filled with bribes and backroom deals. In fact, to strong-arm Members into voting for the bill and to correct for all the technical drafting errors that occurred thanks to their secretive process, there were not one, not two, not even three, but five--that is right, five--separate manager's amendments filed with the Rules  Now, let me explain that.  Only the people who wrote the bill were allowed to amend it. They wrote it so quickly, so sloppily, that they had to amend their amendments. I mean, this would be laughable if it weren't so tragic. And even after all of that, they were not able to piece together votes within their own Conference, and the bill imploded.  Well, it was a mess from beginning to end; and, to put it bluntly, the process was a disaster. Don't take it from me. Listen to Sean Hannity of FOX Now, don't adjust your television set. I am actually going to quote FOX News--and Sean Hannity, at that. I can't believe that he and I agree on something.  Here is what he said. According to a CNN report, he said: ``Now, this legislation was flawed from the beginning. It was created behind closed doors. Not one single Member saw the bill until it was rolled out. And that made it a disaster.''  That is Sean Hannity, one of President Trump's biggest cheerleaders, one of the biggest cheerleaders of my Republican friends. Here he is trashing the Republican health bill. And if that is not a wake-up call for Republicans, I don't know what is. You know, if Republicans are being criticized on their process by Sean Hannity, they have a serious problem.  Now we are reading that Republicans are again huddling in back rooms in the Capitol in an effort to resurrect their terrible plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act, strip important protections away from our constituents, and put insurance companies in charge of our health care. There it is on the front page of today's Washington Post: ``GOP Presses for New Health Plan.''  Now, I haven't been invited to any of these secret backroom negotiations, but from what we are hearing, it isn't good. It seems that things are not looking good for hospitals. MassDevice alerted us to the fact that: ``Hospital Stocks Fall as GOP Looks to Revive TrumpCare Bill.''  It appears as though Republicans are still working to make their bill even more devastating. Mother Jones reported: ``TrumpCare 2.0 Still Isn't Cruel Enough to Satisfy Conservatives.''  Yesterday, Tribune Media Wire wrote about: ``How the Revised TrumpCare Plan Could Hit Americans with Preexisting Conditions.''  I include in the Congressional Record, Mr.Speaker, an article that appears in today's New York Times about how the latest health proposal weakens coverage for preexisting conditions.                [From the New York Times, 4, 2017] Republican Health Proposal Would Undermine Coverage for Pre-Existing                                Conditions                        (By Margot Sanger-Katz)       Throughout the debate to repeal and replace the Affordable      Care Act, President Trump and Republican congressional      leaders have insisted they would retain a crucial, popular      part of the health law: the promise that people can buy      insurance even if they've had illnesses in the past.[[Page H2710]]       Their efforts foundered last month, when a House health      bill had to be pulled from the floor after it failed to      attract enough support. Late Monday night, word emerged that      the White House and the group of conservative lawmakers known      as the Freedom Caucus had discussed a proposal to revive the      bill. But the proposed changes would effectively cast the      Affordable Care Act's pre-existing conditions provision      aside.       The terms, described by Representative Mark Meadows,      Republican of North Carolina and the head of the Freedom      Caucus, are something like this: States would have the option      to jettison two major parts of the Affordable Care Act's      insurance regulations. They could decide to opt out of      provisions that require insurers to cover a standard, minimum      package of benefits, known as the essential health benefits.      And they could decide to do away with a rule that requires      insurance companies to charge the same price to everyone who      is the same age, a provision called community rating.       The proposal is not final, but Mr.Meadows told reporters      after the meeting that his members would be interested in      such a bill. To pass the House, any bill would need to find      favor not just with the Freedom Caucus, but also with more      moderate It would also need to attract the      support of nearly every Republican in the Senate to become      law.       The ability to opt out of the benefit requirements could      substantially reduce the value of insurance on the market. A      patient with cancer might, for example, still be allowed to      buy a plan, but it wouldn't do her much good if that plan was      not required to cover chemotherapy drugs.       The second opt-out would make the insurance options for      those with pre-existing conditions even more meaningless.       Technically, the deal would still prevent insurers from      denying coverage to people with a history of illness. But      without community rating, health plans would be free to      charge those patients as much as they wanted. If both of the      Obamacare provisions went away, the hypothetical cancer      patient might be able to buy only a plan, without      chemotherapy coverage, that costs many times more than a      similar plan costs a healthy customer. Only cancer patients      with extraordinary financial resources and little interest in      the fine print would sign up.       There is a reason that many conservatives want to do away      with these provisions. Because they help people with      substantial health care needs buy relatively affordable      coverage, they drive up the price of insurance for people who      are healthy. An insurance market that did not include cancer      care--or even any cancer patients--would be one where      premiums for the remaining customers were much lower. The      result might be a market that is much more affordable for      people with a clean bill of health. But it would become      largely inaccessible to anyone who really needs help paying      for medical care.       We do not have to speculate to know what the world looks      like without essential health benefits and community rating.      It was how most state insurance markets worked before      Back in 2009, most sick people who did not get      insurance through work or a government program were excluded      from coverage if they had a history of health problems like      allergies or arthritis. Plans that did not cover pregnancy      care or drug addiction treatment were widespread. (The data      about individual market insurance premiums is a little      spotty, but it appears that they were substantially lower in      most states.)       One idea Republicans have about how to care for the sick      was also in effect pre-Many states had ``high-risk      pools,'' where people shut out of the traditional insurance      markets could buy special plans with the help of state      subsidies. The Freedom Caucus proposal is likely to include      some money that states could use to set up such pools.       ``The fundamental idea is that marginally sick people would      pay with risk associated with their coverage,'' Mr.Meadows      said ``Those that have, you know, premiums that would      be driven up because of catastrophic illness or long-term      illnesses, we've been dealing with that for a long time with      high-risk pools.''       But insurance in the old high-risk pools tended to be      expensive, and often came with long waiting periods or      benefit limitations, even for the very sick.       The main difference between the policy environment in 2009      and today is that the federal government would now be      offering tax credits to help healthy people buy what would      probably be relatively skimpy plans. That would mean that      more middle-income Americans would probably have health      coverage than before the Affordable Care Act, since the      combination of policies would tend to make insurance much      more affordable for people who are young and healthy.       What states would choose to do with this set of options is      hard to predict. Before Obamacare, few states required      community rating of health plans. And few states required      insurers to cover all of the benefits deemed essential under      Obamacare, though most did require a few types of treatments      to be covered. State governments would face a difficult      choice: either take away the requirements, and leave sick      patients without insurance options, or keep them and see      people unable to afford coverage under the new subsidy      system.       Under Obamacare, states can already waive many of the law's      insurance rules if they can show that an alternative program      would cover as many people with comprehensive coverage at a      lower cost to the government. But that standard is difficult      to meet. Mr.Meadows suggested that the waivers under      discussion should be ``very easily granted'' to states.       The politics of health care in the United States have      shifted since the Affordable Care Act was passed seven years      ago. In recent months, the law has grown more popular, and      the pre-existing conditions policy is among its best-known      protections. That could create political pressure for states      to keep the insurance rules, even if they are not required by      law. But it is likely that at least some states might decide      to eliminate them if they are made optional. Shifting norms      about health insurance regulation may also affect the idea's      reception in       Mr.Meadows said that the proposal presented to the Freedom      Caucus would retain the pre-existing conditions policy. But      that would be true in only the most literal sense. The mix of      policies could allow insurance companies to charge sick      people prices that few of them could pay. And it could allow      them to exclude benefits that many healthy people need when      they get sick. The result could be a world where people with      pre-existing conditions would struggle to buy comprehensive      health insurance--just like before       Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I mean, preexisting conditions. Oh, my What are my friends thinking about?  And we are reading that essential health benefits are still on the chopping block.  You know, these are some of the main provisions of the ACA that people like, that people need, and that people deserve.  Protecting essential health benefits in people with preexisting conditions is our moral obligation. Taking these protections away from people would be cruel and unjust and immoral. I would say to my Republican friends: You don't have to do it.  But I guess we will have to wait and see until these secret negotiators emerge from their back rooms with details to share. And I will start getting ready for the next emergency Rules I am looking forward to that meeting because that will probably be the only time we will have to talk about the bill because I think it is probably too much to expect that my Republican friends would actually, this time around, hold a hearing. Maybe they will bypass a markup, but they will have to go to the Rules Committee in an emergency meeting, and we will probably look forward to another martial law rule.  But we are doing this bill today that no one has ever heard of. It was a noncontroversial suspension bill last year, but now we lift it up like it is the most important piece of business that we are facing in America today. You know, what about the urgent priorities facing our country?  I think it is clear that Speaker Ryan and the majority leader are grasping for filler legislation to keep us busy on the House floor so that the American people really don't see really how dysfunctional this majority really is.  Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, a Member of the Republican Conference, said, and I think he said it best last week when he said: ``It's pretty evident that we don't have the votes among Republicans to do, in essence, anything that's real.''  Maybe that is why we are wasting our time this week on these bills instead of moving an infrastructure package or finishing the FY17 appropriations process, which should have been finalized last year.  I will remind my Republican colleagues that our government runs out of funding on April 28. That is 5 legislative days from now, since we are going on break at the end of this week. Now, maybe, again, this is a radical idea, but maybe we should be dealing with that today.  I am beginning to give up hope for regular order in the appropriations process under the Republican leadership, but I would have thought we would at least have some insight about a funding bill by now. Again, 5 legislative days from now, the government potentially could be shut down.  Maybe some of you think that the underlying legislation that this rule would allow us to consider, a bill to increase the number of companies that are exempted from certain SEC regulations, is vitally important. Maybe you are being inundated with calls about this issue. I don't know. Maybe your townhalls are overflowing with people[[Page H2711]]demanding this SEC suspension bill, but I am certain that no Member of this body could say with a straight face that this is somehow more important than keeping the entire Federal Government open.  For the life of me, I don't understand why we always have to get right up to the edge of the cliff, but here we are again. Today is just the latest example that the priorities of this Republican leadership do not serve the American people.  I would urge my colleagues to think about this as we spend time in our districts over the next 2 weeks. Maybe, when we get back, Congress can actually do its job and fund the government and focus on things that are important like a jobs bill or an infrastructure bill instead of more of the same Republican messaging bills.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1245  ",CREC-2017-04-05-pt1-PgH2708-3.txt

But I do want to lay out, as one of the senior members of the committee, what has happened in Financial Services when we have dealt with this.  Last Congress, this exact bill passed 52-2 in the committee, with the ranking member supporting the bill. There were no dissenting minority views that were offered. And now, with this particular piece of legislation, H.1219, there were no amendments even offered at the Rules  So which is it? My friends across the aisle complain when we don't do regular order. They complain if this had gone on suspension. I am kind of reminded of Groucho Marx in his movie, ``Horse Feathers.'' Whatever that is, I am against it. That seems to be their attitude.  But I do look forward to working with my colleagues across the aisle to make sure that they join me in supporting government funding when we are going to be dealing with that here shortly.  So on to our bill here, H.1219, unless the opposition, the other side of the aisle, would like to continue to talk about a lot of nongermane things; I will keep bringing up Susan Rice and her illegally unmasking people if they would like to do that. We can continue with that conversation.  I would prefer to talk about H.1219. So we know that small businesses and entrepreneurs are the heartbeat of the American economy, and access to financial capital is vital for entrepreneurs seeking startup money, or to operate, or to expand their businesses. However, gaining access to capital has remained an enduring challenge for small businesses.  The financial crisis and the Great Recession made the situation worse as capital became increasingly hard to access from institutional banks and various capital players. And while conditions have improved somewhat in the recent years, many entrepreneurs continue to struggle with accessing the capital that they need to compete and to grow.  In order to succeed, these companies need capital and credit, which is the lifeblood for growth, expansion, and job creation. Yet the government continues to construct arbitrary walls that cut them off from essential financing as smaller companies are caught in a sea of regulatory red tape created by Washington bureaucrats oftentimes.  As we had a similar bill yesterday, I made the point at that time as well. We know that 60 percent of all net new jobs that have been created here in the United States, 60 percent of all net new jobs that have been created here over the last 2 decades, have come from these small businesses.  Congress has made strides in tailoring the regulatory environment for these smaller companies--most notably when we passed, with strong bipartisan support, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, in 2012. That was a bipartisan bill that was signed by President  The JOBS Act's benefits are notable as more and more companies use its provisions to raise investment capital in both the public and the private markets. And the JOBS Act raised the cap on investors in a privately held company from 500 to 2,000 investors, but the limit on the number of investors acting as a coordinated group to invest in a company remained at 100, where it has been since 1940, some 77 years ago. I think it is about time that we update that.  As noted by Kevin Laws, of AngelList in his written testimony before the Capital Markets Subcommittee: ``With online fundraising and general solicitation becoming more common because of the JOBS Act, companies are bumping up against the limit more frequently. The current limit . . . now acts as a brake on the amount of money the company wanted to raise, leaving tens of millions of dollars on the table that did not go into startups.''  Well, H.1219, the Supporting America's Innovators Act, a bipartisan bill introduced by Representatives Patrick McHenry and Nydia Velazquez, would amend the cap currently contained in the Investment Company Act to allow 250 investors, instead of that 100, for a qualified venture capital fund, and, therefore, enhance angel investors' ability to provide important funding to our small businesses.  This bill is a very modest increase to the current exemption which has been in place for nearly 77 years, since 1940. Modernizing the cap is long overdue and reflects today's capital markets realities and the increasingly important role that angel investors play as they commit the funds necessary to help these small businesses grow.  The Securities and Exchange Commission continues to ignore the backlog of good ideas to spur capital formation recommended by entrepreneurs, small businesses, and market participants at the SEC's annual government-business forum on capital formation. So in the SEC's absence, Congress must act to promote market efficiency and capital formation. That is what we are here to do today, and I do think that that is an extremely important thing for us to do here in  I think that we can all agree that we support smart regulation that protects investors and maintains orderly and efficient markets.

Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I am glad the gentleman from Michigan believes that closed rules are regular order--maybe in Russia, but that is not supposed to be the norm here in the people's We have an obligation to actually debate serious bills.  Right now, my Republican friends are behind closed doors somewhere in the Capitol debating healthcare legislation. And what I am against is this whole process. This is backwards. My Republican friends ought to be out in the open debating health care. They ought to be doing hearings. This is what I am objecting to.  In the scheme of things, this is a relatively minor piece of legislation, compared to my Republican friends' plans to repeal the Affordable Care  Yes, we should be debating Russia and all the ties that the Trump administration has with The question[[Page H2712]]used to be: Who in the administration has ties with Russia? Now the question is: Who in this administration doesn't have ties with Russia? Yes, those are important things we ought to be talking about. But, come on.  What we are objecting to is you bringing filler to the floor while, in secret, you are trying to dismantle health care in a way that we believe will harm millions and millions of Americans; that will take away their protections, those who have preexisting conditions; that will throw millions of people off of their insurance; that will take away essential health benefits. Yeah, that is important to us, and it is important to the American people.  What we are objecting to is a process where you debate these issues in secret and you bring stuff like this to the floor.  Mr.Speaker, this week, President Trump signed a bill to allow internet service providers to sell their customers' sensitive information. This information includes location, financial and health data, information about customers' children, Social Security numbers, web browsing history, app usage history, and the content of their customers' communications, such as emails and video chats.  Yet, amazingly, President Trump's tax return information is still off limits to the American people. Every President since Gerald Ford has disclosed his tax return information. These returns have provided a basic level of transparency that has helped to ensure the public's interest is placed first.  So the message from President Trump and the Republican Party is clear: It is okay for companies to profit off your medical and financial information, or information contained in your private emails, but the American voter is not allowed to know if the President has any conflicts of interest. That is right. Donald Trump's privacy matters, but your privacy doesn't.  Internet companies can auction off your private, personal information to the highest bidder. But information related to Donald Trump's business life must be kept secret.  Mr.Speaker, the American people deserve better, and it is incumbent upon us, as the people's elected Representatives, to hold the executive branch accountable.  So I am going to ask people to vote ``no'' on the previous question. And if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative Eshoo's bill, which will require Presidents and major party nominees for the Presidency to release their tax returns.  Mr.Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts?  There was no objection.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, this is a big deal.

It is time to let a little light shine on the President's tax returns so the American people know what his dealings have been and know what, quite frankly, they have been able to know about every other President and every other major party nominee.

863,ESHOO,proceeding_id,topic-id,644,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for yielding the time to me.  While I support the underlying bill, I want to urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so that this bipartisan legislation, the Presidential Tax Transparency Act, can be made in order for consideration and a vote.  The legislation is very simple. It is not pages and pages and pages. It simply states that there will be a requirement that the President of the United States, all future Presidents, and Presidential nominees of the major parties publicly disclose their tax returns. For decades, Republican and Democratic Presidents and Republican and Democratic candidates of both parties have voluntarily disclosed this information, but not this  Now, this tradition began in 1973, with President Richard Nixon who, while under audit by the IRS, publicly released his tax returns and submitted them for review by Congress because there was a mini scandal at that time regarding his claims of charitable giving. He released his tax returns and, shortly after, gave what became a famous speech: ``People have got to know whether or not their President is a crook. Well, I am not a crook.''  The Joint Committee on Taxation, at that time, ultimately found numerous errors in the President's return, and that he owed about a half a million dollars in back taxes, and he paid them.  Now, since then, every President has voluntarily released their tax returns. But this tradition is now being tested by a President who continues to hide his finances and faces an unprecedented number of potential conflicts of interest relating to his business empire.  Now, through his financial disclosure forms, we know that he has some 564 businesses around the world and inside the United This is a legitimate question being posed by the American people, and that is: If we don't know, whose interest is he operating under? Who is he there for?  Is he making decisions relative to trade that will benefit his business? We don't know. Why? Because a tax return is highly instructive. Tax returns disclose to whom you owe debt, what the debt is, where your businesses are, whether they are in the United States or in a foreign country, whether you have made charitable donations, whether you have paid taxes, whether you have avoided taxes, whether you have used loopholes, whether you have dollars in offshore areas. So this is an essential.  I want my Republican friends to think of something. This is not a partisan issue. This should concern you just as much as it concerns your constituents. The American people across the country, 74 percent, say that his tax returns should be disclosed.                              {time}  1300  We are now moving into an area of questions about national security.  Who is the President doing business with?  Whose interests come first? Is it the national security of the United States of America by the Commander in Chief, or is it for some Trump business?  These are very serious questions that you should want answered.  In a democracy--in a democracy--transparency is essential. They go hand in hand. We are not a banana republic. We don't have people in charge of the government that stand above the law or just disregard it.  In this case, it is not the law. It is a beautiful tradition that patriots on the Republican side and the Democratic side honored. Why did they honor it? I think they honored it because they wanted to honor the American people. That is what this effort is about.  Now, it is important to note that the President wasn't always opposed to this important transparency. As far back as 2011, he said that he would release his tax returns if he ran for  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.

In 2016, he said repeatedly that he would release his returns ``over the next few months'' and ``before the election.'' It hasn't happened yet.  So all of these issues should concern all Members of Congress because, as I said a moment ago, transparency is essential in a democracy.

This is a bipartisan piece of legislation that has seen productive debate and almost no opposition when it was considered by the House Financial Services The House considered a very similar bill last July that received 388 votes here in the House in support.  Congressman Patrick McHenry has been steadfast in his dedication to finding opportunities to update our securities laws so we can harness the true power of our capital markets. In recent memory, this started with the JOBS Act, which was very bipartisan and has been crucial to reinvigorating our capital markets. However, there is still more we can do.  The Supporting America's Innovators Act of 2017 increases the limit on the number of individuals who can invest in certain venture capital funds before those funds must register with the SEC as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Currently, the act limits the number of investors in an investment company fund to 100 if the fund is to be exempt from registration with the This registration is an extremely costly regulatory requirement that is not always appropriate.  The Chamber of Commerce describes this as a fix to what has come to be known as the ``99 investor problem,'' that is, the requirement that certain venture capital funds register with the SEC once they reach their 100th investor. Increasing this low threshold, originally set in the 1940s, would allow venture capital to continue to play the important role in the economy that it has in the past.  Unless Congress updates this threshold, startups, the driver of job creation and economic growth in our districts, will continue to be choked off from what should be easily accessible and affordable capital.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and to support this bipartisan legislation.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I just want to be clear so that my good friend from Colorado understands where I am coming from.  I don't really care about this bill. I think it is a noncontroversial bill that, quite frankly, probably could be approved by voice vote if it were brought up that way.  The point I am trying to make is that this is a relatively minor bill compared to some of the important issues that we need to deal with. It is troublesome to me that, on this bill, which my friend from Colorado said involved years of hearings and where the sponsor of the bill consulted with Democratic colleagues--I favor all of that. But what I am really outraged about is that, while we are talking about this relatively inconsequential bill and about how wonderful this process around this bill is, there are meetings going on in secret, right now, with my Republican colleagues, on dismantling health care in this country, conversations that might result in tens of millions of Americans losing their health insurance, conversations involving taking away essential benefits from insurance packages, conversations that would basically remove protections for people who have preexisting conditions.  All of this is going on in secret. We are reading about it in the press. I am sure my colleagues know about it because they are reading about it. Maybe they are proud of these secret meetings. I want to know where these secret meetings are.  I am simply saying to my friends on the other side of the aisle, on something as big as health care, you ought to be having these meetings out in the open. There ought to be hearings. You ought to bring in patients and patient advocate groups. You ought to bring in doctors, nurses, and heads of hospitals. You ought to bring in people who are going to be affected by any kind of changes you make in our healthcare policy.  Instead, it is being done behind closed doors, in secret, and I think the American people are outraged by that. That is one of the reasons why the bill you brought to the floor recently only had 17 percent support amongst the American people.  So what we are objecting to is the fact that we are not bringing to the floor matters that are urgent, like keeping the government running and like an infrastructure bill. We are also objecting to the fact that we are reading that my Republican friends are, once again, behind closed doors negotiating another healthcare bill that we think will do great damage to the health care of a lot of people in this country.

867,BUCK,proceeding_id,topic-id,933,"Mr.Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time, and I will close for our side.  Mr.Speaker, I want to alert my Republican colleagues to some recent polls that came out today. There is a poll that Qinnipiac did that said that Trump is more unpopular than Obama ever was, and, today, President Trump's approval rating is at 35 percent. That is down from 37 percent, and that is the lowest, I think, of any President this early on in his I think the lowest rating ever was President George It was at 28 percent, but it took 8 years, two unpopular wars, and a staggering economy to get to that point. But with President Trump, we are already at 35 percent. The Gallup Poll says his approval is at 39 percent.  By the way, the Affordable Care Act, according to Kaiser, now polls at 55 percent approval rating, and the Republican Congress is about as low as President Trump is right now.  I am trying to think of the words to help my colleagues understand what these polls mean. I guess ``not good'' comes to mind, or ``very, very bad.'' I don't think, even if you tried, you could get poll numbers so low so early on in a new Congress or so early on in a new administration.  I would say to my friends the reason for this unpopularity is the way you are conducting business in our government, that the closed processes that are being used with regard to legislation I think are unprecedented. There has never been a more closed Congress than this one. You were pretty closed last session as well. This is a terrible pattern.  I agree with my friend, Mr.Buck, on one thing he said. The gentleman said yesterday that good process produces good policy, but perhaps equally as important, good process helps instill faith in this institution. I agree with that. I could have said those remarks here today.  My question is: If that is the case, why are my Republican friends tolerating a process on healthcare reform that is now going on that is being done behind closed doors in some back room somewhere in this building with no input from patients or patient advocate groups or doctors or nurses or hospitals or anybody who has anything to do with health care? Why, on something so important, is the process so closed and so restrictive and so secretive?  I will tell you, just as this closed process led to a disastrous Republican healthcare bill recently, this continued closed process will lead to more disaster. This is not the way we should be doing the people's business. So we[[Page H2714]]strongly object to the way the Republicans are running this House and, in fact, the way the President is handling this issue as well.  It is always nice to see Vice President Pence in the hallway when he is walking back and forth, but it would be better to see him in a public setting talking about what the administration's priorities are, not rushing from one back room to another back room to another back room trying to make secret deals to get more people to vote for something when they have no idea what is in the legislation. That is not the way of doing business. So we object to the process.  Again, I urge my colleagues to also vote ``no'' on the previous question so we can have an opportunity to see President Trump's tax returns. Every President since Gerald Ford has disclosed their tax returns, every major Presidential candidate, and every day we read in the newspaper about more and more potential conflicts of interest between the President and his family. I have to tell you, we are on a collision course with corruption. The President has promised to drain the swamp. He has created a cesspool, and it should be of concern to every single person in this Chamber, Democrat and Republican alike.  I don't think it is too much to ask for transparency when it comes to the person who is our Commander in I shudder to think if Hillary Clinton had won the Presidency and didn't release her tax returns, the outrage that would be coming from the other side of the aisle. I can't even imagine how much outrage would be coming from them.  Yet when Donald Trump hides his financial information from Congress and the American people, there is silence; people don't want to know. Well, the majority of people do. Poll after poll show the overwhelming majority of Americans want to know what is in his tax returns.  Why is this such a state secret? Why can't people see what they want to see and what they have been given with every other President?  So this is an opportunity to put this issue behind us, and if there is nothing controversial in his taxes, well, then this issue goes away and we can talk about something else. But maybe there is something he is hiding. Maybe there is something that we should be concerned about. Maybe there are conflicts of interest that might be constitutionally questionable. Maybe there are ties to Russia that would cause my colleagues on the other side of the aisle more concern.  This idea of hiding this has to stop. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question and vote ``no'' on the underlying rule.

Mr.Speaker, I appreciate my friend from Massachusetts quoting me yesterday, and I would love to just emphasize a few of the words that he said a moment ago: I also shudder to think if Hillary Clinton won the  My friend was kind enough to focus his half hour on H.1219, Supporting America's Innovators Act of 2017. It is, in fact, a great piece of legislation, and I am proud to close now on that bill.  We have the opportunity today to improve access to capital for America's entrepreneurs and startups. The men and women who start companies in this Nation put everything on the line. They give of their time and their financial resources. They give of their weekends and evenings and vacations.  Our economy relies on the small businesses that these men and women create. Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy. They provide jobs and important products and services. They contribute to the life of their communities.  If we want to grow our economy, if we want to increase hiring, if we want to improve our quality of life, then we need to unleash America's entrepreneurs and startups. That is why we need to support this bill.  We must expand access to credit for small-business owners. We need to make it easier for angel investors to take a risk on young companies. We are not asking the American taxpayer to take a risk or spend any money on this. We are simply asking the Federal Government to allow angel investors to join together in larger groups to invest in promising young American companies.  I am encouraged that this bill represents a bipartisan effort to make small-business owners in this country more rewarding. When the cost of starting a small business is outweighed by the reward, our country will benefit from the resulting innovation and job creation. We simply need to give entrepreneurs the tools they need to succeed, and one of those tools is access to capital.  America's entrepreneurs and startups need H.1219. Americans who want to work for small businesses need H.1219. Americans who want to buy great products, access incredible services, and visit amazing websites all need H.1219.  I thank Chief Deputy Whip McHenry for introducing this important bill, and I thank Chairman Hensarling for bringing this legislation before us. I also thank Representative Velazquez, Representative Hollingsworth, Representative Sherman, and Representative Gottheimer for cosponsoring this legislation.  I ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the rule and vote ``yes'' on the bill.  The material previously referred to by Mr.McGovern is as follows:          An Amendment to 242 Offered by Mr.McGovern       At the end of the resolution, add the following new      sections:       6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the      Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare      the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on      the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.     305) to amend the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to require      the disclosure of certain tax returns by Presidents and      certain candidates for the office of the President, and for      other purposes. All points of order against consideration of      the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the      bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided among and      controlled by the respective chairs and ranking minority      members of the Committees on Ways and Means and Oversight and      Government After general debate the bill shall be      considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All      points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At      the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the      Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with      such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous      question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and      amendments thereto to final passage without intervening      motion except one motion to recommit with or without      instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports      that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the      next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the      third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,      resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further      consideration of the bill.       7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.305.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend[[Page H2715]]     the rule because the majority Member controlling the time      will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the      same result may be achieved by voting down the previous      question on the rule. . . . When the motion for the previous      question is defeated, control of the time passes to the      Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous      question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may      offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of      amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

874,GOODLATTE,proceeding_id,topic-id,608,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  In 2008, our economy suffered one of the most significant financial crises in history. In the midst of the crisis and in response to a fear that some financial firms' failures could cause severe harm to the overall economy, the Federal Government provided extraordinary taxpayer-funded assistance in order to prevent certain financial firms' failures.  In the ensuing years, experts from the financial, regulatory, legal, and academic communities have examined how best to prevent another similar crisis from occurring and to eliminate the possibility of using taxpayer moneys to bail out failing firms.  The Judiciary Committee has advanced the review of this issue with the aim of crafting a solution that will better equip our bankruptcy laws to resolve failing firms, while also encouraging greater private counterparty diligence in order to reduce the likelihood of another financial crisis.  Among others things, this effort responded to provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that called for an examination of how to improve the Bankruptcy Code in this area.  During the past two Congresses, the Judiciary Committee favorably reported the Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act, legislation that improved the Bankruptcy Code to better facilitate the resolution of financial firms.  That legislation was the culmination of a bipartisan process that solicited and incorporated the views of a wide range of leading experts and relevant regulators. In both instances, the bill passed the House by a voice vote under suspension of the rules.  This Congress, Chairman Marino of the Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law introduced the Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act as H.1667. Following its introduction, the Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law conducted a hearing on the bill. H.1667 is identical to previous legislation, with one minor change to refine the director liability protection provision. Last week, the Judiciary Committee approved the legislation by a unanimous voice vote.  The bill before us today is the product of a careful, deliberate, and thorough process, and reflects a diverse range of views from a variety of interested parties.  The Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act makes several improvements to the Bankruptcy Code in order to enhance the prospect of an efficient resolution of a financial firm through the bankruptcy process.  The bill allows for a speedy transfer of the operating assets of a financial firm over the course of a weekend. This quick transfer allows the financial firm to continue to operate in the normal course, which preserves the value of the enterprise for the creditors of the bankruptcy without a significant impact on the firm's employees, suppliers, and customers.  The bill also requires expedited judicial review by a bankruptcy judge randomly chosen from a pool of judges designated in advance and selected by the Chief Justice for their experience, expertise, and willingness to preside over these complex cases. Furthermore, the legislation provides for key regulatory input throughout the process.  The Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act is a bipartisan, balanced approach that increases transparency and[[Page H2719]]predictability in the resolution of a financial firm. Furthermore, it ensures that shareholders and creditors, not taxpayers, bear the losses related to the failure of a financial company.  I would like to thank Chairman Marino, who chaired the hearing on this legislation and who is the lead sponsor of the bill. I am also pleased that Ranking Member Conyers and Subcommittee Ranking Member Cicilline joined in introducing this important legislation. I want to thank them and their staff for their efforts in developing this bill.  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this important legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

875,SCHNEIDER,proceeding_id,topic-id,464,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of H.1677, Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act of 2017.  I commend Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law Chairman Tom Marino and Ranking Member David Cicilline, as well as Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, for their leadership on this bill.  I support this legislation for several reasons. To begin with, H.1667 addresses a real need recognized by regulatory agencies, bankruptcy experts, and the private sector that the bankruptcy law must be amended so that it can expeditiously restore trust in the financial marketplace as soon as possible after the collapse of a systemically significant financial institution.  This need is perhaps best illustrated by the collapse and subsequent bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in 2008. As a result of that firm's failure and the rampant uncertainty it generated, a worldwide freeze on the availability of credit quickly developed. This, in turn, triggered a near collapse of our Nation's economy and clearly revealed that current bankruptcy law is ill-equipped to deal with complex financial institutions in acute economic distress.  H.1667 would establish a specialized form of bankruptcy relief specifically designed to facilitate the expeditious resolution of a large, systemically significant financial institution, such as Lehman Brothers, while minimizing its impact on the financial marketplace.  Under the bill, the debtor's operating subsidiaries would continue to function outside of bankruptcy, while the debtor's principal assets, such as its secured property, financial contracts, and the stock of its subsidiaries, would be transferred to a temporary ``bridge company.''  The bridge company, under the guidance of a trustee, would then liquidate these assets to pay the claims of the debtor's creditors. The bill would also temporarily prevent parties from exercising their rights in certain qualified financial contracts.  Each critical step of this process would be done under the supervision of a bankruptcy judge and subject to appeal.  Another reason I support this bill is that it appropriately recognizes the important role the Dodd-Frank Act has in the regulation of large financial institutions. Without doubt, the Great Recession was a direct result of the regulatory environment at the time. Fortunately, the Dodd-Frank Act has done much toward reinvigorating a regulatory system that makes the financial marketplace more accountable and more resilient.  In particular, title II of the Dodd-Frank Act establishes a mandatory resolution process to wind down large financial institutions, which is a critical enforcement tool for bank regulators to ensure compliance with the act's heightened regulatory requirement.  H.1667 is an excellent complement to the Dodd-Frank Act's resolution process and will help facilitate the rapid administration of a debtor's assets in an orderly fashion that maximizes value and minimizes disruption to the financial marketplace.  Accordingly, I support this measure.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-04-05-pt1-PgH2715-2.txt

877,MARINO,proceeding_id,topic-id,538,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member Conyers, and my current new ranking member, Mr.Cicilline, for their work on this important legislation. I further thank my colleague across the aisle, Congressman Schneider from Illinois, for helping us manage this.  This is a bipartisan bill that is better for having gone through the regular legislative order. It was a pleasure to work with such knowledgeable and professional colleagues.  In the wake of the financial crisis of 2008, Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection That legislation was intended to address, among other things, the potential failure of large financial institutions.  While the Dodd-Frank Act created a regulatory process for such an event, the act states that the preferred method of resolution for a financial institution is through the bankruptcy process.  However, the Dodd-Frank Act did not make any amendments to the Bankruptcy Code to account for the unique characteristics of a financial institution. The legislation before us today fills that void.  The Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act is the product of years of study by industry, legal, and financial regulatory experts. It is also the result of bipartisan review over the course of four separate hearings before the Judiciary  The legislation includes several provisions that improve the ability of a financial institution to be resolved through the bankruptcy process. It allows for a speedy transfer of a financial firm's assets to a newly formed company. That company would continue the firm's operations for the benefit of its customers, employees, and creditors, and ensure the financial stability of the marketplace.  This quick transfer is overseen by and subject to the approval of an experienced bankruptcy judge, and includes due process protections for parties in interest.                              {time}  1330  The bill also creates an explicit role in the bankruptcy process for the key financial regulators. In addition, there are provisions that facilitate the transfer of derivative and similarly structured contracts to the newly formed company. This will improve the ability of the company to continue the financial institution's operations.  Finally, the legislation recognizes the factually and legally complicated questions presented by the resolution of a financial institution. To that end, the bill provides that specialized bankruptcy and appellate judges will be designated in advance to preside over these cases.  The bankruptcy process has long been favored as the primary mechanism for dealing with distressed and failing companies. This is due to its impartial nature, adherence to established precedent, judicial oversight, and grounding in the principles of due process and the rule of law. We are here today as part of an effort to structure a bankruptcy process that is better equipped to deal with the specific issues raised by failing financial firms.  I want to stress again the bipartisan support that went through this process--at the subcommittee level and at the full Committee on the Judiciary level chaired by Chairman Goodlatte, my colleague on the other side of the aisle who is helping us manage this and the individuals in this House who realized what had to be done to protect the law abiding citizens of this country from a financial disaster.  As a sponsor of the bill, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this important legislation.  ",CREC-2017-04-05-pt1-PgH2715-2.txt

880,CICILLINE,proceeding_id,topic-id,791,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.1667, the ``Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act of 2017.''  In 2008, the United States economy nearly collapsed as a direct result of lending practices in the housing market that were predatory, unsafe, and in many cases fraudulent.  Investments in toxic securities created a cycle of failure in the housing market: the declining health of the market undermined the value of these securities, which, in turn, devastated the housing market and caused the failure of several of the nation's largest financial institutions.  With the financial system in near collapse, large financial institutions were essentially able to ``blackmail'' the government because these banks were so large that there was no way to break them apart, as then-FDIC Chair Sheila Bair testified in 2009.  Although the true hardship caused by this widespread fraud is incalculable, we do know that it erased $10 trillion of household wealth and caused 8 million Americans to lose their jobs and 5 million Americans to lose their homes.  Rhode Island, my home state, was hit particularly hard by the recession. When I took office, the unemployment rate in Rhode Island hovered at 11.2%, the fifth highest in the country.  In the wake of this economic disaster, the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted to comprehensively reform the financial system.  Because of this law--which includes some of the strongest consumer protections passed since the Great Depression--the banking system is stronger; there is more transparency in consumer lending; and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) continues to serve as an important watchdog to protect Americans against predatory lending and fraud in the financial system.  Title I of Dodd-Frank provides stability in markets by requiring large financial institutions to have a ``living will'' to serve as a plan for the ``rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure.''  Title II ends taxpayer bailouts of banks that are too big to fail by providing financial regulators with orderly liquidation authority where a bank's collapse ``would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the United States'' and ``no viable private sector alternative is available.'' This process expressly requires a finding by the Secretary of the Treasury that the bankruptcy process would not be appropriate to resolve a distressed firm.  Leading commentators agree, however, that the U.bankruptcy process is not designed to accommodate the orderly resolution of a large financial institution that poses systemic risk to the entire economy.  H.1667, the Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act,'' addresses this concern by establishing a ``single point of entry'' for the resolution of an insolvent financial institution with assets exceeding $50 billion. The goal of the bill is to establish a process where a distressed financial institution could voluntarily seek bankruptcy relief while its subsidiaries continue to operate.  But while I support H.1667 and am an original cosponsor of this bill, make no mistake: I will strongly oppose any effort to combine this measure with a repeal of the Dodd-Frank Act, or any part of this law for that matter.  Since this law was enacted, the economic recovery has led to the creation of more than 15 million private sector jobs, a 60% increase in business lending, and record performance by the Dow Jones Industrial  It is critical that we build on this progress through education, training, and other initiatives to promote economic opportunity. Too many Americans are still unemployed or working two or even three jobs just to get by while Wall Street has never been better.  We must also preserve and advance the protections established by the Dodd-Frank Act to ensure transparency and stability in the financial system while protecting consumers.  The National Bankruptcy Conference agrees with this assessment, and has previously instructed that the Dodd-Frank Act should ``continue to be available even if the Bankruptcy Code is amended to better address the resolution of SIFIs because the ability of U.regulators to assume full control of the resolution process to elicit the cooperation from non-U.regulators is an essential insurance policy against systemic risk and potential conflict and dysfunction among the multinational components of SIFIs.''  Moreover, should this legislation become law, Dodd-Frank provides a valuable backstop to bankruptcy through its Orderly Liquidation Authority, which empowers the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to act as a receiver for large financial institutions that are ``too big to fail.''  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.Jenkins of West Virginia). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.Goodlatte) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.1667, as amended.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-05-pt1-PgH2715-2.txt

Mr.Speaker, I, too, rise in strong support of 544 to eliminate the sunset on the Veterans Choice  This bill will basically allow the Department of Veterans Affairs to continue spending previously appropriated resources in the Veterans Choice Program to provide direct and timely patient care to veterans. It allows the VA to charge a veteran's healthcare insurer for nonservice-connected care so that veterans aren't sent expensive medical bills, wasting time trying to figure out how to get them paid. Finally, it allows the VA to share medical information with community care providers so patient care is better coordinated.

It brought all parties together. I think the chairman is going to get a unanimous vote. They have got one in the  I can see that, under less steady hands, where this may have bogged down, and I appreciate the chairman's sense of urgency in getting it to this point. It puts us in a good place. So thank you for that.  It also gives us the time we need to come to a bipartisan fix for the Choice We know, under the Choice Program, veterans are still waiting too long to receive care. As we said, in 2014, we all supported the Choice Act because of the crisis. Throughout the country, veterans were waiting, and in some cases dying, because they were waiting for care. If we recall right, an honorable and decent man, the VA Secretary, resigned over this crisis. So this was an important issue that needed to be addressed. We passed the Choice Act so that veterans could get that care.  The Choice Program was created as a temporary fix, designed to end this summer or when the VA spent the $10 billion. As the chairman said, there is about $1 billion left in With veterans still in need of care, we cannot possibly allow that to go back without addressing where it needs to go. It would be a waste of money, a waste of time, and it would make veterans' wait times even higher.  The bill gives us time to rewrite the Choice The bill will give us time to address all of the problems with Choice so that veterans' care is managed and coordinated with VA and community care providers and so that veterans do not have wait times. It will also make sure the money will continue to be spent on veterans' health care.  I look forward to working with the chairman. As I said earlier, his steady hand and visionary leadership has gotten us to this point. It will ensure that we can figure out what the next iteration of community-based care looks like, and we can come together, bring that to the floor, and get it passed.  For this reason, I would urge my colleagues to support this legislation so veterans can receive their care now while Congress continues to work to improve upon that.

The intentions and goals of the Choice Program are good, giving our true American heroes more choices and more focused care; but, clearly, some areas of the program need improvement. I hear that from my veterans.  We have already taken some solid steps to make the program work better for veterans, but not enough. We will have the opportunity to fix this in a bipartisan fashion; for example, one positive step: The eligibility rules initially stated that a veteran had to live 40 miles as the crow flies from the nearest VA facility. We changed it to 40 miles driving distance. That is just common sense; isn't it? I think it is. We have also made reforms to increase the number of non-VA providers who are allowed to participate in the program and expand eligibility to all enrolled veterans.

I appreciate the efforts from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for advancing this legislation.

Objective analyses found that it is not meaningfully reducing veterans' wait times, and its arbitrary standards have added a layer of confusion for both patients and providers.

It should apply to everyone that does business with the Federal Government because the Federal Government cannot endorse discrimination of any kind.  I will fight to ensure that this committee and this Congress restores their commitment to equality and fairness as we develop a more streamlined and thoughtful method for connecting veterans with community care.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter echoing these concerns from the Human Rights Campaign, the National Women's Law Center, The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and the National Partnership for Women &                                                    April 5, 2017.       Dear Representative: We write to express our serious      concerns about H.369/544, which would eliminate the      sunset of the Veterans Choice The Veterans Choice      Program currently includes a provision exempting it from      oversight by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance      Programs (OFCCP). This has diminished civil rights      protections when the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)      enters into federal contracts for veterans' health care      services. The Veterans Choice Program was always intended to      be a temporary solution to ease the health care access crisis      faced by the veterans receiving care through the We fear      that removing the sunset will open the door to extension of      the program, including extending the provision that strips      critical equal employment opportunity protections from the      men and women serving our nation's veterans. OFCCP must have      full jurisdiction to protect against employment      discrimination and promote equal employment opportunities.       The antidiscrimination rules enforced by OFCCP ensure that      federal contract dollars further equal employment opportunity      and are not used to subsidize unlawful discrimination. OFCCP      plays a unique and vital role in combating unlawful      employment discrimination by federal contractors on the basis      of sex, race, national origin, religion, color, sexual      orientation, gender identity, and disability. It also      enforces the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance      Act, or VEVRAA, which requires nondiscrimination and      affirmative action for special and disabled veterans of any      war, campaign, or expedition in which a campaign badge has      been authorized. In addition, OFCCP guides contractors and      subcontractors on affirmatively promoting equal opportunity      in the workplace and promotes fair and nondiscriminatory      federal contractor workplaces. Many of its regulations      require contractors to take affirmative steps to expand the      pool of individuals from which it recruits, and evaluate      their own practices to identify and address conduct that      limits equal employment opportunities for protected classes      of workers. By conducting compliance audits and systemic      investigations, through its data collection and investigative      authority, OFCCP can aid contractors in identifying and      resolving practices that limit equal employment      opportunities, without relying solely on individuals who are      willing to risk retaliation to challenge unfair employment      practices. OFCCP's historic and current role in ensuring      artificial barriers do not restrict employment based on sex,      race, color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation,      gender identity, disability, or veteran status has improved      opportunities for a wide range of workers across the country      and has ensured that federal tax dollars do not subsidize      discrimination.       Carving out the VA provider agreements from these      antidiscrimination protections, affirmative action rules, and      data reporting requirements has the effect of narrowing      employment opportunities for women, people of color, people      with disabilities, veterans, and LGBT individuals and removes      critical tools for ending employment discrimination and      harassment. Extending the provision that weakens these      protections ultimately threatens harm not only to workers,      but to those who depend on them for care.       There is no appreciable administrative burden that      justifies continuing to suspend these protections and      requirements. Federal contractors and subcontractors with      less than 50 employees and $50,000 in contracts or      subcontracts are not covered by OFCCP's affirmative action      requirements. More than 94 percent of health care and social      assistance firms had fewer than 50 employees in 2009. The      larger providers, those with 50 or more employees and $50,000      or more in federal contracts, should be well-equipped to meet      the minimal administrative obligations associated with      maintaining an affirmative action plan.       The carve-out of VA contractors from the employment      discrimination rules applicable to federal contractors not      only has a detrimental impact on the workforces affected, but      sends a disturbing message that ensuring fair treatment for      women, people of color, LGBT people, veterans, and people      with disabilities is unnecessary and inconsequential. It sets      a precedent for future carve-outs and represents a step      backward from equal opportunity. Any continuation of the      Veterans Choice Program must ensure OFCCP jurisdiction to      enforce the antidiscrimination rules and other equal      employment opportunity protections for these providers.

903,FOXX,proceeding_id,topic-id,582,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise today in strong support of H.1304, the Self-Insurance Protection  Mr.Speaker, across the country, hardworking men and women are struggling to afford rising healthcare costs, and their options continue to drop year after year. At the same time, employers, large and small, are finding it harder to provide the type of high-quality, affordable healthcare coverage their employees need.  With over 150 Americans relying on an employer-sponsored health plan, Congress must do everything possible to ensure employers have the tools they need to help control healthcare costs for working families. Preserving access to self insurance is one simple step we can take as part of that effort.  More than 60 percent of employers who offer healthcare coverage choose to self-insure. This means that instead of purchasing a plan from an insurance company, employers pay their employees' healthcare costs directly. As a result, the employers have greater flexibility to structure a healthcare plan to the unique needs of workers and their families.  Although these plans provide important protections, they are free from certain restrictive rules that force workers to purchase one-size-fits-all benefits that they may not want or need. Self-insurance is a popular option that often leads to lower health insurance premiums for workers and their families.  In years with below average medical claims, any remaining healthcare dollars can help offset premiums for workers the following year, or can be used to help create new jobs and higher wages.  It is not just private sector employers who like the flexibility and affordability of self-insured health coverage. It is also embraced by labor organizations, schools, cities, and counties.  Of course, there is some level of risk associated with these plans. That is why employers purchase stop-loss insurance, so that employees can count on their healthcare coverage when they need it. Because it simply serves as a financial backstop to an actual health insurance policy, stop-loss has never been regulated as health insurance by the Federal  But as we all know, the previous administration had a constant urge to regulate practically every aspect of American life, regardless of the consequences. It was only a matter of time before the Obama administration made stop-loss insurance one of its regulatory targets, even though many employers would find it nearly impossible to self-insure as a result.  Limiting a popular free-market healthcare option that millions of Americans rely on was a price they were willing to pay in order to push their government-run healthcare scheme.  Fortunately for working families, the Obama administration was unsuccessful, and we now have a new administration committed to expanding, not limiting, affordable healthcare options. However, all this highlights the need to protect access to self-insurance.  Employers need long-term certainty when it comes to the healthcare benefits they provide, and working families deserve peace of mind that they won't lose the plan they like because of a partisan, unnecessary Federal regulation. The Self-Insurance Protection Act provides that certainty and peace of mind by reaffirming existing law and preventing Federal bureaucrats from regulating stop-loss as health insurance.  There is more we can and should do to promote affordable healthcare coverage for working families. This legislation is one small step we can take to ensure Americans can continue to benefit from flexible healthcare plans that help lower costs.  I urge my colleagues to stand up for affordable healthcare options for workers and employers by voting in favor of H.1304.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Self-insured plans are one solution that small businesses have tried to push back against these rising costs. These policies provide employers flexibility to design a healthcare plan tailored to the unique needs of their workers and their families. Last year, over 60 percent of employers who offered healthcare coverage utilized self-insured plans.  Unfortunately, the previous administration pursued regulations that would jeopardize access to self-insured plans by redefining stop-loss insurance as traditional health insurance under Federal law. Stop-loss insurance does not pay our medical claims; rather, it is a tool--I remind you--that simply provides protections for employers to guard against a catastrophic medical claim.  Mr.Speaker, our constituents need more affordable healthcare options, not fewer; and the bill before us will stop any future administration from putting harmful limitations on self-insured plans. To achieve meaningful healthcare reform, we must promote flexibility and innovative options, not curtail them.  H.1304 provides much-needed certainty to the workers and employers who access quality care through self-insured healthcare plans. As employers and their employees look to plan for the future, the Self-Insurance Protection Act will help provide some long-term certainty that these affordable health insurance options are available.

Restoring health care is more than one bill--our plan has always included a series of efforts to directly address the challenges facing our healthcare system. The challenges resulted from This legislation is one such effort, part of a series of measures to increase choice and access. This bill would make it easier for families to get health insurance from their employers.  As my colleagues have noted, more than 160 million Americans get their insurance from an employer. Of that, 60 percent of employers offering healthcare coverage are self-insured, meaning employers directly reimburse healthcare providers and employees for medical expenses. These self-insured plans provide more flexibility than traditional healthcare plans, as they can be designed and operated to meet the unique needs of workers and families. For many years, the company I led, in fact, was self-insured, and we bought stop-loss coverage.  For most self-insured employers, choosing to buy stop-loss insurance simply assists them in avoiding catastrophic losses. It is a business insurance policy. Regulating it like a traditional healthcare insurance would restrict access to self-insured plans dramatically.  We should be making it easier, not harder, for employers to offer their employees comprehensive health packages, and it certainly should not be left to an unelected bureaucrat to decide which types of plans or which benefits work for American families.  This legislation is a simple, straightforward approach to protect self-insured healthcare plans. It offers clarity, reaffirming longstanding policies recognizing that stop-loss insurance is a distinct business insurance and prevents bureaucrats from--one more time--tinkering with our economy and damaging health care.

I thought it would be interesting to highlight one of these women in Congress, a great woman, and one that I have long admired. Her name is Helen Gahagan She was the first California woman elected to Congress in her own right--in that case, not succeeding a deceased husband.  Helen Gahagan was an actress and an opera singer who did not consider herself political until a chance conversation she had over coffee while performing in Vienna, Austria, in 1938. The man was a Nazi sympathizer, and the things she heard truly sickened her.  She returned to the United States intent on destroying She and her husband, Oscar-winning actor Melvyn Douglas, joined the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League and called for a boycott of products made in Nazi  The release of John Steinbeck's seminal novel, ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' consumed her. She began studying the plight of migrant farmworkers coming to California from the Dust Bowl  After meeting the author, Helen was named president of the John Steinbeck Committee and became the national spokesperson for the rights of migrants.  That work attracted the attention of President and First Lady Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, and Eleanor became a mentor to  Helen Gahagan Douglas won the open congressional seat in California's 14th District in 1944. She was in the Hollywood area, and that was her district.  She served three terms in Congress, earning a reputation as a deep thinker, voice for the downtrodden, and skilled orator.  In 1950, she ran for the United States Senate, facing fellow southern California Congressman Richard  In the campaign, Nixon conflated her anti-Nazi views and work for migrant workers with being a communist fellow traveler.  He also employed anti-Semitic surrogates who attacked her for marrying a Jewish man.  These and other low-campaign tactics spurred Douglas to call Nixon ``Tricky Dicky,'' a moniker that stuck with him his entire career.  During the Watergate scandal, more than two decades after the 1950 Senate race, a popular bumper sticker in California read, ``Don't blame me, I voted for Helen Gahagan Douglas.''  After her death in 1980, California State Senator Alan Cranston delivered a stirring eulogy on the Senate floor. He said: ``I believe Helen Gahagan Douglas was one of the grandest, most eloquent, and deepest-thinking people we have had in American politics. She stands among the best of our 20th century leaders, rivaling even Eleanor Roosevelt in stature, compassion, and simple greatness.''  But it is Congresswoman Gahagan Douglas' own words that speak best for her legacy. As we celebrate 100 years of women in Congress, I can think of few quotes more fitting than Helen's: ``I knew men never would share power with women willingly.

I came from a background where people didn't always know how to dream, and, as a result, I was prepared to settle for a life of unfulfilled potential. I had started to believe that, as a young woman growing up in the fifties and the sixties, who literally lived on the other side of the tracks, maybe the American Dream wasn't for me.

Imagine the difficulties she had to deal with as the first woman in Congress--in 1917, no less--a woman who stood by her convictions no matter the cost. It must have been extremely harrowing for her at times, but she soldiered on as one would expect from the first female in what was at the time, and in many ways still is, a male-dominated world.  The Congresswoman was a woman of rock-solid principles which she absolutely would not budge from, as evidenced by her being the only Member of Congress to vote against involvement in both world wars, a position that was very unpopular at the time. But she stood by her beliefs and could not be swayed, an example for all of us.  While Congresswoman Rankin served only two terms in Congress, her legacy lives on in all of the women who have served since and those who will in the future. She famously once said, and we have all said it several times because it is worth saying and repeating:  ``I may be the first woman Member of Congress, but I won't be the last.''

I was reflecting today, when I heard that this was going to happen, about the fact that we have, in Congress, I think it is 85 women now, which is about one-fifth of the Chamber, and I think there are 20 U.Senators, which is also one-fifth on the Senate side. Obviously, those numbers are not proportionate to women's place in the population.  I hope that we could use the anniversary of Jeannette Rankin's election to reflect on things that could be done to improve these numbers today. One of the things that I would love to be able to pursue with the gentlewoman and other interested Members is the use of multi-Member districts, which were much more common at the time that she first served than they are today.  A lot of our States have multi-Member districts for election to State house or State senate. When you use multi-Member districts, the proportion of women rises considerably because what happens is people form tickets, they form slates, and it would be very unusual today to form a slate that is not balanced according to gender and some kind of racial, ethnic diversity. When we have single-Member districts, it is[[Page H2738]]much tougher to accomplish that.

It has gotten a little bit less attention because there is so much going on all over the globe. The world is on fire today. We see outrageous atrocities taking place in Syria under the so-called leadership of President We see here in America a government in turmoil, as every day the curtain is drawn back just a little bit further on the Russian connection with the Trump White  But we do need to take some time to focus on the U.Supreme Court if for no other reason than what we have in America today is one-party control of the U.House of Representatives, the U.Senate, the White House, and, if the Supreme Court goes, too, we essentially have no meaningful multiparty democracy in terms of the essential governance of the country.  Now, as the Senate takes up the President's nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Court, I have heard a number of officials and commentators criticize the effort taking place in the Senate over the last few days and into the next few days to stop I have heard them criticize it by invoking the aphorism ``two wrongs don't make a right.'' Of course, they are referring to the fact that President Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland, the Chief Judge of the D.Circuit Court of Appeals to the U.Supreme Court, was stonewalled for 9 months in the last year of President Obama's  Judge Garland didn't even receive a hearing. It never got to the point that there was a vote. He would have loved the opportunity to have someone filibuster his nomination on the floor of the His nomination never got to the floor of the He never had a hearing in committee--completely unprecedented in our history simply to stonewall, obstruct, and sandbag a judicial nominee like this. I will have something to say about the qualifications of Judge  But, in any event, the Democrats now are saying: We are not going to proceed with the nomination of Judge Gorsuch; we are going to block it. In answer, I hear repeatedly from U.Senators and commentators this phrase: Two wrongs don't make a right. Of course, that truism is true. But what does this excellent piece of folk wisdom have to do with the current situation of the nomination of Gorsuch to the Supreme Court?  If you saw someone punching out a security guard and running into a bank to rob the bank, it would be legally and morally wrong for you to go punch out another security guard at a bank across the street and go rob that bank. Two wrongs, indeed, do not make a right. You don't solve one bank robbery by committing another. But if you saw someone punching out a security guard and running into a bank to go rob it and you decided to run after the robber, pounce on him, and punch him out, that would be completely legally and morally justified.  In other words, stopping the original wrong is not in itself a wrong. Stopping the original wrong is right. That is the right thing to do, and that is what the Democrats are doing. They are trying to block a crime in progress because, understand, we have never, in American history, seen something like a President send a nomination to the Supreme Court to the U.Senate to fill a seat probably for 20 or 30 years and the Senate just says simply: We are not going to have any hearings about it. That is exactly what they did to Judge Merrick                              {time}  1715  Let me just say a few words about him before I turn it over to my colleague, Congresswoman  Judge Garland is, arguably, one of the two or three most experienced and qualified judges ever to be nominated to the Supreme He graduated summa cum laude from Harvard College and magna cum laude from Harvard Law  After serving as a law clerk to Judge Henry Friendly of the U.Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and then Justice William Brennan on the U.Supreme Court, he practiced law at Arnold & Porter here in Washington; and he worked as a Federal prosecutor in the Department of Justice, where he played a leading role in the investigation and prosecution of the Oklahoma City bombers and the investigation and prosecution of Ted Kaczynski, the  He has had nearly 20 years of judicial experience on the D.Circuit Court of The Senate originally confirmed him in an overwhelming 76-23 vote, where he not only swept the Democratic Caucus in the Senate, but won the majority of Republicans when he first went on the court.  His nomination to the Supreme Court fell victim to the GOP Senate leadership's rule-or-ruin mentality that is ravaging the most basic norms of American political democracy in this century. If Garland could not be confirmed to the U.Supreme Court, then no moderate liberal judge can be.  Some people have suggested that Gorsuch should be filibustered for exactly 9 months, which is the length of time that the GOP used to run out the clock on the Merrick Garland nomination. In other words, he was blockaded for 9 months. Therefore, blockade Gorsuch for 9 months, then have a vote on him.  This apparently symmetrical answer would certainly make President Trump's nominee twist in the wind and suffer the way that President Obama's nominee twisted in the wind and suffered, but that is not the point. It is not to inflict pain on the nominee. The real problem is not 9 months of legislative obstructionism, much less retribution for what was inflicted on one judge.  The real question is: Who gets to have the seat on the Supreme Court?  It is about the next 25 years of Supreme Court decisionmaking. That seat, by all rights, belongs not to Judge Gorsuch, but, rather, to Judge Merrick  Judge Gorsuch, however qualified he might be in terms of his own career, would present a jurisprudence dramatically to the right of the jurisprudence that would clearly be advanced by the addition of Judge Garland to the court. That is what we are going to talk about tonight.

It has been such a pleasure since coming to Congress--and it seems difficult to believe that it has been almost 3 months--but it has been such a pleasure to co-lead this Special Order hour with the gentleman and to really bring to the public all of the issues that we feel are so important in the Progressive Caucus, issues that have ranged from the issue we are talking about now with the Supreme Court nomination, to issues around health care, immigration, the Muslim ban, and many others.  I think that the vision that we are trying to make sure people understand for the Progressive Caucus and certainly for Democrats is a vision of inclusion, a vision that respects the rights of everybody, regardless of what gender you are, regardless of what race or religion you might be.  This moment is, in fact, very important. Tomorrow, Senate Republicans will attempt to push through President Trump's Supreme Court nominee Neil I stand with my colleague, Mr.Raskin, and with our other Democratic colleagues in the Senate who are opposing this nomination because I truly believe that confirming Neil Gorsuch to this position would be a devastating backslide for numerous communities.  I want to go through some of the communities that would be affected and how. Women, people of color, people living with disabilities and members of the LGBTQ community will have to wonder if the conservative majority on the Supreme Court is going to systematically remove their protections and strip them of their rights.  Unfortunately, Neil Gorsuch, though an accomplished justice in his own right, does have a track record of doing that throughout his judicial career. So this isn't as simple as saying: Well, you blocked our nominee; therefore, we are going to block your nominee.  This is about the issues and the refusal he has had to answer some of the questions before the committee.  I did want to reflect briefly on the fact that yesterday was Equal Pay Ninety-four days into the year, Equal Pay Day symbolizes the amount of extra time that it takes for a woman to earn the same amount as a man. We have got to work--I see the heads nodding up there in the Chamber--extra hard for an additional 3 months and some days in order to earn the same wages as a man.  When you break it down by race, the gap widens even further. Black women working full time year round only earn 63 cents to the dollar. For them, Equal Pay Day comes on July 31. Latina women earn a mere 54 cents, which means that their Equal Pay Day--get this--is November 2.  Over a lifetime, the financial losses that women face due to this gap are immense. On average, a 20-year-old woman will lose $418,000 over the course of her 40-year career. For Black women, they will lose $840,000. Latinas will lose more than $1 million.  Now, why do I bring this up in the context of Judge Gorsuch?  Because I believe that as we mark Equal Pay Day, we need to know that we will have a Supreme Court Justice who will, in fact, crack down on the gender pay gap and enforce the law.  Unfortunately, Judge Gorsuch has a history of prioritizing big business over people. In fact, he has ruled in favor of employers in two-thirds of the employment and labor disputes that have been brought before him on the basis of discrimination. Let's be clear: Equal Pay Day and the situation that women face is about discrimination.  Gorsuch ruled against an African-American man who claimed that he was fired because of racial discrimination in Johnson v. Oklahoma Department of  In Poindexter v. Board of County Commissioners of the County of Sequoyah, he ruled against a man who argued that he was demoted because of his political views.  His opinion in Strickland v. UPS was particularly troubling. The court ruled in favor of a female employee who had been discriminated against based on sex. Judge Gorsuch, though, wrote a dissenting opinion, despite the fact that the woman's male colleagues testified that she was required to attend counseling sessions while they were not, even though she was out performing them.  The court ruled in her favor, but, again, Judge Gorsuch, President Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States of America, went out of his way to undermine her.  Perhaps the clearest example of Gorsuch's affinity for big business was his ruling in the Hobby Lobby case, which many people across the country may know about. He ruled that private corporations should enjoy the same constitutional protections as people.  Not only are people being told that the money of corporations represents protected speech, but women across this country are being told that those corporations can make decisions about women's health care and their rights to make decisions about their own body. This case sent a clear signal that Judge Gorsuch is no friend of women's reproductive rights.  It isn't a surprise, frankly, that this President chose him, because he does fit right into this administration's all-out assault that we have seen since the beginning of this Congress on women's rights to make decisions about their bodies and their health care.  Judge Gorsuch wrote a concurring opinion arguing that the Affordable Care Act forced employers to violate their religious beliefs by providing birth control. It is our right to choose whether and when we want to have families. But rather than coming to the conclusion that corporations should be required to allow women to make their own healthcare decisions, Judge Gorsuch made it very clear that he stands with big business and against women's rights.  His appointment is a deep threat to something that I have appreciated my whole life and that women before me have fought for so hard. His appointment is a threat to Roe v. Wade, which has protected women's rights to abortion access.  Trump has said many times that he intended to appoint a Justice who would overturn Roe v. While being questioned in his confirmation hearing, Judge Gorsuch sidestepped all of the questions on this issue, but his views are obvious. He has questioned and argued against the legal foundation of a woman's right to choose, and he has been critical of the decisions of Roe v. Wade's and its reliance on the right to privacy and the substantive due process rationale.  That is unacceptable. Roe v. Wade is the law of the land, and it has helped save the lives of millions of women across our country. We need to make sure that we protect that right to choose and continue to allow abortion access in this country.  Judge Gorsuch has also taken actions that signal his support for the defunding of Planned Of course, we remember the doctored videos that came out to destroy Planned Parenthood's image. Utah Governor Gary Herbert attempted to defund the organization, but the tenth circuit issued an injunction. Gorsuch stood with the He even went so far as to push for a rehearing by the full court, without being asked by the The court refused. Gorsuch issued then a dissenting opinion that relied on the very fallacies that the Governor was pushing.  We cannot afford to have this critical vote on the Supreme Court go to someone who so clearly intends to undermine women's fundamental and constitutional rights.  Judge Gorsuch has also shown that he presents a threat to the LGBT community. In 2005, he wrote that people should rely on the ballot box to achieve marriage equality.  During his confirmation hearing, he was asked about cases that involve LGBT people as a class. This qualification is important because it adds heightened scrutiny. Apparently, Gorsuch was not comfortable with this, because he dodged the question. That is alarming. Our LGBT community does face discrimination at extremely high rates. This is not a speculation; it is fact.  Gorsuch could not even give a straight answer when Senator Dianne Feinstein asked if he agreed with Justice Scalia that there is ``no protection for women or gays or lesbians under the equal protection law.''  With States around the country attempting to pass discriminatory bills, it is crucial that we have a Supreme Court Justice who will apply that heightened scrutiny.  Finally, people living with disabilities are also fearful of this appointment and the possibility that Judge[[Page H2743]]Gorsuch might be our next Supreme Court  In Luke P., a case involving a severely autistic student, Judge Gorsuch ruled that a State can provide an education offering minimal educational progress to students with disabilities.  Rather than requiring States to fulfill their responsibilities under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, Judge Gorsuch was satisfied with putting a student's learning potential at severe risk. In the middle of his confirmation hearing, the current Supreme Court unanimously overruled his decision.  What does that say about his judgment? Do we want a Supreme Court who gets it wrong on so many issues?  Judge Gorsuch should not be appointed to the Supreme The fact that Senate Republicans are threatening the nuclear option if Democrats filibuster his appointment is just terrifying. It would have long-lasting consequences, and it is inappropriate to select a man for this key position to the United States Supreme Court who makes decisions about so many issues that affect all Americans across our country.  It is not right that they would make that on a purely partisan ideological basis. There should be a 60-vote threshold. We should make sure that they understand that, if they do this and they go to the nuclear option, it will have long-lasting consequences for them in their districts, in their offices, and also for the entire country.                              {time}  1730  ",CREC-2017-04-05-pt1-PgH2741-2.txt

Of course, we in the House don't have a vote, but we certainly do have the privilege to be able to weigh in on something as important as this in this manner. So I do appreciate the opportunity.  Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court is the latest battle in the Republicans' war on women and workers. I will find myself agreeing and probably repeating some of what Congresswoman Jayapal has said, but I think it bears repeating.  First of all, let me say we should make no mistake: this is a stolen Supreme Court seat. Senate Republicans demonstrated unprecedented--meaning never before in history--disrespect for the President of the United States, Barack Obama, and our Constitution by denying Judge Merrick Garland a vote or even a hearing when he was put into nomination by President That has never, ever happened before in our history.  Last year, Republicans ignored their constitutional duty by denying Judge Garland a hearing. By the way, he had been approved by the Congress in the past for a seat on the district court, and he had praise on both sides of the aisle. So it wasn't a question of his being qualified or not. It was they did not want the ability of Barack Obama to even nominate someone and have him considered for the Supreme  So now they want to break the rules of the Senate to rush their own nominee through. This is a nomination to the United States Supreme Court, the highest body in the land, the highest Court in the land. The decisions the next Justice takes part in will affect Americans for decades, if not centuries, because it could set precedent. Given the importance of this position, Senators have the right to insist on a 60-vote threshold for ending the debate on the nominee, and Senate Democrats should insist on 60 votes because Judge Gorsuch has demonstrated time and time again that he has put the interest of corporations above Americans--I will describe that later--whether it is worker safety or a woman's access even to contraception.  I am going to talk for a minute about women. President Trump said he would nominate a judge to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that said, as a matter of privacy, that women could make their own decisions about terminating a pregnancy. Women take that threat very seriously. Judge Gorsuch talked about precedents he likes, like Brown v. Board of Education, integrating the schools. I agree with him on that. But tellingly, when he mentioned the precedents that he reveres, he certainly did not give Roe v. Wade the same status.  Judge Gorsuch's judicial record should add to our concern. After the 10th Circuit panel ruled against the State of Utah's attempt to defund Planned Parenthood following the release of deceptively edited videos, Judge Gorsuch called for the full court to hear the case, presumably to overturn the decision. Judge Gorsuch was in the minority in this instance, and his request was dismissed.  In the Hobby Lobby case, Judge Gorsuch sided against women, allowing bosses to deny their women employees contraception as part of health coverage.  Now I want to talk a little bit about workers. In many other cases, Judge Gorsuch has prioritized the interest of employers over the rights of workers. He blocked a woman in Colorado from going to trial on sexual harassment claims because she didn't report the harassment quickly enough.  Judge Gorsuch denied a professor with leukemia at Kansas State University protection under the Rehabilitation He sided with a mining company after a worker was electrocuted due to inadequate safety training. He sided with a trucking company that fired a trucker driving through Illinois--that is my State--who decided to leave his broken trailer instead of freezing to death, literally. The truck was down, couldn't get started, and his choice was to sit there with the truck or to be able to go to safety in freezing temperatures.  Fortunately for workers, Judge Gorsuch was in the minority in some of those cases, but we can't count on him being in the minority once he is on the Supreme His dangerous antiwoman, antiworker views should not be elevated to our highest court.  So I urge my Democratic colleagues in the Senate to stand strong against the Gorsuch nomination. And to Senate Republicans, it was disrespectful to the Constitution to block Judge I am not even saying necessarily that he would have been approved, but to not even offer him a hearing or a vote was disrespectful to our Constitution, and it is disrespectful to the traditions of the Senate to force Judge Gorsuch through now.  We don't want to break the rules to get one nominee through, especially not a nominee who puts critical protections for Americans at risk. Women are watching. Workers are watching.

962,RASKIN,proceeding_id,topic-id,272,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Illinois for those excellent comments. As we have been discussing this evening, there is an egregious process problem with the nomination of Judge Gorsuch, and there is an egregious substantive problem with it.  The process problem, of course, is that the seat properly belongs to Judge Merrick Garland, the chief judge of the D.Circuit Court of Appeals, who was denied, extraordinarily, even a hearing for a 9-month period. The justification for that offered by Senator McConnell was that he felt that the people should speak in the 2016 election. Of course, President Obama was The Senate was the The people had spoken in the 2012 and 2014 elections. But they said they wanted the people to speak.

The other problem, the substantive problem, is that Judge Gorsuch adds to what has come to be called the corporate majority on the corporate Corporations win; workers lose.[[Page H2744]]Corporations win; investors lose. Corporations win; consumers lose.

963,RASKIN,proceeding_id,topic-id,1562,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas for those extraordinary comments. Congresswoman Lee makes me think about the partisan identification of Supreme Court nominees because it is a relatively recent phenomena that we identify them as Democrats or  Many of my favorite Supreme Court Justices were appointed to the Supreme Court by Republican Justice Suitor, of course, was appointed by the first President He was an exceptional Justice, who earned the ire, unfortunately, of the Republicans because he voted with the majority in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, affirming a woman's right to choose an abortion in consultation with her physician and her family and because he voted in Lee v. Weisman to prevent religious prayers from taking place at public school graduation ceremonies.  The rhetoric then in the Republican Party was, ``No more Suitors,'' despite the fact that he had been nominated by a Republican ``No more Suitors'' is what they said.  Or Justice Kennedy, who has been an exceptional Justice when it comes to vindicating the constitutional rights and equality of the LGBT He was the one who authored the decision in Lawrence v. Texas, overruling Bowers v. Hardwick, saying that the State of Texas and other States could not arrest, prosecute, and incarcerate gay people simply for their relationships. He wrote that.[[Page H2745]]  He also was the author of the Supreme Court's magnificent decision in the Obergefell case, determining that equal protection means that States cannot discriminate against gay and lesbian citizens in the institution of marriage--and there is no going back on that.  But, of course, the rhetoric on the other side now, because it has got to be turned into a partisan football, is, ``No more Kennedys.'' ``No more Kennedys.'' ``No more Suitors.'' Why? Because they did their jobs as ``We want people like Neil Gorsuch who are going to tow the line every step along the way.''  Neil Gorsuch is someone that they are convinced will be part of both the attempt to dramatically reduce or abolish the privacy rights of the people, turn the clock back on the equal rights of the LGBT community but, also, more importantly, participate in what has been called the development of the corporate court Neil  Now, that is a long-running development. But the critical moment came in 2010 with the Citizens United decision. Understand, the traditional doctrine for two centuries was that a corporation is, in the words of Chief Justice John Marshall from the 1819 decision in the Dartmouth College v. Woodward case, he said, ``an artificial being, invisible, intangible, existing only in contemplation of law,'' not possessing the constitutional political rights of the people. But in Citizens United, a deeply divided 5-4 Supreme Court found for the first time in our history that for-profit business corporations enjoy the political free speech rights of the people.  So what did that mean as a practical matter? Because, after all, before, the CEOs could spend whatever they wanted of their own money independently in a political campaign--see Buckley v. Valeo; the members of the board, the corporate executives, could spend whatever they wanted independently in a political campaign--see Buckley v. Valeo; they could contribute up to the limits--see Buckley v. Valeo; now they can contribute to every Member of Congress and every Member of Congress' opponent because of a recent decision handed down by the Supreme  But there is one thing they couldn't do: The CEOs could not take money directly out of the corporate treasury to spend in politics. But the Citizens United majority gave them that power.  This breached an understanding that had been in place for centuries that the most conservative Justices on the Court adhered to. Chief Justice Rehnquist, a very conservative judge, said that corporations are magnificent vehicles for the accumulation and investment of wealth, and they have worked great for the economy, but they are very dangerous if you allow them to cross the line from economics to politics.  Justice White, a very conservative Justice, appointed by a Democrat, President Kennedy, said that corporations are endowed with all kinds of special attributes, like perpetual life of the corporation, the limited liability of the shareholders, and all kinds of legal trappings and subsidies. He said: The corporation is the creature of the State, and the State need not permit its own creature to consume it, to devour it.  So we had a doctrine, which is that corporations could be confined to the economic realm. They could not convert all of the wealth and power they accumulate in economics into political power. But that is what the Supreme Court did in Citizens  But it didn't stop there. Because now the question became, as the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals put it: If a corporation has political rights, if a for-profit business corporation has political rights, why doesn't a for-profit business corporation have the religious rights of the people? And that became the Hobby Lobby decision in 2014.  Hobby Lobby was a for-profit business corporation, not a religious entity, not a church, not a mosque. It was a business corporation. And it was not organized for religious purposes. It was organized for profitmaking purposes. Yet the corporate leadership said: We don't want to participate in the provision of contraceptive care for our employees under the Affordable Care We don't want to do that. We assert the religious rights of the corporation.  Now, stop and think about that for a second. From the standpoint of most religions, it is pure blasphemy to say that a corporation should have religious rights. As James Madison put it back when he wrote his famous remonstrance against religious taxation: The religious rights of the people are sacred in our system because they are between the person and God, they are between the believer and The government doesn't get involved; corporations aren't involved; and all of these other artificial entities aren't involved. It is between the person and his or her religious faith or worship.  But beyond the blasphemy of it, think about what this means. What it means is that a business corporation can say that it does not want to participate in the provision of contraceptives to their employees, thereby violating the rights of their employees.  If a corporation can exercise its newly found religious conscience to say that it doesn't want to provide contraceptives to employees, why can't the corporations say: Well, it also violates our rights to compel us to serve people on an interfaith or interracial basis; that offends our religious beliefs, too, as a corporation? Where does this doctrine end?  Now, why do we raise this? Because Judge Gorsuch was part of the majority which determined that corporations have a religious conscience, have a religious soul. He has been part of the spiritual ennoblement of business corporations to the detriment of workers and consumers and other people who have to deal with this newfound corporate power.  Judge Gorsuch seems like a good guy. He is right out of central casting, but he is being put on the Court to participate in the greatest concentration of corporate power, jurisprudence, and thinking on the Supreme Court in its entire history, with the possible exception of the Lochner period. Of course, in the Lochner period, in the early 20th century, the Supreme Court began to slash away at child labor laws, at laws protecting the rights of people to belong to unions, at any kind of social regulation, saying that violated due process.  Well, today, the First Amendment, where religious freedom played the same role that due process played during the Lochner period, they become a catchall rubric for the Court to strike down the laws of the people and to benefit big corporate power against the rights of actual human beings, like the people who lost their contraceptive care in the Hobby Lobby case because some of the corporate lawyers representing Hobby Lobby had the bright idea to assert that the corporation was protected by the Religious Freedom Restoration And, of course, Judge Gorsuch went along for the ride, with all of the other corporate judges and the justices on the corporate court.  Mr.Speaker, there is one category of judges in our Federal judiciary that merit the Appalachian Justice, who are called ``Justice.'' Everybody else is called ``Your Honor'' or ``Judge.'' But the people who go on the Supreme Court get to be called ``Justice.'' It means something.                              {time}  1800  There is a massive injustice taking place here because of the outrageous sandbagging, stonewalling, and obstruction of the D.Circuit Court Chief Judge Merrick Garland, who was denied even a hearing in the U.Now there is an attempt to tilt the Court for the next 15, 20, or 30 years with the appointment of Judge Gorsuch to the corporate bloc.  So here in the House of Representatives, of course, we do not enjoy the power of advice and consent; but a number of us simply wanted to say this evening that we stand very strongly in solidarity with those Members of the Senate who are exercising their constitutional duties by trying to filibuster this nomination, which is conceived in a wrong, in an attempt to steal a Supreme Court seat and, if it were to be accomplished, would be destined simply to add to a rightwing pro-corporate majority on the Roberts  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-05-pt1-PgH2741-2.txt
