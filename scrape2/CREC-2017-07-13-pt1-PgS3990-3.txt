                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS

                                 ______
                                 

                         TRIBUTE TO JOE KALIKO

 Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I wish to thank and commend Joe 
Kaliko for his extraordinarily valuable commitment and service in 
aiding and advocating for our most vulnerable throughout the community. 
His many deeds of generosity and caring have made him a go-to person 
when people need help. His life is a real inspiration for all of us.
  Joe Kaliko is founder of the Needs Clearinghouse, a private nonprofit 
organization. He has actively partnered with governmental agencies, in 
helping provide necessary--sometimes lifesaving--resources to people 
through programs such as Hug a Hound and the Refugee Assistance 
Project. He has helped raise funds and contributions to a myriad of 
charitable causes, touching many, many lives. I have seen those people 
and the powerfully positive effects on their lives, disabled people who 
now have ramps for access to their homes, veterans who now have 
housing, ill people who now have better healthcare, and numerous 
others.
  Joe Kaliko is all about making a difference. He is a true 
hero.
