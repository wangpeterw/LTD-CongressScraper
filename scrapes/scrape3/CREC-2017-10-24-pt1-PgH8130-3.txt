          REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 3798

  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to remove 
Representative Ed Perlmutter as a cosponsor of my bill H.R. 3798. He 
was mistakenly added to the legislation.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman from Indiana?
  There was no objection.
