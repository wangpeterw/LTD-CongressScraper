                     HONORING MICHAEL MACCHIAVELLO

  (Mr. PITTENGER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of North Carolina 
State University senior Michael Macchiavello, who, on March 17, won the 
NCAA Division I National Wrestling Championship at 197 pounds.
  Mr. Macchiavello is a graduate of Sun Valley High School in Indian

[[Page H1759]]

Trail, North Carolina, where he was a 4A State champion wrestler in 
2013, when he posted a 61-1 record. His college coach says Michael is 
constantly improving and that his work ethic, discipline, attitude, and 
commitment put him in position to compete for the national title.
  Mr. Macchiavello is not just a champion inside the ring. He has 
already completed a bachelor's degree in finance and is working on a 
master's of arts.
  Congratulations to Michael Macchiavello on winning the NCAA Division 
I National Wrestling Championship. Indian Trail, Union County, and the 
entire Ninth Congressional District are mighty proud of him. We wish 
him the best in what we know will be a great success for him in the 
future.
