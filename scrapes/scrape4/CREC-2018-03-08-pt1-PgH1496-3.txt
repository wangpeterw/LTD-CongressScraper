                         THE NICS FIX AND DACA

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I could not help, as I listened to the 
colloquy of my two friends, to recognize that the key element is saving 
lives, saving lives from the pillage and the murderous acts that are 
done with guns.
  The NICS fix is crucial. The banning bump stocks is crucial. The 
expanded waiting period is crucial, and banning of AR-15s.
  But if we can move the issue of the NICS fix, if we can move the 
issue of expanded background checks, we can lose the taint of not doing 
anything since Las Vegas, not doing anything since Sandy Hook, Mother 
Emanuel, or, tragically, Florida. It is imperative that we save lives.
  Now, let me speak very clearly to DACA.
  I invite my ICE officers to stand with me on Sunday in Houston and 
tell my thousands of DACA young people that they will not raid their 
homes, they will not jeopardize their lives, and that they are, in 
fact, statused individuals who can go about their daily business. Join 
me Sunday and announce it to them.
  And I ask ICE officers to join the Members of Congress across the 
Nation, because these young people are scared to death, and I would ask 
that we recognize that.
  Mr. Speaker, I intend to honor the late Council Member Larry Green 
with a statement in the Record acknowledging the very fact of his great 
leadership and the fact that he has passed.
