                           GOP TAX SCAM BILL

  (Ms. JUDY CHU of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the 
GOP tax scam bill, H.R. 1, which, considering who it really helps, 
should be labeled ``H.R. 1 percent.''
  As a member of the Ways and Means Committee, I offered amendments to 
ensure the middle class benefits, but Republicans rejected those 
proposals in order to give away tax cuts for corporate interests and 
the top 1 percent. Instead, H.R. 1 percent repeals the deductions for 
State and local taxes, raising taxes on California families who already 
pay more to the Federal Government than they receive back. In fact, the 
average middle class California family who owns a home will see an 
average tax increase of 26.4 percent, making California the hardest hit 
State in the country. It is outrageous.
  The SALT deduction enables communities to fund important services 
that improve our quality of life, like law enforcement, infrastructure, 
and education. But repealing it forces constituents in my State to 
either accept higher taxes or a lower standard of living, all to pay 
for tax cuts for corporations and the wealthiest few.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the GOP tax scam.
