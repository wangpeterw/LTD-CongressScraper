                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Steven E. Boes, Boys Town, Boys Town, Nebraska, offered the 
following prayer:
  Today we remember the lives lost at Pearl Harbor and all the young 
men and women who serve today.
  Lord God, in these troubled times of fires, floods, hurricanes, 
terror attacks, and mass shootings, help us to rely on Your strength to 
envision and build a stronger, more secure America.
  Give us more visionaries like Father Edward Flanagan, who founded 
Boys Town on December 12, 100 years ago. Father Flanagan was an Irish 
immigrant who lived the American Dream and taught us all that even the 
most troubled child could grow up to be a useful citizen if given half 
the chance. He saw the best in the kids that others rejected as 
useless.
  Help us, but especially each of our Representatives, to see the best 
in those who have different political or social views so that we can, 
together, build an America that enables and calls forth the best in its 
citizens.
  Amen.
