             PRESIDENTIAL BUDGET SHORTSIGHTED AND RECKLESS

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, well, the President's budget is 
shortsighted. It is reckless. Hopefully, it is dead on arrival when it 
lands here in the House.
  President Trump and Republicans want to throw billions of dollars 
more on defense programs and drastically cut investments in job 
training, afterschool programs, and lifesaving medical research.
  Think about this:
  It cuts Social Security disability benefits.
  If you are a worker in Saginaw looking for your next job, you are out 
of luck. President Trump wants to cut worker training programs.
  If you are a senior in Bay City, Michigan, and you depend on Meals on 
Wheels, too bad. President Trump wants to take away those meals, take 
away that contact that you have.
  If you are a parent in Flint with a child in Head Start just trying 
to find a way forward, too bad. President Trump's budget will cut 
support for education and for early childhood education.
  A budget is a statement of our values. What does this document say 
about the values of this President?
  We must reject the President's proposed budget. It is bad for 
America.
