           RECOGNIZING THE HAVRE YOUTH BASEBALL ALL-STAR TEAM

 Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this week I have the distinct honor 
of recognizing the Havre youth baseball, 10U, All-Star team. This past 
weekend, the team from Havre won the Montana Cal Ripken Baseball State 
title for the 10 years old and under division.
  Despite a loss to Belgrade in their opening game of the tournament, 
the Havre All-Stars battled their way to the championship game, and 
defeated Bozeman to claim the title. In addition to an outstanding 
performance on the

baseball diamond, the community of Havre also served as host for the 
tournament. A successful 4-day youth sports State tournament is the 
result of hard work from the many volunteers who pitched in to make the 
event a great success.
  With summer events in full swing, I would like to commend the 
community of Havre for their hospitality and congratulate the 
youngsters on the All-Star team for their accomplishment.
