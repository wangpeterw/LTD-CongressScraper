           MICHIGAN FARMERS AND TRUCKERS AID WILDFIRE VICTIMS

  (Mr. MITCHELL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the selfless 
actions of farmers in my district and across Michigan. In early March, 
wildfires spread through Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and Colorado, 
devastating families and destroying crops and livestock--farmers' 
income for next year.
  Hearing of the devastation, Michigan farmers and truckers mobilized 
quickly to bring aid to the farmers in need of immediate assistance. 
Selfless individuals have donated their resources, including over 250 
bales of hay, fencing, cattle feed, financial support, and more. 
Convoys of volunteers, farmers, and truckers have volunteered their 
time and their vehicles to drive these resources hundreds of miles to 
affected areas. Farmers in 68 of 83 Michigan counties have donated 
supplies or driven to deliver aid, and their efforts are expanding. 
This weekend, 50 students from Sanilac County 4-H are delivering aid to 
Ashland.
  These selfless acts are truly inspiring and humbling. I am proud to 
recognize their efforts and was happy to be able to aid some of these 
efforts by getting permits issued for their travel.
