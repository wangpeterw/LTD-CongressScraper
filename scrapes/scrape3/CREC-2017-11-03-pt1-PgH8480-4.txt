                75TH ANNIVERSARY OF EXECUTIVE ORDER 9066

  (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. GABBARD. Madam Speaker, this year marks the 75th anniversary of 
Executive Order 9066, which authorized the internment of over 110,000 
Japanese Americans on U.S. soil during World War II.
  Our country will never be able to undo this grave miscarriage of 
justice or relieve the pain and suffering that was inflicted upon our 
fellow Americans. So we must remember this dark period in our Nation's 
history and ensure that this dark shadow of prejudice, bigotry, and 
hate never occurs again.
  However, sadly, as we look around us, today we see that this 
divisiveness and bigotry persists far too much. We cannot give into 
hate and intolerance. We must confront it and defeat it with the light 
and love of the Aloha Spirit.
  We must learn from this dark stain on our past and vow to never 
repeat it again.
