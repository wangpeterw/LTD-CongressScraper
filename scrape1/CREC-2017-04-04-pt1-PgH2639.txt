                        CELEBRATING THE MASTERS

  (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, as you know, I have the honor of representing 
the 12th Congressional District of Georgia and the good people who live 
and work there.
  This week, thousands will gather in Augusta to take part in a 
tradition unlike any other.
  Beginning in 1934, the Masters, hosted by the Augusta National Golf 
Club, has become the most prestigious golf tournament in the world. 
Known for its lightning-fast greens and gorgeous azaleas, this 
tournament captivates the world for both the talent of those playing 
and its beauty. Since its inception, many legends have conquered the 
greens to prove their skill and earn the coveted green jacket.
  This year will be a little somber, as we will deeply miss another of 
the great legends, four-time Masters champion Arnold Palmer. His 
presence will certainly be missed on that first tee as an honorary 
starter and throughout this great week.
  I wish the best to all those competing in this truly remarkable event 
and invite those who are traveling from far and wide to experience and 
enjoy the wonderful hospitality of the 12th Congressional District of 
Georgia and my home, Augusta.
