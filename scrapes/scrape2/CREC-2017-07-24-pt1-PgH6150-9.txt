                       RECOGNIZING STEWART ADAIR

  (Mr. HURD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. HURD. Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize the extraordinary 
contributions Mr. Stewart Adair has made on my hometown of Helotes, 
Texas.
  Since first becoming the Walmart store manager in 2013, Mr. Adair has 
dedicated his professional and personal life to helping the people of 
Helotes. Stewart and his family have become pillars of the community.
  As the store manager, Mr. Adair was responsible for leading hundreds 
of employees, where he quickly grew to become a role model and mentor 
to many.
  In addition to his commitments to his job and his family, Stewart has 
spent much of his personal time supporting our Nation's troops. Stewart 
is well known in Helotes for organizing the annual Turkey for Troops 
program, which he has helped grow into a thriving charity event.
  As many in the community of Helotes know, Stewart was recently 
diagnosed with cancer.
  This past Saturday, I was honored to volunteer my time for a man who 
has

done so much to help his community. Mr. Adair is a perfect example of a 
Good Samaritan, and I am proud to recognize all that he has done for 
our community in Helotes.
