      CONGRATULATING RASUL DOUGLAS ON MAKING IT TO THE SUPER BOWL

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, hard work pays off. Rasul Douglas, a graduate 
of East Orange Campus High School in East Orange, New Jersey, is now a 
cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles. This Sunday he will play in the 
Super Bowl.
  Rasul is one of seven siblings raised by his grandmother. He spent 
his first 2 years of college at Nassau Community College where he 
trekked 50 miles from home to class and practice every day, slept on 
the floor, and sometimes went hungry in pursuit of his dream.
  Rasul transferred to West Virginia University and was then selected 
by the Eagles in the third round of the 2017 NFL draft.
  Mr. Speaker, Rasul Douglas' success is a testament to how far a good 
work ethic can take you. Rasul is a shining star for young people in my 
district. Even a Giants fan like me can recognize talent like his.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to wish Rasul and the Eagles good luck in 
this weekend's Super Bowl.
