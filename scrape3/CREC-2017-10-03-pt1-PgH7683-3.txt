                      WELCOMING PASTOR KEVIN McKEE

  The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. 
Graves) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to 
Pastor Kevin McKee, who opened with the prayer this morning in this 
Chamber.
  Kevin and his wife, Mary, have been amazing pillars in our community 
as we have been through extraordinary challenges associated with 
Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Gustav, Ike, and Isaac; a thousand-year flood 
last year; the worst oil spill in the Nation's history; the incredible 
shootings of five of our police officers last year; and racial 
divisiveness.
  Kevin and Mary have been incredible at propping up our community and 
sharing the Word in eastern Europe, China, and around the United 
States. I want to thank both of them for their incredible service to 
our State, our Nation, and our community as we have been through these 
times of challenge.
