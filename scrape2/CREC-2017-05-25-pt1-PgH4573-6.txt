                         FIGHT ON, KATIE VACEK

  (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, for 8\1/2\ years I have worked for the best 
people in America, the people of Texas 22. The people of Texas 22 love 
their neighbors. They love their community, they love life, and they 
love God.
  Texas 22 is Katie Vacek. Katie is a senior at Needville High School. 
Three months before using her Blue Jay wings to fly into her future, 
God gave her a different flight. She fell out of a tree with her 
boyfriend, Kernie, watching. She is now paralyzed from the waist down.
  Kernie, her classmates, and the whole town rallied around Katie and 
her dreams. Twelve days ago, at her prom with Kernie, she danced.
  Katie, I don't want to come between you and Kernie, but I want you to 
be my date the next time President Trump speaks in this Chamber in 
February of next year. We will lock this down at the Knights of 
Columbus on June 6 back home. Keep fighting, knowing that God is with 
you always.
