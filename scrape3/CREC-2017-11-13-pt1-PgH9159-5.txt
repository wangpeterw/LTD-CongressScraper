                        AMERICAN EDUCATION WEEK

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, this week is American Education Week, a time 
to celebrate our public education system.
  The public education system is one of this Nation's greatest 
accomplishments. In classrooms from Newark, New Jersey, to Nome, 
Alaska, public schools train a new generation of world leaders, bridge 
builders, first responders, artists, doctors, plumbers, and CEOs.
  Children in this country--all of them--have a right to a high-quality 
education.
  It is a sad state of affairs that we have a U.S. Secretary of 
Education who continues to tilt the board against children whose way up 
is through public education.
  During American Education Week, I call on my colleagues to stop using 
public schools as a political bargaining chip. Let's put public schools 
back together and back to work for the next generation of leaders.
