  (Mr. CONYERS asked and was given permission to address the House for

  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my brothers of 
Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Incorporated, during the annual James 
``Biff'' Carter Kappas on the Capitol Hill Legislative Policy 
Conference. I knew Biff Carter personally.
  Each year, Kappas from all over the country flock to Capitol Hill to 
raise awareness around the key issues that are affecting our 
communities. These men are leaders in religious, business, legal, 
academia, and community service institutions, as well as others.

through experience and passion for their communities to Washington, 
D.C., the Nation, and the world.
