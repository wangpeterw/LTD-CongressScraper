               COMMENDING THE EFFORTS OF PEOPLE FOR LIFE

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend hisremarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend 
the efforts of People for Life, a nonprofit in ErieCounty, 
Pennsylvania, that is dedicated to educating and promoting right-to-
life causes in northwestern Pennsylvania.
  This organization hosts several events throughout the year to bring 
together people of the pro-life community. People forLife organizes an 
annual bus trip to participate in the national March for Life in 
Washington, D.C., and it also hosts its ownMarch for Life in Erie.
  For nearly four decades, People for Life has hosted a Pro-Life 
Breakfast that highlights the sanctity of human life in allphases and 
conditions. Attendees can hear stories of love, courage, and victory 
through God's mercy and grace.
  I thank People for Life for all the work it has done in Erie and 
northwestern Pennsylvania on this topic of such greatimportance. They 
work to save lives through education and love. They recognize how 
sacred each human life is and fullyunderstand the need to protect the 
most vulnerable. They are a voice for the voiceless. I am deeply 
grateful for their work.
