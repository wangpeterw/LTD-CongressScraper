14606,topic-id,746,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to honor May 15 as Peace Officers Memorial Day and May 14 through 20 as National Police I stand in support of those who put their lives on the line day in and day out for the protection of those within the State of Nebraska and all over the United  My district is home to two sheriff's offices, a large urban police force, numerous community police departments, the Nebraska State Patrol, and a handful of Federal agencies. They have unique differences in their responsibilities, yet they are strikingly similar in how they function. The different shapes of the badges they wear on their chests proudly proclaim their distinct alliance to their home agency, but it is also a symbol that binds them all together into one brotherhood.  These gallant law enforcement professionals are driven to serve the public of their jurisdictions. They protect the life, limb, and property in their assigned patrol areas during their long hours for which they have this solemn duty. To those on the front line of our safety, it is not about the pay, the hours, or the conditions they work in. What is of importance to them is the satisfaction of making the world a better and safer place. They are the thin blue line that stands between us and some of the darkest parts of our society.  When one of these brave individuals puts on the uniform and departs their home for the streets, they are not worried about their own safety. They know their fellow officer has their back when needed. At great personal sacrifice, they are pained by missing the baseball games or recitals of beloved children, the birthdays and the holidays that they have worked instead of being home with their family.  I, like so many other members of the military, have a very personal connection and appreciation for those who choose this profession. I spent nearly 30 years in the military, and much of that time was deployed with combat forces protecting our freedoms overseas. The men and women in the military uniform depend on those back home in the blue uniform.  Like so many others in the military, when I was overseas, I left my wife and children in the U.As a five-time former commander, I can tell you that the fastest way to negatively affect a soldier, sailor, airman, or marine within a combat situation was to have them worry about their family back home. Our great police officers allow the military to be a success. I am in awe of the dedication that each officer displays daily. When our military is reunited with their family after a deployment, they can relax knowing their fellow public servants provide a shield of protection.  This is a profession that takes a different type of individual: someone who is consistently putting their life on the line, someone that I have always looked up to, and a group of individuals that I cannot thank enough for the blanket of security they provide.  There are members of the law enforcement community who serve, retire, and move on with their lives. Eventually they go home, lay down their badge in retirement, but they will no longer miss those family functions and events. These professionals have the gratitude of the constituents of my[[Page H4232]]district, and I want to thank them for their dedication to protect and serve.  I would like to honor some of these courageous people who have long, distinguished careers or who have recently retired: Sergeant Joe Eaton from the Sarpy County Sheriff's Office, 38 years and retired; Sergeant Troy Kister, Omaha Police Department, 29 years and retired; Captain Kevin Pokorny, LaVista Police Department, 32 years and retired; Deputy Stephanie Squiers, Sarpy County Sheriff's Office, 32 years and retired; Sergeant Don Voss, Sarpy County Sheriff's Office, 39 years and will soon retire; Deputy Dennis Yeaman, Douglas County Sheriff's Office, 42 years and still serving, nearing retirement.  I want to thank these officers and all others for their service and sacrifice.                              {time}  1045  Mr.Speaker, before I close, I am often asked, as a 30-year, retired military officer, to pay tribute to our law enforcement and to compare. And what strikes me is I used to operate or train in the safety of home, but we would deploy into harm's way. Our law enforcement, every single day, put themselves in harm's way. So we love our law enforcement, we respect them, and we thank them.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-17-pt1-PgH4231-2.txt,99999999999999,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,17.0,May

14315,topic-id,323,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  The purpose of H.1665 is to ensure that, in making a recommendation to the President for a major disaster declaration, the Administrator of FEMA looks at the intensity of the impact in a localized area as well as the impact on other recent disasters.  My colleagues from Illinois are to be commended for working so persistently on this bipartisan piece of legislation. Their Illinois districts have been impacted by several devastating disasters, but each time the communities were told that the damage was not severe enough to warrant Federal disaster assistance.  In recent years, there has been more evidence of devastated small and rural communities not receiving disaster assistance in a fair manner compared to other larger communities and neighboring I know all too well how devastating this can be for those affected by disaster, as I am dealing with a similar issue in northeastern  In March, much of the area I represent was hit with a crippling snowstorm that dumped as much as 30 inches of snow or more. Municipalities had to exhaust much of their yearly budgets on snow removal efforts and emergency services. However, due to the fact that the statewide threshold needed for Pennsylvania to request reimbursement funding from the Federal Government was not met, local municipalities were left with massive holes in their budgets.  This bill helps ensure the severe, remote, and localized impact endured by communities like those in Pennsylvania and Illinois get due consideration and they get the help they need when disaster strikes. The House adopted similar language last year when it passed the FEMA Disaster Assistance Reform  Again, thank you to the gentleman and gentlewoman from Illinois for working with the subcommittee on this legislation to address the concerns of their constituents and other communities in this situation.

14320,topic-id,268,"Mr.Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.LaHood).  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.1665, the Disaster Declaration Improvement I thank my colleagues, Mr.Barletta and Mr.Rodney Davis, for their leadership on this important issue.  Rural areas are the heart of not only my district, but of America as a whole. They are the source of food and resources, and are home to millions of American families. When natural disasters come to these communities, we should be doing everything in our power to help them get back on their feet. Instead, the regulatory regime forces these areas to meet a higher and unfair threshold in order to get the FEMA resources that they need.  My district faced this problem back in 2013, after a tornado swept through Washington, Illinois, destroying nearly 1,000 homes. This was a massive loss, but FEMA's formula for public assistance kept Washington from getting the assistance it needed to repair the public infrastructure damaged by the storm. While individuals could get some relief for personal property, this damage to infrastructure affects every member of the community.  This is why I am a proud cosponsor and supporter of H.1665, the Disaster Declaration Improvement This bill will change and modernize FEMA's formula so that it is easier for rural areas and areas with lower population density to get the support and assistance they need after a disaster.  I urge my colleagues to vote for its passage today to ensure that all Americans, regardless of the town they live in, can know that help will be on the way after such tragic events happen.

I thank Ranking Member Jackson Lee, Chairman Goodlatte, and also Representative Ann Wagner of Missouri for her leadership in combating trafficking in The importance of a bipartisan approach cannot be overstated or diminished.  Over the years, we have made tremendous progress, but the work is far from over. The Put Trafficking Victims First Act is a great first step forward in addressing the perilous deficiencies in sex trafficking policies and services in  As an original cosponsor of this bill, I am grateful for the inclusion of my amendments that serve to further support and strengthen this important legislation by providing necessary language and focus on young victims in the child welfare system.  In drafting legislation that calls for data collection assessments to help identify and implement effective and responsive models of justice and relief services, we must always be cognizant of the need to draw awareness and find solutions to eradicate the devastating epidemic of young children who are in the U.child welfare system from becoming victims of sex trafficking.  In particular, it is imperative that we better identify and screen the characteristics of children and youth involved in the child welfare and justice systems and that we provide greater access to appropriate housing and services from trained trauma-informed care service providers. Far too often, we hear stories about victims who cannot access housing, shelter, or mental healthcare and are unable to expunge or seal their criminal records and are treated like criminals rather than victims.  As the cofounder of the Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth, I am[[Page H4488]]particularly concerned about what we are doing to combat the devastating epidemic of young girls in the foster care system falling prey to child exploitation and sex trafficking. I hear horrific stories of foster girls who have been trafficked far too often, and I hear that the average age of a girl being involved in trafficking is 12 years old.  Mr.Speaker, this week we have over 100 youth here from 98 different congressional districts who will be shadowing their Members of Congress tomorrow. We met with the youth yesterday, and a number of them stepped forward and talked about being involved in the trafficking system and how they fell through the cracks in child welfare.  It is important that we remember that the purpose of the child welfare system is to protect children who are abused or neglected. When we take custody of these children, then we--meaning the local, State, or Federal Government--in effect become their parents. So if your own child showed up missing and you don't do anything about it, then obviously you are considered responsible. This is exactly what is happening with child sex trafficking in the United  H.2473 further encourages States to implement screening mechanisms for all children entering the child welfare system and criminal and juvenile justice systems to better identify child trafficking and connect them with appropriate services. I urge my colleagues to vote for H.2473.  ",CREC-2017-05-23-pt1-PgH4484-3.txt,1996,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,23.0,July

This week, my focus is on the Obama administration's net neutrality policy.  The internet is one of the greatest innovations ever. This has largely been possible because of the Federal Government's regulatory absence from the industry. Yet the Obama administration, in one of many cases of overregulation, took a radical step to inappropriately insert government interference.  In 2015, the FCC adopted a rule to reclassify internet service providers as ``common carriers'' under title II of the Communications Act of 1934. This reclassification caused undue burdens for American ISPs and consumers.  The Trump administration has been supportive of rolling back the Obama-era regulation. Now Congress needs to limit the authority of Federal bureaucrats and preserve a free and open internet. We should repeal the 2015 rule and prevent the FCC from issuing a similar rule.

We can do better, and the people of Connecticut and around the country know we can do better.

14466,topic-id,447,"Mr.President, we have seen in the course of this debate some very high points and some points that I think in some ways we regretted. One of the high points for me was the return of Senator McCain, and I want to join all of my colleagues in saying how heartfelt our gratitude is for his return and his eloquence here about the need for us to work together.  Yet yesterday we also saw, in my view, a shameful and disgraceful mockery of our democracy when Senators proceeded, in effect, to a slogan, a shell of a bill, not a really substantive measure. Yet that shell itself will undermine the exchanges and insurance coverage for millions and millions of Americans by creating uncertainty, and this process itself will aggravate that fear.  I have now held five field hearings in Connecticut, and at each one I have heard from countless people with tears in their eyes telling me what the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid have meant to them, what repeal of it will mean to them, and how devastating and cataclysmic the damage will be.  Thousands of constituents have written, have called, and have also contacted others of my colleagues, as I have urged them to do, and I want to say how grateful I am to them for their continued activism and advocacy. We need to maintain this fight. I have heard from moms and dads about what would happen to their children. One said to me: We can't thrive as a nation or as individuals if we can't afford to be healthy.  So I ask my colleagues to listen to their constituents, to the people in their States, people like Conner and Mackenzie and Amelie and Evan and Amanda and Michelle and Jennifer and I described them on the floor in my previous talks. These voices and faces need to be brought here because there have been no hearings, no regular order, no democratic process, as we have an obligation to do.  If at some point my colleagues abandon this effort to repeal and decimate the Affordable Care Act, I stand ready to come across the aisle to work together to drive down the costs of healthcare--particularly pharmaceutical drugs--and to open the exchanges to more competition and create more choices for consumers among insurance companies. There are steps we can take together to improve this process. As Senator McCain urged us so powerfully, we need to go back to regular order, come together, and work across the aisle. There is no panacea. There is no instant solution. But we need to work together.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.

14317,topic-id,521,"Mr.Speaker, I also want to thank my colleague, Congressman Rodney Davis, for working with me to advance this long overdue legislation, which we call the Disaster Declaration Improvement  This bill seeks to bring fairness to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's disaster declaration process.  Right now, if a tornado, a flood, or any other natural disaster strikes a small town, like many of the ones I represent in the State of Illinois, FEMA's current per capita formula leaves much of rural America behind. That is because FEMA's current disaster assessment rules fail to take into account localized impacts on Main Streets and agricultural communities throughout our  This has left hardworking families in Illinois and rural States throughout the United States without access to the Federal relief they so badly need under these circumstances.  For instance, in my district, the city of Pekin was denied FEMA disaster recovery funding following a deadly tornado that had winds up to 120 miles per hour that ripped through the town in November of 2013.  Gary and Selena Cleer were in church on that Sunday afternoon when this tornado hit. They took shelter along with the rest of the congregation in the hallway to protect themselves. Finally, and with God's blessing, they were able to drive safely home, and they didn't even recognize what was in front of them. Much of their roof was gone, their garage had been torn away, and their battered car lay among all of the rubble.  The tornado destroyed about 200 other structures in this town of only 35,000 people. But this community received no public assistance dollars--zero. This was a direct result of FEMA's disaster declaration formula, which, again, makes it unnecessarily difficult for Illinois' smaller communities to receive the help that they need.  Mr.Speaker, we are not asking for a handout for rural In fact, in the Midwest, we are as resilient as they come, but we are certainly asking for a fair shake and the opportunity for all of our families to get the help that they need in a time of crisis.  A few million dollars of damage can devastate a smaller town or a rural community. That is why FEMA must give greater weight to the local impact of a disaster when making these decisions about the need for Federal assistance.  Our bill fixes an unfair formula that hurts too many of our smaller towns and villages across Illinois and across This bill had been included in the FEMA Disaster Assistance Reform Act of 2015, but it sat in the Senate without any action. Today we are working together to pass it once again because we can't solve this problem by ignoring it. I urge our friends in the Senate to take action.  With new flooding, damaging roads and infrastructure in places like Pekin, Peoria, and in southern Illinois where my friend, Mike Bost, serves and where Rodney Davis serves, I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this bill so that we can help ensure that hardworking families from the heartland have the support they need to get back on their feet after a disaster.

14394,topic-id,628,"Mr.President, I saw the remarks of the President of the United States in Youngstown, OH, and it has brought me to the floor this morning because the focus of some of his speech was on the economy and job creation. Well, I can tell the President right now that we need his urgent attention to making sure that we create jobs right now. It is not about something in the future; it is about right now.  There are over 40 projects worth $30 billion being held up because the Export-Import Bank does not have a quorum. It is incredibly important to get a functioning bank and to get a board that supports having the support of a credit agency to work with the private sector to finance the sale of U.S.-made products.  The President seems to embrace the notion that we should make things in I think we should make things in America, but I don't think that we sell them only in I actually want to sell the great manufactured products of the United States of America to overseas markets, to the 95 percent of consumers who are outside the United But because this administration has not shown the leadership to get a functioning Export-Import Bank, we continue to struggle. Those $30 billion in projects are being held up because we don't have a functioning quorum.  GE Aviation in Ohio--I wish he would have visited them because they decided to move part of their operations to Canada and Brazil, instead of expanding in Ohio, to take advantage of countries that actually have a credit agency. GE Aircraft Engines decided to open a turbine prop engine facility in Europe for the same reason. We are losing jobs simply because we don't have a tool to work with private-sector banking to make sure that the sale of U.S.-manufactured products actually gets done to countries and organizations in those countries that don't have the proper financing. GE supposedly said that they weren't going to move their corporate headquarters to Ohio because they did not support the reauthorization of the Export-Import  Between 2012 and 2016, the Export-Import Bank supported more than 255 export deals in Ohio from all sizes of companies, such as Haltec, which exports auto parts, and Anglo American Hardwoods, which exports wood products to the GE Aviation that I mentioned and GE Aircraft These deals were worth more than $2 billion.  What I am so frustrated about is that this administration has not kept its word in support of the Export-Import We continue today with the folly of having our Trade Ambassador show up before the Finance Committee and say that the Export-Import Bank is controversial. I reminded him that it was actually supported by a majority of Democrats and a majority of Republicans in the U.It was also supported by a majority of Republicans in the House of Representatives and the Democrats in the House of So how could it be so controversial if we reauthorized it?  But the White House has continued to have a double-edged strategy, pretend that they support the Export-Import Bank, and yet send up the name of a nominee to chair the bank who wants to destroy the bank and has made that intention clear.  If we want jobs in Ohio, we need to get the Export-Import Bank approving deals from manufacturers that are ready to close sales and create more jobs, so let's focus on the task at hand. I hope the President will stand up and clearly articulate the need and support for an Export-Import Bank and stop sending us the name of someone who just wants to destroy it.

The individual market is 7 percent of the overall market for health insurance.  What we have found with the expansion of Medicaid that has been done by both Democratic and Republican Governors is great success.[[Page S4242]]  I hope my Republican colleagues will heed the warnings of our Nation's Republican Governors and Democratic In June, a letter from seven bipartisan Governors was sent to Senate leaders. This is a letter by the Governors of Ohio, Montana, Nevada, Louisiana, Colorado, Massachusetts, and It shows the diversity of both our Nation and political parties. It says:       We believe that, first and foremost, Congress should focus      on improving our nation's private health insurance system.  Then they say:       Medicaid provisions included in this bill [that has been      proposed by the House] are particularly problematic. Instead,      we recommend Congress address factors we can all agree need      fixing.  So the message was clear from these Governors, including Republican Governors, and I hope my colleagues will listen to them. The Nation's Governors know because they have had to provide and be a partner on Medicaid for their citizens. They know how it affects their economy, and they know what it does when families in their States get access to healthcare. It reduces the bankruptcy rate. It helps people stay employed. It boosts All of these things are benefits of Medicaid expansion that we have seen in Washington It cut the uncompensated care cost in half. It also resulted in the creation of new jobs.  A nonpartisan study found that if the current bill we are debating, the House bill, is passed, state economies will shrink by $93 billion. So pulling the rug out from under Medicaid recipients would hurt jobs and hurt economies in Nevada, Alaska, and West West Virginia would lose more than 10,000 jobs, more than $1 billion in gross State product, and more than $1.7 billion in business output. Nevada would lose 3,300 healthcare jobs and Alaska would lose 2,600.  So all of these things are ways for us to say: If you are serious now--before you go home for the August recess--about protecting Medicaid and stopping this ridiculous war on Medicaid, vote for our motion. Stand up and say you understand that we may have challenges in the individual market, but it doesn't mean that we should cut people off of access to healthcare through  I thank the Presiding  I yield the floor.

14356,topic-id,1413,"Mr.President, a few weeks ago, I joined Senators Barrasso, Capito, Klobuchar, Boozman, and Baldwin in introducing 1514, the Hunting Heritage and Environmental Legacy Preservation--HELP--for Wildlife  This bill represents a more than $100 million annual Federal investment in the protecting the bay. The bill has several provisions, one of which reauthorizes the programs at the heart of restoring and maintaining the health of the Chesapeake Bay watershed. 1514 reauthorizes the U.Environmental Protection Agency's, EPA, Chesapeake Bay Program through 2022 at $90 million per year, which is more than the program has ever been funded in its history. This unique regional partnership, managed by EPA through the Chesapeake Bay Program office in Annapolis, helps program partners collaborate to achieve the goals of the voluntary, bipartisan Chesapeake Bay agreement. Because this program expired in 2005, reauthorizing the program is critical to secure necessary appropriations and reject the Trump administration's proposal to eliminate the program.  1514 also reauthorizes the Chesapeake Bay gateways and watertrails network and the Chesapeake Bay Gateways Grants Assistance Program, which provides $6 million per year throughout the watershed in technical and financial assistance to State, community, and nongovernmental partners to increase access to the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. The bill also reauthorizes the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, NFWF, until 2023. As the Nation's largest conservation grant-maker, NFWF has been instrumental in completing conservation projects in Maryland and around the Chesapeake In 2016, the State received nearly $5 million in funding for projects protecting and restoring habitat for fish and wildlife.  1514 also reauthorizes the North American Wetlands Conservation Act, NAWCA, which provides grants to increase and protect wetlands which not only provide habitat for wildlife, but also reduce the severity of flooding and coastal erosion, and improve water quality. In the 2014 to 2015 grant period alone, Maryland received $1 million from the NAWCA program, which was leveraged with nearly $3 million in additional contributions by outside partners to protect 1,600 acres of wetlands in the  The bill reauthorizes the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act for another 5 years and authorizes $6.5 million to be spent each year on conservation projects that protect more than 350 different species of birds which summer in the United States and winter in the tropical regions. Twenty-one different State birds are neotropical migrants, including Maryland's famous and beloved Baltimore  1514 codifies the National Fish Habitat Partnership, a collaboration between public agencies, private citizens, and nonprofits for promoting fish conservation. America is home to more than 3,000 species of fish, and 22 percent of the stream miles in this country are at high or very high risk of current habitat degradation. Over the past few years, $175,000 in funds from this program were used in Maryland to rehabilitate three different streams, funding which was 27 matched by $843,000 from private investors. The partnership estimates that the improved habitat in the three streams for brook trout provided a total socio/economic impact of $9.2 million.  I am proud that 1514 contains so many provisions to help the Chesapeake Bay and the State of  I would like to speak for a minute about the importance of reauthorizing these programs and the ``power of the purse.'' As my colleagues in the Senate well know, the ``power of the purse'' is the two-step process of authorizing and appropriating. Authorizing legislation can establish, continue, or change programs and activities, and it signals to the appropriators that they should fund these programs. The budget process is not complete until the appropriations process provides the actual funding for the activities and programs established through the authorization process.  Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney has said that President Donald Trump is sending a deliberate message to Congress about spending money on unauthorized programs. With the President putting an emphasis on boosting defense spending without adding to the deficit, administration officials are looking closely at expired authorizations. By reauthorizing these programs, we are sending our own clear message back: these programs matter to our constituents and to us.  Mr.Mulvaney said lawmakers too often ignore the ``regular order'' process of approving a budget, authorizing specific programs, and then appropriating the money for those programs. ``We actually spend a lot of money in the federal government on programs that aren't authorized at all,'' he said. ``Either they used to be authorized and they lapsed, or they were never authorized in the first place. They simply were appropriated without any authorization. It's the wrong way to do it.''[[Page S3989]]Because of President Trump and Director Mulvaney's position, it is more important than ever that the essential programs contained in 1514 be reauthorized.  None of these reauthorizations are more important to Maryland than EPA's Chesapeake Bay In 1987, Congress ratified the Chesapeake Bay Program, a voluntary partnership among the watershed States and the EPA, under the Clean Water The 1987 legislation supported cleanup efforts with a program of grants and scientific research. In 2000, Congress directed the EPA to ``ensure that management plans are developed and implementation is begun'' to meet the goals of the Chesapeake Bay In June 2014, the Governors of the six States in the watershed signed a new voluntary Chesapeake Bay watershed agreement to work in partnership with the Federal Government through the Chesapeake Bay The watershed agreement has ten goals to improve water quality in local rivers and streams and the Chesapeake Bay by 2025.  The program office is housed within the EPA, which provides staff and funding. Primary funding for the program comes from State governments. Federal funding was first authorized at $40 million annually from fiscal year 2001 to fiscal year 2005 to fund environmental studies and grants that support restoration activities in the Chesapeake Congress has appropriated funds for the Program since the authorization for appropriations expired in fiscal year 2005. In fiscal year 2017, for instance, Congress appropriated $73 million for the program. The President's fiscal year 2018 budget eliminates funding for the program and cuts other programs that also benefit the bay across several Federal agency partners' budgets.  A healthy bay means a healthy economy, and this recovery cannot be accomplished without a strong Federal commitment. At a time when we have seen nutrient levels dropping and water quality improving, I am deeply disappointed President Trump is intent on turning the clock back to a time when a swath of the Chesapeake Bay in mid-summer was a hypoxic low-oxygen zone or ``dead zone''.  The most recent State of the Bay report, issued biannually by the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, evaluates the progressing and overall health of the Bay for 2014 to 2016. The Chesapeake Bay's health was given a grade of C-minus, a slight improvement from the previous State of the Bay report in 2014. This progress is due largely to the continued implementation of the Chesapeake Clean Water This improvement, though modest, was hard-won. It is the result of countless hours of grueling work by State and Federal public servants and nonprofit workers, as well as citizens' actions across the watershed. A grade of C-minus is hardly an acceptable endpoint. To reach an A, which would represent a saved and comprehensively healthy Bay, we will need redouble and accelerate our efforts. I am determined to pass on a vibrant and healthy Chesapeake Bay to the next generation, for the sake of public health and the local economies that depend on a clean and bountiful bay. This is all the more reason that we need to reauthorize the Chesapeake Bay Program and make sure that it is fully funded in this year's appropriations bill.  Many Marylanders and national wildlife organizations are happy about the HELP for Wildlife The Choose Clean Water Coalition and Blue Water Baltimore have issued statements of support. The Chesapeake Bay Foundation will testify in support of this bill next week in a legislative hearing the Environment and Public Works Committee is holding. The National Wildlife Federation's Collin O'Mara said the bill ``represents a great bipartisan effort to conserve America's outdoor heritage for hunters, anglers, campers, hikers, and wildlife enthusiasts, while helping to restore America's wildlife populations.'' The Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership said the bill is ``the strongest legislative package of sportsmen's priorities in years.''  As 1514 moves out of the Environment and Public Works Committee and to the Senate floor in the coming weeks, I urge my colleagues to support this bill that is critical not only to the Chesapeake Bay and the State of Maryland, but to conservation efforts in every State across the                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-13-pt1-PgS3988-3.txt,,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,13.0,June
14384,topic-id,948,"Mr.President, today I wish to recognize May as Asian Pacific American Heritage Month and celebrate the many contributions of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, The Asian American and Pacific Islander community is diverse and draws from a variety of distinct cultures, each of which has strengthened this country--providing leaders, innovators, scientists, activists, artists, and citizens.  As we take the time to recognize Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and their heritage, it would be negligent to forget that this year marks 75 years since President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066. He signed Executive Order 9066 in the aftermath of the attack on Pearl Harbor and authorized the Department of War--today known as the Department of Defense--to establish ``military zones.'' The military had complete authority over these zones, including control over who entered and who was permitted to leave. The military zones became internment camps. In total, some 75,000 Americans of Japanese ancestry and 45,000 Japanese nationals were imprisoned in these camps across the country.  At the time, many attempted to justify the internment camps by citing Japan's attack on Pearl They cited the need to protect our homeland from potential espionage. They cited the fact that Japan was our wartime enemy. They cited the likelihood that the next attack would come from someone ``looking like'' the enemy.  What they failed to explain was why no internment camps were established for Americans of German ancestry--or Italian ancestry. Japan was not our only wartime enemy; yet Japanese Americans were the only ones thrust into imprisonment under the guise of ``national security.''  It is not difficult to guess why. Japanese Americans were targeted because their heritage was thought to be easier to perceive. Of course, in many cases, the U.Department of War did not draw distinctions between Americans of Japanese ancestry and Americans of other Asian or Pacific Islander ancestry. If you were thought to look like the enemy, you were a target--full stop--and were at risk of being imprisoned illegally by the American  This is one of the darkest periods in our history. We must not forget it. We cannot forget the tens of thousands of innocent families who were stripped of their basic human and legal rights and[[Page S3205]]property, racially profiled, and degraded. We cannot forget that ``national security'' was then--and is now--a poor justification for racial profiling and a transparent attempt to sanction and institutionalize racism.  These are lessons the Asian American and Pacific Islander community has carried for generations, all while making our country stronger and more inclusive. The AAPI experiences--when we take the time to hear them--force us to engage in self-reflection, to be more aware of our own biases, and more cautious of our own impulses.  As the former chairman and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia and the Pacific, I have worked hard to stay mindful of the needs and concerns of the AAPI community. I have learned that, while we have come a very long way over the past 75 years, the AAPI community still battles nativism that portrays its members as something other than ``real'' They still bear the burden and pain of discrimination, and they still struggle to have their voice and their perspective heard during the great debates of our time.  The changes Republicans are seeking on healthcare, for example, would have far-reaching consequences for the AAPI community. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have one of the highest incidences of Hepatitis In fact, in 2013, they had the highest Hepatitis A rates out of any ethnic group in the country. In 2015, tuberculosis was 30 times more common among Asian Americans than among any other group. Both Hepatitis A and tuberculosis would be considered preexisting conditions--conditions that would have made many Asian American and Pacific Islanders uninsurable before President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law and conditions that would result in sky-high premiums under the misguided American Health Care  By comparison, the Affordable Care Act has reduced the uninsured rate for minority communities by at least 35 percent. It also expanded Medicaid, allowing over 250,000 more Maryland beneficiaries to access an array of mental health services like therapy, psychiatric rehabilitation, and many others. The Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion had similar positive impacts for mental health services across the country, which affects Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders directly as they continue to work tirelessly to reduce suicide rates. For these reasons, when we think of healthcare, we must consider the human cost our policies inflict on every community--on every  Likewise, immigration bans based on country of origin, race, or religion are awakening newfound fear that minority communities will be targeted once more, that racial profiling will rear its ugly head again, licensed and sanctioned by the Federal The AAPI community's concern is warranted; people's fear is understandable. Each Member of Congress must realize that caring about the mistakes of our past means working with purpose and with conviction to prevent them from happening again in the present. We must use our votes where our values need defending and our voices where there is silence.  As we move forward through Asian Pacific American Heritage Month and beyond, I implore every member of this Chamber to remember that the best way to honor that heritage is to respect the community bearing it. Hearing their experiences, carrying their lessons with us into the policy arena, and considering their needs and fears as our own, these are the substantive ways by which we can truly honor Asian American and Pacific Islander I am committed to honoring it accordingly and join every American of Asian or Pacific Islander heritage in celebrating this month as their own.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-25-pt1-PgS3204-3.txt,,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,25.0,June
14490,topic-id,1416,"Mr.President, I have listened very carefully to the majority leader and his requests that we come forward and bring amendments to the floor--all of our ideas about how we can improve our healthcare system so that this would be an opportunity through budget reconciliation for us to deal with those issues.  I asked my staff to prepare amendments in order to protect the Medicaid system from cuts. I asked my staff to prepare amendments to protect the essential health benefits that are in the Affordable Care Act because it is important that we preserve those benefits, whether it is mental health and addiction services or one that is particularly important to Maryland; that is, pediatric dental. In Maryland, we all recall the loss of a 12-year-old not too many years ago because he couldn't get dental care--Deamonte  I asked my staff to take a look at preparing amendments to protect minority health and health disparities because the Affordable Care Act made tremendous advancements in trying to close that gap on the disparities in minority health and health disparities. I asked my staff to take a look at the tax provisions because we want to make sure that we are not giving tax cuts to wealthy people at the expense of cutting the Medicaid system. I asked them to look at this in a lot of different ways.  Listening to the majority leader, I also have introduced legislation that I will talk about that could build on the Affordable Care Act, and I was wondering what bill I should amend? What is the bill that we are considering? It is not the bill that Senator McConnell brought forward because that bill was defeated. It is not the repeal--and we are starting with a blank slate--because that was defeated. I don't believe it is the House bill because that has been discredited, called a mean bill by the President, as well as by Members of this body, who said it has no chance of passing. So my dilemma is that I don't know what I should be amending.  I expect we will get to see another bill somewhere along the process with virtually no notice and no opportunity to read and no opportunity to amend, but the majority leader says I am going to have that opportunity. Yet we don't know what the bill is that I am supposed to be addressing my amendments to.  We know that all the bills we have seen today--every single one from the Republicans--have been scored by the Congressional Budget Office as to tens of millions of Americans losing their insurance coverage--tens of millions. I understand it is about 33 million if we just repeal the Affordable Care Act, 22 million if we use the type of replacement that the majority leader was suggesting. All of those move in the wrong direction.  We also know that in every one of these proposals to date, insurance premiums are going to go up, not down.  That is one thing I have heard from my constituents. They would like to see us bring down the growth rate of health insurance costs and healthcare, not increase it. So, yes, I would like to be able to offer amendments, but I don't know what to offer amendments to.  I also am concerned when I see that every one of the bills that have been suggested by the Republicans would reverse the protections that we put in law against the wrong practices--the discriminatory practices--of insurance companies. I have talked to many of my constituents who tell me that if we reimpose caps, either yearly or lifetime--they have the circumstance where their child was born with a disability and that cap would have been expended within a matter of months--they would be left without insurance coverage. They tell me about how preexisting conditions could be jeopardized. All of us have some form of preexisting condition, and, on a lot of these plans that are being suggested where you could choose the type of coverage you want, insurance companies are not going to offer the benefits you need. People who have challenges are going to be most discriminated against. So I don't quite understand how I can offer amendments and we could have a vote on the floor when we don't know what we are trying to amend.[[Page S4260]]  I must state that there is a common theme here, and we know it. We know that there is now talk that the majority leader might bring up, sometime during this process, what has been called in the press a ``skinny'' bill. I call it a slow death of the Affordable Care Act, and, in fact, I am afraid it might be a fast death of the Affordable Care Act because, if the reports are accurate, one of the provisions that the majority leader is looking to bring in as the final bill that we would vote on would eliminate the requirement that companies have to provide insurance coverage to their employees and individuals must have coverage.  Now that seems innocent enough, except for the tens of millions who are going to lose their insurance coverage--people who are working for companies that decide to terminate their policies, healthy people who decide not to buy insurance policies. I believe you are going to find that there still will be tens of millions of people losing their insurance coverage, and that is unacceptable. But it goes beyond that. That proposal will also increase premium costs by a very large percent. Why?  Think about this for a moment. If you don't have to buy insurance and you are young and healthy, are you going to buy insurance or not? Many will say no until they need the insurance, and then they will buy the insurance. Actuaries tell us that without the requirement to have insurance, the insurance pools will contain a very high percentage of adverse risks--people at higher risk--and when that happens, the purpose of insurance to spread the risk is no longer done. It means premiums will go up dramatically. That doesn't help the people who are going to need it.  What you also find when you eliminate this requirement is that people get what we call job locked. They may have a company that provides health benefits, but now they may have to leave that company. But if they want to leave that company and start a job or go to another job that doesn't have insurance, they are locked into where they work. All of that adds to anxiety, adds to lack of coverage, adds to people who don't have health insurance, adds to people not getting adequate healthcare, adds to bankruptcies, adds to the problems that we addressed with the Affordable Care  But there is another explanation here. Maybe this is just a shell bill that is going to go back--hopefully, as the Republicans believe, but I hope it does not happen--to the House, and then we will put in the Medicaid cuts and the tax relief and all the other things that are not in the bill. This is just a shell to get us back to one of the bills that couldn't get the votes here on the floor, where tens of millions of people will lose their insurance coverage, premiums will go up, and insurance company arbitrary and discriminatory practices will return.  Every one of these proposals--every single one--moves us in the wrong direction in healthcare. We recognize that we can improve our healthcare system. I am for improving our healthcare system. I think we can work together--Democrats and Republicans--to improve our healthcare system.  So here is my request: Vote for the Casey motion. Why? For two reasons. One, I would hope that on this anniversary of the ADA, or the Americans with Disabilities Act, we would want to do no harm to those with disabilities in our healthcare system and they would have adequate coverage. I was in a celebration over the weekend in Baltimore City with the disabilities community. We celebrated one of the great victories in America, the Americans with Disabilities Act--a bipartisan bill, with Democrats and Republicans coming together in a proud moment, in the best traditions of the Senate, to say that people with disabilities will be treated fairly in On this day we should adopt the Casey motion on the issue of protecting people with disabilities.

There is a second part to the Casey motion that sends it back to committee so we can use the regular process, as Senator McCain talked about yesterday. Let's have the committee hearings, as Senator Alexander talked about. Let's have the committee markups and work together. I introduced legislation that would bring down the cost of healthcare and lower the rate of increase of individual premiums. I do that by suggesting more competition in the individual marketplace, by having a public option, by providing stronger subsidies to lower income families, by making sure that cost-sharing is in fact paid for so we don't have that uncertainty, with the reinsurance that Senator Carper was talking about to deal with the overall cost of healthcare, by dealing with prescription drug costs, and by dealing with coordinated care so that we can deal with the whole patient rather than their individual disease.  All of those issues would improve the Affordable Care Act, but before we get there, we have to get off of this train. We have to stop this disastrous course. I am going to do everything in my power to make sure that, as to the bill we have, whenever it comes forward, we stop it right here, and then work together, Democrats and Republicans, to improve our healthcare system, not to take away insurance coverage and increase costs for so many  With that, I yield the floor.

14523,topic-id,482,"Madam President, I intend to offer a motion to commit the reconciliation bill to the Finance Committee with instructions to report the bill back to the Senate within 3 days, not counting any day on which the Senate is not in session, with changes eliminating provisions that would weaken access to essential health benefits, reduce access to affordable preventive services, and undermine the prohibition of annual and lifetime limits and caps on out-of-pocket expenditures for health insurance plans.  I am offering this motion because the reconciliation bill affects tens of millions of Americans who gained health coverage under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, The reconciliation bill allows insurers to eliminate coverage of essential health benefits. Insurance companies could exclude essential benefits like maternity care, substance use disorder treatment, mental healthcare, prescription drugs, and hospitalization--the very services people buy insurance to obtain. Before the ACA, one-third of individual market health plans did not cover substance use disorder services, nearly one-fifth of those plans did not cover mental health, and only nine States required all insurers on the individual market to cover maternity care.  Allowing States to waive essential health benefits would also allow insurance companies to reinstate annual and lifetime caps. This means that a premature baby could exceed its lifetime limit within its first few months of life or that a cancer patient could hit an annual cap just a couple of months into treatment.  Before the ACA, too many people and families were hurt physically and financially because they could not afford access to healthcare. They didn't get the tests they needed. Perhaps they did not catch a preventable disease early enough--so the treatment costs skyrocketed. We saw too many families go through bankruptcy because they could not afford the healthcare that they needed. We saw too many people literally cutting their prescription pills in half, hoping to stretch out their medicine because they could not afford more, even though they knew they were compromising their health.

I am offering this motion because communities of color and disenfranchised communities have faced significant barriers to accessing affordable health coverage, and these barriers have contributed to health disparities, which are evident in higher rates of diabetes, heart disease, hepatitis B, HIV/AIDS and infant mortality, among other conditions. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's vital coverage reforms, which include Medicaid expansion, cost sharing reductions, eliminating annual and lifetime limits, and creating coverage options for individuals with preexisting conditions, has led to sharp declines in the uninsured rates for minorities and low-income populations. With the implementation of the major ACA coverage provisions in 2014, the uninsured rate dropped dramatically and continued to fall in 2015. In 2015, the nonelderly uninsured rate was 10.5 percent, the lowest rate in decades, with the most dramatic changes seen among low-income Latino Americans, African Americans, and Asian  Minorities now make up more than 35 percent of the American population, and that number is expected to rise in the future.

14634,topic-id,488,"Mr.President, today I wish to ask my Senate colleagues to join me in designating April 2017 as National Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia Awareness Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia, also known as CDH, is a birth defect that occurs when the fetal diaphragm fails to fully develop, allowing abdominal organs to move into the chest cavity and preventing lung growth. When the lungs do not develop properly during pregnancy, it can be difficult for the baby to breathe after birth, or the baby is unable to take in enough oxygen to stay healthy. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a birth defect that occurs in 1 out of every 2,500 live births worldwide. Only about 50 percent of CDH cases are diagnosed in utero. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, estimates that CDH affects 1,600 babies in the U.each year. Every 10 minutes, a baby is born with CDH, adding up to more than 700,000 babies with CDH since 2000. According to the CDC, babies born with CDH experience a high mortality rate ranging from 20 to 60 percent, depending on the severity of the defect and the treatments available at delivery; yet most people have never heard of  Researchers are making great progress to determine the cause of this birth defect and to identify optimal treatment methods. In fiscal year 2017, the National Institutes of Health funded approximately $4 million in CDH research, an increase of $700,000 from fiscal year 2015. There is still much progress to be made, however. The cause of CDH remains unknown, and there currently is no cure. CDH survivors often endure long-term complications, such as congenital heart defects and developmental delays, and the average CDH survivor will face postnatal care of more than $100,000.  Last month, members from the Association of Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia Research, Awareness and Support, also known as CHERUBS, visited my office. Among them were David and Allison Finger and their daughter Vivienne from Hyattsville, Vivienne was born with CDH and had to spend 60 days in the newborn intensive care unit after birth and had to have surgery to repair the hernia when she was only 3 weeks old. On March 18, 2017, Vivienne celebrated her second birthday and is doing very well. Babies like Vivienne, born with CDH, today have a better chance of survival due to early detection and research on treatment options.[[Page S2536]]  For these reasons, I am proud my colleague the junior Senator from Alabama, Mr.Strange, has joined me in submitting a resolution designating April 2017 as National Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia Awareness In previous years, I was pleased to work with his predecessor, Senator Sessions, on this resolution. Designating this month in this fashion provides an opportunity to raise public awareness about CDH; promote quality prenatal care and ultrasounds to detect CDH in utero; and support finding for the research necessary to improve screening and treatment of CDH, discover the causes of CDH, and develop a cure for  ",CREC-2017-04-25-pt1-PgS2535-4.txt,,SUPPORT THE GENERAL AVIATION COMMUNITY,2017.0,25.0,June
14484,topic-id,15,I am happy to yield.  The PRESIDING The Senator from                 Amendment 288 to Amendment 267  ,CREC-2017-07-26-pt1-PgS4227-9.txt,179,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,26.0,June
14488,topic-id,2383,"I was happy to yield. Good to see you.  Mr.President, I want to say a few words about If you ask most people in this country ``What is ObamaCare?'' my guess is, they probably wouldn't know. Those who do might think it has something to do with the exchanges that would allow people to have coverage who don't have coverage on their own. They are not in a large group plan and they are not insured by their employer. They are not covered by They are not covered by Maybe they are not a veteran. And 5 or 6 or 7 percent of the people today get their coverage from something called the exchanges.  We have large purchasing pools in each State that are insured by private health insurance. That was not invented by Barack People call it ObamaCare, but its roots go back well before he was a U.Senator, much less before he was President of the United The idea of these large purchasing pools in each State--called exchanges--goes back to, as far as I can tell, 1993, when the new First Lady, Hillary Clinton, was offering to begin work to find a way to do what I think every President since Harry Truman has tried to do, and that is three things: provide better coverage for people in this country, do so at less cost, and cover everybody. I believe that has been the goal of every President since Harry  When Lyndon Johnson was President, some notable progress was made with the introduction of Medicare and But there were still a lot of people who, in 1993--in fact, in 2003 and 2008 and 2009--who didn't have healthcare coverage in this country, tens of millions of people.  In 1993, when Hillary Clinton worked on what was called--in some cases derisively--HillaryCare, she and others said to Republicans: Well, where is your idea? What is your idea? At least we have an idea. The Republicans apparently turned to the Heritage Foundation and said: Help us come up with an alternative. And Heritage did. The alternative they came up with was a market-based approach to providing coverage for people. The idea was that in every State across the country, something called an exchange or marketplace would be created, which is really a large purchasing pool for people who don't have coverage.  So the idea of the exchanges originally suggested by Hillary were introduced in the U.Senate by a Republican Senator from Rhode Island named John Chafee, who was a very good man, a marine veteran, a former Governor, and a greatly admired U.He offered legislation to do five things. As far as I can tell, all ideas were suggested by the Heritage  1, create purchasing pools in every People who didn't have coverage could buy their coverage as a member of a much larger purchasing pool, and by doing that, bring down the cost of coverage.  The second thing in the Chafee legislation in 1993 was to allow folks who bought their coverage through the exchanges to be eligible for a slight tax credit--the lower their income, the bigger the tax credit. When their income reached a certain level, the tax credit would go away.  The third component of the Chafee proposal--again, going back to Heritage--was the idea of individual mandates. You can't make people get coverage, but in the case of the Chafee legislation, provide for a monetary fine for people who failed to get coverage. Over time, the amount of that fine would go up. The idea was to make sure that younger, healthier people would get healthcare coverage, and they would sign up for coverage in the exchanges. That way, the insurance companies would have a healthy mix of people to insure. Otherwise, people would wait until they were really sick--they need to go see a doctor, go to the hospital, or have an operation--to get their coverage, and then the health insurance companies would be left with a tough mix of people to insure. Financially, that would be very challenging for health insurance companies. They said: We need something to ensure that young, healthy people get their coverage through the exchanges.  The fourth piece of the 1993 legislation offered by Senator Chafee said that employers of a certain size, with a certain number of employees, have to cover their employees. You don't have to cover them 100 percent for their insurance and their family's insurance, but they have to be covered with insurance and have access to health insurance through their employer.  The fifth and last piece of ObamaCare, which is really the Heritage Foundation's idea, was a prohibition against health insurance companies saying to people who have a preexisting condition--they had to cover people with preexisting conditions in these exchanges.  That is what people think of and call  Barack Obama is a bright guy. I knew him before he was a U.I knew him when he was a State senator. He didn't invent it. It was not made up in his head. The source of those ideas was originally the Heritage I actually think they are good ideas. I thought they were good ideas then, and I think they are good ideas now.  Somewhere between 1993 and 2009, when we debated on this floor the Affordable Care Act--including exchanges, tax credits, the individual mandate, the employer mandate, a prohibition against insurance companies not covering people with preexisting conditions--somewhere between 1993 and the debate here in 2009 on the Affordable Care Act, a Governor of Massachusetts said: Why don't we try to be the first State to provide healthcare coverage for everybody? And they took that Chafee legislation--the Heritage Foundation idea--dusted it off, and turned it into It actually worked pretty well. They sure covered a whole lot of people in that State who hadn't been covered before. They covered a lot of people who were not eligible for Medicaid, not eligible for Medicare, maybe not a veteran. They were not receiving coverage from a large group plan, so they now had an option to get coverage in the exchanges.  For those who chose not to in Massachusetts, they had to pay a fine. As it turns out, it was not a very big fine, and it went up over time but not quickly and not very high. So did some people who were young and healthy get coverage in the exchanges in Massachusetts? If you asked some of the people who were involved with Governor Romney at that time, they would say that if they had to do it over again, the fine would have started a little bigger and gone up a little faster in order to make sure healthier, insurable people got into the exchanges for their coverage.  Well, in 2009, we were here on this floor and debating what some people[[Page S4258]]still call ObamaCare, but it is something else. It is really It is really It is really But it ain't It is a market-based idea to get coverage for people. I think it happens to be a good idea.  Right now, this administration has done their dead level best to destabilize the exchanges. They made it a question of whether the individual mandates will be enforced. If young, healthy people decline to sign up for coverage, will there be a fine they would have to pay? Will it go up over time? This administration has thrown big doubt on that. As a result, a lot of young people haven't signed up. They are not sure they really need to.  We had something in place for a couple of years called CRAs, cost-sharing arrangements. Think, if you will, about people who are buying their healthcare coverage on the exchanges. Their income is under 250 percent of poverty. For several years now, they have been able to get help paying down their copays and their deductibles when they get their coverage on the exchanges.  What this administration has sought to do is throw doubt on whether those cost-sharing arrangements will continue. What has happened as a result is the health insurance companies, which lost their shirts in 2014, raised premiums, deductibles, and copays. They lost money again in 2015, but less. They raised premiums, deductibles, and copays, and lost money in 2016, but less. Some of them even actually made some money. They were not in a death spiral. According to Standard and Poor's, they were actually coming to a stronger financial position.  Enter into that this administration throwing doubt on whether the exchange are going to be around, the individual mandate is going to be enforced, these cost-sharing reductions are going to continue to be offered. That is why a lot of the health insurance companies in this country decided they are going to get out in different They are not going to offer coverage in a number of States, a number of counties. That is why. Businesses need certainty and they need predictability, and that includes health insurance costs. Frankly, they didn't have that certainty and predictability.  If we are smart about it, we will hit the ``pause'' button and maybe, before we do anything else, provide the certainty and the stability in the exchanges that are needed. And for the health insurance companies, make sure they will offer coverage without having to fear that they will be back in 2014 and lose their shirts again. That is not why they are in business.  There are three things that need to be done in order to stabilize the exchanges.  The first thing that needs to be done is the individual mandate, which we have by law. It says: If you don't have healthcare coverage, get your coverage on the exchange. If you choose not to, you have to pay a fine. Over time, that fine goes up.  We need to preserve something that works like the individual mandate--maybe, ideally, the individual mandate as it is, and if we can't get the votes for that, then something that works at least as well as the individual mandate in making sure people--healthy people too--get their coverage on the exchanges if they are eligible.  The second thing we ought to do is reinsurance. Senator Kaine, myself, and others, including some recovering Governors who serve here in the Senate, have cosponsored legislation that we have described as reinsurance. I am told it has been around forever in the insurance business, and it is one of the reasons the Medicare Part D drug program is successful and works.  The way it works, quite simply, is this: Say an individual who has serious medical problems gets their coverage in the exchanges. They first start in 2018. In 2018, 2019, and 2020, for a person who has significant health challenges and is expensive to insure, the first $50,000 of their cost to the insurer in a year would be borne by the insurer. Between $50,000 and $500,000 for one individual for one year, the Federal Government would pay 80 percent of that. It is reinsurance.  For anything over that in those 3 years, 2018 through 2020, the first 3 years, anything between $50 and $500,000, the Federal Government would pay 80 percent.  Starting in 2021 and beyond, the reinsurance program would continue, but it would be a little bit different. In 2021 and beyond, the first $100,000 of costs incurred by an individual covered by a policy in the exchange--the first $100,000 would be on the insurance company. They would have the liability. Anything between $100,000 and $500,000 in one year for that individual, 80 percent of that cost would be borne by the Federal Anything above $500,000 from 2021 and beyond would be borne, again, by the insurance company. It is called reinsurance.  The last piece of the three is to make it clear that these cost-sharing reductions are reduced and make sure that the copays and the deductibles will continue to be subsidized by the Federal It will reduce the out-of-pocket costs for people whose income is below 250 percent of poverty.  If we do those three things, the insurance companies tell us we will stabilize the exchanges. They will have a healthy group of people to insure. More insurance companies will come in to provide coverage in States and in counties. More insurance companies providing policies and coverage leads to competition. The competition leads to better quality coverage, and the competition leads to lower prices--lower prices for individuals who are getting their coverage in the exchanges and lower prices, we are told, for Uncle The Federal Government, the costs to the Treasury, will be reduced, as well, if we do these three things.  Again, we are told by the health insurance companies that have been reluctant to stay in the exchanges, if we do those three things, we would reduce the cost of premiums in the exchanges by 25 to 35 percent. That helps individuals get their coverage, and it helps the government, too, in reducing our exposure. I think that makes a lot of sense.  Unfortunately, what our colleagues here on the floor are talking about doing--and the rumors we hear about some kind of skinny repeal--certainly, it doesn't stabilize the exchanges. It does more to destabilize the exchanges. That isn't where we need to go.  We need to hit the pause button and say: Let's stabilize the exchanges, and then let's revert to regular order. People have ideas on health insurance. Let's introduce bills. Let's have hearings with witnesses who come in and say what is good or what is bad. The witnesses could include Governors, health insurance folks, providers, normal people.  Let's have a debate. Let Members offer amendments in committee, have votes, report the bills out, and eventually bring them here and go through the same thing. We call that regular order. John McCain, in his return speech yesterday--thank God he is back--called again and again for return to regular order. We need to do that, and if we do, we will end up not with a Democratic victory or a Republican victory or a Trump victory, we might win a victory for democracy and actually doing what is right and what needs to be done. That, most of all, is what we need to do.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from New  ",CREC-2017-07-26-pt1-PgS4227-9.txt,179,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,26.0,July

14477,topic-id,1836,"Mr.President, first, I thank my friend from Indiana, Senator Donnelly, for his remarks this afternoon and also for his efforts to help to protect and preserve Medicaid so that hundreds of thousands of people in our States and across the country can continue to live in the community.  I want to point out that today is the 27th anniversary of the signing of the Americans with Disabilities This legislation, known as the Americans with Disabilities Act, is 27 years old. It is a piece of legislation that both recognizes and guarantees the rights of people with disabilities. It is, at its heart, a civil rights bill, one that promotes and promises liberty and freedom for people with disabilities--the liberty and freedom that all Americans are promised, that our founding documents guarantee, and that we in the Senate are charged with protecting for all citizens.  We should be celebrating the liberty and freedom of people with disabilities, but instead of having a celebration of the Americans with Disabilities Act on this anniversary day, the Senate Republican bill--which, I guess, is basically the House bill that we are on right now--threatens that freedom and threatens that liberty that was accorded in the Americans with Disabilities Act with regard to those with disabilities.  Now, I have heard a lot of speeches on this floor by my Republican colleagues about freedom and liberty in the context of healthcare--lots of speeches about both of those words. I would argue that, if you consider this legislation and the Senate versions of it that came after the House bill, all of these Republican healthcare bills were really, simply, about decimating Medicaid, limiting community-based care, and cutting long-term services and support, which will rob people with disabilities of their rights that the Americans with Disabilities Act advanced.[[Page S4253]]  I think everyone here knows the disabilities story. I will just do a quick summary.  For centuries, people with disabilities have been placed against their will in institutions like this one. This is a building in When it was open and operating, it was known as There were lots of places like this across the country, not just in one or two These institutions were, in fact, over time, warehouses, in which people had few, if any, rights. They were told what time to wake up, what time to go to bed, and when to eat. They were told they could never leave. That was the basic set of rules they lived by when they lived in institutions like that. These were places where choice was unknown and where freedom, liberty, and self-determination were also unknown.  Over the past 50 years, we have made some improvements--slow improvements--with the voices of people with disabilities leading the way. Throughout those 50 years, individuals and families have fought for their freedom and have worked to create laws that protect their freedom.  For example, the 1973 Rehabilitation Act Amendments and the Americans with Disabilities Act affirmed and protected the rights of people with disabilities to have access to all of society. The 1999 Olmstead Supreme Court decision reaffirmed the right of people with disabilities to live where they want to live and to be free of the confines of an institution.  Let's take it from the institution down to the individual--to individuals like Jensen, who is pictured right here. People like Jensen, who were once forced to live in nursing homes, now live where they want to live and pursue their dreams. Yet we know that rights alone do not equal freedom and liberty for people with disabilities.  Medicaid provides the supports that are necessary to live in the community and to have that full measure of freedom and that full measure of choice. Medicaid protects the hard-won rights of people with disabilities to have real choices. Medicaid home-based and community-based supports mean that people with disabilities can live in their own apartments, hold jobs, and contribute to their communities. Medicaid makes it possible to use the talents, skills, and knowledge of people with disabilities. Medicaid makes their rights a reality.  Do not take my word for it. Just ask the people who were here today in the Gallery, the people who are outside this Chamber and are walking the halls of the Senate, walking throughout the buildings, marching, demonstrating, and greeting people on the streets, with some of them staying overnight at one place to make their voices heard. Ask the members of Ask the members of the National Council on Independent Ask The Arc's 700 affiliates around the country. Ask the folks from Easterseals, the Association of University Centers on Disabilities, the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, and on and on and on--groups across the country that are telling us with one voice: Do not move forward with cuts to Medicaid as have been proposed in each of these bills.  These Americans will tell you that their rights are not real without community supports. This bill will drive people back into those institutions that I just showed you a picture of.  In the midst of voting on my amendment--which would basically say: Let's go back to the committee of jurisdiction--in this case, the Finance Committee--and spend some time to have some hearings, have some regular order, which some have called for here, and really consider this issue seriously--I know there will be talk that some will reject my amendment and will introduce and maybe have a vote on a sense of the  There is a time and a place for that kind of measure when the Senate speaks with one voice on a matter. This is not one of those times. This is a time when we have to do more than just have a sense of the We have to be serious about a particular matter of public policy--in this case, of making sure that we protect people with disabilities so that they have all of the rights and all of the promises fulfilled in the Americans with Disabilities Act and other legislation.  So we are hearing that there might be a sense of the Senate offered as a side-by-side to the amendment that I will offer. This is totally inadequate in terms of the serious issue that we are here to talk about--in this case, protecting people with disabilities. It is a totally inadequate response to that. The people with disabilities who are in the Gallery, who are in the reception area, or who are back at home in congressional districts and States--those folks in each and every community around the country--want to ensure that the promise that we made to them in the ADA and in other measures will be kept--that we will keep our promise. If Medicaid community-based services are slashed, statements by the Senate will not help very much.  What will we likely have in front of us in the next couple of hours or between today and tomorrow?  I know it has been described in a lot of ways, if the Republicans want to get there. Here is the way I describe it. It is a congressional Republican scheme that they are working on to get to repeal--not repeal and replace. In this case, it would be repeal and decimate--decimating Medicaid, repealing the entire Patient Protection and Affordable Care  Some here will argue that they can support this because this next version--this scheme--will not include Medicaid and will likely not even include tax cuts for the very wealthy. Cuts to Medicaid have been the core part of every House version of healthcare and every Senate bill that we have seen so far. They will get to those cuts one way or another, and they will also get to the tax cuts for the superrich.  The bill that we are debating, H.1628, as you know, creates block grants in the context of Block-granting, in a sense, may be sending to the States a limited amount of money and saying: Good luck when you have to balance your budget and pay for Medicaid services. It will have per capita caps, which would, again, limit what States can do in terms of the dollars they have, or it would just continue to have cuts to Medicaid, as every bill has had, the likes of which we have never seen--sometimes over $800 billion, sometimes over $700 billion, but it is in that neighborhood of hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars of cuts to This next version of the Senate bill will do the same.  When you consider the cuts to Medicaid juxtaposed with the tax breaks given to the superrich--really giveaways--there is no other word that I can come up with other than ``obscene.'' There are probably other words, but that is, I think, a good description of what that is. That is one of the reasons that these measures have been so unpopular across the board with every income group. Those folks who would get those big giveaways--I think most of them would not want them if they knew the price of that tax giveaway to someone with a lot of money would be to decimate  So passing this version of the bill--passing a scaled-down scheme--means that Republicans have not abandoned their Medicaid cuts. They are going to get to that as soon as they can. This is simply what we are going to see over the next couple of hours--a back door to cutting and capping Medicaid--and anyone who believes otherwise is probably deceiving themselves.  What we need are serious policies crafted to ensure long-term supports and services that provide and guarantee community-based services that promote choice and freedom for people with disabilities. This bill doesn't promise freedom or liberty. It doesn't promise the choice to live in a community and to be part of a family, like this family, where one member of that family has a disability and gets to live in a house with other members of the family. That is not possible for many Americans without  For people with disabilities, this bill is anything but a bill that would enhance freedom or enhance choice. This bill would, in fact, be an anti-freedom bill when it comes to people with disabilities. It is not a key to liberty. It is really just a pathway to institutional care, where we were years ago and where we have come from, from whence we have made progress. It is a return to limited choices, a lack of rights, and a place where freedom is not possible.  In conclusion, let me thank the Members of the Senate who have supported[[Page S4254]]this motion: Senators Stabenow, Duckworth, Hassan, Van Hollen, Murray, Brown, Blumenthal, Carper, Durbin, Kaine, Baldwin, Wyden, Markey, Murphy, Harris, Cardin, Warren, Hirono, Reed, Nelson, Klobuchar, Warner, Shaheen, Coons, Bennet, King, Menendez, Whitehouse, Leahy, and I want to thank them for joining me in this effort.

14496,topic-id,492,"Mr.President, I know the Chair said I may speak for a few minutes before the vote. I spoke earlier so I will not reiterate every argument.  Really, what we are doing with this particular amendment is sending this legislation to the Finance Committee so as to focus it as the motion itself says: When this bill would be recommitted to the Finance Committee, the Finance Committee could examine it from the perspective, in this case, of people with disabilities and to focus on changes that could be made in order to prevent harm to individuals with disabilities as defined in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.  The reason we mention that particularly is that is the seminal piece of legislation to protect people with disabilities who would be harmed by this legislation because you cannot just have rights that are guaranteed without the support for those rights. Medicaid provides that support so folks, if they want to live at home or if they want to live in a community-based setting, can do that, but they can only do that with the help of It is a pretty simple amendment to make sure there is some adequate review of the impact on Americans with disabilities.  We have, in Pennsylvania, for example, over 720,000 people who have a disability and depend upon I want to make sure every one of those Pennsylvanians has all of the protections we say we are guaranteeing with disability legislation--with laws like the Americans with Disabilities Act and with the protections Medicaid provides.  This is critically important. At a time when we are talking about freedom and liberty in the context of healthcare, I would hope we would take steps to guarantee that freedom and liberty apply to those with disabilities so that as the Americans with Disabilities Act has enshrined in our law, they may be able to choose the kind of places they want to live and choose the settings within which they want to live their lives, to be able to have the freedom to choose that by way of the support they can get from I hope that is something that is reasonable enough so as to get support from both sides of the aisle.

14479,topic-id,1006,"Mr.President, we are struggling right now to find a replacement for the Affordable Care The American people have voted in four successive elections for such a replacement, culminating in the election of Donald Trump to be President of the United  Now, one can ask oneself, if the Affordable Care Act is so great, why would the American people continue to want to have a different program? I think the wisdom of the American people is that they do not want the government so intrusive in their lives, and secondly, there is a sense that somehow the Affordable Care Act is not entirely fair, that perhaps there are some who do better under the Affordable Care Act than others. Our country is about equity.  By the way, I am a physician, and for 25 years I have worked in the public hospital system of Louisiana trying to get healthcare for those who otherwise did not have it. I am all about those who do not have insurance or those who are fully insured getting better care. Ultimately, to have better care, there has to be adequate financing for that care. So we begin to look at the numbers that underlie how the Affordable Care Act--ObamaCare, if you will--finances healthcare across the It is very interesting.  If you look at the numbers from Health and Human Services, three States--Massachusetts, California, and New York--get 37 percent of the money that ObamaCare spends on Medicaid expansion and health insurance access. Three States get 37 percent. And although I don't have an accurate depiction of what the demography is, I estimate their population to be roughly 18 percent, if that much, of our Nation's total population. So they get twice as much, if you will, on a per-beneficiary basis than the rest of the Nation put together. That is not fair. And if we are going to provide access for patients--our fellow Americans--to healthcare, ultimately we have to have adequate financial resources to do so.  My colleague Senator Graham will speak in more detail about the inequities between the States, but let me just say as a guideline, how do we create equity? How do we create fairness so it is not just three States that benefit, but wherever you live, if the Federal taxpayers are contributing to your access to insurance, you get about the same amount whether you are in Louisiana, Colorado, South Carolina, Mississippi, or in California, Massachusetts, or New York? That is about equity.  What we attempt to do--and we are going to submit this as part of the Graham-Cassidy amendment--is we attempt to establish fairness for all Americans in terms of the support they receive from the Federal taxpayer. What we will do, beginning in 2020, is begin to equalize the payments between those States receiving very little, those States receiving a lot more, and those States that are kind of right where they should be. We do this by beginning with a formula that acknowledges that the poorer the people, the more support they need; the older the person, the higher their medical expenses. So between poverty and age, it is a good starting point about how to divide those dollars. Between 2020 and 2026, we will actually gradually move those high-cost States down, those lower cost States up, and keep those just-about-right States just about right, until at the end, wherever that American lives, she or he is getting about the same amount as every other patient receiving support across the country.  When we say this--I am a physician. I know that if you have more disease burden in one State, that is a costlier population. If your average age is greater in one State, that is another aspect of a costlier population. We can go through those sorts of factors. So we do put wiggle room at the end, so that if a State is higher cost because they have more disease, they would get a little bit more money. But on the whole, if you net it out, wherever that American lives, she or he would get about the same amount of money.  Senator Graham will go over this in more detail, but it turns out that the average American receiving benefits under the Affordable Care Act--if you combine Medicaid expansion and the tax credits people receive, the average credit is somewhere in the mid-$6,000 range; call it $6,400, $6,500. But if you look at what some States receive, in Massachusetts, it is about $18,000 per person. Now, that is a lot of money. So if the average is $6,600 and in one State it is $18,000, that is not fair.  Now, I would submit that if we equalize that treatment; if we just treat people fairly; if no matter where you live, the amount you get is not dependent upon the State in which you live but upon your need, then we can actually provide access. We can fulfill President Trump's campaign pledges of continuing coverage, caring for those with preexisting conditions, lowering premiums--lowering premiums--and eliminating mandates.  By the way, it isn't just Republican-represented States that would benefit. We can look at West These are some preliminary numbers. West Virginia would receive in 2020 about 43 percent more than they would based upon current trajectories. Indiana would receive about 48 percent more. Let's look at Montana would receive about--my gosh--Montana would receive over 100 percent more than they are currently scheduled to receive.  This takes the money that has already been allocated, and instead of focusing it on three States--there are a few more; call it seven, but those are the States that really bring it home--if, instead of all of this Federal largess going to three States, we distribute it fairly, all Americans can do better. All Americans can do better.  Ultimately, we should be about fairness in this Chamber, not about partisan politics.

14707,topic-id,591,"Mr.Speaker, on Wednesday the Rules Committee met and reported a rule for consideration of a very important measure. The resolution provides for consideration of H.2842, Accelerating Individuals into the Workforce                              {time}  1230  The rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and the ranking member of the Ways and Means  Mr.Speaker, H.2842 is a commonsense proposal to help transition welfare recipients into steady, paying jobs. Moving welfare recipients into work is a central goal of TANF, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. This bipartisan bill would incentivize employers to hire TANF recipients and help subsidize these new employees' salaries for up to a year to allow them to transition into the workforce.  The policy idea behind H.2842 is simple: under this bill, States can establish partnerships with employers to hire recipients of TANF dollars. Through these partnerships, employers would receive a subsidy of up to 50 percent of the wage for a TANF recipient while the other 50 percent would be paid by the employer.  Beneficiaries would have to meet three requirements: they must be a TANF recipient, they must be unemployed, and they must have an income of 20 percent or less of the Federal poverty level. H.2842 will direct our resources to the neediest individuals and families to help them accelerate these welfare recipients back into the workforce.  Mr.Speaker, President Ronald Reagan once noted: ``We should measure welfare's success by how many people leave welfare, not by how many people are added.''  The legislation under consideration in today's rule is a fulfillment of that promise. Under H.2842, State and local governments will be able to better utilize their TANF dollars to help move individuals into paying work and eventually help them transition out of the welfare system altogether.  Helping people get back to work is a great deal for the individuals who will be helped under this program, for the employers, for the economy, and for the American people. This bill is, at its core, about helping unemployed Americans get back to work.  Mr.Speaker, we are a nation filled with hardworking people, and I have seen over and over again how badly many of the unemployed want to return to work. Many, if not most, recipients of TANF are in the program not because they want to be, but because they have been forced to be by circumstance. These unemployed Americans want nothing more than to return to the dignity of the workforce as quickly as they are able to do so. This bill will help remove barriers to employment and will incentivize employers to hire current TANF recipients.  Workers re-entering the workforce is a good thing for society. Not only will workers who receive jobs under this program be taken off of welfare rolls, thus ensuring the continued success of that program, but these new workers will be better able to contribute to better lives for themselves, for their families, and for their communities.  Here in Washington, we too often describe policy solutions as being ``commonsense'' or ``win-win,'' but in this case it is absolutely true. H.2842 is a commonsense solution and is a win-win for everyone involved: the workers, the employers, the community, and the country.  That is why this legislation will receive a substantial bipartisan vote tomorrow. Whatever their differences, Republicans and Democrats alike want to put unemployed people back to work. This bill will actually succeed in doing that.  Mr.Speaker, I urge support of the rule and the underlying legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.

14709,topic-id,566,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I want to begin by agreeing with my good friend on many of the points that he made. I was particularly struck by the point he made about the low participation rate in the labor force. That has been a problem that has been with us, quite frankly, for, as he pointed out, several decades, and it is one that has gotten worse.  That is attributable in large part to another point that my friend made, effectively the thing around here we call the skills gap. We have literally millions of jobs available in this country, and employers are ready to hire people but they simply don't have the training.  I couldn't agree more with my good friend that on-the-job training is sometimes the best training. You actually acquire the skill that you need to be successful, and the situation of this legislation will actually, again, offset the cost of that to the employer and, by the way, not add any cost to the taxpayer.  That is something we ought to talk about as well. We are just taking money that we would have been spending anyway, and we are spending it a lot more productively.  Now, my friend is right. This is a new program. This is a new approach. So trying it out for a year, spending $100 million--a lot of money--but obviously we would spend more this way if we would know this would be successful. But I can't help but think it will be successful.  It is important to note that this bill is actually, again, exceptionally bipartisan. I was struck, as I hope my friend was, yesterday when we were in Rules Committee considering this legislation. We are used to seeing the members of the Ways and Means Committee come up and sort of fight in front of us. Instead, they actually came up arm in arm with a bipartisan proposal that they had agreed to that, again, is an excellent, excellent work.  It is exactly the way that Congress should work, quite frankly: find common ground and advance commonsense solutions that make life better for the American people. In this case, at least, I think we have succeeded in doing that.  It is also important to note that the rule authorizes the consideration of H.2353, the so-called Perkins grant program. The Perkins grant is something we are pretty familiar with in This is Federal money that moves into career tech systems that helps actually, again, workers acquire the necessary skills to be productive, quite often, again, working with the employer who has already got the jobs available. We then train the worker at a career tech system partly funded with Federal dollars, and that person is assured the job the day they walk out.  I suspect that bill, like this bill, when it finally reaches the floor will also have substantial bipartisan support. I want to pledge to my good friend that we are going to continue to work together on things like this. I don't think anybody disagrees about putting Americans back to work. Workers would rather be at work than, frankly, just receiving government assistance and not able to go work. So this bill does that.  I want to urge support of the rule and, again, the underlying legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

14711,topic-id,296,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Decades of experience tell us that the most effective antipoverty program is a job, and this bill helps low-income Americans earn success through the dignity of work.  States actually, as my good friends on the other side know, spend very little of their TANF funding on moving people into jobs. Today, half of all TANF recipients are neither working nor preparing for work. This bill ensures that money only goes to those who are working, providing individuals with paychecks in lieu of benefit checks, a key tenet in welfare reform.  This pilot only provides funding for one fiscal year, repurposing money that has already been appropriated and, frankly, using it in a better way than it was originally appropriated to achieve.  The bill requires that States report on outcome measures and provide high-quality evaluations so that Congress can make appropriate decisions after we have actually seen the results yielded by the program.  And finally, as we have been pointing out, but I think around here it is always worth pointing out multiple times, where actually CBO estimates the bill has no cost. So we are actually doing something good without increasing expenditures for the taxpayers, and, indeed, we are probably in the process of creating new taxpayers, people who can contribute to the wealth and the activity and the prosperity of the country; and people, honestly, who want to contribute to the wealth and the activity; and employers who want to provide people with an opportunity to improve themselves and become more productive.  So it is a good bill all the way around, and, again, I will be urging the passage of the rule and the underlying legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

14714,topic-id,929,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, we have been having such a wonderful bipartisan moment here. My good friend from Oregon, and appropriately, wants to change the tenor a little bit.  Let me begin by actually congratulating my good friend from Oregon because he is a serious legislator and does serious things, and I am probably going to find myself on the same side with him on the issue of air traffic controllers where I think his points have been very well made.  On this particular piece of legislation, I must admit, I have not had the opportunity. I don't sit on my friend's committee to actually read it, but I suspect the committee hasn't picked it up and dealt with it either.  And just from a process standpoint, I think the appropriate thing to do would be for the committee to actually review it. It could be amended in committee, as indeed this bill was, and then we would have the opportunity to consider it on the floor. But to bring it to the floor immediately, to me, is premature, legislatively.  I also want to take issue, on the record, with my friends of the President of the United States in terms of job creation. I suspect President Trump, in his private life, has created more jobs than just about anybody in the Congress of the United States, and I think he has laid forward some incredibly important proposals to continue and build on his personal record, now that he is President of the United  One of those proposals, as my friends are surely aware, because I think they largely agree with it, is to enhance the apprenticeship program announcement he made recently. Another one that my friends may not be quite so much in agreement with, he has laid out his principles for tax reform.  The greatest engine for job growth is never going to be the Federal It is going to always be the private sector. And if we could, as the President has suggested, cut corporate tax rates, incentivize the return of profit, something where perhaps we can work together, that are stranded overseas, bring them back here and invest in America, I think we would create a lot more jobs a lot more quickly and in a lot more sustainable fashion than we would do through additional public spending.  Finally, I think we ought to give the President a little bit of credit for emphasizing and bringing home American jobs, something that actually began once he was President-elect. We saw it in Indiana with Carrier air-conditioning. We have seen it in other cases where he has promoted the sale of American arms in the Middle East where we have got substantial things.  So I think this is a President who actually gets up each and every day and thinks profoundly about what can we do to create an overall ecosystem, an environment, if you will, that will incentivize private investment, private employment, American jobs, and bringing American companies back to this country.  I think he is actually off to an exceptionally good start in those areas, and I look forward to working with him on that. I suspect we will see a tax proposal on this floor in the not-too-distant future--our friends on Ways and Means are working on it now--that will mirror many of the principles that the President laid out in his initial draft discussion of what he thinks we ought to do.  And that one change, changing the Tax Code, I think, will do more than[[Page H5064]]all the programs that we would work on, many of them worthy programs, many of them things, I think, where the Federal Government does have a role.  I will agree with my friend from Florida, I am disturbed about some of the cuts in training programs. I have seen those programs work and work well, and I suspect the President will find out, as other Presidents have found out--we used to routinely praise President Obama's budget on the floor. It never got very many votes. I don't think it ever got any Democratic votes--that, you know, Presidents propose, as they should, that is their prerogative, they run the executive branch, but, at the end of the day, it is Congress that makes the final funding decisions.  I happen to know a little bit about those programs because they come through my subcommittee on appropriations, and I want to assure my friends they are not going to disappear. And we may have to make some tough choices, as you always have to do, in appropriated dollars, but on many of the programs that I know my friend cares about and has championed in his distinguished career, they are going to be protected, and we are going to try and work in a bipartisan fashion in those areas and keep those things going.  But, at the end of the day, I think the President's record on job creation will be outstanding, and I think the actions that he has taken in the opening part of his administration are a testament to how seriously he takes the challenge of making sure that every American has a decent job, a job that pays a good wage, a job that will provide for his or her family, and a job that will give them an opportunity to live a life of dignity and prosperity, something we want every American to have a chance at.  So with that, Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-06-22-pt1-PgH5059.txt,2259,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,22.0,July
14716,topic-id,1811,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, I want to begin by addressing a couple of points that my friend made. There will be places we agree; there will be places we disagree. I think too often around here we talk about how nothing gets done when this has actually been an extraordinarily productive period in terms of passing legislation. We are going to have differences on some of that legislation, there is no question. There is a reason why God created a Democratic Party and a Republican Party, and it probably wasn't to always agree all the time, but it was to challenge one another and try to work together when they could or define alternative paths when they felt they must, and let the American people make the decision.  Fortunately, we are blessed to live in a country where they get to make that decision on a regular basis like clockwork. They have been making some decisions recently. I think the President has had a pretty good run in special elections. We are pretty pleased with the decisions they have been making. But at some point they will change their mind--they always do--and they will decide somebody else has a better way.  I think in the interim we ought to stress occasionally so the American people know when we do work together. I actually was home after we managed to pass healthcare through this particular body, and that bill moved through multiple committees, had multiple amendments, lots of negotiation. Obviously it is in the Senate now. I think that process will start over there. But the day before we passed it, actually, we came together in a really quite remarkable way. We passed an omnibus spending bill of over $1 trillion. That bill had worked through the Appropriations Committee of each House, 12 different bills put together to fund the Federal That particular bill gave us the largest increase in defense spending in about a decade, the largest increase in border security money in about a decade. It gave us a substantial increase in money at the National Institutes of Health and at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, areas that Democrats and Republicans alike have been working together on and feel very strongly about.  That bill also broke the one-to-one relationship--pretty artificial relationship, in my view--that President Obama had laid down that, if you increase defense spending, you have to automatically increase domestic spending whether you need to or not or whether you can afford to or not.[[Page H5065]]Frankly, that bill actually passed with a majority of my friends on the Democratic side in both the House and the Senate and a majority of Republicans in the House and the Senate voting for the same bill and Donald Trump signing the bill.  Now, when I go home and I explain that to people, they look at me with a blank stare. It is like: What? That really happened? One trillion dollars with all those different elements in there and a majority of Democrats voted for it and a majority of Republicans voted for it and Donald Trump signed it?  I say:  They are amazed. They have never heard about it. They have never seen it. I think that is because sometimes we present a false narrative of constant conflict. There is certainly plenty of conflict here. Look, I have some sympathy with the minority. Having been in the minority myself, you always feel shut out. But this is an occasion--this legislation, and, frankly, that spending bill--when my friends certainly weren't shut out. They participated, and they participated vigorously, and they contributed in the process.  I am with my friend. We need to do more of that. As a matter of fact, I think you will see it is happening right now. If you go to the Defense Committee, they are working on their authorization bill. That committee is the most bipartisan committee probably in Every time they report something out on an authorization--I think they have 63 or 64 members, something like that--the vote is always like 60 to 3. They have clearly put aside their partisan differences to work together.  In this bill, we have done exactly the same thing. So while we are going to have some points where we disagree, we are going to have some opportunities to agree and come together. And I pledge to my friend I will continue to work with him to try and see that we find more of them.  Mr.Speaker, in closing, I want to encourage all of the Members, obviously, to support the rule, but I am sure my good friends on the other side probably won't accept the invitation. That is okay. This is a process vote and they have got other matters they want on the floor, and I certainly understand that they will be opposing our rule and trying to offer an alternative.  But when the matter counts, when the actual legislation reaches the floor, I think H.2842 will draw broad bipartisan support. This House is taking steps to help workers leave welfare rolls and return to the workforce. Under this bill, employers will be incentivized to hire TANF recipients and will help bring the unemployed up into the workforce and the economy.

The material previously referred to by Mr.Hastings is as follows:          An amendment to 396 Offered by Mr.Hastings       At the end of the resolution, add the following new      sections:       3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the      Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare      the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on      the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.     2510) to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to      authorize appropriations for State water pollution control      revolving funds, and for other purposes. The first reading of      the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against      consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be      confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally      divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority      member of the Committee on Transportation and      After general debate the bill shall be considered for      amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order      against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion      of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee      shall rise and report the bill to the House with such      amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question      shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments      thereto to final passage without intervening motion except      one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the      Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to      no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day      the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of      business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the      Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill.       Sec.4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.2510.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

14458,topic-id,2343,"Mr.President, yesterday we took a giant step toward delivering on our promise to the American people to provide relief from the failures of the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as  Over the last 7 years, we have discussed what our solution would look like, and everybody who has been willing to participate in that conversation--sadly, not our Democratic colleagues, who simply refuse to do so, but every Member of our conference--has engaged in discussions and has had input on how best to accomplish the goal of providing people affordable coverage, increased access, market stability, and better care.  We can talk about all of the details, but basically what this boils down to is how to provide people with access to quality, affordable health care. I know some of our friends across the aisle thought the Affordable Care Act was it, but it failed. It started with the promises that were made by President Obama when he sold this to the American people, saying: If you like your policy, you can keep your policy; if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. He said that premiums would go down $2,500 for a family of four, none of which have proved to be true--none of which have proved to be true.  Now we find that in many parts of the country, insurance companies are pulling out, limiting if not denying altogether people's access to coverage within the exchanges. We know what has happened to premiums. Since 2013, they have gone up 105 percent nationally--a 105-percent increase in premiums.  People find that their deductibles are so high that they effectively are self-insured. They have been denied the benefit of their own insurance. Nominally, they may have insurance, but the fact is, if you go to the hospital, you are going to be responsible personally for what is not covered by that deductible.  Even our colleagues across the aisle admit that ObamaCare has failed to provide stable access to insurance markets, but their solution has been to pay more money to insurance companies. I would call that an insurance company bailout without any reform, without any changes in the basic structure of ObamaCare, which has caused this failure.  What we have tried to do on this side of the aisle--and we have repeatedly invited our Democratic colleagues to join us because optimally this would be a bipartisan effort, but so far they have refused to participate whatsoever and really are focused solely on trying to blow up the current process.  What we have said we want to accomplish are four things. We want to stabilize the insurance markets. We want to bring premiums down so they are more affordable. We want to protect people with preexisting conditions. We want to put Medicaid--the safety net for low-income Americans--on a sustainable path.[[Page S4245]]  Of course, as you might imagine with something as complex as healthcare, we have had a number of opinions on how best to achieve these goals. Even as approaches and ideas have differed, one thing has remained constant: the belief that the status quo is simply unacceptable. It is unacceptable.  Take, for example, one of my constituents in Texas, who wrote me recently to say that his monthly insurance premium under the Affordable Care Act had nearly tripled, to $690, and his deductible, to my earlier point, went from $1,500 to $6,000.  I don't know many people--unless they happen to be well-to-do--who can afford to absorb those sorts of increases in premiums and deductibles. Because his coverage went from a PPO, a preferred provider organization, to an HMO, a health maintenance organization, some of his doctors are no longer in the network, forcing him to switch healthcare providers entirely.  This story is certainly not unique. It is typical. This is the norm under the Affordable Care I often hear from Texans who would rather drop their coverage and pay the costly fine rather than have to pay for insurance that will cost them more and more each month, which they can't afford.  Here is a telling statistic. More than 400,000 Texans who earn less than $25,000 a year have decided to pay the penalty rather than to be forced to buy the insurance they can't afford, so many of them pay the penalty because of the individual mandate in the Affordable Care They are left with nothing, other than having to pay the penalty as required by the law. That is not a solution. That is why I hope that someday we can get out of this rut and off of the talking points on each side and say: What can we do to try to provide people access to affordable health care? That is the key.  People are going to make their own decisions based on their own economic self-interest. If you are a young person, you might decide: What I would like to do is to buy a policy that will cover me in emergency circumstances if I have to go to the hospital, but I don't want to have to pay for all the bells and whistles that raise the price. You can't do that under the Affordable Care Act and take advantage of the tax subsidies that everybody else can. It is basically a false promise.  I also heard from another small business owner in Donna, TX, who was forced to fire four employees just to comply with the employer mandate or otherwise owe the government more than $100,000 in fines that he said could bankrupt his business. Those are the kinds of decisions that ObamaCare is forcing. Rather than hire enough people--or if you have more than 50--you decide you need to fire people in order to avoid these penalties that come from the employer mandate. That is not good for the economy. That is not good for the job prospects of hard-working  I shared the story of a constituent in Needville, TX, who, after a 50-percent increase in his monthly premiums, still lost his doctor because the doctor wouldn't accept his ObamaCare plan.  Then there is the emergency room employee in North Texas, who wrote me to say that she has seen a significant increase in the Medicare and Medicaid patients in the emergency room because fewer and fewer doctors would accept these patients.  In my State, only about one-third of doctors will accept a new Medicaid patient because it pays at such a low rate. We have a better idea that will make people up to 350 percent of the Federal poverty level eligible for a tax credit they can use to buy private insurance, which will increase their access to care and make it more affordable. We have coupled that with something called the innovation and stability fund, in which we have taken the authority out of Washington and sent it back to the States to let Governors and State legislators and regulators at the local level design policies that meet the needs of the people in the  The basic structural failure of ObamaCare was to assume that you could write a one-size-fits-all plan for 320 million-plus people that would work. It hasn't. We know that. That is not speculation; this is based on experience.  I know my colleagues across the aisle have heard similar stories from their constituents, as well, but apparently they don't seem to care very much about that. Otherwise, they would join with us in trying to improve the status quo, which they have refused so far to do.  One thing about the procedure that we are undertaking here is that any Senator who wants to offer an amendment to improve the bill or even offer a complete substitute to the bill is entitled to do so, and they will get a vote on that. Our colleagues on the Democratic side, despite hearing from their own constituents that they are hurting as a result of the status quo, appear not willing to lift a finger to help them.  Indeed, the only proposal I have heard from the other side--I have heard two. One is an insurance company bailout, which does nothing to effect reforms that would ultimately address the structural problems with ObamaCare or else they say: We want to have a single-payer system, which will bankrupt the country. Those are their solutions.  On Monday, I noted that in an effort to try to unite their deeply divided party after last year's elections, our Democratic colleagues unveiled an economic agenda aimed at, they say, lifting up lower and middle-class That is an admirable goal.  If Democrats are really serious about helping lower and middle-income Americans, one glaring and immediate action they could take is to join us in alleviating the burdens placed on these very same folks by ObamaCare--the types of people I have been talking about back in Texas, whom I know exist in their States as well.  If the Democratic leader refuses to help get rid of one of the biggest economic burdens on lower and middle-income Americans, then his plan is not worth the paper it is printed on. What they are offering is false hope. Unless you are willing to deal concretely with the problem here and now, that is just another campaign promise--one they will not be able to keep until they address what the failures of the Affordable Care Act have imposed on low- and middle-income  Simply stated, ObamaCare is a failed experiment. It has failed because Washington has tried to do too much at the expense of individual choices, individual liberties, and family control over what are deeply personal decisions.  With each day that passes, ObamaCare keeps getting worse. The premiums for 2018 will soon be announced by the insurance companies, and we are going to see double-digit increases again, over and above what ObamaCare has seen so far--105-percent increases since 2013 alone--on top of that.  After yesterday's vote, we now have the opportunity to provide relief from this failed law. I know Members have a lot of ideas about how to fix the mess that ObamaCare has left us, but that was precisely why it was so important for us to get on the bill yesterday, so Members on both sides of the aisle can offer amendments and share their ideas.  Do you know how many Democrats voted to get on the bill and begin the debate and offer amendments? Zero, zip, nada. Their protestations that they somehow want to do things on a bipartisan basis really have fallen flat, as demonstrated by their own failure to act.  If they were really interested in working with us to do something on a bipartisan basis, why wouldn't they take advantage of this opportunity to do so?  Last night we began the process of considering amendments, including one from my colleague in Texas, Senator Cruz, who has a plan to provide people who choose a lower cost premium insurance product the opportunity to do so, as long as the State also requires a comprehensive plan as well. This is something that is ideal for many people who want an insurance safety net but don't necessarily want their health insurance to pay for their regular medical expenses or doctor visits. They can handle those through a health savings account or some other way.  Later today we will continue to work toward bringing relief to millions of Americans suffering from the failure of Yesterday was a big step toward ending ObamaCare and the first step toward ending the mandates, the[[Page S4246]]penalties on low- and middle-class Texans who are having to choose between buying unaffordable insurance or paying a penalty that their government is forcing them to pay. We are going to end that.  We are going to end the job-killing employer mandate, which is forcing employers either to lay people off or not hire additional people because they don't want to run into the additional costs required by the employer mandate.  Then there is the single mom, whom I met in Tyler, TX, a few years back. She said: I want to work full time. I want to work at least 40 hours a week, but the restaurant where I work figured out that if they put me on part time, 29 hours a week, then they wouldn't be required to meet the mandates of the Affordable Care  What this single mother, who wanted to work full time, was forced to do because of ObamaCare was to work part time. Do you know what? She can't make it on 29 hours a week, so she has to get two jobs. Effectively, she had to go from 40 hours a week doing a job she enjoyed, which helped her pay the bills, to working two jobs in order to make ends meet.  We can and we should do better, and we invite our colleagues across the aisle to join us, if they will.  People keep talking about a secret process. Well, this is about as open and transparent as it gets. Everybody will have an opportunity to offer an amendment, to discuss what is in the amendment, and to vote on it. To the extent that the Senate's work product differs from what the House of Representatives provides us, we can go to a conference and work out those differences. That is how the legislative process is supposed to work. Sitting on your hands and complaining about something while offering no effort to try to help solve the problem simply boils down to hollow words. Unfortunately, that is all we have been hearing so far.  We hope our colleagues will change their minds and join us. Insurance bailouts with reform are not the answer, a single-payer system is not the answer because it will bankrupt the country, but we are more than happy to entertain any reasonable proposal from our colleagues across the aisle. We will guarantee they get a chance to debate it and to have a vote on their amendment. I don't think they could ask for anything more.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Cotton).

14454,topic-id,680,"Madam President, Karen from Missoula County wrote to me about how her daughter can't afford to buy insurance. ObamaCare imposes a tax penalty on Americans who don't buy insurance. In fact, in 2014 and 2015 alone, they collected over $5 billion in fines.  It turns out, this tax has hurt poor and middle-income Americans the worst. That is why I refer to this as ObamaCare's ``poverty'' tax. For Karen from Missoula, paying ObamaCare's poverty tax is cheaper for her so she pays the IRS a fine because she can't afford healthcare insurance.  Take Debbie from Roundup, She lost her own healthcare insurance. She couldn't afford the $1,700 per month premiums so she, too, was subject to ObamaCare's poverty tax and was forced to pay the  Take Mike from Kalispell, He is concerned for his son who can't afford a health insurance plan either. The poverty tax he is forced to pay to the IRS is expensive. It is hard to come up with money to pay it. There are American families who can't afford health insurance because of ObamaCare, and what does ObamaCare do? It fines them. This is adding insult to injury.  These are just a few of the stories I have received from my constituents back home in Montana, where ObamaCare is doing more harm than good. Yes, it is doing some good, but it is doing more harm than good. In fact, 40 percent of the 34,250 Montanans who paid ObamaCare's poverty tax made less than $25,000 a year; 80 percent made less than $50,000 a year. This is not a tax on the rich. In fact, just 3.4 percent make more than $100,000. This is a tax on the poor.  Instead of helping these vulnerable Montanans to make ends meet, ObamaCare puts a poverty tax on them for being too poor to afford health insurance. In fact, in Montana alone, they paid nearly $7.8 million to the This individual mandate--this poverty tax--is immoral. It is unfair. It is a tax on freedom. It needs to be repealed immediately, and these poverty taxes must be paid back to the poor who have paid them.  Our friends across the aisle will say we want to get rid of taxes on the rich, but the rich aren't paying this tax. The poor are paying this tax. I think the right thing to do--the handshake agreement we have back in Montana as Montanans, where a man or woman's word is worth something--the right thing to do is, they should be paid back.  That is why I will be offering an amendment on the floor when we debate. We should pay back this poverty tax to the poor who have paid it. The poverty tax is just one of the many problems of ObamaCare, and I look forward to continued debate.  By the way, if you take this to the higher level here nationwide, nearly 8 million Americans have paid this poverty tax. As we looked at every State's numbers, it all is about the same: Somewhere between 40 percent and 50 percent of those Americans make less than $25,000 a year. In Indiana, it is 176,000  We have them for every Look at West West Virginians, 45,000 have paid the poverty tax; 49 percent make less than $25,000 a year.

I also want to extend a special thank-you to my friend Senator Bob Casey of Senator Casey has been a tireless advocate for protecting the Medicaid Program and the critical services it provides, not just to the people of Pennsylvania but to millions of Americans across our beloved country. Senator Casey has done incredible work to remind all Americans of the important role Medicaid plays in our communities and the millions of children, families, students, and seniors who have coverage through  My motion is simple. It would send this bill back to the Finance Committee to get the consideration it never received, and it would require the committee to strike provisions that reduce or eliminate benefits for those currently eligible for Medicaid, prevent States from expanding Medicaid, or shift costs to States to cover that care.  In my State of Indiana, we have seen the success of a bipartisan approach to expanding the Medicaid Program and helping our fellow citizen access health insurance. I was proud to work with then-Indiana Governor and now-Vice President Mike Pence when he used the Affordable Care Act to establish HIP 2.0. More than 400,000 Hoosiers have been able to access coverage through HIP 2.0, many for the first time in their lives. HIP 2.0 has helped reduce the uninsured rate in Indiana by 30 percent. Our Vice President called HIP 2.0--that is the Medicaid expansion in Indiana--a national model.  Then-Governor Pence is hardly the only Republican Governor to praise the Medicaid expansion as a way to cover more of our citizens. Governor Sandoval of Nevada said just yesterday that he ``will continue to do all I can to protect the thousands of Nevadans whose lives are healthier and happier as a result of the expansion of Medicaid.'' Governor Kasich of Ohio has offered similar sentiments as he has fought to protect the Medicaid coverage for his  Nationwide, 31 States and Washington, DC, expanded coverage to more than 14 million Americans, many of whom have health insurance for the first time in their lives. All of that progress is at risk with the current bill.  Many of our States, including Indiana, have been devastated by the opioid abuse and heroin use epidemics. This public health crisis hasn't been confined to simply one neighborhood or one economic bracket; it has been felt in communities across my State and all communities across our country.  Vice President Pence said in his farewell address as Governor: ``With HIP 2.0, we have also made great strides expanding treatment for those who struggle in the grip of drug addiction.'' I agree with the Vice HIP 2.0 and the Medicaid expansion have made treatment and recovery services more accessible for thousands of Americans struggling with addiction as they work to get back on their feet.  I don't think there is a single Member of this entire body--the U.Senate--who hasn't heard from the relative of someone who is battling addiction or from someone who has lost a loved one due to this epidemic. Gutting Medicaid and ending programs like HIP 2.0 as we know them would not make life better for Hoosiers or for the other 14 million Americans who have gained coverage through the Medicaid expansion. It would actually do the opposite.  Too often, this debate has been about statistics and not about the people who would be harmed. But healthcare, at the end of the day, is inherently personal. It is about the health and the economic well-being of our loved ones. It is about not having to go to the ER just to visit a doctor. It is about our financial security so our families and our friends aren't one illness away from bankruptcy.  The proposal before us wouldn't just impact Medicaid expansion; it would harm millions of working Americans who count on Medicaid for basic healthcare. It would affect more families than that, including those families who have insurance through their jobs but also use Medicaid to access care for chronic or complex conditions.  In 2015, 63 percent of Medicaid households had at least one full-time worker, and another 14 percent had part-time workers. That is almost 80 percent. For these hard-working Americans, Medicaid provides their families with financial security and stability and the healthcare they need so they can keep working.  Last month I stood on this floor and shared the stories of Hoosiers, including those who have Medicaid for themselves or to ensure that their children have the care they need. I have met with these families and heard their struggles, their fears, and their pain. I have listened as they pleaded with all of us here to protect their ability to access Many of these Hoosiers or their children are struggling with very complex medical needs that made it impossible for them to get coverage in the past. They would be priced out of the market under this current legislation. I cannot support a bill that takes care away from these families or from their children.  My faith teaches me that we are all God's children, and every man, woman, and child should have the chance to live up to their God-given potential. There is nothing we wouldn't do to take care of our kids. These aren't just Indiana values. These are values in every town in every corner of our country.[[Page S4243]]  My faith also teaches me that we all deserve to live, work, and retire with dignity. In Indiana, 62 percent of Hoosier nursing home residents use Medicaid to help pay for their care. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, Medicaid supports more than 1.4 million Americans in nursing homes across our country. Their care would be threatened by this bill, which is part of why seniors' groups have been so vocal in their opposition to the proposed Medicaid cuts in this bill.  I have also heard from a number of school superintendents all across my State opposing the Medicaid cuts because of the harm it would cause to the thousands of students across the Hoosier Schools use Medicaid funding for certain health-related services they provide, including individualized education plans, special transportation for children with disabilities, social workers, physical and occupational therapists, and medical equipment at the schools.  Some school districts use Medicaid to help pay for health professionals or for full-time registered nurses at schools across the country, where they assist students with complex medical needs and treat students with everything from illnesses to asthma attacks.  As school districts and local governments across the country continue to make even more difficult budget choices, cutting off this critically important source of funding creates just one more huge challenge. In addition to trying to make up the lost funding, our communities and States could be impacted in other areas as well, including infrastructure, other education spending, police and fire, and other local priorities.  The plan from my friends across the aisle undermines coverage for millions, but we haven't even had a hearing on their proposal. Committees haven't been able to go through regular order to examine the merits of Medicaid and the Medicaid expansion and how gutting them would harm millions of people--children with really complex medical conditions, those struggling with substance abuse disorders, and seniors in nursing homes trying to live with dignity and peace.  My motion sends this bill back to the Finance Committee to ensure that we are protecting those Americans who are the most vulnerable among our society. It would allow us to move toward strengthening healthcare for our country.  If you believe we should support children and families with complex medical conditions, then you should support this motion. If you want to protect the 1.4 million seniors using Medicaid for nursing home care, then you should vote for this motion. If you want to continue the progress we have made fighting the opioid abuse and heroin use epidemics, then I ask for your vote in this effort.  I firmly believe we can improve healthcare and build upon the gains we have made if we work together--not as Democrats or as Republicans but as Senators and Americans--in a bipartisan manner. This is not a political game. The consequences are as serious as it gets, and the American people are counting on us.  I urge my colleagues to support this motion.

14495,topic-id,755,"Mr.President, I speak in support of Senator Casey's motion protecting people with disabilities.  It is appalling that the Republican Party is working to strip healthcare from the disability community on the very anniversary of the day when we passed monumental legislation that improved the lives of Americans with disabilities.  It was 27 years ago that the Americans with Disabilities Act--one of the most important pieces of legislation of our time--was signed into law, and it is a shame that as we celebrate our great achievement for equality, we are moving backward rather than building on the progress our community has worked so hard on to make it so Americans with disabilities can live healthy, productive, independent lives. We cannot afford to move backward, and I will not sit quietly by and let that happen and neither will my constituents.  I have heard from thousands of Illinoisans who are struggling to understand why lawmakers are considering ripping away the care that is keeping them alive and allowing them to be independent and productive members of our community. I want to share just one of their stories with you.  It is about a woman by the name of Jessica Baker, from Mascoutah, Nearly 10 years ago, when she was a healthy and young 19-year-old, her entire life changed. Jessica was driving on the highway on a foggy morning. Because of the lack of visibility on the road, a truckdriver ahead of her ran through two cars. Jessica, just feet behind the truck, never saw the brake light go off. She struck that semi-truck and became part of a 20-car pileup. This young, healthy woman's life completely changed in an instant.  Jessica is now 29 years old and is a quadriplegic. She depends on Medicaid for her healthcare needs. She is living an independent life and has done well under the Now she fears she will lose her care that the law has helped her to receive. Jessica was a healthy, vital person whose life changed in an instant.  I understand how that feels. I went from being a soldier--one of the most physically fit people among my peers--to becoming wheelchair bound. So many of our brave men and women take that risk every single day, and we must be completely honest with ourselves as any American's life can change in the blink of an eye. The healthy can become sick, and the able-bodied can become disabled in a single moment. Any one of us can end up at the mercy of our healthcare system.  After her accident, Jessica had to fight for her life and relearn how to live as a thriving young person. Now Senate Republicans and President Trump are threatening her life by eliminating her access to care. As proud as I am to be a part of the Senate Chamber, which passed the monumental ADA, I am also appalled by what the Republicans in this body are doing today.  Yesterday's vote to proceed on a debate on a bill that would rob tens of millions of their health insurance is utterly shameful. It would jeopardize a program that 1 in 10 veterans, 2 out of 3 nursing home residents, and children with autism, Down syndrome, and special needs depend on. That is simply unacceptable. Senate Republicans have done everything they can to hide their legislation from the American people, crafting it in secret, behind closed doors. However, one thing remains clear; that the fight to protect healthcare is not over.  This is the time for the American people to keep speaking up, to make their voices heard, and Senate Republicans must listen. They must listen to their constituents and to the most vulnerable among us, like the members of the disability community who have been here day after day, literally, fighting for their lives. Day after day, I see people who come into my office who say: Save me. Save my child. Save our lives.  That is why I am working every single day to not only push back against these Republican efforts to strip away care from those who need it the most[[Page S4262]]but also to bring people together on commonsense improvements to our current healthcare system. We cannot be a nation that says: If you are sick or ill, we are going to leave you behind. That is simply not who we are. We are the greatest democracy on the face of the Earth, and we do not leave our most vulnerable behind.  Thank you.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Tillis).

14460,topic-id,1194,"Mr.President, yesterday, on the floor of the Senate, there was a speech which will be remembered for a long time. Our friend and colleague Senator John McCain came to the floor just days after he had been diagnosed with a serious cancer challenge. He made the trip from Arizona to Washington to vote on the floor on this healthcare debate, then asked for 15 minutes of time afterward to speak to the Of course, he was given that opportunity.  During the time that we learned about his diagnosis and he was home, virtually every one of us sent our personal best wishes to him and his family. Our love and respect for John McCain is deeply felt in the U.Senate, and virtually everyone stayed on the floor to hear his speech. Look around the floor now. There aren't many people, right? As good as my speech may be, it is not going to touch the quality of what John delivered yesterday. I wanted to be here for it and so did my colleagues on the Democratic side and on the Republican side.  John said a lot about who we are and what we are in the U.Fewer than 2,000 individuals, in the history of the United States of America, have had the honor to stand here and speak on the floor of the This is a rare opportunity. For many of us, it is a dream come true and one we couldn't imagine, but what John said yesterday, to summarize part of his statement, is that we ought to understand our responsibilities, as well, as  We ought to be honest about what we now face in America when it comes to the political discourse, the political debate. What we face now is a divided country, a divided Senate, divided House, and yet a yearning by all Americans for us to step up and do something; make America a better nation; help America's families, the workers, the businesses; step forward and solve a problem. John reminded us yesterday that to do that, we needed to move to what he called the regular order.  It may not mean much to those who are just watching this debate and don't follow the Senate closely, but the regular order is to introduce a bill into[[Page S4247]]the Senate, send it to a committee, have the committee staff review it, experts take a look at it, call for a committee hearing so the American people can see what is in the bill, debate the back-and-forth at the hearing, then have members offer amendments--changes. Some will win, some will lose. Then the bill can come to the floor of the Senate for a similar process. It is an open, public process. That is what regular order is, and that is what John McCain spoke to.  Let me, at this point, quote what he said verbatim. I like this paragraph a lot so I am going to add it here. Here is what John McCain said yesterday on the floor of the Senate:       I hope we can again rely on humility, our need to      cooperate, on our dependence on each other to learn how to      trust each other again and, by so doing, better serve the      people who elected us.  I like this part:       Stop listening to the bombastic loudmouths on the radio and      television and the internet.  John McCain said:       To hell with them. They don't want anything done for the      public good. Our incapacity is their livelihood.       Let's trust each other. Let's return to regular order. We      have been spinning our wheels on too many important issues      because we keep trying to find a way to win without help from      across the aisle. That is an approach that has been employed      by both sides; mandating legislation from the top down,      without any support from the other side, with all the      parliamentary maneuvers it requires. We are getting nothing      done, my friends. We are getting nothing done.  John said it yesterday and it still applies and he is right. I say that as a Democrat with respect for him as a Republican, but if we are not going to do more than just listen and be warmed by his words and applaud his speech, what should we do at this moment?  What is pending before us on the floor of the U.Senate is legislation that will change healthcare for every single American--every one of them. It will change it for us in the Senate, but it will change it for the 12.5 million people I represent in Illinois too. Every one of them will be changed by this bill. What is in this bill that will change it? We honestly can't tell you. The bill has not been written. We aren't able to see it. We are being told before the end of the week we will actually get a copy of the bill. I am not making that up.  We have tried several amendments on the floor, and they failed--one has failed. Several are likely to fail this afternoon, but there is no bill before us. We can't explain to the American people what this is ultimately going to be, except in the most general terms of what is being debated. That is embarrassing. It is embarrassing on the floor of the  What we should do is take this critical matter that affects every American and every American's healthcare and send it to a committee--the HELP Committee, chaired by Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee; Ranking Member Patty Murray, who is a Senator from Washington; the Finance Committee, Senator Hatch of Utah, Republican; Senator Wyden of Oregon, They need to sit down and look at these bills carefully.  Let's not make a mistake at the expense of the people who sent us here. Let's stand up for sound, thoughtful judgment. Let's stand up for a Senate that works, as John McCain challenged us. Is that what the American people wish? I think it is at the heart of all of it. I think John McCain really set a standard we ought to live up to. Let's stop this waste of time over a debate over a bill that cannot even be printed. Let's take this to the regular order. Let's do it the right way, to the credit of the Senate and to the credit of our country.  We took an oath, each and every one of us, to swear to uphold the That Constitution, that document we revere, spells out exactly what we should do at this moment, which is stop what we are doing on this floor, stop wasting the time of the American people and endangering their healthcare and take this to a debate that is befitting a great Constitution and a great nation and a great  I yield the floor.  I do it with the hopes that those who speak after me, of both political parties, will first sit down and read what John McCain said yesterday and let their applause for his remarks be reflected in what they do on the floor of the Senate today.

14396,topic-id,2010,"Mr.President, I listened with a lot of interest to the Democratic leader's comments this morning and his proposal that there would be cooperation if we went to a system of putting it back through committees and doing that, but I have to say that we would have a lot more confidence in getting a solution if there were a single positive suggestion from the other side for a change. Until that happens, there isn't much confidence on our side that the promise of bipartisanship is going to happen.  They keep saying that it isn't perfect, but they don't put forward ideas for any of the changes. We have been suggesting changes for several years, and we have been told each time that it just needed a little more time, that it was a perfect bill.  Soon we will be trying to do a budget. It would be nice if we had some suggestions on budget items that were positive things. I put out that offer as well.  The reason we are having this is that more than 7 years ago, President Obama and congressional Democrats imposed a risky, partisan healthcare experiment on America that ultimately led to skyrocketing healthcare costs and collapsing insurance markets for millions of Americans across the country. This riverboat gamble has caused a stark and dramatic outcome. Currently, there are projected to be 50 counties across the Nation that will not have a single insurer participating in the ObamaCare exchange.  To add further insult, Americans seeking affordable coverage in these almost 50 counties will still be fined under the ObamaCare mandate for not having health insurance. In other words, many Americans will either be forced to pay for insurance they cannot afford or pay a penalty for not having health insurance under this so-called Affordable Care Act, which they can't even access. Where are these people supposed to go? What can we do to help? Again, we are looking for some positive suggestions.  My colleagues on both sides of the aisle know that this healthcare experiment has failed and that we must work together to free Americans from these mandates and put healthcare decisions back in people's control.  Today, Senate Republicans are taking an important step to rescue the millions of hard-working families trapped by ObamaCare's taxes and[[Page S4230]]mandates. We are trying to repair the Nation's broken healthcare system because we now have a President in the White House who shares our commitment to improve America's healthcare system and make better care available to all  One of our top priorities in Congress has been to provide relief for hard-working Americans from ObamaCare, which has pushed insurance markets to the brink of collapse. In Wyoming and across the country, premiums for hard-working families are soaring while choices for patients have dwindled. As I travel across Wyoming, I have a lot of people who tell me that their health insurance costs more than their mortgage and, if they ever need healthcare, they have a deductible that is bigger than that.  Simply put, ObamaCare stumbled out of the starting gate on the very first date the healthcare.gov website launched. You might remember how you couldn't get on the website or how you got kicked off after you had done a lot to put in information. Yes, ObamaCare stumbled out of the starting gate on the very first day that the healthcare.gov website was launched, and it has consistently failed to deliver on its core promises while hurting far more Americans than it is helping.  One thing both parties should agree on is that an accessible and affordable healthcare system should be available to each and every American family, and I truly hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will work with us to find common ground on healthcare that truly delivers better care.  Millions of Americans have been suffering under President Obama's healthcare law, and this past fall our Nation voted for a change. These hard-working Americans made it clear that fixing our healthcare must be a top priority for Congress and the This week, we are delivering on that promise of relief from  Making America's healthcare system more efficient and effective has always been an important and challenging endeavor for the public and private sector alike. President Obama and his congressional Democrats pushed Washington into the healthcare market, inflicting far greater uncertainty, cost, and disruption into the healthcare landscape than anyone ever imagined. By taking the important steps necessary to untangle Americans from this unworkable, unpopular, and unaffordable law, hard-working families can expect to see stability in the skyrocketing healthcare costs and egregious penalties imposed on them by the ill-named ObamaCare concept of ``affordable care.''  If you are young and healthy, ObamaCare has made it an easy choice to opt out of health coverage. But for those not so fortunate, for those who must have coverage, soaring healthcare costs are becoming a stunning reality. I have constituents in Wyoming who have written to me with worry and concern about their surging health insurance premiums.  I assume that my 99 other colleagues have received many letters like one I received from a family in Gillette, They recently wrote me that under ObamaCare they are paying more than $2,400 a month--essentially taking on more than another mortgage.  In their letter to me, they write:       Mike, we are small business owners in Gillette, Between      Obama trying to kill the coal, oil and gas industries and his      insurance fraud, we are stuck between a rock and a hard      place. I just paid a $2400 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Wyoming      Health insurance bill. I can't keep doing that. I am a real      person with real problems created by my own government. HELP      MIKE  That last line of this letter is especially moving: ``HELP MIKE HELP.'' This is why Republicans in Congress and the President have focused on doing just that--helping hard-working Americans like this family in They are looking to us to provide real leadership and rescue them from the failed ObamaCare law.  The previous administration seemed to focus only on protecting their self-described signature legislative achievement. Our focus must be to address ObamaCare's tangled and expensive web of regulations. For families like my constituents, the situation is grim and only getting worse by the day.  One of the most disturbing parts of this law is that Americans are now essentially double-charged by having to pay more in taxes to fund the very healthcare law that is driving up the cost of their insurance premiums. Let me explain further. ObamaCare taxes have increased insurance premiums and limited options for patients and healthcare providers, including taxes on prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, health insurance premiums, and medical devices.  Unless Congress acts, American households will be forced to pay nearly $1 trillion in new taxes and penalties over the next 10 years. Individual and employer mandate penalties forced millions of hard-working families into expensive and terribly inadequate ObamaCare plans that they did not want and could not afford. ObamaCare's crushing regulations mean smaller paychecks for families and prevent small businesses from expanding and hiring new workers.  For every American, ObamaCare has meant more government, more bureaucracy, and more rules and regulations, along with soaring healthcare costs and few choices. Working together, we can begin to lift these burdens and higher costs this law has imposed on all The bill we are debating this week will begin to provide relief from ObamaCare that millions of hard-working Americans have long demanded.  Fortunately, America now has a Congress and a President committed to helping stabilize the collapsing insurance markets that have left millions of Americans with no options.  The goal of the Republican healthcare bill will be to improve the affordability of health insurance, preserve access to care for Americans with preexisting conditions--yes, to preserve access to care for Americans with preexisting conditions--and to safeguard and strengthen Medicaid for those who truly need it. This will be accomplished by giving States more flexibility and ensuring that those who rely on this program won't have the rug pulled out from under them. Most importantly, we will free the American people from the onerous ObamaCare mandates to purchase insurance that they don't want and can't afford.  The American people have endured a lot under ObamaCare--including every broken promise. We all remember President Obama's promise to each and every American that if they liked their health plan, they could keep it. Well, Americans soon learned they couldn't keep their plan or their doctor or any extra money in their wallet. The main reason for this is because ObamaCare invaded the insurance marketplace and drastically reduced Americans' choice of healthcare plans and with it the competition necessary to contain the costs of health insurance. It was no surprise that the President's promise--if you like your plan, you can keep it--became the ultimate example of the unfulfilled and unattainable promises of  For many Senators, especially from rural States like mine, the real impact of ObamaCare on our health insurance market is much more disturbing. Wyoming currently only has one health insurer in the individual market, both on and off the ObamaCare exchange. Let me say that again so there is no mistake. There is only one health insurer either on or off the ObamaCare exchange for all of One health insurer for all of Many States are experiencing a similar crisis, with only one insurer left standing since others have entirely abandoned the exchanges.  For residents of Wyoming and millions of other Americans, the Obama administration's public relations campaign--on which it spent millions of taxpayer dollars--touted choice that ultimately became false advertising. This is the actual ``choice'' for millions of Americans: one and none--but the ``none'' will cost you because of the mandate penalty. You can't afford it, so you don't get it, and then it costs you because of the mandate penalty.  What about the promise of lower healthcare costs that provided the foundation for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to pass this flawed bill? Even President Obama's administration admitted that ObamaCare is failing to address costs, with average premiums rising by 25 percent for silver-level plans on the Federal exchange. That means families have to decide whether to purchase unaffordable insurance or pay a fine. In most cases, they are literally paying[[Page S4231]]more money for less control of their healthcare.  Last October's dramatic premium increase was clearly on the minds of voters when they cast their ballots in the November election. Let me say that again. Last October's dramatic premium increase was clearly on the minds of voters when they cast their ballots in the November election. There is trying to be some blame put on us for those increases, but that was before last November's election.  This is a crucial time for healthcare in We do not have the luxury of ignoring the crisis in health insurance markets and the crushing premiums faced by families across the country. Healthcare costs for my constituents in Wyoming continue to be among the highest in the Nation, with other States not far behind.  We must act now to rescue the millions of Americans who are suffering under ObamaCare in order to provide relief to those who have been harmed by this law. Unwinding this failed law to make meaningful changes has not been easy, but Americans are relying on us to accomplish this task and keep the promise to rescue them from Our goal is to create a healthcare system where Washington gets out of the way and families are again empowered to control their own healthcare, with more choices and lower costs.  So this is where we find ourselves today. Congress and the President are fulfilling their promise to provide relief for millions of hard-working Americans trapped by Obamacare's taxes and mandates. We are not tied to any single idea. We hope our Democratic colleagues will ultimately join us in this worthy endeavor. The American people are expecting us to act. We must not let them down.

14469,topic-id,1467,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague from Wisconsin, my fellow accountant, for doing a good job of accounting there and providing some charts that very explicitly show what he has been working on, what he has been encouraging people to do, and[[Page S4251]]some solutions. That is what we keep looking for within the criticism that we are getting from the other side of the aisle--some solutions.  Earlier this year, Congress took an important first step in fulfilling the promise of repealing ObamaCare by passing a budget resolution that paved the way for this debate that we are having right now and paved the way for some real healthcare reforms that we are currently debating. These reforms are focused on rescuing the millions of hardworking families who are trapped by ObamaCare's taxes and mandates.  You heard one example from the Senator from Wisconsin of a family who is paying excruciatingly high prices for their healthcare only to find out that they have $16,000 in deductibles, which makes it very difficult to utilize it at all. Is that insurance, if you have to pay $16,000 before the rest kicks in?  What we are doing here is working to stabilize collapsing insurance markets that have left millions of Americans with no options. We improve the affordability of health insurance. We preserve access to care for Americans who have preexisting conditions while we safeguard Medicaid for those who need it the most by giving States more flexibility. We ensure that those who rely on this program will not have the rug pulled out from under them. Most importantly, we liberate the American people from the onerous ObamaCare mandates of purchasing insurance they do not want and/or cannot afford.  Additionally, these bills can reduce the Federal deficit, the amount the Federal Government overspends each year, by billions of dollars. They can also end up saving taxpayers billions more by improving and reforming the way Medicaid operates. These aspects of the bill are enormously important. This will be the first time in a generation that we will have even attempted to rein in any of these programs and put them on a sustainable path--the ones that are threatening to bankrupt our country--without pulling the rug out from under people, as you saw from the charts by the Senator from  By reducing spending, lowering the tax burden on hard-working families, and curbing our national debt, which now stands at almost $20 trillion and is on its way rapidly to $29 trillion, we will be ensuring a brighter and stable fiscal future for our children and our grandchildren. Actually, with that kind of debt, we are almost ensuring a brighter and stable future for ourselves. We are in trouble.  While my colleagues complain about using the reconciliation process to untangle the country from this unworkable, unpopular, and unaffordable law, they should remember that they actually employed the exact same procedure to secure the passage of ObamaCare, without having any input or assistance from Republicans, and rushed it through both Houses of Congress in less than a week. Senate Republicans are responsibly utilizing this reconciliation process to address the healthcare crisis that has been thrust upon America by former President Obama and congressional  There is also the common misconception that some of my friends across the aisle have promoted--the idea that ObamaCare is a runaway success and that repeal will be tearing down a functioning program. This is, simply, not true. My Democratic colleagues know it is not true. Former President Obama knows that it is not true, and the American people, certainly, know it is not true.  Here is the reality. ObamaCare has put our health insurance markets on the brink of collapse in many parts of the country. As I pointed out in an earlier speech, that began in October of last year, which was before the elections. It has nothing to do with what has transpired since the elections. ObamaCare put our health insurance markets on the brink of collapse in many parts of the country, and what the Republicans are tackling now is what President Obama and congressional Democrats simply could not bring themselves to do when they had control, which was to fix the problems they had created. This may be because ObamaCare has enshrined their idea that bigger government is better and that any changes, unless done by Executive action under the President, were out of the question.  In their zeal to protect this flawed program, they may have missed it when President Obama himself admitted last year that the law had real problems.  He said:       There are going to be people who are hurt by premium      increases or lack of competition and choice.  He went on to say that these problems are simply called ``growing pains.''  Now, these growing pains have forced millions of Americans across the country to grapple with impossibly high health insurance premiums for plans they do not want, out-of-reach deductibles to help with common prescriptions, and disappearing insurance providers to even be allowed to shop for better coverage.  As I noted earlier, for more and more Americans, there is only a single insurer from which they can select health plans, and they may soon not have a single ObamaCare insurer, as 50 counties already do not have one, and others are threatened. Thousands only have one choice. In fact, on the Federal exchanges, one in five consumers will only be able to select plans from a single insurer. Many residents across the country will have only one choice of health insurer. This includes my home State of Wyoming, as well as the entire State of  What does this lack of competition mean? Premiums are surging for hard-working families, who now have to choose between unreasonable insurance rates or an unreasonable fine. If my colleagues wanted yet further evidence that competition lowers prices, they need look no further than their constituent mail.  In Wyoming, some families will be forced to pay more than 30 percent of their total income on premiums in order to obtain healthcare coverage, which often includes deductibles of over $1,000. One family faced premiums of more than $1,600 a month. As an alternative, their tax penalty for not carrying coverage was only $1,700 for the year. That is a $1,600-a-month premium charge or a $1,700 penalty for not covering it for the whole year.  So guess what they did? They paid the fine because they could not afford the insurance premium, let alone the deductible. I think $5.3 million in fines were collected in Wyoming from the people who could not afford the insurance. They took the lesser alternative of paying a tax penalty, which gave them nothing.  For those who are lucky enough to be able to afford insurance, particularly in the individual market, under the new health law, premiums are expected to increase faster in 2017 than in previous years. Some States will see insurance premiums rise by as much as 53 percent. That is in 1 year. We are talking about a 4-year doubling of cost. This will be a 50-percent cost increase in 1 year. That is truly a healthcare emergency. Not doing anything and accepting the status quo is simply unacceptable to millions of Americans suffering under this law.  Now that we have discussed why we are doing this, it is important to also ask how we hope to help these suffering It is vital that we stabilize collapsing insurance markets that have left millions of Americans with no options, while reestablishing the affordability of health insurance.  Our bill will also preserve access to care for Americans with preexisting conditions, and it will safeguard Medicaid for those who need it most by giving States more flexibility, yet ensuring that those who rely on this program will not have the rug pulled out from under them--contrary to the scare tactics being put forth by ObamaCare's defenders.  Most importantly, Congress is working to free the American people from the onerous mandates to purchase insurance they don't want or can't afford.  Congressional Republicans and our President are focused on securing the future of Americans' healthcare system and truly understand the importance of restoring the trust of hard-working taxpayers.  What we are doing here under reconciliation, which is a budget process, will not solve all the problems. There will be an opportunity for bipartisan investigation, support, and changes if the other side is willing to do that. There are some things that need to be[[Page S4252]]done immediately to protect the American taxpayers and the people who want to have healthcare.  So I ask everyone to focus on securing the future of America's healthcare system and to try to understand the importance of restoring the trust of hard-working taxpayers.

14624,topic-id,779,"Mr.President, I rise today with my colleagues Senators Leahy, Brown, Cardin, Durbin, Franken, Klobuchar, Murphy, Murray, Markey, Merkley, Sanders, Udall, and Whitehouse to introduce the Cluster Munitions Civilian Protection Act of 2017.  First and foremost, the legislation would limit the use of cluster munitions by the U.Armed In June 2008, then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates signed a memo stating that after 2018 the United States will not use cluster munitions with a greater than 1 percent unexploded ordnance rate. The Cluster Munitions Civilian Protection Act would codify the Gates policy by immediately prohibiting the use of cluster munitions with a greater than 1 percent failure rate.  Second, this bill would make it clear that the export of U.S.-made cluster munitions must be contingent upon the receiving country not using these weapons inappropriately. Since 2008, the Congress has required that U.S.-made cluster munitions can only be used by the recipient country against clearly defined military targets and will not be used where civilians are known to be present or in areas normally inhabited by civilians.  During the 114th Congress, the Defense Department discovered that several export agreements for U.cluster munitions--known as letters of offer and acceptance--failed to mirror congressional restrictions on their use. Specifically, the Pentagon found that letters of offer and acceptance with South Korea and Saudi Arabia were either incomplete or missing. While the Pentagon is attempting to amend the mistake, it is imperative that the Congress make clear that U.S.-made cluster munitions must not be used where civilians are known to be present or in areas normally inhabited by civilians. As a result, the legislation requires export policies and licenses to restrict cluster munition use against clearly defined military targets and not in civilian areas.  Today 119 countries have signed or acceded to the Convention on Cluster In fact, four of our closest allies--Canada, Great Britain, Germany, and France--are states parties, legally bound by all of the convention's provisions.  The convention prohibits the use, production, transfer, and stockpiling of cluster munitions. The convention also requires the destruction of stockpiled cluster munitions within eight years, clearance of cluster munition remnants within 10 years, and assistance to victims, including those injured by submunitions.  I am disappointed that the United States has not signed the convention but believe we can move toward doing so. This legislation states that it is the sense of Congress that 1, the U.Government should phase out the use of all cluster munitions as soon as possible; 2, any alternatives that the United States develops to replace cluster munitions should be compliant with the Convention on Cluster Munitions; and 3, the United States should accede to the convention as soon as possible.  The United States has not widely used cluster munitions since the first weeks of the 2003 Iraq war. Unfortunately, cluster munitions have been used by others around the world with devastating effect on civilians in the past year.  According to the Cluster Munition Monitor, since 2012, Syrian government forces have used at least 13 different types of cluster munitions in 360 recorded attacks. Additionally, the United States and the United Kingdom have publicly accused Russia of using these weapons in Syria, including against the moderate opposition.  In Yemen, the Saudi-backed coalition has employed cluster munitions against the Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have documented at least 19 instances of cluster munitions use in Yemen, including with U.S.-made weapons. The U.Defense Department has acknowledged that U.S.-made weapons were employed in Yemen, though the Pentagon has said their use didn't violate export restrictions.  Finally, there is evidence that cluster munitions were also used in the Nagorno-Karabakh region and by Kenya in  According to the Cluster Munitions Monitor, over the past 50 years, there have been 20,300 documented cluster munitions deaths in 33 nations. The estimated number of total cluster munitions casualties, however, is an astonishing 55,000 people.  While cluster munitions are intended for military targets, in actuality civilians accounted for 97 percent of cluster munition casualties in 2015.  Worldwide casualties caused by cluster munitions demonstrate that they are indiscriminate weapons. While U.S.-made cluster munitions reduce the likelihood of civilian casualties when they are used correctly, U.ratification of the Convention on Cluster Munitions would help move the world toward a global ban.  This legislation moves the United States toward accession by codifying the Gates policy and encouraging the Pentagon to develop alternatives to cluster munitions that are compliant with the convention.  Mr.President, the Congress cannot compel the administration to sign the Convention on Cluster But, we can surely take steps to abide by its spirit. Passing the ``Cluster Munitions Civilian Protection Act'' would do exactly that.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.[[Page S2457]]                            ____________________",CREC-2017-04-07-pt1-PgS2451.txt,1332,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,7.0,July

14682,topic-id,266,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague from Michigan (Mr.Upton).  I rise in support of H.951, a bill I authored to extend the license authorizing the Wilkesboro Hydroelectric Company's construction of its hydropower project at Kerr Scott  The project has required exhaustive coordination with the U.Army Corps of Engineers, and there have been delays in the review process for the design plans. As the Wilkesboro Hydroelectric Company takes steps to comply with statutory mandates and requirements by Federal regulators, the shot clock for action on breaking ground dwindles. As has often happened with these projects, delays in the review process and coordination efforts precluded the start of construction.  I ask my colleagues to support a new authorization for this project, along with the other projects the House is considering today. Furthermore, I applaud Representative McMorris Rodgers and the House Energy and Commerce Committee for working on comprehensive reform legislation to address the statutory framework and FERC processes pertaining to these projects.  I am a proud supporter of our Nation's renewable energy resources. Congress should optimize the use of our Nation's clean, renewable hydropower potential by bringing regulatory and permitting certainty to the process.  Given North Carolina's growth and demand for electricity, my State needs Congress to explore every opportunity to meet our energy demands, provide for job growth, and sustain our environment. As chair of the Education and the Workforce Committee, I will work tirelessly with the other committees in the House and the Trump administration to achieve this.  I thank Chairman Walden, Majority Leader McCarthy, and former Chairman Upton for bringing this important legislation to the floor.

14504,topic-id,1297,"Thank you, Madam  Madam President, I rise this evening to speak in opposition to the Republican plan to dismantle our healthcare system. Their effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act and gut Medicaid would put the health, as well as the financial security of millions of Americans, at risk.  Let me tell you how this would affect Minnesotans such as Annie and her 5-year-old son Carter has autism spectrum disorder and relies on Medicaid to help cover necessary therapy services. When Carter was 2, he did not talk, make eye contact, or interact with anyone. But now, because of the treatment he receives under Medicaid, Carter speaks full sentences and is entering kindergarten. Annie explains how none of that would be possible without If Republicans succeed in imposing drastic cuts to Medicaid, which is what they want to do, and States are forced to cut back services, Annie and her family would not be able to afford the therapy that Carter needs to thrive.  Think about that. Think about what that does to one life. Think about the other millions that would be affected in such a negative, tragic way.  There is also Mari and Chrysann, both from Moorhead, Moorhead is in northwestern Minnesota, right across the river from Mari took care of her aging mother in her home as long as she could, but when Chrysann's health began to decline, Mari helped her mom move to a nursing home where she could access the higher level of care she needed.  Mari and her husband work full time and still have children at home. I visited the nursing home where Mari spoke, and she got emotional when she told me that if it were not for Medicaid, her family would not have any other way to pay for her mother's care. She does not know how she would care for her mom or what would happen to her.  Chrysann, Mari's mom, is worried too. She spoke at this roundtable at the nursing home. She is worried about how the Republican plan will affect her own future and those of others who are in similar situations in nursing homes. Sixty-four percent of Americans in nursing homes have their care paid for by Chrysann told me this[[Page S4268]]plan is not about taking care of people but simply about ``survival of the fittest.''  Is that really the healthcare system we support in the United States of America--the survival of the fittest?  How about Chuck? Chuck is the CEO of Perham It is a rural hospital that is doing really innovative work in Northwest It is kind of central, north. It is in rural Minnesota, not unlike the rural areas in the Presiding Officer's  Chuck told me: ``Cutting Medicaid as drastically as they are proposing will force us to cut staff in areas that are actually saving the system money today.''  These cuts would affect nurses who run the hospital's medical homes, community paramedics, and other staff who are helping to keep people out of the Emergency Department, reduce readmissions, and keep people healthy overall. This is part of the innovation they are doing there. This is part of the innovation that Minnesota leads the Nation in.  Perham Health is one of the largest employers in town so taking away jobs does not just impact the patients and the hospital, it affects the community and rural economy. Cutting jobs and getting rid of successful reforms just does not make sense, and this would be repeated over and over and over again in rural  Again, the question is, Why are Republicans pursuing such a reckless and irresponsible strategy?  All of the bills they have proposed thus far will increase patient costs, including premiums and out-of-pocket costs, will increase the number of uninsured Americans, and will rip apart our healthcare safety net. These are not the changes Americans want. In fact, this is the opposite of what Americans want and are asking for.  Now, over the last day, we have heard a lot more about another path Republicans may pursue--a scaled-back plan that eliminates a handful of the ACA provisions, including the employer mandate and individual mandate. While these two changes may be politically expedient, they would, according to the Congressional Budget Office, drive up premiums and cause millions of Americans to become uninsured.  What is more, as the New York Times points out, this plan does nothing to address the criticisms Leader McConnell, President Trump, and their allies continue to lodge against the Affordable Care For example, this approach does nothing to improve competition and choice in the individual market and, in fact, injects far more uncertainty into individual health insurance markets, which are already rattled by the administration's deliberate efforts to sabotage them.  Should this plan pass the Senate, it will surely get much worse when the differences between the plan and the House bill are reconciled in the conference committee. According to news reports, a number of my Republican colleagues are arguing that passing this scaled-back version of repeal is really just a means to get to conference, where Members can further negotiate the House and Senate repeal and replace bills. In fact, some are even suggesting that the provisions in the House-passed bill would be a guidepost for negotiations.  I think all of us remember how awful, far-reaching, and--according to President Trump--mean the House-passed bill is. What is more, we can see the worst provisions of the Better Care Reconciliation Act resurface in the conference committee, which is the Senate repeal and replace bill that was defeated on a bipartisan basis.  Overall, pursuing this path is dangerous, given the tremendous number of unknowns. Not only would this half-baked--that is being generous--quarter-baked, scaled-back version of the ACA repeal destabilize health insurance markets, but it would also serve as a vehicle for Republicans to take up the most controversial measures included in the defeated BCRA and the House-passed bill.  Why on Earth would we support that?  Frankly, it is also delusional to believe that a small group of House and Senate leaders can craft a workable solution in a matter of days or weeks. They have had 7 years to come up with an alternative. They do not have one so how can we expect them to, all of a sudden, come up with a viable plan that affects one-sixth of our economy?  Look, this whole process has been and continues to be irresponsible. In fact, this is one of the most irresponsible policymaking processes I have seen in my time in the U.What we should do is just what Senator McCain called for in his speech yesterday, which is to pursue regular order, work together--Republicans and Democrats--and seek out compromise. If we reject this wrongheaded effort, then I and many of my colleagues are ready and committed to work in a bipartisan way on reforms that will expand coverage, lower costs, and improve care.  Let's have bipartisan hearings on the individual market, on drug prices, and more. Let's call in nonpartisan expert witnesses. Let's have meaningful committee and floor debates. Let's fix what needs fixing in the Affordable Care Annie, Carter, Mari, Chrysann, Chuck, and millions of other Americans need us to do just that.  To my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, please, stand up to the bullying, stand up to the lies, and work with us to improve people's lives, not make them worse. Paul Wellstone said that politics is not about winning, that it is not about power, that it is not about money.

I want to start someplace else that has been a very special part of my thinking about government issues, about policies of all kinds, and it was something that Franklin Delano Roosevelt said during the height of the Depression as the American government and Mr.Roosevelt were talking about the various policies that were being discussed at the time. He laid out a test to which he would apply his judgment of a policy. It reads this way: ``The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is rather we provide enough for those who have too little.''  I see this as a profound and extremely important criteria upon which to judge many policies that come before us in bills, but it is also, I think, an extremely valuable way to judge the question of the Affordable Care Act: Has it added much to those who have little?  I will try to answer that in a few moments.  Similarly, in looking at the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, the test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much. When we consider the repeal of the Affordable Care Act--ObamaCare--does it add to those who have much? Does it add to those who have little?  I will try to answer these questions in just a few moments.  So does the Affordable Care Act add much to those who have little?  The answer is: Categorically, it does. There is absolutely no doubt that the Affordable Care Act has helped those who have little. I will give a couple of examples. Just a couple.  One, a beauty salon operator in Sacramento, California, around the age of 30, married, wanting to have children but not able to do so because she had no insurance. A small-business operator, herself, maybe one part-time employee, unable to get insurance prior to the Affordable Care  My wife visited her after the Affordable Care Act went into place, and she was able to purchase private insurance through the subsidized market, and she happily, excitedly told my wife: And now my husband and I, we are going to have a baby. At last I have the insurance. And I want you to tell your husband ``thank you.''  That thanks is not to me. It is to the men and women of the Congress in 2010, myself included, and the Senate, and President Obama that signed the Affordable Care Act that set up a situation in which, through the California exchange, similar to other State exchanges, she was able to purchase insurance. Subsidized to be sure, but nonetheless, she was on her way to having a baby, or at least thinking about having a baby. I will come back to her in a few moments.  A second person, small family farmer in my district unable to have insurance throughout her entire adult life. In and out of hospitals for everything from an accident on the farm to some more serious things. Facing bankruptcy. The Affordable Care Act gave her the opportunity to have insurance, to stabilize her life, her healthcare, and, importantly, be able to avoid the financial disaster of a major medical bill that would have clearly bankrupted her and put her out on the street.  That is what the Affordable Care Act did to two constituents in my district. And that story is repeated over 20 million times around this More than 20 million Americans have been able to get health insurance as a result of Affordable Care And 6.1 million young Americans have been able to stay on their parents' insurance policies, not thrown off at the age of 18, but able to stay on until the age of 25. And 27 percent of Americans who have preexisting conditions--27 percent of us have some sort of preexisting condition--no longer a bar to being able to get insurance.  I was the insurance commissioner in California for 8 years, and I saw the forms that the insurance companies would require be filled out. Everything in their life from the moment of their birth--in fact, before their birth, they needed to disclose every single event. Did you have pneumonia? Did you have an illness of this or that? All the way down the line.  And if you answered ``yes'' to any one of those, you would probably not be able to get insurance. And 27 percent of the American public unable to buy insurance because of preexisting conditions, no longer the case in America today. It is gone. That is history.  This is my experience. Thousands of times I saw this. If a person went through that entire checklist and there was some inaccuracy in the way they answered those questions and they went to the hospital with a serious illness that was supposed to be covered, it was common for the insurance companies to go back and do medical underwriting after the event and deny the coverage. Common practice.  Something as mundane as: I did not have mumps when I was a child. Check, check, check. Oh, you had mumps? I am sorry, we are not going to pay for this operation.  Those days are gone. The Affordable Care Act did that.  In my own State of California, 3.7 million Californians are now insured due to the Medicaid expansion program, which we call Medi-Cal in And 1.4 million people now have insurance through the exchange. The two examples I gave are but two of 1.4 million Californians that have insurance. So it works. And it is not just that. There are other things.  Seniors, the infamous doughnut hole in which, under Medicare part D, the first couple of thousand dollars of drug expenses would be covered. And then serious illnesses, you blow through that quickly, and then you faced the doughnut hole, and it was out of your pocket.  So you found seniors all across this country unable to afford the continuation of the drugs that kept them alive. It is gone--or will soon be gone. The Affordable Care Act collapses that doughnut hole so that in another 1\1/2\ years, 2 years from now it would be gone and the Medicare part D would provide the drugs that are necessary to keep seniors alive.  The repeal of the Affordable Care Act would end that and send those seniors back where they were before, facing the ominous doughnut hole. It goes on and on.  Medicaid expansion, 20 million Americans covered; 3.7 million in The drop in insurance rates. Due to the Affordable Care Act, the uninsured rate is now the lowest in history.  Consider this: 16 percent of Americans in 2010, before the Affordable Care Act, did not have insurance--16 percent of the 380 million of us.                              {time}  1945  Today, it is down to just about 8 percent--excuse me, that is in 2016. There has been continued improvements since then, 8 percent. That is where those 22 million Americans are.  So we have seen this over time. As a result of the Affordable Care Act, the[[Page H5423]]uninsured in America have steadily decreased as the Affordable Care Act has taken hold.  Hospital-acquired infections significantly reduced. Under the Affordable Care Act, unnecessary hospital readmissions due to infections, have fallen for the first time on record, dropping 8 percent between 2010 and 2015. Why has this happened, you ask? Because in the Affordable Care Act, there was a serious financial penalty to hospitals when there was a readmission as a result of a hospital-acquired infection.  Is that important? It certainly is, for those who are not readmitted for infections.  The annual lifetime benefits, you have heard about this. You know somebody in your family, in your community, who had a limit on their insurance policy, $100,000 a year, or maybe a lifetime exclusion or limit of $200,000, or $300,000, or some number. If you have a serious illness, you blow right up through that barrier, and your coverage, it is on your account. Hospital coverage and expenses are no longer covered by the insurance policy.  That is gone. It is over. It doesn't exist any longer in the United So the end to annual and lifetime limits is a direct result of the Affordable Care  Slower premium growth and a cap on out-of-pocket expenses. Due to the Affordable Care Act, all health policies now have a limit on out-of-pocket costs, which benefits all  Free preventative care. Have you talked to any seniors recently? If you are on Medicare, you have an annual free checkup. What does that mean? It means that your high blood pressure that you didn't know about, your onset for diabetes and other illnesses, you find out about it, deal with it, live longer, reduce the costs.  In part, that is the reason that we have now seen that the Medicare viability, the financial viability of Medicare has been extended by nearly a decade as a result of the Affordable Care Act and the kind of policies that were built in it--for example, free preventative care.  I have already talked about young adults being able to stay, and that is 2.3 million young adults.  Lives saved from reductions in hospital-acquired conditions. Eighty-seven thousand Americans are alive today because of better healthcare in the hospitals.  Public satisfaction. Eighty-two percent of the consumers in the marketplace plans or newly insured under Medicare due to the ACA, the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, have expressed satisfaction with their coverages.  Tax credits. Seven in 10 consumers in the marketplace got coverage through their tax credits.  I already talked about preexisting conditions.  Mental health and maternity care. Family values, well, we hear that all the time here on the floor. Family values, this is a family value. This is a family value, yes. And the Affordable Care Act is a family value because maternity coverage is guaranteed. The most basic element of family, babies are now covered.  Maternity care is now guaranteed coverage under the Affordable Care And from the moment that baby is born, through their life under the Affordable Care Act, they have a guaranteed coverage, regardless of any illness that they may have at birth.  I can give you story after story that I found when I was an insurance commissioner in The family had coverage. The family actually had maternity coverage. The baby is born with a serious defect of some sort. There was no coverage for that baby because of a preexisting condition from the very moment of birth. That is not the case any longer in America as a result of the Affordable Care  We can go on and on, and probably we ought to. We have heard a lot. I am just going to keep this up here to remind all of us about a test of what good public policy can and should be.  There has been a lot of talk now about the collapse of the insurance market. We have heard the President talk about the collapse of the insurance market. Any time he brings up the issue of the repeal of ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act, he always prefaces it or follows his comments with: The insurance market is imploding. It is collapsing.  We have heard that discussion here on the floor from the leaders of the majority party. The Affordable Care Act is collapsing. The insurance markets are collapsing. Oh, my, my.  Let's see, this is the 10th of A report was issued by The Henry Kaiser Family Foundation--not a liberal organization, not a conservative organization, but one of the best-known research organizations on healthcare in The Henry Kaiser Family Foundation issued a report on July 10, 2017, by Cynthia Cox and Larry I won't read it all to you, but I will read the discussion point.  Early results from 2017 suggest the individual market is stabilizing and insurers in this market are regaining profitability. Insurance financial results show no signs of a market collapse. Anybody listening?  Early results from 2017 suggest the individual market is stabilizing and insurers in this market are regaining profitability. Insurer financial results show no sign of market collapse.  First quarter premium and claims data from 2017. First quarter premium and claims data--this is from the insurance companies--from 2017 support the notion that 2017 premium increases were necessary as a one-time market correction to adjust for a sicker than expected risk pool.  Although individual market enrollees appear, on average, to be sicker than the market pre-ACA, data on hospitalization in this market suggests that the risk pool is stable, on average, and not getting progressively sicker, as of early 2017.  Some insurers have exited the market in recent years, but others have successfully expanded their footprints, as would be expected in a competitive market.  Now the caveats. While the market, on average, is stabilizing, there remain some areas of the country that are more fragile. In addition--and here is the important point for any policymaker in Washington, D.C., from the President to the rest of us. In addition, policy uncertainty has the potential to destabilize the individual market generally.  Mixed signals from the administration and Congress as to whether cost-sharing subsidies under the Affordable Care Act and cost-sharing reduction payments will continue, or whether the individual mandate will be enforced, have led some insurers to leave the market or request larger premium increases than they would otherwise.  Few parts of the country may now be at risk of having no insurers. If you don't mind, I would like to go back over that again. Mixed signals from the administration--hello, President Trump and Hello, my colleagues--who have voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act, mixed signals from the administration and Congress as to whether cost-sharing subsidy payments will continue, or whether the individual mandate will be enforced, have led some insurers to leave the market or request larger premium increases than they would otherwise.  So who is responsible for the collapse? Well, we can do some finger-pointing, but then I would be admonishing--Mr.Speaker, I should do some finger-pointing, but I am not going to do it right now.  I am going to go back here. ``The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much.''  Let's look at the repeal. Let's judge the repeal based on that criteria. Maybe you don't believe Franklin Delano Roosevelt was correct, but maybe we ought to just see what we are talking about here.  The repeal of the Affordable Care Act, the legislation that passed this House, the tax provisions in the Affordable Care Act, it is somewhere north of a $700 billion to $800 billion reduction in taxes. That is a lot of tax reduction. That was in the legislation.  I have argued repeatedly here on the floor and other places that it is the largest single transfer of wealth from the poor and the middle class to the super wealthy. That argument is factual because, what are the benefits? Who wins in the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, the poor, or the 22 million to 24 million people who will lose their insurance as a result of the repeal of the Affordable Care Act? That was in the House bill.[[Page H5424]]  In the Senate bill, they are talking about similar numbers, 23 million, 24 million, 25 million people. That is a lot of Americans who are going to lose their insurance and are going to be personally, physically harmed as a result of the repeal.  So who benefits? The other side of this piece of legislation is one of the largest tax reductions ever--not for the poor, small for the middle class, but oh, my, for the wealthy, the top 1 percent of Americans--excuse me--the top one-tenth of 1 percent of Americans would have their taxes cut, on average, by $197,490 per year. That is the top one-tenth of 1 percent.  How about the top 100 wealthy families in America, five of whom are in this administration, the super wealthy, what does it mean to them? $4 million to $6 million a year reduction, on average, in their taxes. The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much.  Need I stand here on the floor for hours driving home the point that the repeal of the Affordable Care Act is more than a taking away of healthcare benefits in which, if we were to believe the Senate and the Senate bill were to become law, 18 million Americans next year would lose their health insurance, and then beyond, another 5 million Americans in the years ahead.  It is a test of our progress. It is whether we provide enough for those who have too little. It is pretty easy, a pretty easy criteria when applied against the repeal. Are we providing anything for them? No, you are taking away their healthcare, their health insurance, and, undoubtedly, their health and their lives. It doesn't meet this test at all.  On the tax side, oh, my, the bottom 80 percent of taxpayers in this Nation would receive the awesome, extraordinary benefit of a reduction of $160 a year in their taxes.                              {time}  2000  That is what our Republicans have offered us with the repeal of the Affordable Care Eighty percent of American taxpayers would receive the awesome, extraordinary benefit of a $160 annual reduction in their taxes, while the superwealthy, the top 100 families, a $4 million to $6 million annual reduction, and the top one-tenth of 1 percent of Americans--wealthy--would receive a $197,490 reduction, on average.  Mr.Roosevelt, President Roosevelt, laid out a clear criteria.  So where are we? Where are we? We have the Henry Kaiser Family Foundation report yesterday. The insurance market is not collapsing, and where it is is the result of what this administration and Congress are doing. They are destabilizing the market. That is what is happening. That is why these insurers are leaving certain communities and certain States because they simply do not know what is going to happen.  Insurance companies have to plan now--actually, a month or two ago--for the insurance policy that they will be selling in the fall and in the early winter, October, November, December, for the next year, the 2018 year. And they do not know because of what this Congress is doing; they don't know how to price, and therefore market instability is the result.  There is more to it than that. Under the law today, the Federal Government is supposed to be providing money for the exchanges. That money has been withheld under this administration in numerous ways, actively and proactively taking steps to undermine the insurance market so, presumably, they can say: ``Oh, my, it is collapsing.''  Well, if it is, it is the President's fault, and it is the fault of this Congress in passing such legislation.  Now, I hear a lot of talk, and it is correct, a lot of discussion about what we can do together. Let's not fight. Let's work together. Let's improve the Affordable Care We ought to, and we can. There are many ways it can be done.  So what can we do?  Well, we could immediately end the efforts to destabilize the market. That would be a good start, wouldn't it? All that takes is an end to this effort to repeal and, rather, to do what the President asked us to do, and that is to work together as he drives forward policies that destabilize the market as he continually talks about repeal. But he also says, ``Let's work together.'' I agree with him. Let's work together. I ask the President to please stop his efforts to destabilize the market.  So what can we do?  How about if we allow the Federal Government to negotiate the price of drugs? We can't do it now, but what if we did? Would that help stabilize the market? It would certainly help reduce the cost. That is not a bad idea. So idea one. Let's allow the Federal and State governments to negotiate the price of prescription drugs and allow individuals to buy certain medications in Canada, for example, which they cannot, now, legally do.  We might think about expanding programs that are proven to enhance quality and reduce costs, such as streamlining care coordination. Coordinate the care and medical services that an individual has, particularly for those with chronic conditions, where most of the healthcare dollars are spent. It has been proven.  There are programs out there, pilot programs, and some are more permanent, that allow for coordination of benefits--that is, services--for those who have chronic illnesses. Part of that is found in the current Affordable Care It is being done. It needs to be expanded.  And we can dramatically improve the care and the health of individuals by coordinating their care, making sure, for example, that people with diabetes are able to get the drugs, get the treatment, work on their healthcare, work on the food they eat, and work on exercises, coordinate all of that. If you want to drive down the cost of healthcare, take the six chronic illnesses and coordinate the care. Keep people healthy. Keep them out of the hospital by being healthy. We can do that. We do, but not everywhere.  Allow States greater flexibility in administering the Medicaid program. Our Republican colleagues talk about this. We should do it. I am in favor of it.  I know from my experience as insurance commissioner in California that there are many things that can be done by the States as they deal with the peculiar and individual circumstances of the citizens of their State in altering the Medicaid program so that it can meet the needs of the Let's do it, but not with the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and stripping out of the program billions upon billions of dollars so there really is no money to do anything. That is flexibility in the Medicaid program.  We have a national health insurance exchange program. It is there, but it has been reined in. It has not been allowed to grow as it could by the actions of Since the Republicans took control of Congress, they have withheld, they have reined in, the national health insurance exchange program. This is in States that refused to establish their own exchanges. Individuals can then go to the national exchange. But they don't even know it is there because the advertising for the national exchange has been eliminated. So we can do that. It is pretty simple.  Hey, folks across America, you don't have a State exchange? You can come to the national exchange. You haven't heard about it? I am not surprised because there is no advertising. There is no knowledge available to individuals. It is a pretty simple thing we can do. As that exchange grows, we begin to spread the risk across a wider population.  In the early version of the Affordable Care Act here in the House of Representatives, we passed and I voted for what was known as the public option, a national public insurance option. The Senate removed it--mostly Republicans, but some Democrats didn't think that was a good idea. I thought it was a good idea in 2009 when the issue came before us because I saw an advantage in a national insurance program.  So there are five things that we can do right there, and there are many, many more.  When the repeal of the Affordable Care Act passed through this House on the floor, my Democratic colleagues offered 22 amendments to improve the Affordable Care Act, to improve They were all rejected. So much for working together.  But let me make a baseline statement: Don't repeal the Affordable Care Act; improve the Affordable Care If you are determined to repeal the Affordable Care Act, there is not much[[Page H5425]]we can work with. That is why I took the time to talk about the Americans that are now covered, the seniors that now have drug coverages, the end of discrimination based upon preexisting conditions. That is why I talked about those things.  In a repeal--and the President called for a flat-out repeal--that is gone. It is gone. If you want to do that, don't count on me. I won't be there. But if you want to take the Affordable Care Act and if you want to deal with the problems that we know are there, then let's work together.  I just laid out five things. There are 17 more that have been suggested by my Democratic colleagues. We can improve the well-being of We can help those people.  As for my wife's hairdresser, I don't know if she is going to get pregnant because she doesn't know if she is going to continue to have coverage. For that farmer, that woman who is running her own family farm, she doesn't know either. There are 23 million Americans who are in that position--23, and quite possibly more--who don't know if a year from now, 2 years from now, they will have health insurance.  So, President Roosevelt: ``The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.''

REPORT ON PROSECUTORS SEEKING MANDATORY RESTITUTION                    IN TRAFFICKING       Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of      this Act, the Attorney General, in consultation with the      Administrative Office of the United States Courts, shall      submit to Congress a report on efforts to increase mandatory      restitution orders and use of asset forfeiture to provide      restitution to victims of trafficking that shall be posted on      a publicly available website, which shall include the      following:       (1) Information on the Department of Justice's training      programs on mandatory restitution and the use of asset      forfeiture to provide restitution to victims of trafficking,      and recommendations of necessary additional training to      ensure mandatory restitution is ordered in all relevant human      trafficking cases.       (2) An assessment of obstacles that continue to prevent      Federal prosecutors and Federal courts from ordering      restitution.       (3) An assessment of whether the asset forfeiture      provisions in the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of      2015 and the amendments made by that Act have helped increase      requests to transfer forfeited proceeds for restitution,      including how many requests have been made and how many of      those requests have been approved, and whether United States      Attorneys offices are properly informed about requesting      transfers.       (4) An assessment of how establishing trauma-informed,      victim-centered investigative and prosecutorial procedures      can help improve mandatory restitution orders, including by      encouraging victims of trafficking to cooperate in criminal      cases, equipping victims of trafficking with proper      assistance during criminal proceedings, and helping victims      of trafficking secure mandatory restitution.       (5) The annual number and percentage of Federal cases      related to human trafficking, separating sex trafficking and      labor trafficking, during the period beginning on June 1,      2015, and ending on the date of the enactment of this Act, in      which restitution was ordered, and the amount of restitution      ordered in each case.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ENCOURAGING STATES TO ADOPT                    PROTECTIONS FOR VICTIMS OF       Congress recognizes and applauds the State legislative      bodies that have taken tremendous steps to adopt protections      and services for victims of trafficking. Congress encourages      States to do the following:       (1) Uphold the basic rights and dignity of human      trafficking survivors.       (2) Adopt a survivor-centered approach to addressing human      trafficking that ensures the safety, confidentiality, and      well-being of victims of trafficking, while recognizing      symptoms of trauma and coping mechanisms that may impact      victims' interactions with law enforcement, the justice      system, and service providers.       (3) Implement screening mechanisms for all children      entering child welfare services, the juvenile justice system,      or the criminal justice system to identify child victims of      trafficking and connect them with appropriate services,      including appropriate housing and services from trained      trauma-informed care service providers, and to try to      identify foreign nationals who may be victims of trafficking.       (4) Ensure that child victims of trafficking are provided      with a range of protections, including access to child      welfare services, trauma-informed programming, and the same      legal rights afforded to other children who experience sexual      abuse, rape, or incest, including ensuring that--       (A) criminals who exploit child victims of sex trafficking,      including offenders who purchase, solicit, or obtain a child      for purposes of engaging in a commercial sex act, face      serious penalties and sentences under sex trafficking laws,      and are not given lesser sentences; and       (B) child victims of trafficking are never referred to as      ``child prostitutes'' or ``underage sex workers'' in law or      official documents and proceedings.       (5) Develop a 24-hour emergency response plan to provide      victims trafficking with immediate protection and support      when they are first identified, which may include physically      moving victims of trafficking to a place of safety, attending      to the immediate[[Page H4486]]     medical and emotional needs of survivors, assessing whether      survivors are under risk for harm, retaliation, or      intimidation, and directly connecting survivors with victim      advocates, housing, and service providers.       (6) Adopt protections for victims of trafficking that      include the right--       (A) to be treated as a victim of crime and afforded      justice, respect, and dignity;       (B) to protection if the victim's safety is at risk or if      there is danger of harm, retaliation, or recapture by the      trafficker;       (C) to comprehensive trauma-informed, long-term, culturally      competent care and healing services oriented toward      emotional, psychological, and family healing;       (D) to evidence-based screening and assessment tools,      treatment plans, and therapy to address traumatic stress and      associated mental health symptoms;       (E) to safe and effective emergency and long-term housing;      education, vocational, and job assistance and training;      mentoring programs; language assistance; drug and substance      abuse services; and legal services;       (F) for child sex trafficking victims to be treated as      children in need of child protective services and to be      served through the child welfare system, where appropriate,      in place of the juvenile justice system;       (G) for all victims of trafficking, including United States      citizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals,      to be eligible for services;       (H) to have convictions and adjudications related to      prostitution and nonviolent offenses vacated and such records      cleared and expunged if offenses were committed as a direct      result of the victim being trafficked, and protection for      foreign nationals from being removed, being determined to be      inadmissible, or losing any immigration benefit because of      such conviction or arrests;       (I) to the same type of court procedures and legal      protections accessible to victims of sexual assault, rape,      child sexual abuse, or incest, including the right to not be      treated as a criminal; and       (J) to retain all rights regardless of whether the crime      has been reported to law enforcement.

14297,topic-id,377,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.2473, the Put Trafficking Victims First Act of 2017, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.  Human trafficking has plagued communities and neighborhoods across Victims have endured horrific trauma, violence, and reoccurring abuse. As a result, there is a tremendous need for expanded victim services, improved data on the prevalence and trends of human trafficking, and effective mechanisms to identify and rescue trafficking victims.  H.2473 takes reasonable steps to increase victim services while improving upon the tools already available to combat human trafficking. The bill directs the Attorney General to provide a report on the effectiveness of State safe harbor laws to ensure these laws are based upon a survivor-centered approach.  In addition to the report, the bill instructs States to recognize coping mechanisms and the symptoms of trauma as local law enforcement interacts with victims of human trafficking.  Furthermore, the legislation provides for increased training and technical assistance for State and Federal agencies, prosecutors, and law enforcement on how to take a victim-centered approach to preventing human trafficking. This provision promotes evidence-based training in order to improve the physical and mental health services provided to victims.  The bill's focus on supporting victims continues as H.2473 instructs the National Institute of Justice to establish detailed methodologies to review the modern trends and detail the prevalence of human trafficking throughout the United The survey will not only assess how victims of trafficking are accessing services, but, in addition, help estimate the prevalence of human trafficking in the United  Moreover, H.2473 will provide assistance to trafficking victims seeking restitution, many of whom still face many obstacles in Federal court. The bill directs the Attorney General to report on efforts to increase mandatory restitution for victims by providing Congress with data involving the number of Federal cases related to human trafficking in which restitution was ordered, as well as the participation rate of victims in trafficking criminal proceedings.  Finally, the bill expresses the sense of Congress that States should implement trauma-informed, victim-centered care for all trafficking victims.  Mr.Speaker, Congress' intent is clear: Protecting victims from the heinous crime of human trafficking is of utmost concern.

14480,topic-id,2093,"Mr.President, let me just tell my colleagues where I am coming from.  Under the current system--ObamaCare as we know it--the money to help people buy insurance and the money for Medicaid expansion, those two pools of money--here is what happens under ObamaCare: California is 21.39 percent of all the money, and they are 12.15 percent of the population. Maryland gets 2.35 percent of the money, and they are 1.86 percent of the population. Massachusetts gets 6.67 percent of all the money, and they are 2.11 percent. New York gets 8.62 percent, and they are 6.11 percent. That is a lot of math for a guy who didn't do well in math. So 39 percent of all the money goes to four States that represent 22 percent of the population. I like these people. They are all good I just don't like them that much. The bottom line is, the rest of us--46 States--get 60 percent to divide up among ourselves. How can that be?  Senator Cassidy explained that the current system is weighted to the benefit of four States at the expense of the rest of us. I would like to fix that, and if you don't live in one of those States, you will want to fix it too.  What I want to do is take the money that we are spending under ObamaCare and block grant it back to the States so that we can level out the disparity in funding but go even further and allow people in each State to develop healthcare systems that meet the needs of that  If you are for single-payer healthcare, you will hate this idea because that will be the end of single-payer healthcare because the money and the power will leave Washington and it will go back to people where they live. It will be healthcare closest to the patient. So if you believe that[[Page S4255]]government is better--closer to the voter, closer to the people--if the idea of government close to the people is a good idea, I would argue that healthcare closer to the patient is a good idea.  I regret we didn't think of this sooner.  What Senator Cassidy said is that our goal is to make sure that no matter in what State you live, you are going to get X amount of dollars, and it is going to be fairly equal no matter where you live. If you live in a State with a unique disease problem or an aged State, you will get a little bit more because you will need a little bit more.  The model we have today is really disproportionate. It doesn't work. It is driving up healthcare costs all over the country. People are dropping coverage because the ObamaCare mandates are too expensive.  So what we are doing is we are leaving the taxes on the wealthy in place. To my conservative friends, I am sorry, but that is what we are going to have to do to make this work. We eliminate the medical device tax because that hurts innovation. We eliminate the individual employer mandate because that stifles the whole idea of having creativity at the State level. We leave the taxes on the wealthier Americans in place. We are able to take that money, plus money we would give to insurance companies to stabilize the national market, and block grant it back to the States with a formula that is fairer.  Let me tell my colleagues what that would look like. Let me drill down to what two States do, by the way. California and Massachusetts by themselves are 28 percent of all ObamaCare money and 14 percent of the population.  Let's look at Beginning in 2020, you are going to get 200 percent more. How can that be? It is where you start from. The people in Alabama are going to get a lot more money because when you look at the money coming through the ObamaCare system to the good people of Alabama and how we spend per patient, you are way behind. You are going to get a lot of money to catch up with what should be the national average.  Our friends in California are going to get a 38-percent reduction, but we are going to give you time to adjust for that. There is going to be a wind-down period. It is not going to happen overnight. There will be a fund that can help you if you can prove you have a unique population of people who are sicker and older.  To my good friend from Colorado, you get 42 percent more. How can that be? Under ObamaCare, the money that was going to these four States gets a little higher percentage if you block grant. Not only will you get 42 percent more money than ObamaCare would give the good people of Colorado, you actually get a chance to spend the money unique to the needs of  Let's go to Oklahoma, since we have a guy from Oklahoma here whom we like a lot. You get 200 percent. Why do you get 200 percent? You are starting way behind everybody else. The bottom line is, we want to catch you up beginning in 2020. We are going to have to take away from some other people because they are hoggish.  New York, California, we want to help you transition, but the rest of us are not going to sit on the sidelines anymore and watch you take most of the money. We are going to begin to level this out.  Where is South Carolina? I have a unique interest in that How did we do? We get 123 percent. That shows you where we start from.  In about 6 years, we are all going to meet. It is going to take 6 or 7 years to level this all out, and we are going to get more. Other States are going to get a little bit less. The ones that are about where they need to be will get about the same.  The big benefit for all of us is, the people in your backyard get to make decisions about healthcare rather than a Washington bureaucrat whom you will never meet. The big thing about this to me is, you have a voice now as a consumer.  Right now, if you don't like your healthcare under ObamaCare, whom do you complain to? Do you complain to your Congressman? I guess your At the end of the day, most of ObamaCare is administered by the Federal Government through a bureaucracy. We don't manage healthcare in the  Under this construct, the same amount of money is going to go back to your backyard, and you will get a better deal if you are starting on the tail end of this now. If you don't like what is going on in your State, you can actually complain to somebody whom you vote for in the statehouse. You can go to your State capital and complain to your  The likelihood that the person you are complaining to goes to the same hospital as you and your family goes up. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to complain to somebody who is in the same boat you are who goes to the same healthcare network because they live in your neighborhood?  To me, the most innovative thing we could do in healthcare in America is allow people in their own backyard to design healthcare systems that meet the unique needs of that State and give consumers a voice that really can be heard because, under this model, your statehouse and your Governor are going to have a lot of flexibility. They can't spend it on roads and bridges. They have to spend it on healthcare.  If they get really efficient, the savings they will accrue stays in that State to even do more for healthcare so you will have a race for efficiency rather than just a race to write bigger and bigger checks.  The big benefit to me is, if you are a healthcare consumer, you will finally have somebody you know you can talk to about what works and what doesn't.  We are about to talk about how we end this debate. I hope this idea will be looked at by not just Republicans but If you are from West Virginia--our good friend Joe Manchin--West Virginia gets 43 percent more dollars under the block grant than they would West Virginia gets to determine how to spend that money more under the block grant than they would under You can't spend it on roads and bridges, but you have to spend it on healthcare.  There are three things we are trying to achieve. We are not going to let four States take most of the money, a disproportionate share of the money. Over time, we are going to create a system--no matter where you live--you are going to get roughly the same amount of money from the Federal Government, but the money comes in a bock grant so the people in that State can use it without being dictated to by a Washington bureaucrat as long as it is on healthcare. The biggest thing we give you is a chance to have a voice about your healthcare because the people in charge of your healthcare will be in your own backyard, not in Washington, somebody who doesn't know you, you will never get to meet, and quite frankly doesn't understand your world.  I hope we can rally around this. These are not 100 percent done numbers. Generally speaking, this is pretty accurate. It came from the Labor-HHS people. It may change a little bit, but when you start the debate with four States getting 40 percent of the money, clearly most of us are going to get more. When you see these big numbers like our friends in Oklahoma and Montana, the reason you are getting so much more now is that the current system leaves you behind in an unfair way.  My goal is, if you live in Oklahoma, New York, and California, the Federal Government is going to provide healthcare resources as equal as possible, but those resources will be managed by people in the State, not bureaucrats in  I hope over the coming day and a half that maybe we can rally around an idea that we should have started with to begin with. I don't mind being generous when it comes to putting money on the table to make sure people can afford healthcare. The tradeoff is as follows. We leave most of the ObamaCare taxes in place because we need a funding stream to level out the inequities. We are going to have a tax cut bill later. I want a flatter tax, a smaller corporate tax, and lower individual taxes, but this revenue stream coming from wealthy Americans is going to be used in a different fashion. It is going to provide resources to States that they can manage, unlike ObamaCare where one-size-fits-all.[[Page S4256]]  To me, this is a tradeoff. To the people in West Virginia, I am not asking you to take less and have a tax cut for rich people. We are going to keep the wealthy taxes in place. I am asking the people of West Virginia to take 43 percent more money. It is not a trick. Use it wisely.  Thank you all. I hope over the next day we can inform you about how your State benefits. To those States who are going to have to ramp down, the only reason you are ramping down is you are taking so much more from the rest of us. Quite frankly, that is not fair. We want to be fair to you and give you a chance to adjust, but the rest of us should stand up and say it is not fair that an American in California or New York or Massachusetts--all fine States--gets 40 percent of the money. That is not right.  It is not right to have a one-size-fits-all healthcare system because you will not get the best product. The best product will come from innovation. Your strongest voice will come from having a say to people who live in your same community, talking to a politician who sends their kids to the same hospital you do. That is what this is all about.

14489,topic-id,883,"Mr.President, I rise today in support of Senator Casey's motion to strike provisions from TrumpCare that would harm individuals with disabilities by reducing their access to affordable healthcare or limiting coverage or benefits under Medicaid or in the private health insurance market.  Today, as Senator Casey noted, we celebrate the 27th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, recognizing the enormous contributions that Americans who experience disabilities have made in communities in New Hampshire and across our  Unfortunately, Senate Republicans are proposing massive cuts to traditional Medicaid, which threaten the support that individuals who experience disabilities need to thrive in their homes, their schools, and their communities.  A few weeks ago, I visited an organization called Granite State Independent Living in Concord, It is a nonprofit that helps individuals with disabilities of all ages to try to have an independent life for themselves. What struck me the most was the consistent theme that I heard over and over from[[Page S4259]]different people who experience different disabilities. They said that because of services like personal care attendants, transportation help, and other medical supports, they were able to work and live more independent lives.  Many shared their biggest fears about what would happen if they didn't receive the support--a real possibility if plans to decimate Medicaid go into effect. Their biggest fear is that independence would go away. There were fears of becoming a burden for their families or having family members have to give up their jobs or having to be put in a nursing home because that would be the only way they could survive.  Person after person talked about how much they wanted to contribute to American life--to their communities, to their States, and to our economy. I kept thinking that all of these people were expressing such an American value with their desires to roll up their sleeves, do everything they could to make a difference, to be self-sufficient, to be independent.  The ability for Americans who experience disabilities to reach their full potential is truly put at risk with some of these TrumpCare proposals, and just a little while ago on the floor, I heard a discussion that perhaps there might be a proposal put forward on the floor--maybe this evening--that would record a sense of the Senate that the Senate wants to make sure that whatever action it takes will not hurt people with disabilities. It will support people with disabilities.  There is no doubt that a kind word can go a long way on a difficult day, but as someone who has raised a child who has experienced severe disabilities, as someone who has spent a lot of time talking to people with disabilities and their families, I can tell you that sympathy and empathy only go so far.  The people I know who experience disabilities want to do everything they can to support themselves, to be independent, to be able to reach their full potential. There is a difference between charity and justice, and while none of us would ever reject the kindness that so many people demonstrate to people with disabilities, what we really should be working toward is making sure people with disabilities have the same access to healthcare, to education, to the workforce that will allow them to have what every American wants, which is an independent life where they are free to chart their own course, support themselves, move forward.  We celebrate the 27th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act today--one of our great moments in this country, as we have reminded ourselves of our Founders' vision. Our Founders said that every single person counts, and while they didn't honor that principle perfectly at our founding, while they did not count everyone at first, they have had the confidence that every generation of Americans would move forward, bringing in more and more people from the margins into the heart and soul of our democracy, our communities, our economy, and, in doing that, we would unleash the talent and energy of more and more It is that talent and energy that has been the secret of our country's success. It is our vision that continues to drive us forward.  On this day of all days, when we celebrate the progress we have made to honor the freedom, strength, and productivity of Americans who experience disabilities, the last thing we should do is pull the rug out from under those very people by decimating the Medicaid Program that provides them the kind of support that actually allows them to be free, to work hard, to be with their families, to make a difference, to be treated like every other American, to have the rights of every other American, and to feel like every other  We can't afford to go back to the days when we marginalized or didn't assist some of our most vulnerable people--people who want to participate and contribute to their communities and to the country they love. So I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of Senator Casey's motion and make clear that individuals with disabilities deserve the right to receive the support they need at home, at school, and in their communities, so they can be free and thrive.

14708,topic-id,751,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I thank my good friend from Oklahoma for yielding to me the customary 30 minutes for debate.  This measure is a bipartisan bill that will help Americans receiving support from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families find good-paying jobs.  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are more than 6 million job openings in our country. That is the highest level recorded since we started tracking this data, yet the share of Americans participating in the workforce is at a four-decade low. Clearly, there are underlying issues[[Page H5060]]that need to be addressed to get more people plugged into the workforce.  For people looking for jobs, TANF serves as a lifeline. TANF is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services and is designed to help in-need families achieve self-sufficiency. Under the program, States receive block grants to design and operate their own programs to fulfill the goals of the TANF program.  It is important to note that States are at risk of financial penalty if TANF participants receive more than a year of education or if States have more than 30 percent of the State TANF caseload in education and training programs. Due to these limits, States have largely abandoned efforts to promote or support work in their TANF programs. This is important to understand because one of the most effective ways to get more people employed is through employer-driven on-the-job training.  Research has shown that, properly structured, these programs result in better and more stable employment, especially for individuals who are otherwise unlikely to find work.  Although the measure we are debating today does not address this issue, this bill will help tip the scale back toward job-training programs. H.2842 establishes demonstration projects that combine work, training, and support for hard-to-employ TANF recipients.  This bill provides a onetime appropriation of $100 million to subsidize these programs. After the 12-month period, States are going to be required to report to Congress on the effectiveness of subsidizing wages in moving individuals receiving TANF into full-time jobs.  Since we are talking about jobs, we need to recognize that we as an institution have not provided the necessary resources to get people back to work. If you were to ask any Member of this body to outline his or her top priorities, I guarantee you that job creation would be mentioned every single time. We all agree on the need, but from there, the conversation stops. There are lots of proposals in Congress to create jobs, but we have been unable to pass a large-scale, bipartisan bill for quite some time. This really needs to change.  Given the legislation we are debating today, it is interesting to me that President Donald John Trump's budget proposal cut workforce training programs by 39 percent. Rather than present a jobs bill, he has presented a plan that would actually stop helping people looking for jobs. That, in my judgment, is penny-wise and pound-foolish. In bringing forward this legislation, I think it is being made clear that this body does not share that approach, but we need to do more than a single, targeted bill.  Five months into the Trump administration, Republican leadership still has not put forward a single large-scale piece of legislation to create good-paying jobs or raise the wages of hardworking Americans, but its leadership has rejected Democratic proposals out of hand.  We should be working every day on creating jobs and raising wages for everyone everywhere in But instead of focusing on job creation, Donald John Trump's budget request would destroy approximately 1.4 million jobs.  His budget would eviscerate billions of dollars from critical job-creating investments in infrastructure and innovation, dismantle skills training programs like the one we are discussing here today, ransack education benefits, and leave our country in a weakened state. Instead of bringing jobs back to communities that have fallen on hard times, the budget walks away from them.  So, Mr.Speaker, I will leave it at this. The underlying measure we are debating today is a good step forward. But one step is not nearly enough. We need to do more, not less, to strengthen our communities and help working families.  Just as I urge Donald John Trump to move past the campaign rhetoric and get serious, I also urge this body to lead with more bipartisan measures that will provide for necessary resources for those who need them most.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-06-22-pt1-PgH5059.txt,511,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,22.0,July

14712,topic-id,242,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  President Donald John Trump campaigned on the promise of job creation; however, his budget paints a very different picture. It cuts job training programs by 39 percent, and its radical spending cuts would lead to massive job losses.  In this body, we talk a lot about jobs, but we are 6 months into this Congress and have failed to pass any major job creation bills. While the bipartisan legislation before us today is, indeed, as my good friend points out, a step in the right direction, we can and we must do more.  Well, Mr.Speaker, I am happy to say that I have an amendment in my hand that will generate thousands of American jobs. If we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative DeFazio's bipartisan bill, H.2510, the Water Quality Protection and Job Creation This bill will create thousands of new American jobs through increased investment in our Nation's wastewater infrastructure. Here is a chance to take today's momentum a step further and consider Mr.DeFazio's bill in addition to the bipartisan TANF bill.  Mr.Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida?  There was no objection.  ",CREC-2017-06-22-pt1-PgH5059.txt,511,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,22.0,July
14713,topic-id,2841,"Mr.Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.DeFazio), my very good friend, the distinguished ranking member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee who will discuss our proposal.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for this opportunity. As he noted, the President has talked and tweeted incessantly about creating jobs and infrastructure investment, but, unfortunately, the only substantive proposal to come out of the White House that relates to infrastructure, infrastructure investment, and jobs is in his budget, and it actually reduces Federal investment in infrastructure, which would basically eliminate jobs.  So I mean, the bill before us today, bipartisan bill on apprenticeships is great, but you have got to apprentice for something that is real: a job in the end, construction.  America is falling apart, and, right now, we have nothing but rhetoric coming out of the White House, and now ideology. They are talking about privatizing all of the infrastructure in the United States so that you will pay tolls everywhere you go, and, you know, they call it asset recycling. They have come up with a catchy new name. That has been floated, but they haven't put any substance behind it.  So this amendment would allow the House to debate and pass H.2510, Water Quality Protection and Job Creation Act of 2017. This bill would provide $25 billion in direct infrastructure investment over the next 5 years to address America's crumbling wastewater infrastructure and local water quality challenges.  The state of our water infrastructure, according to the American Society of Engineers' report card of 2017, is a D-plus. Meanwhile, municipalities across the country have a backlog of more than $40 billion--B, billion--in clean water infrastructure projects, and, according to the EPA, communities need close to $300 billion over the next 20 years to bring their systems into a state of good repair.  It is clear that we cannot continue to neglect the serious needs of our aging water infrastructure. As these systems fail and degrade, they pose a risk to the health and safety of our citizens and obviously the environment.  I know the President promised, during his campaign, to make clean water a priority. I agree with that. He promised to triple funding for State revolving loan fund programs to help States and local governments upgrade critical drinking water and wastewater infrastructure.  Well, here is a chance to deliver on that promise. H.2510 does exactly that. It triples investment in America's crumbling water infrastructure.  I was a county commissioner at a time when the Federal Government was a good partner, and, in those days, they put up 85 percent of the cost of our wastewater system. We put up the other 15. You know, this could--by renewing this legislation and a commitment to the State revolving loan fund programs and adding in a grant component for lower income areas, that could, you know, be a great step in terms of Federal partnership and creating actual jobs for the apprentices that this bill wants to create.  There is widespread support for this legislation. I include in the Record letters of endorsement from 30 separate groups.                                   Ohio Environmental Council,                                                     Columbus,     Garret Graves,     Chairman, Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment,          Washington,     Grace Napolitano,     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Water Resources and          Environment, Washington,       Dear Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Napolitano: On      behalf of the Ohio Environmental Council, I am writing to      enthusiastically support the Water Quality[[Page H5062]]     Protection and Job Creation Act of 2017. This bill bolsters      the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (SRF) by authorizing $20      billion over five years for loans to improve wastewater      infrastructure in local communities. It also provides crucial      additional funding to help states control water pollution and      address challenges from outdated sewer systems.       The need for this bill has never been greater as the nation      faces a $40 billion backlog of clean water infrastructure      projects, with cities and towns needing $300 billion over 20      years to update their water systems. In Ohio, the American      Society of Civil Engineers found our state needs a total      $14.58 billion for wastewater improvements. The Clean Water      SRF is an essential resource to help meet this need.       The Water Pollution Control Loan Fund (WPCLF) program,      Ohio's Clean Water SRF, continues to provide fundamental      capacity to improve water quality for Ohio communities and      residents. The program includes several different loan      options that help both cities and rural communities prevent      water pollution. This includes funding to upgrade and replace      Home Sewage Treatment Systems (HSTS), as well as assistance      for wastewater collection and treatment, stormwater      activities, and efforts to reduce nonpoint source pollution.      Interest from the WPCLF program funds the preservation and      restoration of aquatic habitat to counter the loss of natural      systems that helped maintain the health of Ohio's water      resources.       Since its inception the Clean Water SRF has provided $7.2      billion serving 621 villages, cities, counties and sewer      districts helping to curb pollution while providing quality      jobs. To ensure this program's continuing success and help      Ohio address our water infrastructure needs, I urge your      support for the Water Quality Protection and Job Creation Act      of 2017.           Sincerely,                                            Heather Taylor-Miesle,     Executive                                  ____                                         California Association of                                          Sanitation Agencies,                                                   Sacramento,     Peter DeFazio,     Ranking Member, Committee on Public Works and Transportation,          House of Representatives, Washington,     Grace Napolitano,     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Water Resources and          Environment, Committee on Transportation and          Infrastructure, House of Representatives, Washington,       Dear Ranking Members DeFazio and Napolitano: The California      Association of Sanitation Agencies (CASA) is pleased to      support your efforts to address the water infrastructure      funding gap and specifically the introduction of the Water      Quality Protection and Job Creation Act of 2017. For 60      years, CASA has been the leading voice for California's      public wastewater agencies on regulatory, legislative and      legal issues.       CASA agencies are faced with mounting challenges of aging      infrastructure, growing demands from increasing population,      and emerging challenges from changing climate conditions.      Confronted with these realities, there is clear demand for      increased infrastructure investment, including the need to      invest in water recycling infrastructure and clean energy      facilities derived from the wastewater treatment process.       Under your legislation, the Clean Water State Revolving      Fund (SRF) would be renewed at $20 billion over five years.      This authorization represents a critical down payment toward      a robust federal commitment to the nation's water      infrastructure needs. According to the report, the financial      burden to simply meet water quality and water-related public      health goals of the Clean Water Act (CWA) in California was      in excess of $26 billion in 2012. Due to drought conditions      and other strains on our wastewater systems, that figure has      only gone up over the last 5 years. Nationwide the demand for      all clean and drinking water infrastructure needs has been      estimated at more than $300 billion over the next two      decades. CASA also supports the bill's provisions to      authorize grant assistance for water recycling as well as the      programs to address stormwater flows and combined sewer      overflows. In California, the ability to construct water-     recycling projects is vital to a safe and reliable water      supply and to ensure protection of our ecosystems.       As you and your colleagues work to develop a comprehensive      water infrastructure policy for the nation, we look forward      to working with you to advance meaningful federal assistance      programs.

Peter DeFazio,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Ranking Member DeFazio: The American Society of Civil      Engineers (ASCE) supports The Water Quality Protection and      Job Creation Act of 2017 to provide needed funds to fix the      nation's wastewater treatment systems.       The nation's wastewater treatment systems are the most      basic and critical infrastructure systems for protecting      public health and the environment, but are badly underfunded.      Nearly 240 million Americans--76% of the population--rely on      the nation's 14,748 treatment plants for wastewater      sanitation. By 2032 it is expected that 56 million more      people will connect to centralized treatment plants, rather      than private septic systems--a 23% increase in demand. In the      U.S., there are over 800,000 miles of public sewers and      500,000 miles of private lateral sewers connecting private      property to public sewer lines. Each of these conveyance      systems is susceptible to structural failure, blockages, and      overflows.       In March, ASCE released its 2017 Infrastructure Report      Card, which graded our nation's wastewater systems a ``D+.''      Many wastewater systems are aging and it's expected that over      the next two decades, requiring at least $271 billion to meet      current and future demands.       This legislation is an important step towards meeting our      country's wastewater investment needs and improving our      wastewater systems.

Re WIN's Strong Support for the Water Quality Improvement and          Job Creation     Peter DeFazio,     Ranking Member, House Committee on Transportation and          Infrastructure, Washington,       Dear Ranking Member DeFazio: The Water Infrastructure      Network (WIN), a coalition of the nation's leading      construction, engineering, municipal, conservation, public      works, labor and manufacturing organizations, strongly      supports the Water Quality Improvement and Job Creation      WIN also commends your continued work to reauthorize our      nation's critical water infrastructure funding programs. The      United States is facing a water infrastructure funding crisis      as documented in recent reports by CBO, EPA and WIN pointing      to a shortfall in funding for clean water infrastructure that      exceeds $300 Billion over the next two decades. The Clean      Water Act was last reauthorized in 1987 and WIN believes that      consideration and passage of legislation providing      substantial increased investment in America's Water      Infrastructure is long overdue.       WIN is encouraged by the growing bipartisan support in      Congress for investing in our nation's clean water      infrastructure. The FY '17 Appropriation Package released      this week calls for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund to      be funded at $1.39 Billion--a $414 M increase over the      original FY '17 funding request. The Trump Administration has      also made investments in our nation's water infrastructure a      top priority for the Environmental Protection Agency,      requesting increases in funding for both the Clean Water Act      and Safe Drinking Water Act State Revolving Funds in their      2018       WIN believes Congress must seize this unique opportunity      make long overdue investments in our nation's critical water      infrastructure. Investments in water infrastructure make      eminent economic and environmental sense for our nation. WIN      is committed to working with you and the bipartisan      leadership of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee      to advance water infrastructure funding legislation in the      First Session of the 115th           Sincerely,         The WIN Executive Committee--American Council of            Engineering Companies (ACEC), American Public Works            Association (APWA), American Society of Civil Engineers            (ASCE), Associated General Contractors of America            (AGCA), International Union of Operating Engineers            (IUOE), Laborers International Union of North America            (LIUNA), National Association of Clean Water Agencies            (NACWA), National Rural Water Association (NRWA),            United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters (The            United), and the Vinyl Institute (VI).                                  ____                              Oregon Water Resources Congress,                                       Salem, Oregon, May 3, 2017.     Re The Water Quality Protection and Job Creation Act of 2017.     Peter DeFazio,     Washington,       Representative DeFazio: On behalf of the Oregon Water      Resources Congress (OWRC), I am writing to express our      support of Congressman DeFazio's efforts to reauthorize the      Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) and tackle the water      quality financing needs in the country under The Water      Quality Protection and Job Creation Act of 2017. The CWSRF is      an effective program that addresses critical water      infrastructure needs while benefitting the environment, local      communities, and the economy.       OWRC was established in 1912 as a trade association to      support the protection of water rights and promote the wise      stewardship of water resources statewide. OWRC members are      local governmental entities, which include irrigation      districts, water control districts, drainage districts, water      improvement districts, and other agricultural water suppliers      that deliver water to roughly 1/3 of all irrigated land in      These water stewards operate complex water management      systems, including water supply reservoirs, canals,      pipelines, and hydropower facilities that serve a diverse set      of farmers, ranchers, and other water users contributing to      the local and global economy.[[Page H5063]]       The CWSRF is a perfect example of the type of program that      should be reauthorized because it creates jobs while      benefitting the environment, and is an efficient return on      taxpayer investment. CWSRF funded projects provide family      wage jobs in construction and professional services industry      that are a crucial component to economic recovery in Oregon      and other states. Moreover, as a loan program, it is a wise      investment that allows local communities to leverage their      limited resources and address critical infrastructure needs      that would otherwise be unmet.       OWRC was very pleased to see the passage of the Water      Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (WIIN) by      Congress in December last year. An integral piece of the      funding puzzle for our member districts was reinstated by      this act, irrigation district eligibility for principal      forgiveness. The CWSRF is often an integral part of an      overall package of state, federal and local funding that      necessitates a stronger level of assurance that loan funds      will be available for planned water infrastructure projects.      Irrigation districts are often located in rural communities      and have a small number of farmers with limited capacity to      take on loan debt. Even a small reduction in the principal      repayment obligations can make the difference in whether or      not a district can move forward with a project.       The CWSRF program is an important tool utilized by OWRC      members across Oregon, and we applaud this effort by      Congressman DeFazio to reauthorize this key program. OWRC      looks forward to working with the Committee and this Congress      as the Water Quality Protection and Job Creation Act of 2017      moves forward.

At      a time when much of our nation's infrastructure is at a      breaking point, bolstering our national infrastructure funds      is more critical than ever. Thank you for your leadership on      clean water infrastructure investment.       This bill authorizes $20 billion in Federal grants over      five years to capitalize Clean Water State Revolving Funds      (Clean Water SRF). Across the country, many communities are      struggling with how to pay for needed investments and      upgrades to infrastructure that protects clean water and      public health. According to the 2012 Clean Watersheds Needs      Survey, municipalities need close to $300 billion in      investment over the next 20 years to bring their wastewater      and stormwater management infrastructure to a state of good      repair.       The Clean Water SRF provides a critical source of funding      to states to address water infrastructure needs and reduce      pollution from stormwater and wastewater across the country.      This legislation will help communities address the estimated      $40 billion backlog in clean water infrastructure projects.      Additionally, this investment in our water infrastructure is      good for the economy. The report Water Works: Rebuilding      infrastructure, Creating Jobs and Greening the Environment      shows that investments in our water infrastructure, including      green infrastructure, would conservatively yield 1.9 million      American jobs and add $265 billion to the economy.       This legislation authorizes $20 billion in Federal grants      over five years for the Clean Water SRF to provide low-     interest loans and additional loan subsidizations to      communities for wastewater infrastructure. We are supportive      of efforts to increase the resiliency of treatment works to      natural or man-made disasters. In the face of a changing      climate, resiliency of our nation's infrastructure is      increasingly important.       Also, this legislation authorizes $2.5 billion over five      years for grants to address combined sewer overflows (CSOs)      and sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) and recapture and reuse      of municipal stormwater. CSOs and SSOs pose a significant      health and safety risk to communities and can damage local      economies that are dependent on clean water and tourism. We      are supportive of funds to address this ongoing problem that      can cost communities significant resources to address.       Economists estimate that between 20,000 and 26,600      construction, engineering, and manufacturing jobs are created      for every billion dollars of federal investment in water      infrastructure. Investments in the Clean Water SRFs are      critical to protect public health, promote job creation, and      restore clean water in our rivers, lakes, and streams.       SELC appreciates your leadership on clean water      infrastructure investment and your continued work on reducing      pollution related to aging and inadequately funded      infrastructure.           Sincerely,                                            Navis Bermudez,                                      Deputy Legislative Director,                                Southern Environmental Law  Mr.And according to the National Utility Contractors Association, every billion dollars invested in our Nation's water infrastructure creates or sustains 27,000 real jobs in the private sector. That means that the $20 billion in Federal investment in the Clean Water State Revolving Fund, including H.2510, would create or sustain approximately 540,000 jobs.  This is real. It is real. Real jobs for real people and real improvements in the infrastructure of this country. This would be a great step forward, and I urge that my colleagues adopt the amendment.

14715,topic-id,709,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  I first want to address my good friend about the previous question and the fact that it has not gone through the process. I will just remind him that the chatter in Washington today is about a healthcare measure that hasn't gone through the process, at least to the extent that most of us would all want.  I also have great respect for my good friend from Oklahoma, and I know he will see and get a chance to talk with President Donald John I am not likely to.                              {time}  1300  But I would ask him to tell him when he sees him for me that I came here in 1993, and there were 14,000 bridges in need of repair in America, and last year the statistics from the society that does that analysis showed that there are 54,000 bridges in need of repair in this country. The point that I wish to make is that we need a serious substantial infrastructure measure.  Mr.Speaker, we talk a lot about jobs in this I was at a forum on Saturday, and someone mentioned: My governor's mantra is ``jobs, jobs, jobs.'' And that person said: Well, he must mean that you have to have three jobs in order to get by.  I am glad that we are here today considering a bill that will help Americans in search of work to find a good-paying position that will help them support themselves and their families. We have a lot of issues facing us, and this bipartisan legislation is just one tiny step forward in the right direction. I hope this measure translates into more bipartisan bills.  Too often, from healthcare reform, tax reform--footnote right there. My friend mentions that we will likely see a tax reform measure sometime soon. I hope that it doesn't revert to trickle down. We have seen trickle down. It did not work, and I hope we don't do that again.  We have an opportunity on other issues, and in many respects the majority has shut out the minority from the process, just like what has happened until today, at least, in the other body with reference to healthcare.  The bills we have debated and even passed are projected to eliminate millions of jobs. Even as we talk about job creation, my friends across the aisle too frequently turn around and champion measures that would do just the opposite. There is so much room for cooperation in this area, yet time and time again we are kept out of the process, and the results speak for themselves. For the sake of our country, this needs to change.  Even though this is a bipartisan bill, it also serves as an example of what I mean. I was disappointed that my Republican colleagues in the Rules Committee blocked yesterday six germane amendments to this bill. It is a sympton of the closed process. When we prevent germane amendments from even being debated by the House, it does us all a disservice, yet my friends across the aisle do it again and again.  Mr.Speaker, I will close with this: President Obama is credited for creating 11.3 million jobs in our country. The economy added jobs for 75 straight months, and very fortunately that carryover for the last 5 months has continued.  While President Donald John Trump makes untenable pledge after pledge, I watched every word of his speech last night in Iowa, and all I heard was platitudes. I didn't hear anything about substance. And it seemed like a road test for some new ideas. He makes these untenable pledges, including a very humble promise to be--and I quote him--``the greatest jobs producer that God ever created.''  The record is clear, the Democratic Party is, has been, and will be the party of job creation, and is ready to work with my Republican colleagues to continue significant job creation in this country.  So I will ask my friends across the aisle, let us continue the trend of the past few years and work together to produce bipartisan measures that will benefit the American people.  Mr.Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-06-22-pt1-PgH5059.txt,511,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,22.0,July

14494,topic-id,1169,"Mr.President, I rise today to talk about my amendment, Heller amendment 288.  My amendment reinforces the important role Medicaid has played in my home State and in the States of many of my colleagues here today.  Let me explain the impact Medicaid has had on the State of As many of you know, the State of Nevada was the first to expand Before Nevada made that decision, the State's uninsured rate was at 23 percent, and it was one of the highest in the country. So think about that for a minute. One in four Nevadans did not have healthcare coverage. Under expanded Medicaid today, Nevadans' uninsured rate is between 11 percent and 12 percent. I have also seen the number of uninsured people living in Nevada's rural communities cut in half, and I have seen major gains with the number of children in our State with healthcare coverage.  In fact, Nevada has seen one of the most significant decreases in uninsured children in the country. In 2013, our State had the highest rate of uninsured children in the country. We were ranked 50th in the nation. Now I can proudly say that Nevada is the most improved State when it comes to addressing our rates of uninsured children. Our State has made significant progress since the State's decision to expand Medicaid, and that has made a big impression on me.  Over the past few months, I have had the privilege of meeting with Nevadans here in Washington, DC, as well as back home, to discuss healthcare. The resounding message I continue to hear is that, because of Medicaid expansion, more than 200,000 Nevadans have health insurance today who otherwise wouldn't. The other resounding message I hear is that drastic cuts to the Medicaid Program threaten the critical services that Nevadans rely on.  Let me read you a letter I received from a woman in Las She said:       My oldest child has Down Syndrome and has depended on      Medicaid since the day she was born, and was denied      healthcare because of preexisting conditions that she was      born with. My husband and I are hardworking We      started our own business 5 years ago and have seen that      business grow more and more each year. We do not rely on the      government for assistance, other than Medicaid coverage.      Without it, we would be unable to afford the numerous      appointments with specialists and surgeries that keep our      daughter happy, healthy, and progressing in life.[[Page S4261]]  This is one example of the real stories behind the numbers, and I want to do everything I can to make sure they are protected and their coverage is not threatened. I want to make sure their daughter has healthcare coverage today and tomorrow.  Medicaid also plays a crucial role in Nevada when it comes to covering the elderly and people with disabilities. More than 30,000 of Nevada's seniors receive healthcare through Medicaid, including nursing home care and services that help them live at home. In fact, more than half of Nevada's nursing home residents are covered by Nearly 50,000 people with disabilities in Nevada now have access to care that helps them live independently, thanks to  Karen from Henderson recently contacted me and said that her adult son has MS and depends on Medicaid to help cover the cost of his medication, which costs $300 per month. Without Medicaid, he can't afford it.  One Nevadan traveled all the way from Las Vegas to talk with me about her two sons with cystic fibrosis. She is worried about any legislation that would jeopardize access to care for people with serious, chronic illnesses, such as the ones her sons are struggling with.  In total, over 631,000 people in Nevada are covered by the Medicaid That is low-income children, pregnant women, seniors, and people with disabilities. It is why I have said since the beginning of the healthcare debate, that I will only support a solution that protects Nevada's most vulnerable. The House bill didn't go far enough to do that, and neither did the Senate's bill, and that is why I voted against it last night.  Nevada faces unique challenges when it comes to healthcare. I have spent the past few months trying to find ways to protect Nevadans who depend on Medicaid and provide coverage for those with preexisting conditions, all the while bringing down costs and improving quality and access to care. I have also been having discussions with Nevadans in Washington and back home to hear from them how potential changes could impact their care.  Whether it is a mom in Reno who has a son with a heart condition and is terrified about the future of his treatments or the nurses from Las Vegas who came all the way to DC because they are worried that their patients could lose coverage, I have been listening and I do understand.  Make no mistake, ObamaCare needs fixing. It has led to higher costs and fewer choices in my For the past 7 years, I have said that we need more competition to drive down costs and increase competition for My discussions with Nevadans in Washington and back home have also allowed me the opportunity to hear from them how potential changes could impact their care. I believe we can achieve these goals while recognizing the role that Medicaid plays in our States and ensuring that those who have coverage today are protected.  My role as a Senator is doing the very best I can for my State, and that means standing up for Nevadans who depend on We are having this debate because I do believe there are commonsense solutions that can improve our healthcare system, and I voted to give us the opportunity to have that discussion and to fight for them. But, as I have said all along, healthcare reform cannot be balanced on the backs of Nevada's low-income families and sickest individuals. That is something I cannot and I will not stand for.  We can work to find a way to lower costs, increase choices, and improve the quality of care for Nevadans everywhere, but we can do it in a way that also protects our most vulnerable. That is why for the past few months I have been working with my colleagues in the Senate who also understand the unique challenges expansion States face, and we have been fighting for solutions that will protect those who currently rely on the Medicaid It hasn't been easy, but that is the way it is supposed to be, and that is  I am here to roll up my sleeves, get to work, and fight for policies that will be in the best interests of all So I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment, Heller 288, today to reiterate the value of Medicaid in our We have much work ahead of us to do to improve the healthcare system for Nevadans and Americans across this country.

14482,topic-id,915,"Mr.President, there seems to be some confusion. I will take whatever time you designate is left. I wanted to talk longer.  The things the Senator from South Carolina was talking about are pretty amazing. I look at my State of Did you know our premiums in the State of Oklahoma under ObamaCare have tripled? They have gone up 201 percent.  When you look and you see the options that are out there, what really disturbs me--I understand one big difference between Democrats and Republicans is Democrats are disciplined, Republicans aren't, so they are all voting against any kind of a change. I guess they all love  I can assure you, though, if you look at the charts the Senator from South Carolina was showing, you would wonder why in the world they would all be gathering around when they would dramatically benefit by taking one of the alternatives to  I didn't come down to talk about that, but I have to say, from a State where our premiums have gone up--tripled--you stop and you ask: What is this going to look like when we get the new bill done?  We don't know exactly what it is going to look like. It is going to have the individual mandates done away with. It is going to have the taxes reduced. It is going to have block grants going to the  Look at my State of That will increase the amount of money that will be coming in, with less taxes, by 200 percent. I dare say, there are a lot of Democrats who would find that in the same situation.  One last note about that, as I go back and I work around the State, I find there are a lot of people who are saying: I don't like this alternative.  I would only say, not just in Oklahoma but anywhere in the Nation, if you oppose what is going to be the alternative, what you are saying is, you would rather have                  Commending Attorney General Sessions  Mr.President, actually, I came to the floor for a different reason. It is probably the most awkward situation I have been in before. Since they cut me down to 8\1/2\ minutes, I will have to come back to the floor and embellish a little bit more. I am in an awkward situation. First of all, I believe that we have a President in President Trump who is doing a great job.  I look around and I see what is happening to us. We are now a leader in the free world again. All kinds of things have happened that are very good. Yet I have to say the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, if I could single out three people in the U.Senate whom I respect more, he would be among those.  I am fortunate enough to have known him since the middle eighties, back during the Reagan administration. I knew him very well when he was elected the first time in 1996. Here is a guy who is an outstanding guy, who does things, gets things done. Look at his accomplishments as Attorney In that short period of time, what he has done is, he has been working to crack down on immigration. He has performed some real miracles there, and he has worked on protecting law enforcement. In fact, a law enforcement group came out and singled him out as the most prominent and most popular Attorney General we have had.  Look what he has done in his time, what he has introduced. Child abuse--he did the Child Abuse He did it himself. Nobody else helped him. His quote was: ``There is no higher duty than protecting our Nation's children.'' The Prison Rape Elimination Act, the first Federal law dealing with sexual assault on prisoners. A lot of those are young prisoners. We all know the stories. He is the guy who passed that, and nobody else was in on that deal--just him. Forensic sciences, he has been able to be a champion there.  I would have to say that the major thing he did during the time in his early years was that he was the one who was standing up against segregation. He was the one who single-handedly put himself in a situation where he was taking on the bad guys, and he was desegregating the schools in He was key to the prosecution of the Klansmen for abducting and killing a Black teenager. We all remember that. Who was that? Who did that? That was Jeff So he gets things done. He was the one who was responsible for bankrupting the Klan in his State of Here is a guy who has the sensitivity. I have never known a person I could respect more. That is what bothers me.  I think we have a President who is doing a good job, and the only area where I disagree with him--he has this fight going with Jeff  Let me just say this: There is no one I hold in higher regard. He is about the most knowledgeable person, compassionate person, and honorable person we could have in that job.  When there is more time on the schedule, I will come back and elaborate a little bit more on my hero Jeff Sessions and how he ought to remain in that office and do a great job for the United  With that, I will comply with the request and yield my time.

14467,topic-id,2773,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to speak to three amendments that I have either submitted or plan to submit on the matter before the Senate here today, the repeal and hopefully complete replacement of  There are two issues that concern me the most and that I have fought for and debated.  In this process, how can we bring down gross premium levels that have skyrocketed under ObamaCare? According to HHS, on a national average, premiums have increased 105 percent. They have more than doubled. And of course it is far worse than that in many places.  Janice Fenniman was a 62-year-old woman when I met her a couple of years ago. Prior to ObamaCare, she was paying $276 per month. In 2016, just 2 years into the implementation of ObamaCare, she was paying $786 per month. Last time I talked to her, she would be paying over $900 a month, but the problem is, she can't afford it, so she is just taking a risk and going uninsured until she reaches the age of 65 and is qualified for  The other issue I want to speak about is literally the unsustainable nature of The other thing I fought for is reducing the disparity between States that have expanded Medicaid and those that haven't, like Wisconsin, that have done a great job managing My concern is that Medicaid expansion, which is directed toward able-bodied, working-age, childless adults, is funded by the Federal Government 90 to 100 percent, depending on which year you are looking at, versus traditional Medicaid targeted toward--40 percent of Medicaid spending is targeted toward children, the disabled, and the elderly. Medicaid expansion is putting at risk the sustainability of traditional So my three amendments deal with those issues, and let me first take up the first two amendments dealing with premiums.  I have a few charts. Unfortunately, in Washington, DC, there is not a whole lot of people who understand the problem-solving process. Let me describe it briefly.  It starts with information. It starts with defining the problem, doing a root cause analysis, having the courage to recognize and acknowledge the truth in reality. Based on that reality, you try to set achievable goals. From my standpoint, the achievable goals should be to bring down gross premium levels back to a reasonable level where they were prior to the implementation of this completely faulty architecture of ObamaCare and preserving and sustaining traditional  This chart, I realize, is a little busy, but let me walk you through it. This shows the trend line of ObamaCare, in terms of what we have experienced from 2010 to 2017, plus the estimates of the Congressional Budget Office as it relates to the Senate bill we voted on yesterday.  Let's take a look at this. Back in 2010 to 2013, you see the trend line here. In 2013, on the national average, an individual is paying about $232 per month for healthcare. Now had that trend line just continued, had we not passed this faulty architecture of ObamaCare, we could reasonably expect that in about 10 years, premiums for an individual being about $303 per month.  What has happened--again, according to HHS--those premiums have gone[[Page S4249]]from $232 per month to this year $476 per month on a nationwide average. That is a 105-percent increase.  One of the problems with CBO scoring is it is difficult to interpret. What I tried to do for my colleagues is put in chart form exactly what CBO is saying. In their scoring of the Senate bill, they said next year premiums would be 20 percent above the current baseline. Of course, they don't give you the baseline, and they don't really give you the premiums so I had to try to cobble those together. This is pretty accurate. That would put premiums next year at about $546 versus $232 about 4 years ago. The following year it would be 10 percent above the baseline. So it would start decreasing with the Senate bill, and the third year would be 30 percent below baseline. You would see a dramatic drop. You would be at $441 per month. Then the trend over the next 7 or 8 years would be 20 percent below the baseline, $574.  Take a look at this. Had we never passed ObamaCare, premiums should be in the $300-a-month level versus $574. This is the damage done by ObamaCare, and this, I am very sad to report, is not what we are adequately addressing because we do not have the courage to do the root cause analysis and be honest with the American public about what is happening.  Let me read you a dictation from the family I just heard from yesterday. Sheri and Vern Kolby, whom we heard about from one of our State legislators who contacted one of my regional directors. He sent me an email telling me their story.  I called Sheri last night. She didn't have time. She was just off her shift. Her husband is working way more than 40 hours a week--basically, that is 60 hours a week. The people whom President Clinton was talking about, people busting it, working 60 hours a week, their premiums have doubled and their coverage has been cut in half. So my staff reached out, and we basically dictated her story, her and her husband Vern's story.  This is not her letter to me but her voice based on what was told to me by my staff. This is Sheri Kolby from River Falls,       My husband and I have preexisting conditions. We need      affordable healthcare through ObamaCare or whatever works.      Vern is a milkman now, driving a tank to farms to pick up      milk, and there are only seven employees at his company which      doesn't provide coverage. I am a florist. Now, I am the only      full-time employee so they don't have health coverage at my      work either. We signed up for ObamaCare in 2014 for the      entire 12-month period.       We went on healthcare.gov, but the site crashed, so we had      to call a phone number which was jammed. Finally, I got hold      of someone and got through an hour and a half of      questionnaires. Then you get information in the mail about      what your premium will be and your subsidy, and you make your      monthly payment.       We were getting monthly letters telling us we had to fax in      our pay stubs to make sure we were still qualifying for the      subsidized premiums. We did that every month, but then next      March, when we filed our taxes, that is when my tax preparer      said, ``You better sit down. Not only did you pay your      premium, but they want your subsidy back.'' That was about      $15,000.       We were earning too much to qualify for the subsidies, even      though we held blue-collar jobs. If we stayed on ObamaCare,      we would have to pay the entire premium unsubsidized. In      2015, we made $59,000 and ended paying almost $30,000 for      premiums and deductibles. That was 51 percent of our income.       In covering our deductibles and our out-of-pocket costs, we      used up almost all of our 401(k)s. It just multiplied and      multiplied. When a huge amount of money was due the IRS, we      decided we had to sell our house.  Sheri and Vern Kolby had to sell their house so it wouldn't be taken away in foreclosure because of Obama's skyrocketing premiums.       Now we can only get a 3-month plan. That is all that is      available. Private catastrophic plans are few and far      between.  And I will add, parenthetically, also way overpriced because of the faulty architecture of       There aren't a lot of companies that offer plans in Pierce      We are kind of in a funnel and that funnel keeps      narrowing. In May, I went back to healthcare.gov, but      coverage would have cost $1,200 per month, about $14,400 per      year in premiums for a policy with a $14,000 deductible. If      you made $200,000, you could pay that, but we are not even      close to that. We usually fluctuate between $50,000 and      $60,000. We are blue collar. We pay our bills on time, we      respect people, and we want to live a good life, and we      have just been dumped on. It has got to stop.       It may come to a point where we might not have insurance,      but we will just end up owing the hospital if something else      happens. My husband works 60 to 70 hours a week, and I work      30. We drive a `98 We are not running around in a      We don't spend money beyond our means. We don't take      trips to Tahiti, and we are not trying to swindle the system,      but it has been a very stressful experience.       We have been married 28 years, and we have stayed together      through so much, but we are not old enough to even think      about retirement for a long time so I don't know what we will      do.  These are the forgotten men and women of this healthcare debate--the people who are busting it, who don't get subsidized, who can't afford insurance coverage because of the faulty architecture of ObamaCare, and we are not courageous or honest enough to really address it.  We did get from HHS a study that they commissioned and they had the results in  I would like to put up my next chart here.  Basically, what they did is they studied the cause, and I have the study right here. Basically this is the question they are asking: What portion of the increase in premiums is attributable to the effects of guaranteed issue and community rating?  Now I realize those are very popular elements of The problem is, they cause premiums to skyrocket. That last graph--way above what they would have been without that architecture--pricing people out of the market, forcing American taxpayers to pay far more in subsidies than we otherwise would have to do or would be necessary had we never passed  Well, here is the result of their study. They studied four States: Georgia, Ohio, Tennessee, and I can't remember the last one, but I am going to focus on  What this graph shows--I realize it is kind of hard to see--but in Tennessee, between 2013 and 2017, premiums increased $327 per month, from $104 per month to $431 a month for a 41-year-old male. That is a threefold increase, 314 percent. What caused it, 73 to 76 percent was increased risk. Again, increased risk is basically defined as the guaranteed issue covering preexisting conditions and community rating--things that are popular but again that cause premiums to double and in Janice Fenniman's case, more than tripled.  One thing I want to point out about that, when you hear that talking point, premiums that double and triple, look at the inverse of that. If we could roll back the clock, go back 4 years, premiums would be one-half to one-third of what they are today. People would be able to afford coverage, and the American taxpayer would be supporting those whom we want to support with a whole lot less dollars.  Now, the good news, if we were honest, if we were courageous, and if we actually addressed the root cause analysis, which has been done, which we have largely ignored, the good news is, you can actually cover people with high costs and preexisting conditions without collapsing insurance markets. They are called high-risk pools or, in the case of Maine, invisible high-risk pools. The people in it don't even realize they are in it, but it has worked phenomenally well.  Maine passed guaranteed issues, and just like they did under ObamaCare, guaranteed issues caused premiums to skyrocket. You can see the premium rate from their old Anthem HealthChoice plan back in 2011. Once they supplanted--they didn't even repeal the guaranteed issue, but they just supplanted this with an invisible high-risk pool--their premiums were cut in half. This is doable. It is possible, but it is only possible if we take a look at best practice, if we are willing to have the courage to admit exactly what is causing the problem.  I have two amendments designed to address the increase in premiums. First--and I realize this will probably not even be voted on--would be a simple one-sentence amendment that would repeal all of ObamaCare, not partial repeal, not just two-thirds repeal but repeal that would concentrate on removing all of those market reforms. I would call them market distortions that cause premiums to skyrocket, that cause people like Sheri and Vern Kolby to lose their house. That is my first amendment.[[Page S4250]]  The second amendment really relates to exactly what ObamaCare was originally designed to do, which was put Members of Congress in the exact same position of people like Sheri and Vern  Back in July of 2009, November 18, as this was being debated in the HELP and the Finance Committee, Senators Coburn and Grassley introduced language to those bills that would make Members of Congress have to purchase their health insurance plans on any kind of program or the State-based exchanges, whatever was passed under the Democrats' healthcare plan.  On December 24, 2009, the Senate passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, an Orwellian-named bill that did neither, that had Senator Coburn's basic language from the HELP Committee that was going to require Members of Congress to purchase their coverage through the exchanges. What was interesting is, it did not include an employer contribution. Those were barred.  On March 24, after the House had passed their version of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Healthcare Education Reconciliation Act, Senator Grassley again offered an amendment to allow an employer contribution to Members of Congress and their staffs' healthcare plans. That amendment was defeated with 56 Democratic Senators defeating it. Three Democratic Senators voted for it, and every Republican Senator voted for it, allowing the Federal contribution. So Congress specifically said in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Members of Congress and their staffs must purchase their healthcare through the State exchanges, and they cannot obtain an employer contribution for those plans.  Let's fast forward to October 2, 2013. Members of Congress and their staff panicked. They went running to the Obama White House and said: You have to fix this. We know what we passed. We know what the law says, but we have to weasel our way around this--and they did. So the Office of Personnel Management issued a rule, first of all, that Congress was a small business that could purchase their insurance on a shop exchange which required a small business, which is defined in the law as less than 100 employees--I just want you to know that Congress has about 11,000 employees. There is no way this Congress is a small employer, but that was the technique that they were able to work their way around this law. So right now Members of Congress and staffs are the only Americans who get the special treatment of being able to purchase insurance on ObamaCare exchanges and get an employer contribution.  Millions of Americans did lose their insurance because of They had to purchase the overpriced insurance policies out of the exchanges, but they have no access to employer contributions. So my second amendment would put only Members of Congress--I don't think we should penalize our staff--but I want to put Members of Congress in the exact same position as Sheri and Vern and thousands and maybe tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of Americans who are making too much, busting it, working 60 hours a week. Their premiums have doubled, sometimes tripled. Coverage is cut in half, and they can't afford it. They are taking a risk. Congress is still advantaged because we are making more than $59,000. We are making $174,000.  The reason I am offering this amendment--I know it will not be popular--is that the only way Congress will have the courage to act is if they are affected every bit as much as the American public. I urge all of my colleagues to be honest, to be courageous, and to make sure they do not exempt themselves from the pain, from the harm, from the damage of ObamaCare, so that they will commit themselves to actually fixing this problem.  Those are my first two amendments that have to do with premiums. I urge my colleagues to support them. I think that they are good amendments and are worthy of support.  Mr.President, how much time do I have remaining?  The PRESIDING There are 30 minutes remaining.  ",CREC-2017-07-26-pt1-PgS4227-9.txt,,NATIONAL POLICE WEEK,2017.0,26.0,July
14468,topic-id,656,"Mr.President, let me move on to my second point.  Again, I come from a State whose Governor showed real courage in recognizing that traditional Medicaid was unsustainable and was in trouble. The last thing we really should be doing to an unsustainable entitlement program is to throw more promises on top of that and make it even more unsustainable. I think it is extremely important that we recognize that Medicaid expansion is directed toward able-bodied, childless, working-age adults. That is, again, funded at a much higher level by the Federal Government, at 90 to 100 percent, versus traditional Medicaid, which is really targeted to those we want to help--children. Forty percent of traditional Medicaid goes toward children, the disabled, and the elderly.  My next amendment is designed to try and make traditional Medicaid more sustainable, not by pulling the rug out from anyone but simply by limiting further enrollment and allowing Medicaid expansion to phase out based on attrition. Let me show you a couple of facts, because we hear an awful lot of demagoguery. We hear an awful lot of scaremongering. I hear it in Wisconsin, as people who are on traditional Medicaid and who are largely unaffected by this bill other than in the out years are scared that their traditional Medicaid is going to be taken away from them.  Here are the facts. Back in 2008, the Federal Government spent about $200 billion on traditional With the implementation of ObamaCare, we began increasing that pretty dramatically with Medicaid expansion. Over the next decade or so, we will spend close to $90 billion per year, on average, on Medicaid expansion--again, targeted toward able-bodied, working-age, childless adults. This was the former trend line, and this is the current trend line for traditional  Now, you hear about all of this slashing of Here is the current baseline. This is what the Senate bill would have done to traditional Medicaid and to Medicaid expansion. Yes, you can see some relatively significant cuts to Medicaid expansion, but to traditional Medicaid, you see, really, not all that much--about $164 billion over 10 years.  My amendment would say, without pulling the rug out from anyone: Let's end further enrollment in Medicaid expansion, and as that program phases out through attrition, let's devote the money that we save to traditional Medicaid--supporting and sustaining the elderly, children, and the disabled.  This is what happens to traditional Medicaid under my amendment. First of all, this is what happens under the Senate bill. You do not see any year in which Medicaid is actually cut. It is always rising. We boost it a little bit further and do not increase the deficit by any more, under the Senate bill, by doing that.  My last point is this, and then I will move on and yield the floor. This is what I am talking about in terms of dollars. Under current law, traditional Medicaid will spend $4 trillion over the next decade and Medicaid expansion almost $1 trillion, for a total of $5 trillion spending. Under the Senate bill that was originally proposed, original Medicaid would have been cut by about $164 billion, which is still close to $4 trillion, and Medicaid expansion, obviously, would have been reduced by a fair amount.  Under what I call my sustainability amendment, traditional Medicaid would actually increase in spending slightly and not harm anybody--not children, not the disabled, not the elderly. Obviously, with Medicaid expansion, just by allowing it to phase out through attrition--not pulling the rug out from anyone--in the end, you would be spending the same amount on the Senate bill. From my standpoint, I think that we preserve and sustain  Again, I urge my colleagues to support all three of my amendments. I hope to get a vote. If not a vote, I hope that they are considered if this thing goes to a House-Senate conference.  I yield the floor.

An explosive device destroyed the Mercedes being driven by      Col Maksim Shapoval at 8.15am local time, police said.       The car's bonnet was blown open and its roof and driver      side door almost completely destroyed, video footage from the      scene showed.       ``The picture of the crime looks like it was a planned act      of terrorism,'' interior ministry spokesman Artem Shevchenko      told local media. The military prosecutor said his office      would lead an investigation.       Police said a female passerby with shrapnel wounds to her      legs received medical treatment after the explosion, as did      an elderly man who suffered shrapnel wounds to his neck.       According to the defence ministry, Shapoval was a colonel      in military intelligence. The Ukrainian Pravda newspaper      quoted law enforcement sources saying he had headed a special      forces unit.

14373,topic-id,377,"Mr.President, as we end Police Week, I wish to pay tribute to the police officers across the country who serve their communities with steadfast dedication. In particular, I rise to honor three brave New Jersey law enforcement officers who lost their lives in the line of duty last year.  In 1962, President Kennedy first proclaimed May 15 as National Peace Officers Memorial Day, and he proclaimed the calendar week in which May 15 falls as National Police These designations pay special recognition to those law enforcement officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty and includes a number of events that brings together thousands of law enforcement professionals and families to our nations' capital.  On this Police Week, I reflected on the nearly 400 new names inscribed on the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington, Of these names, at least 139 were killed last year, and roughly 250 were earlier deaths that had slipped through the cracks of history. The total number of names on the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial will increase to more than 21,000, dating back to the first known officer fatality in 1791.  It is a deeply upsetting fact that, on average, one law enforcement officer is killed in the line of duty somewhere in the United States every 58 hours. We can and should do better than this, and we owe it to these brave men and women to give them the necessary tools and training to protect themselves. Those who protect us deserve to be protected as well.  In honor of National Police Week and in recognition of the supreme sacrifice made by these officers, I will now read the names of the three law enforcement officers from New Jersey who were killed in the line of duty in 2016: Sean Cullen, trooper, New Jersey State police; Nikeelan Semmon, senior corrections officer, New Jersey Department of Corrections; and Frankie Williams, trooper, New Jersey State police.  Today my thoughts and prayers go out to the families of these brave officers. I sincerely hope that we rededicate ourselves to doing everything we can to support all law enforcement officers across the country. We owe them,[[Page S3062]]along with all those who serve our country, the deepest debt of gratitude.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-22-pt1-PgS3061-3.txt,791,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,22.0,May

Alum was born and raised in Havana, He began his career as a professor and dean at a local technical college, educating his students on literature and grammar.

At his company, Alum established important quality control measures and developed influential drugs.  The light of Alum's life was his family.

This week is meaningful to me and my family, for my oldest son is a police officer in Michigan, and I could not be more proud of him and his service.  Too often, we take for granted those who every day put on a badge and a vest to protect us and our communities. Events across this country have been politicized and stretch the relationship between law enforcement and their community. Let us not have politics overwhelm the dedication and commitment of our men and women in blue. Our lives, and indeed our freedoms, are safeguarded by the thin blue line. We owe the men and women in uniform, those who put themselves at risk every day, a simple thank you and simply our respect.

14400,topic-id,1509,"Mr.President, no one should normalize what is happening on this Senate floor right now. We are all waiting for the white smoke to come out of Republican leadership offices so that the millions and millions of very scared people in my State will be able to see what is about to happen to their lives.  This isn't a game. People's lives are at stake. People's health is at stake. Yet, because this debate is now devoid of policy and substance and seemingly just about delivering a political victory to Republicans, we wait and we wait and we wait.  People are scared. All over the Capitol today there are parents of children with disabilities, many of whom rely on Medicaid in order to keep their children alive. I have spent a lot of time with them over the course of the last 6 months because, to them, the measure of a civilization is how it treats the most vulnerable, and their kids, with these deep disabilities, are among the most vulnerable. For much of the last 6 months I have seen anger in their eyes--anger that Congress would choose to hurt their kids or to force their family to go bankrupt.  Yesterday, I saw something new in their eyes. I saw fear. I saw deep, debilitating fear because they sense that we are on the precipice of doing something that they didn't think was possible--a piece of legislation passing the Senate and the House that would deliberately and intentionally hurt their children.  There is no way around it. It is not hyperbole. The House bill that we are debating right now guts Medicaid to the point where 15 million people--the most vulnerable Americans--would lose access to healthcare.  I know it is very hard for people in this Chamber to understand because we all have really good healthcare. But when you have an expensive disease or your child has an expensive disease and you lose insurance, you can't pay for it. You can sell your house, you can sell your car, and you can exhaust your savings. For some families, that will cover 6 months' worth of expenses for their sick child. At some point, the patient dies if they don't have access to healthcare.  So people are scared. They are really scared. They are scared not just at the consequences of the House bill eventually passing, but they are also scared at the casualness with which this debate seems to treat their plight.  There are rumors now that, at the end of this process, we are going to vote on what has been described as a stripped-down, gutted version of the original Republican healthcare bill. It might have one or two provisions in it--maybe the elimination of the individual mandate, maybe the elimination of a few taxes. The intent would be to essentially punt the more comprehensive debate about what our healthcare system is going to look like to a conference committee.  I want to talk about that for a few moments and what the consequences of that are. First, I want to talk about what the consequences are, if that end result is achieved, for the Why do my colleagues choose to run for the Senate if they are prepared to surrender the biggest policy decision they will likely face to the House of Representatives? Why go through all the trouble of running, of raising all the money, of getting all the votes to become a Senator if you aren't prepared to actually render an opinion and pass a bill on the biggest priority issue facing this country right now--the future of the American healthcare system?  Republicans have been unable to come up with a bill that can get 50 votes. Why? Because they refuse to engage with Now the solution[[Page S4234]]is to punt by passing a stripped-down version of the bill, handing all power to the House of Representatives, surrendering to the House of What is the point of being a U.Senator if you aren't actually going to make policy, if you are just going to hand over the keys of policymaking to the House of Representatives? This is the U. I disagreed with Senator McCain's vote yesterday, but I heard the speech he gave to us that this should be the place in which we make the big, tough decisions about the future of the American economy. The Senate will put an ``out of business'' sign on the outside of this Chamber if we pass a scaled-down version of this bill that admits we can't come to a conclusion.  What is the point of being a Senator if you just hand this debate over to the House of Representatives? By the way, that is what will happen. If the Senate goes to conference with the House of Representatives and there is only one bill in that conference--and that is what will happen if a stripped-down version of this bill goes into conference and the House has a comprehensive reform bill--the House bill will be the only one in the conference committee, and the House bill will become law. The House bill will survive. It may have some small cosmetic amendments to it, but all of the power will be given to the House of Representatives in those negotiations because there is only one idea that will be present.  Let's go back for a moment and remember what was in that House bill that so many of my Republican colleagues told me was deeply objectionable to them and would never get a vote on the Senate floor. Twenty-three million people will lose insurance. Rates will go up by 15 to 20 percent. People with preexisting conditions in most States likely will lose all protections available to them. Insurance plans will not have to cover maternity care, mental illness, or addiction any longer. Medicaid will be gone as we know it. My small State, with an $8 billion Medicaid Program, will have a $3 billion cut. Children will lose their ability to stay alive because they lose their healthcare insurance. Seniors in nursing homes will be put out on the street. That is not hyperbole. That is real. That is what happens when you kick 23 million people off of insurance.  That bill or some version of it would emerge from the conference committee because the Senate would have defaulted to it by going to conference with nothing. But that is just the long-term consequence. The short-term consequence is that this scaled-down bill reportedly will include an elimination of the individual mandate. Insurance markets will fall apart.  Everybody here knows, whether you are a Republican or a Democrat, that the only way you guarantee that people get priced the same if they are sick or not sick is to require people to buy insurance when they are not sick. In fact, the Republicans know that because in their bill that they wrote behind closed doors, they included an individual mandate. They did. It was designed in a different way. They said that if you don't buy insurance, you will be penalized by being locked out of the insurance market for 6 months. But they had a penalty for people who don't buy insurance, just like the Affordable Care Act has a penalty. Republicans and Democrats understand that in order for the insurance markets to work as they are regulated today, you need to encourage people to buy insurance when they are healthy and penalize them if they don't. The Republican bill does that, just like the Affordable Care Act does that.  If you pass a bill that removes that mandate, then every insurance adjuster, every actuary who works for a major healthcare insurance company, will tell you that the markets will crater because individuals won't buy insurance until they get sick, knowing that they can't be charged any more. Healthy people will not buy insurance. Rates will go up. Insurers will flee the markets. The entire thing collapses.  That is the short-term consequence of telegraphing to the insurance companies that you are getting rid of the individual mandate. Even if that is not the final result, that telegraph signal, at a point where insurers are already rethinking the markets because of the sabotage campaign that President Trump has undertaken, would be catastrophic.  This is not a game. These stakes are big. The casualness with which people are approaching this debate is scaring the life out of people in my State, out of parents of kids with disabilities and folks who are dealing with sickness and illness all across this country.  It is not too late. We don't have a communicable disease. We aren't going to physically harm Republicans if they come talk to us. It is time to abandon this Republican-only approach and come work with Let's jointly own the problems that still exist in the healthcare system and jointly own the solution. People are scared of what is happening in the Senate today, and there is a different way.  I yield the floor.

We are here because of backroom deals that have brought us to this floor at a time when no one can accept the fact that all of the proposals are as a result, so far, of how many millions of people will lose insurance--22 million, 15 million, 24 million. That is what we are debating here, and that is a terrible debate. That is not what we should be talking about, but those are the proposals we are being offered.  Again, the Democrats are here. We are not giving up, and we are going to fight any effort to pass TrumpCare until the last possible moment because that will be the result. We are going to speak out for families nationwide--children, parents, patients, people with disabilities, seniors, and people who have called and tweeted and marched and filled our office halls. So many people are worried and, frankly, scared right now. These are families who are being kept in the dark by our Republican colleagues and who are being left to wonder what might happen to their healthcare, their financial security, and even their lives.  It is appalling the majority of Republicans who are willing to go along with this plan and move to begin debate without even knowing what bill they will be debating. Yet, last night, the vast majority of the Senate did something unusual. It showed just how much agreement there actually can be among us, when 57 Republicans and Democrats agreed to reject a full TrumpCare replacement bill and sent a message that we agreed with Senator McCain in that we should stop letting the ``bombastic loudmouths'' drive our work and instead return to regular order and get back to work on policies that actually help the people we are here to represent.  There are responsible Republicans who disagree with the way the Republican leaders have hidden their legislation from Democrats and the public throughout this process, who think there should be an open, transparent process, with both sides at the table, and who want hearings and public debate rather than backroom deals and secret negotiations. I do as well, and I know many of my Democratic colleagues agree.  Now that it is clear that there is absolutely no path to full TrumpCare in the Senate, what is the reason for continuing this damaging, rushed, deeply partisan effort on the floor to jam just any bill through the Senate? Together we can do a lot better than the lowest common denominator bill that simply sends TrumpCare to conference with the House and then gives the Freedom Caucus a blank check to gut Medicaid and put insurance companies back in charge of people's healthcare, and more. Let's be clear. The only reason to pass a cobbled-together, last-minute bill on the floor is to keep the extreme conservative dream of repealing ObamaCare alive, no matter what that means for patients and families.  I truly believe there is a better way to get this done right, and it is to stop what Senate Republican leaders are doing right now and start over.  So, once again, I ask my Republican colleagues to drop this partisan effort and join us at the table. Let's work together to improve families' healthcare, as so many of us truly want to do. My door is open, and I am ready to get started.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.

14405,topic-id,3909,"Mr.President, as a physician and an eye surgeon, I have seen ObamaCare up close, and it is not working for  If you look across the country and say ``Is it working?'' you find that ObamaCare premiums have doubled for those in the individual marketplace in just a few short years. You find that the ObamaCare insurance mandates have caused 4.7 million people to lose the insurance they chose. If you like your doctor, you can keep him or her--that was the promise, and it was a lie. Some 4.7 million people were told that they couldn't choose the insurance they want and couldn't choose their doctor.  It is estimated that there are 800,000 fewer jobs because of How does that happen? Well, if you work 32 hours a week and your employer has to provide insurance at 30 hours, guess what happens. Some people get moved to 28 hours. You add up all those hours, and millions of people are working fewer hours.  Who are the people who got shafted by ObamaCare? Often, working-class people. In my State, there are 25,000 people who pay a fine because they can't afford These 25,000 people make less than $25,000 a year. They are our working class.  ObamaCare punishes them and says: You have to pay a fine.  They say: I wish I had insurance, but ObamaCare added all these mandates, things that I can't afford.  Sure, everybody wants to have everything under the Sun covered by their insurance, but when you mandate that, you elevate the price of insurance. So what has happened? Young, healthy people have lost their insurance and don't buy insurance in droves.  ObamaCare says: You can come back any time after you are sick and buy your insurance.[[Page S4235]]  That sounds good, but what it leads to is the death spiral of ObamaCare premiums have doubled because the young, healthy people are saying it costs too much and the sicker people are the only ones left in insurance.  This is what happens when you let the government get involved in the marketplace. If you allow the marketplace to work--what is the one universal feature of capitalism? You get the lowest amount of cost and the most amount of goods distributed to the most amount of people.  Right now under ObamaCare, 50 percent of America has one choice. What does that mean? A monopoly. Who wants the insurance company to have a monopoly? When the insurance companies have monopolies, the prices get doubled.  There are now some parts of our country that have no choice in the individual market. If you are a plumber or a welder or a carpenter, you have to buy insurance in the individual market. In many places in America, you have no choice. In half of America, if you buy insurance by yourself, if you are not part of a large group, in half of America, there is one choice--a monopoly and monopoly prices.  In my State alone, 50,000 Kentuckians have to pay a tax. They have to pay a fine because they can't afford They are regular working people, and they do work and they do pay taxes. They pay a fine. We pay $16 million in fines in just my Across America, this is happening.  How did it become an American sort of legislation or plan to force people to buy stuff they don't want and then to extract money out of their paycheck if they don't do what you tell them?  Ultimately, Americans should remember that ObamaCare is predicated on force and coercion. ObamaCare dictates what kind of insurance you can get and makes you pay a fine if you don't get what the politicians tell you you must get.  President Obama basically told you that you were too stupid to make your own choices. These people who want to dictate to you are elitists. They think they know better than you what kind of insurance you should get. If you don't buy the insurance they dictate, they will fine you. If you don't pay the fine, they will jail you. How is that consistent with the American ideal of freedom?  This debate is about more than actuarial tables. We get dragged down into this debate, and we think it is all this healthcare wonkiness, this and that. It is about freedom of choice. It is about whether you as an American can make the choice whether you want insurance or don't want insurance, whether you want insurance that is really expensive or not.  They put a special tax in there if you have good insurance. First they tell you what kind of insurance to buy, and then they tell you that your insurance is too good. If you are in a union or you are an executive and you have great insurance, ObamaCare tells you they are going to tax you because your insurance is too good. These busybodies think they know everything about what you want. They are going to dictate what kind of insurance you can get, and then when you buy it, they are going to tell you that you have too much, so you have to pay a tax. That isn't the American way.  Today we will vote on a bill we have voted on many times. The Senate itself voted on this 2 years ago. It is the identical bill. We are going to vote on a bill we voted on 2 years ago. I hope everybody who voted for it before will vote for it again. It is what we call a clean repeal. It is not cluttered with insurance company bailouts. It is not cluttered with this and that, new Federal regulations. It is just trying to peel back  While it is a clean repeal, it is only a partial repeal. Why? It is only a partial repeal because we have these arcane Senate rules that say we can't repeal the whole thing. Because we are only repealing part of it, ObamaCare will remain. Even if we are successful with this bill, at least half or more of ObamaCare remains. Bad things remain. All of the mandates on what you have to purchase on your insurance will remain. That doesn't mean we shouldn't do this.  The other side does not want to help. The other side has never met a regulation they want to repeal and has never met a tax they want to lower. So if you want to get rid of the taxes, it has to be done today.  People say: Well, this doesn't have the replacement.  Well, sure we should replace I have been advocating that from the beginning. But we have to figure out what that replacement is. And the only way we are going to be forced into a bipartisan compromise is if we repeal it. If we do not repeal it today, there is no impetus from either side to work on replacing it. If you repeal it, even the other side will say: Oh, my goodness, we have to do something because they repealed these subsidies in this Medicaid expansion. They will say: We will work with you now. But everything else is false.  They will not work on repealing one regulation or one tax. That heavy lift is left to Republicans, and my hope is that Republicans would band together and say: Sure, this isn't everything I wanted. It is not everything I want. It is a partial repeal. It leaves in place a lot of ObamaCare that we should get rid of, and we should continue to try to get rid of these Federal mandates on insurance.  This is a beginning, and it is all we are being offered up as a beginning, but it is a victory for those of us in America who have said: Enough is enough. My government shouldn't be telling me what I can buy and what I cannot buy. My government should not tell me which doctor I can choose and which doctor I have to leave behind. The government should not be involved in my healthcare business. I want to be left alone. The right to privacy, the right to be left alone is a fundamental right of That is what this is about.  It is about freedom of choice. It is not about actuarial tables. It is not about the Federal Government designing a perfect healthcare system. The Federal Government cannot deliver the mail. They lose a billion dollars a quarter delivering your mail. Do you want them in charge of your doctor? Do you want them in charge of your insurance? This is the one chance we get today. We will have a chance to repeal We will have a chance to fulfill our promise to the American voters.  There is a partisan divide. Democrats are for keeping it; Republicans are for repealing it. But Republicans made a promise. We made a promise to the American people to repeal it. There may be some Republicans today who say: I am not voting to repeal any longer; things have changed. The problem is that we are not going to get toward a solution if we don't begin to repeal. The other thing about this repeal is that there is a 2-year window in which part of the repeal doesn't take place for 2 years. Over those 2 years, my guess is that we will have impetus from the other side to actually begin to negotiate. Currently, there are 27 million people in America without insurance. From all the talk, you would think that ObamaCare has covered everyone, and somehow Republicans are against that.  Count me as one Republican who wants to figure out how we insure the 27 million who don't have insurance. Of the 27 million people who don't have insurance under ObamaCare, half of them don't buy insurance because it is too expensive. Why is it too expensive? Because ObamaCare dictates about 15 different things that every insurance policy has to have: Vision, hearing, pregnancy--you name it; it is all on there. Everyone wants it. If you put it on every insurance policy, not everyone is going to be able to afford it. You force people out of the market. So 27 million people don't have insurance, and half say they can't get it because it is too expensive.  Where is the problem in insurance? If you are here today visiting in Washington, and you work for Toyota or Ford or General Motors or any big American company--any big corporation in our country--if you work for them, my guess is that you are not worried about your wife getting sick and they fire you from your job or raise your rates. What happens when you have group insurance is, if your family member gets sick, you don't lose your job. Your insurance rates really don't change, and you continue on with your life. You still have the tragedy to deal with of someone in[[Page S4236]]your family being sick. But if you have group insurance, it seems to work in our country.  What we are talking about is the individual insurance market. We are talking about the plumber, the pest control guy, the carpenter, the welder, the farmer--people who are in a small business. Either they have a few employees or it is just them. That is what we are talking about. It is horribly broken. I don't wish it on any I wish no American had to buy any insurance in the individual market. In fact, what I am proposing would so disrupt the individual market that maybe everyone would leave. I am trying to give an exit ramp to everyone in the individual market to get out of the individual market because the individual market is a terrible place to be.  If you are a farmer in America and you buy insurance for you and your wife, and your wife gets breast cancer, you are not only deathly afraid for her health, you are deathly afraid your insurance rates will be doubled, tripled, or you will be dropped. I don't care if you are a Republican, Independent, or a People in the individual market do worry. We have had people here worried that people are going to lose their health insurance. The individual market is a terrible place to be.  So what should we do? Should we give hundreds of billions of dollars to the insurance company and say: Please insure these people and make sure their rates aren't too high. I don't like that because I am not for crony capitalism. These companies make billions of dollars a year in profit. I am not for giving them one penny of your money.  Do you know what I want? I want something that doesn't cost anything, that doesn't cost one penny and would completely transform healthcare and insurance in this country. I want to legalize--I want to make it open to every American that you can go out with an association across State lines and buy your insurance as part of a group. What would that mean? In my State, the Farm Bureau has 33,000 people. But when you go to the Farm Bureau to buy your insurance, you get an individual policy. A farmer, his wife, and their family get a policy. It is just them. They are not really protected by the group. They don't get the leverage of price, and they are not protected. If they get sick, their rates are based on them and their family. Why don't we let them join together? There are probably a million farmers in the Farm Bureau throughout the American Farm What if the American Farm Bureau had an association and one person negotiated for them? I don't think we can overstate the negotiating value of a group.  In China recently, they negotiated for patented medicines, and they reduced the price by 67 percent. Groups can negotiate prices down. This is a free market reform. This is collective bargaining for consumers. I can't see why either side--I am still hopeful, no matter where this goes, that at some point in time, when partisan fervor dies down, we can go to the other side and say: What's so wrong with collective bargaining? I thought you were for collective bargaining for labor. Why not be for collective bargaining for consumers? Let the consumers band together. AARP has 33 million people. What if one person negotiated the rate for their insurance and their drugs? My guess is that they would have the lowest drug prices in the world, and more people would want to join What if the credit unions--there are about 20 million people in credit unions, maybe more, across the United What if you could join your credit union and became part of a national association to buy your insurance? The leverage of 20 million people would be maybe 40, 50 times bigger than America's biggest corporation.  Right now, if you are General Motors and you are a big corporation, you have leverage to bring prices down. What if you were in a corporation 20 times bigger than General Motors--an association that negotiated your prices? This is freedom, though; this isn't a government plan. This is the Federal Government saying that you are allowed to do what you want. You are allowed to collectively bargain as consumers.  I think there is every chance that we could fix a lot of the market. Would there be anybody left behind? I mean, we have terrible tragedies. I spent my adult career in medicine. I have seen the terrible tragedies, the terrible disabilities, the terrible neurologic disorders people are born with and have to live their lives with. Those exceptions will be treated and are treated.  Frankly, one of the misunderstandings of this debate is that any Republican is up here talking about trying to take away stuff from those who are disabled, can't work, and do have to have care. That is traditional They will continue to be cared for. Under this, we are talking only about able-bodied people. Should able-bodied people--people who walk around, hop out of their truck--should they be working? Should they be providing for their health insurance? Can there be a transition zone? We have transition programs between unemployment back to employment. We shouldn't have people permanently unemployed--people permanently on benefits who don't work or won't work. There should be work requirements. I am not afraid to say that every able-bodied person on Medicaid ought to work. There should be a work requirement. I meet many people on both sides of the aisle who are for that.  I don't say they should work as punishment. I think everyone in America should work as a reward. I think work is a reward. I don't care whether you are from the lowest job on the totem pole to the top, to the chief executive. Work is where you get self-esteem. No one can give you self-esteem. Your self-esteem comes from work. I think we are wrong. In fact, I think what we have done--in some cases, we now have multigenerational dependency on government, and they are so distraught and so lacking in self-esteem that it also compounds the drug problem that we have.  Some say that we need more Medicaid money to fight the drug problem. I worry that more Medicaid trips to the doctor may actually be part of the drug problem--that much of the dependency is coming from OxyContin, which the drug company says was not addictive, but everyone got put on OxyContin because it supposedly wasn't addictive. A lot of our heroin and OxyContin problem came out of going to the doctor.  If we were to get everyone out of the individual market into group insurance, there would be some people left behind. My hope is it would be a small number of people, and we would know after a year or two. Let's see what it is. We already have a safety net. The other side is acting as if there is no safety net. We have had a safety net for decade after decade. The safety net is If your child has a disability, no one is trying to take that away from him.  The thing is, we have to try to fix what we have. We need to understand that what we are looking at--what we are trying to fix isn't just some kind of policy that nobody can understand. Healthcare policy is very technical and detailed. This is about freedom.  Do you think that every American should get to choose whether they have insurance and what kind of insurance they have? This is what it is about. It is freedom of choice. It isn't about whether we want people to be insured. When you hear these hyperbolic statements saying that all these people are going to die--Republicans want people to die--those hyperbolic statements aren't really helpful to the debate.  I do not question the motives of any of the Democrats as far as wanting to provide care. I never questioned President Obama's desire to help people get insurance. To me, it is more of a question of what will work. What distributes goods better: socialism or capitalism? Look at the Soviet We defeated the Soviet Union because capitalism defeated socialism. Socialism doesn't work.  When the government fixes the prices, it doesn't work. Are we going to have some government involvement? But because Government is so pitiful at anything they do, we should minimize government's involvement in any industry. If we say that government has to be involved to take care of the poor, let's do it at the State level, not the Federal level.  People ask me: Are the people in government inherently stupid? I say no, but it is a debatable question. The reason is this: Government doesn't get the proper incentives, and they are too distant from the people, and we have a printing press.[[Page S4237]]  What is the fundamental deceit of ObamaCare? This is the fundamental problem of all government, but the fundamental deceit of ObamaCare is this: They said that everyone is going to get free healthcare. Everyone is going to have Medicaid, and you don't have to pay for it, and the States don't have to pay for it. We are going to have the Federal Government pay for it. But the problem is the Federal Government can't pay for most of the things we already have. We already had Medicaid we can't pay for--Medicare we were short of money for. We already have Social Security that we are short of money for. What do we do? We borrow the money. Our deficit this year will be $500 billion. Our deficit is projected next year to be $1 trillion. That is the real question. It isn't, do you want to help people? It is, how are you going to pay for it? If this were done at the State level, what would happen? If the State of Kentucky wants to keep the expansion--we have expanded Medicare to 450,000 people. The question should be, should we double the State income tax in Kentucky? If that went to the State legislature, they have to balance competing concerns. If we double the State tax to pay for it--we live right next to Tennessee, which has no State income tax--would we possibly lose existing businesses or existing jobs or would we encourage new businesses not to come to Kentucky? That would be a valid debate. We want to help people, but what are the ramifications of it?  In Washington, it is said that there are no ramifications because everything goes to the debt. Everything just piles up. We have $20 trillion in debt. Whose fault is it? Both parties. Under George Bush, the debt went from $5 trillion to $10 trillion. Under President Obama, it went from $10 trillion to $20 trillion. Both parties are at fault, but the entitlements are consuming us.  How would we possibly move forward with a bill that sets up a new insurance entitlement, as some of the Republican plans wanted to do? We can't pay for the current entitlements. As we look forward today to the solution, what I would say is that there are alternatives. We really shouldn't question the motives of those across the aisle, and they shouldn't question ours.  I want more people to have insurance at a lower cost. We should have a disagreement on how it works. I think capitalism works better than socialism. I think we should minimize government's involvement because government is not very good at distributing anything. Just look at the mail.  I also think there are exciting opportunities for saying how we could insure the 27 million who are not insured currently. Twenty-seven million people under ObamaCare are without insurance. The question shouldn't be about debating over the past. It should be over debating the future. The future should be about trying to figure out how we insure those 27 million. I think there are a lot of opportunities that involve more freedom of choice, more freedom to choose your doctor, more freedom to choose what insurance works for you. My goodness, that is what this debate is about. It is not about healthcare policy. It is about freedom of choice, and I hope every Senator today will vote for freedom of choice.  Thank you.

14503,topic-id,1419,"Madam President, let me join the Democratic leader in expressing my dismay in what has been going on on the Senate floor with respect to healthcare.  For over 7 years, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have been talking about how they intended to repeal the Affordable Care Act in order to replace it with something better and improve our healthcare system. President Trump has said time and again that he would provide better healthcare at a lower cost. He said that everyone would be covered. Yet we have seen no solutions from the other side that would accomplish these goals. We have been trying to work with Republicans, not just this year but for the last several years to improve our healthcare system. In fact, we worked with them to craft the Affordable Care Act in the first place, holding public hearings and meetings with both Democrats and Republicans around the table. The Affordable Care Act included well over 150 Republican amendments. Yet they refused to work with us on our final passage of the law and refused to work with us on the current law and healthcare ever since.  However, today we have seen a couple of glimpses of bipartisanship. First, the Senate voted last night, both Democrats and Republicans, to reject the TrumpCare bill that would have provided tax breaks to special interests while decimating I am glad the Senate has spoken on that issue and said that we do not support this effort. This afternoon, Democrats and Republicans voted to reject a bill that would have repealed the Affordable Care Act with no replacement. A majority of Senators voted to say that effort was unacceptable.  Now that we have taken those votes, Senators have had their say on what they think is the best path forward, and to me, these votes show that most Senators want to work in a bipartisan fashion to improve our healthcare system. I have heard many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say just that, as Senator McCain said so eloquently yesterday.  I think, if my colleagues are willing to sit down and negotiate in good faith[[Page S4267]]on legislation to improve our healthcare system and bring down costs, we could come up with a bill that would get the support of the majority of this body. My colleague Senator Shaheen, for example, introduced legislation to help stabilize the individual market, something I think most of us would agree is an important step forward in improving the Affordable Care However, we are now hurdling toward a vote with absolutely no plan to improve the healthcare system. My Republican colleagues are scrambling to get enough votes just to pass anything at all.  Right now we are debating the bill, but what does that mean when we have not yet seen the bill we are eventually going to vote on? This is not a meaningful exercise with opportunities to amend and improve legislation. We are simply killing time so that the Republican leadership can unveil a new bill, if they are able to come up with one, that they can convince enough of their Members to support. Hours or minutes before final passage this could be sprung upon us, and we would then be forced to take a vote. That is not the way the legislative process should work.  What kind of message does this send to our constituents? This is an example of legislating at its worst.  This is why many Americans don't trust Washington to have their backs. We don't know what Republicans intend to pass at the end of this debate, but we do know that they intend to pass something that is harmful. The CBO score, which the Democratic leader suggested, based upon the reports of what is pending, suggests significant losses in coverage across the country and significant increases in the cost of healthcare insurance for Based on what we have seen so far, each proposal would send the healthcare market into a death spiral, impacting all of our constituents--not just the Medicaid recipients, not just those who are in the exchanges--and even private employers who provide insurance coverage for their workers would see increases.  As I mentioned earlier, the bill we voted on this afternoon would repeal the Affordable Care Act with no replacement. In that case, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said this would cause 32 million Americans to lose health insurance over the next decade, including 17 million next year alone, and health insurance markets would collapse.  As I indicated, fortunately, that failed, with both Democrats and Republicans voting against it, but it looks like Senate Republican leadership is still trying to cobble together yet another version, taking some of the worst elements of the repeal act. What is worse, there will be no opportunity to review the bill, no chance for CBO to analyze the bill and provide feedback, no opportunities for stakeholders, patients, and States to weigh in.  It is telling that the only path forward they have for their repeal effort is to pass a bill no one has literally read. The only chance they have to get support for their effort is to hide, essentially, the impact of the bill because on the merits it appears devastating to our constituents.  Nevertheless, as much as they try to hide this bill, the American people will find out. They will find out when they get the bill for their health insurance. They will find out when they go to their doctor and discover the treatment they had last year that was covered under the Affordable Care Act is no longer covered. They will find out when the only insurance company in their State decides to leave. They will find out when their employer says: We are no longer providing healthcare to our employees. They will find out when they start a family and discover that maternity care is no longer covered and, if the child needs medical care early in life, the insurance company can say: No, thank you; we don't have to cover the child. There is a preexisting condition.  Just last night I got a call from a woman in Charlestown, RI--She urged me to continue fighting to preserve the Affordable Care She is a hairdresser and her husband is a commercial fisherman. Because they are both self-employed, they are not able to get coverage through work. They have been able to access care through our State's health insurance marketplace, HealthSource As Amy said, she and her husband are hard-working, middle-income taxpayers, but they never have been able to afford coverage without the help of the Affordable Care They would not have been able to do that. Amy recently got sick and had to be hospitalized. She has coverage because of She was able to get the treatment she needed. Without coverage, she would have been left to pay a bill of $78,000. Amy told me that she and her husband would have had to sell their house to afford that, and, probably even with that, they would have been left impoverished.  Is that really what my colleagues want for their constituents?  My constituents know what is at stake. I have heard from thousands and thousands of them throughout the year, urging me to keep fighting for healthcare, asking me to put an end to this repeal effort. However, Democrats cannot do this alone. We need more Republicans like some of my colleagues, Senator Collins and Senator Murkowski, to come forward and say: Enough is enough. Even if you have problems with the current system, let's try to work together to solve the problems. We might not always agree, but we will try our best to come to a consensus. There is no harm in trying to come up with a bipartisan solution. It is not too late to reverse course and return to regular order, to start again, to start right, and to do it, as my colleague on the Armed Services Committee, Chairman McCain, said, the good old fashioned way, with Senator Alexander and Senator Murray on the HELP Committee and my colleagues on the Finance Committee working their way through, carefully and deliberately, listening, amending, moving forward legislation so that we can come to this body not with a few minutes' notice but fully prepared to vote on something that is critical to every family in the country.

It is clear House and Senate Republicans are miles apart. They are divided on major issues--on Medicaid, tax breaks, and preexisting conditions. The differences between House Republicans and Senate Republicans are virtually irreconcilable. So what is the point of a conference?  You can imagine a conference that turns into an endless game of hot potato; the Republican leader and the Senate passing the potato to the House; the Republican leader of the House passing the potato back to the Senate because neither wants to be responsible for what is inevitable: the demise of Of course, it is likely a conference could probably produce no agreement at all, keeping the incredibly toxic and unpopular TrumpCare bill the topic of conversation for another 3 months, stalling the legislative agenda for another 3 months, and in the end getting nothing done.  My Republican colleagues should consider that. Many of them want to work with us on so many issues. Above all, NDAA, which my dear friend John McCain, who we pray for every day, wants to get to right away, and the Energy bill, which my colleague from Washington and her chair, the senior Member from Alaska, could bring to the floor and get moving in a bipartisan way. Leader McConnell has made it clear he wants to move nominations.  If we stop playing this game with TrumpCare and send it back to committee and do regular order, as John McCain preached so well yesterday, we could move on to all these other things in a good, strong bipartisan way and start to get things done. My Republican colleagues should consider that carefully.  We Democrats want to start working with our Republican colleagues on the issues I mentioned. We also want to work on improving No one has ever said ObamaCare was perfect. I have called five or six of my Republican colleagues on the other side and said if we stop this effort with TrumpCare--with repeal or repeal and replace with something far worse than the present--we can go back to committee and improve the present healthcare system and get premiums lower, make healthcare better, and stabilize the system so there is more competition. We will do that.  My good friend the Senator from Wyoming, not the Senator sitting here but his colleague--I heard he was saying to some Members: Oh, the Democrats will never negotiate. Schumer will never negotiate. I saw him last night on the floor, and I assured him we will. That is our goal. He accepted that in good faith, which I very much respect.  So the bottom line is simple. I say to my Republican colleagues, when you find yourself in a hole, the first rule is stop digging. By continuing this process--trying to send something, anything, to conference with the House--Republicans are just digging a deeper and deeper hole for themselves and for this body. I implore my Republican colleagues to stop digging and come work with We can work to improve our Nation's healthcare system, but Republicans have to turn back soon, and they are running out of chances.  One more thing I would add. I heard my friend the Republican leader say we are going to have a full amendment process. He is trying to convince the folks on the other side that, oh, we will do a bunch of amendments, and then we will have no choice, we will have to send something to conference because we couldn't get anything major done. That is a lot of bunk. We have had no hearings, we had no amendments, we had no bipartisan discussions, and we will not even be able to have debate on many amendments on one of the most major bills affecting us, that affects tens of millions of people's health, and affects one-sixth of the economy. Don't fall for this, oh, we are having a full process. I like my friend the Republican leader. We get along well, but sometimes he says things that when I hear them, I get a little twinge in the stomach. We have a full and open amendment process, he said three or four times. Everyone in this Chamber knows that is not the case. Don't be deluded into thinking, well, we tried. We haven't tried until we go back to regular order.         Comments of the President on Attorney General Sessions  Mr.President, on another matter, President Trump continues to find new ways to humiliate his own Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, a man who stuck his neck out for the President before any other Senator would. I heard President Trump say: I was already popular. As I remember it, when Jeff Sessions supported him, he was an underdog, and everyone said: Wow, Jeff Sessions is doing that out of loyalty and friendship with Donald Trump, not because he was jumping on a train that was headed down the track. Maybe he saw that, but no one else did, and now the President humiliates him.  I would say to my fellow Americans--Democratic, Republican, liberal, conservative--every American should be troubled by the character of this person who humiliates and turns his back on a close friend after only 6 months. We are already far beyond the dangers of a chilling effect at the Department of The President is taking almost every opportunity in public to demonstrate an open hostility toward the Attorney It seems clear the President's intention is to make life unbearable for the Attorney General, hoping to prompt his resignation. All Americans should be wondering why the President is publicly demeaning and humiliating such a close friend and supporter--a member of his own They should wonder if the President is trying to pry open the office of Attorney General to appoint someone during the August recess who will fire Special Counsel Mueller and shut down the Republican investigation. Let me say, if such a situation arises, Democrats will use every tool in our toolbox to stymie such a recess appointment.  Second, I can't imagine my friends on the Republican side, particularly my friends in the Republican leadership, the majority leader and Speaker Ryan--I can't imagine they would be complicit in creating a constitutional crisis. They must work with us and not[[Page S4229]]open the door to a constitutional crisis during the August recess.                             Sanctions Bill  Mr.President, one final point because I know my colleagues are waiting: sanctions--finally, a word on them. Yesterday, the House of Representatives passed nearly unanimously, 419 to 3, a sanctions bill that was a product of bicameral, bipartisan negotiations and includes strong sanctions against Russia, Iran, and North The Senate must act quickly on the legislation from the  I understand that earlier today the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee indicated he plans to strip out a section of this package that relates to North This is yet another delay generated by Republicans to prevent this bill from landing on the President's desk before we leave for the recess. Even as we debate other items here on the floor, we shouldn't delay this legislation any longer.  I will work with the majority leader to schedule another vote on the sanctions bill so that we can send the legislation to the President's desk before the recess, and I expect the vote will constitute a veto-proof majority, just like the vote in the  ",CREC-2017-07-26-pt1-PgS4227-9.txt,1036,BILL THREATENS OHIOANS,2017.0,26.0,July

14502,topic-id,549,"Madam President, I rise this evening to announce the Democrats will offer no further amendments to the pending legislation until the Republican leader shows us what the final legislation will be.  Clearly, the Senate bill--repeal and replace--has failed. Senator Paul's bill--repeal without replace--has also failed. We know the Republicans are not going to take a final vote on the underlying House bill, which is still the pending legislation.  Now the Republican leadership team has been telling the press about a yet-to-be-disclosed final bill. If the reports are true, the Republicans will offer a skinny repeal plan.  We just heard from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that under such a plan as reported in the press, 16 million Americans would lose their health insurance and millions more would pay a 20-percent--20-percent--increase in their premiums--at least 20 percent.  I thank Senator Murray and Senator Wyden for working with CBO so that we could figure out what exactly is going on, if this skinny bill is the bill that is brought to the floor.  My Republican friends come to the floor every day to assail the problem of high premiums. If the reporting is accurate and skinny repeal is their plan, it makes premiums far higher than they are today. We don't know if skinny repeal is going to be their final bill, but if it is, the CBO says that it would cause costs to go up and millions to lose insurance.  In the meantime, Democrats are not going to continue to try and amend the House plan that is already dead. Certainly, we are not going to do that while there is some secret legislation--skinny repeal it is reported--waiting to emerge from the leader's office.  The Republican leader has said that this is a robust amendment process. No, it isn't--far from it. We don't even know what bill to direct our amendments to. Certainly, a process that bypassed the committees and public hearings was never an open and transparent process. There was never a robust amendment process to this bill, but now it has gotten even worse. Since the beginning of this debate, we have just been taking votes on amendments to a piece of dead legislation.  What kind of process is this? Anyone who listened, as we all did, so intently to Senator McCain's wonderful speech yesterday and applauded the sentiment that he mentioned--getting back to regular order and proper procedure--anyone who listened to that speech would blush at this sham of an amendment process thus far. We don't even have a final bill to amend. The idea that this is a robust amendment process, I would say to my dear friend the leader, defies credulity. No one believes it. I bet not a single person on either side of the aisle believes it. So Democrats are not going to participate in this one-sided and broken process.  Once the majority leader shows his hand, reveals what his bill will actually be, Democrats will use the opportunity to try to amend the bill. But we have to see it first, and we ought to see it soon in broad daylight, not at the eleventh hour.  Until we see the real bill, Democrats will offer no further amendments.

14623,topic-id,6537,"Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 910       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT       This Act may be cited as the ``Disability Integration Act      of 2017''.     2. FINDINGS AND       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:       (1) In enacting the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990      (referred to in this Act as the ``ADA''), Congress--       (A) recognized that ``historically, society has tended to      isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and,      despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination      against individuals with disabilities continue to be a      serious and pervasive social problem''; and       (B) intended that the ADA assure ``full participation'' and      ``independent living'' for individuals with disabilities by      addressing ``discrimination against individuals with      disabilities [that] persists in critical areas'', including      institutionalization.       (2) While Congress expected that the ADA's integration      mandate would be interpreted in a manner that ensures that      individuals who are eligible for institutional placement are      able to exercise a right to community-based long-term      services and supports, that expectation has not been      fulfilled.       (3) The holdings of the Supreme Court in Olmstead v. L.C.,      527 U.581 (1999), and companion cases, have clearly      articulated that individuals with disabilities have a civil      right under the ADA to participate in society as equal      citizens. However, many States still do not provide      sufficient community-based long-term services and supports to      individuals with disabilities to end segregation in      institutions.       (4) The right to live in the community is necessary for the      exercise of the civil rights that the ADA was intended to      secure for all individuals with disabilities. The lack of      adequate community-based services and supports has imperiled      the civil rights of all individuals with disabilities, and      has undermined the very promise of the It is, therefore,      necessary to recognize in statute a robust and fully      articulated right to community living.       (5) States, with a few exceptions, continue to approach      decisions regarding long-term services and supports from      social welfare and budgetary perspectives, but for the      promise of the ADA to be fully realized, States must approach      these decisions from a civil rights perspective.       (6) States have not consistently planned to ensure      sufficient services and supports for individuals with      disabilities, including those with the most significant      disabilities, to enable individuals with disabilities to live      in the most integrated setting. As a result, many individuals      with disabilities who reside in institutions are prevented      from residing in the community and individuals with      disabilities who are not in institutions find themselves at      risk of institutional placement.       (7) The continuing existence of unfair and unnecessary      institutionalization denies individuals with disabilities the      opportunity to live and participate on an equal basis in the      community and costs the United States billions of dollars in      unnecessary spending related to perpetuating dependency and      unnecessary confinement.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to clarify and strengthen the ADA's integration mandate      in a manner that accelerates State compliance;       (2) to clarify that every individual who is eligible for      long-term services and supports has a Federally protected      right to be meaningfully integrated into that individual's      community and receive community-based long-term services and      supports;       (3) to ensure that States provide long-term services and      supports to individuals with disabilities in a manner that      allows individuals with disabilities to live in the most      integrated setting, including the individual's own home, have      maximum control over their services and supports, and ensure      that long-term services and supports are provided in a manner      that allows individuals with disabilities to lead an      independent life;[[Page S2452]]       (4) to establish a comprehensive State planning requirement      that includes enforceable, measurable objectives that are      designed to transition individuals with all types of      disabilities at all ages out of institutions and into the      most integrated setting; and       (5) to establish a requirement for clear and uniform annual      public reporting by States that includes reporting about--       (A) the number of individuals with disabilities who are      served in the community and the number who are served in      institutions; and       (B) the number of individuals with disabilities who have      transitioned from an institution to a community-based living      situation, and the type of community-based living situation      into which those individuals have transitioned.     3.

I think this is worth repeating because we are talking about changing one-sixth of the U.economy, impacting every American family, and yet we still have no idea what the bill actually is.  We do know this. A partisan bill to take away health insurance from tens of millions of Americans, written behind closed doors, opposed by every healthcare stakeholder group and by an overwhelming majority of the American people should not pass the  As I have repeatedly said, the only constructive way forward is for Democrats and Republicans to come together in a good-faith, bipartisan effort to repair and strengthen the current law. Bipartisanship should not be our last resort, as Senator McConnell has suggested. It should be a starting point. It should be the foundation of what we do in this body. This is how the great majority of the American people want us to conduct the Senate's business. This is what I hear from my constituents in New Hampshire, and this is especially true with healthcare legislation which affects families all across this country.  Make no mistake, every bill proposed by the Republican leadership has been designed as a bullet to the heart of the Affordable Care Republican proposals will collapse the individual marketplaces, make it impossible to provide affordable coverage for people with preexisting conditions, and take healthcare coverage away from up to 32 million Americans, including the most vulnerable.  I hope nobody is fooled by this latest partisan measure to roll back the Affordable Care Act and take healthcare coverage away from tens of millions of I hope every Senator will, at long last, heed Senator McCain's call for bipartisanship--as we have been hearing at townhalls and in countless messages from our constituents. The American people want us to make commonsense, bipartisan changes to the current law.

At the recent National Governors Association meeting, Democratic and Republican Governors alike urged Congress to reject the Republican leaders' healthcare bill--in particular, its harsh and unsustainable cuts to The Republican Governor, John Kasich, was especially forceful in urging Members of Congress to work together to find bipartisan solutions. He urged Congress to give first priority to stabilizing the healthcare marketplaces.  We should listen to the Governors, but most importantly we should listen to our constituents--to the great majority of our constituents who want to preserve what is working in the Affordable Care Act and see us change what is not working.

There is a great success story in Michigan that I would share on the Medicaid front. Of course, three out of five Michigan seniors in nursing homes with Alzheimer's or other kinds of challenges get their healthcare from In addition to Medicare, Medicaid is there for middle-class seniors, for low-income seniors, and so on.  When our distinguished Senator from Oregon talks about dollars--saving dollars or costing dollars--an interesting thing has happened by setting up Healthy Michigan and expanding Medicaid healthcare to minimum-wage working people. We are actually saving money.  Ninety-seven percent of our children can now see a doctor in That is great. They have cut in half the number of people who walk into the emergency room who can't pay. We all pay if somebody walks in and gets the most expensive treatment through the emergency room.  The State of Michigan will save $432 million in taxpayer money next year because they are focusing on children going to a doctor, people getting preventive care, not using the emergency room. It saves money.  Instead of doing these tax-cut provisions for the wealthiest and for the pharmaceutical companies that take dollars away, actually doing the right thing on healthcare in Michigan is a great success story for saving taxpayer dollars.

14452,topic-id,1177,"Madam President, I don't need to tell anyone why we are here. We are here because ObamaCare is fundamentally broken. That is clear. It is evident. Everybody knows that.  A combination of soaring premiums and rapidly decreasing insurer participation has left the law's centerpiece--the healthcare exchanges--literally on the brink of collapse. Insurers are fleeing. Nationwide, 141 insurers have registered to offer plans on the exchanges in 2018, which represents a 38-percent drop from 2017, and that is on top of a nearly 30-percent drop in insurer participation from 2016 to 2017.  If the trend of the past 2 years continues, the final number of insurers offering plans on the exchanges in 2018 is likely to be roughly half the number that offered plans in 2016--a year ago. At least 40 counties around the country are likely to have no ObamaCare insurer in 2018 and another 1,300-plus counties are likely to have just one choice of insurer.  President Obama once said that shopping on the exchanges would be like buying a TV on For a lot of people next year, it is going to be like shopping for a TV on Amazon, if Amazon only offered one brand of Of course, for some people it is going to be like shopping for a TV on Amazon only to discover that Amazon has no TVs at all.  Another thing ObamaCare was supposed to do was make health insurance more affordable. That hasn't worked too well. Premiums on the exchanges have soared and soared again. Between 2013 and 2017, the average individual market monthly premium in the healthcare.gov States increased by 105 percent. How many families in this country can afford to have their health insurance premium more than double in just 5 years--and there is no end in sight.  Here are some of the premium hikes insurers are proposing for 2018:  In Maryland, one insurer has proposed an average premium increase of 52 percent; an Iowa insurer is seeking an average 43.5-percent premium increase; a North Carolina insurer is pursuing an average 22.9-percent hike; a Virginia insurer is looking for an average rate increase of 38 percent; a Delaware insurer is looking for an average rate hike of 33.6 percent; a Maine insurer is seeking an average rate hike of 40 percent; and in New Mexico, one insurer is seeking a rate increase of nearly 80 percent.  Again, those are rate hikes for just 1 year. That is after years of dramatic premium increases on the exchanges. Suffering under ObamaCare isn't limited to high premiums and decreasing choices. There are the Americans who have lost their healthcare plans, and the Americans who have lost access to the doctors they liked, the huge deductibles that left some Americans unable to use their insurance, and the ObamaCare tax hikes that have hurt small businesses and driven up the cost of health insurance.  ObamaCare has failed. Americans are suffering. Doing nothing is not an option. Yesterday we moved forward to debate legislation to provide relief to the millions of Americans who have been hurt by We are going to have a full debate and give people a chance to help shape the final bill.  I hope that at the end of the week, we will be able to pass a strong bill to start undoing the harm ObamaCare has caused. We owe the American people nothing less. We made a commitment to the American people; that if they elected us, we would do everything we could to give them relief from It is time to make good on that promise.  Chances to do away with damaging government programs don't come around every day. Once you give the government power, it can be pretty hard to wrest it away. This week, we have the chance to start repealing a really bad government program. We need to take it. If we don't act to help the American people, no one will. Democrats have made it clear that if they were in power, they would be doubling down on ObamaCare's failures.  The head of the Democratic Party in the U.Senate openly stated single-payer healthcare is on the table for A number of colleagues on the Democratic side have proposed that legislation. An analysis of one of our Democratic colleague's single-payer plan estimated that it would cost $32 trillion over 10 years. Well, that would require a tax hike so staggering the Washington Post pointed out that even the Senator who proposed it--an avowed Socialist--didn't offer anything close to what would be needed to pay for it.  We are the only hope Americans have of getting out from under ObamaCare's burdens. This week, we have a chance to pass legislation to finally provide them with relief. I heard my colleagues get up and talk about the impact the proposed legislation that is before us[[Page S4241]]would have on people across this country and American workers. I have to say, I talked to a lot of rank-and-file, hard-working South Dakotans and South Dakota families who have been hit so hard by these premium increases. I talked to families--a mom and dad with two kids who are paying more than $2,000 a month in premiums to get insurance in the individual marketplace.  In my State of South Dakota, premiums since 2013--the last 5 years--have gone up 124 percent. They have literally doubled. Do you know what that means in South Dakota? That is almost a $3,600 increase in just the last 5 years. What average family who is trying to raise kids, trying to pay the bills, trying to save for retirement, trying to put something aside for college education, trying to pay the mortgage and the utility bill--how many families can put up with a healthcare bill that has gone up in the last 5 years by almost $3,600? That is a crisis. That is why we are here.  Our colleagues on the other side want to turn a deaf ear and blind eye to what is happening out there. We can't afford to do that because the status quo is unsustainable. There is absolutely no way the American people who are suffering under the harms caused by ObamaCare can continue to abide the status quo.  It is up to us to take the steps that are necessary to move us in a different direction, a better path that brings stability to the marketplace, that gives people more choices, more options, greater competition, and brings down premiums and deductibles and the costs that are driving family budgets through the roof.  What we have seen since ObamaCare has been implemented are higher costs, higher taxes, and fewer options. It is as simple as that. That is what we are up against, and that is why it is time for us to act. I hope when we conclude this process at the end of this week--and we have an opportunity for everybody to offer their amendments--we will move forward with the bill and fulfill our promise to the American people.

It means hundreds of vacancies still left in important agencies like State and Defense, hundreds of hours wasted on meaningless executive orders, hundreds of miles flown back and forth to Mar-a-Lago to play golf, hundreds of educational and cultural programs on the chopping block, hundreds of acres of public lands under threat, and hundreds of programs that benefit millionaires while causing hundreds and thousands of seniors to worry about losing Meals on Wheels, working families losing their health care, DREAMers losing their protection, women losing Planned Parenthood, and ordinary folks losing money out of their pocket to pay higher tax bills because of the new proposal.

Earlier this year, Neil stepped down as president and CEO of Comcast Cable after 7 years with the company, but he will continue to work for the Comcast Corporation in his new role as a vice chairman.  Many know Neil for his business success and acumen, but his impressive career began as a member of the Armed Neil served on Active Duty with the Navy SEAL teams for over 5 years and retired from the service as a lieutenant commander. Neil never forgot the actions of his fellow servicemembers, which is why he championed Comcast's pledge to help Active-Duty servicemembers find jobs and make the transition into the civilian workforce. In particular, Neil spearheaded Comcast's commitment to hire 10,000 veterans, Reservists, and their spouses, as well as improving the company's military leave policies.  Neil is active in community service, both nationally and in the Philadelphia region. He currently sits on the executive committee of the board of trustees for the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and he serves on the board of directors of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association and C-SPAN, which broadcasts the Senate's proceedings nationwide.  As CEO of Comcast Cable, Neil developed and implemented significant changes aiming to improve cable and broadband services across the country. Comcast has a strong and well-known presence in Pennsylvania, both in terms of delivering television programming and Internet service to customers and in employing thousands of hard-working individuals across a variety of careers. Under Neil's leadership, Comcast Cable accelerated its commitment to job creation and innovation, developing new products that changed how customers consume telecommunication services. Prior to his time at Comcast, Neil displayed the same leadership and dedication to teamwork while serving in senior leadership positions at Charter Communications, AOL, Pillsbury, and  Today I congratulate Neil Smit on his leadership and an impressive career.

I have been one who has acknowledged for many years that there are challenges in the Affordable Care Act and that there are areas in which there could be common interests in finding solutions, but what we have before us now is a series of ``bad, badder, and baddest'' choices. In effect, we have a series of options that ask: Do we want to pass legislation that would take 16 million Americans off healthcare? Do we want to pass legislation that would take 22 million people off healthcare? Do we want to pass legislation that would take 32 million Americans off health insurance?  What parts of these choices do my Republican colleagues really embrace?

That is why our phones are ringing in our offices and I know in our Senate Republican colleagues' offices. People are saying do not pass this kind of legislation.  I think about the fact that in the last couple of weeks, the parents of a number of children and young adults who have enormous disabilities have come to my office. In Virginia, we run a very skinny Medicaid Frankly, it has not been very generous. Some of the individuals who have come to my office have waited 5, 6 years--one person has waited 10 years--to get a Medicaid waiver. These families, these children, in any of the proposals that have been put forward, would be the first to lose their coverage.  Family after family talked about the fact that, right now, both parents can work because they have a little bit of relief to take care of their disabled young adults in certain cases. In many cases, it is because the young adults can at least find someplace to do some productive work themselves. Yet, if they were to lose the Medicaid waiver, one of the parents would have to stop working, and the child would have to stop his form of employment. Net-net, it would be a loss not only to that family, but it would be a loss to our economy.  I mentioned that I used to be the Governor of In 2016, Virginia received about $4 billion in Federal Medicaid funds--51 percent of the State's funding for people covered by As I mentioned, we are ranked one of the skinniest programs in the country. Unfortunately, we rank about 47th, I believe, in terms of our payments. Yet, under any of these proposals that decimate Medicaid, Virginia would be penalized for running an efficient program.  Again, one of the ironies of this is that the States that are the least penalized in the Republican proposals, in terms of the $700 billion-plus of Medicaid cuts, are actually the States that have more generous programs. They are often States that are represented by Democratic In what way do these proposals help our Republican colleagues or, for that matter, their constituents?  We have heard, as well, that the American Cancer Society, the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Hospital Association, and AARP--a who's who of groups affiliated with healthcare--have come in and pleaded: Please, do not do this, this way--any one of these litany of proposals that we will be dealing with over the next few days.  From what I have heard on an individual basis--and I take enormous pride in the fact that in my time here--and sometimes it has even gotten me crosswise with the ranking member of the HELP Committee--I have tried to reach out on virtually every piece of legislation I have worked on to find a Republican partner. I actually got put in a timeout by a previous leader for doing too much of that.  What I hear from my Republican colleagues is, they do not want to own this. They know, in many ways, that this is walking the plank on what is both bad policy, bad politics, bad for their constituents, but the notion that somehow they have to provide a win for a President who has provided zero leadership before they can take some kind of August recess is literally the worst reasoning I have heard in my 8 years in the Senate as to why to pass a piece of legislation, particularly a piece of legislation that affects one-sixth of our economy. In many ways, it is almost one-third of the people who will be affected by some of these changes.  I think many of us were touched yesterday when we saw Senator McCain, who is an American hero and who himself is having to grapple with enormous healthcare challenges, come back to the floor and, frankly, admonish us appropriately but also say that while he was going to vote to start debate on this bill, the real way we ought to go about doing this is to roll up our sleeves, in a bipartisan fashion, and take this legislation back to where it should start, which is in the HELP Committee, where the Senator from Washington serves, in the Budget Committee, whose chairman is on the floor, and in the Finance Two of those three committees I have the honor of serving on.  I commit to my Republican colleagues that I will work with them. I have laid out a series of ideas, some of which they have endorsed in terms of there potentially being cheaper options, in terms of selections; the idea, as long as we protect consumers, of allowing insurance policies to be sold across State lines and other ideas in terms of reinsurance that other colleagues have worked on. There are a host of ideas we all agree on. Let's start with that premise, in terms of coming to a solution, not coming up with legislation that is cooked up behind closed doors that even my strongest Republican colleagues have acknowledged they cannot vote on when they only get an hour to look at it.  Think about all of the same criticisms--some of them valid--that were made against the Democrats when we passed the ACA; although I would continue to remind my friends that we had, literally, hundreds of amendments which were Republican amendments that were accepted into that legislation. It was not a perfect process, but let's learn from that and take this advantage right now. Listen to the American public, and let's work together to get this right.  The other item that will come about from any of this Republican legislation put forward, even from the skinniest of their proposals, would dramatically affect those individuals with preexisting conditions. I have three daughters. One of my daughters has juvenile diabetes. She has had it for 18 years. Another daughter has asthma and a very strange set of allergic reactions that have actually caused her to have been hospitalized 38 times in the last 40 months.  I am an extraordinarily lucky individual. I know that both through health insurance and because I had the resources, every time my two children got sick, I could make sure they got the medical attention they deserved. I cannot imagine talking to any Virginia family or Washington family or Wyoming family or Arkansas family who has a child with those same afflictions and trying to explain to them that my kids who have juvenile diabetes, asthma, and allergic reactions--through no fault of their own and that have caused this number of hospitalizations--have a right to healthcare and that their kids who have preexisting conditions do not have that right.  Our country is much better than this. We can figure out a way to get this right, but we are not going to get it right if we continue to have this ploy of one closed-door, cooked-up deal after another that is put forward, with no review and no real attempt to find a common solution.  I do not come to the floor that often, and I do not often talk about the medical needs of my family. This is for the sake of not only my kids who get the coverage they need and deserve but for[[Page S4233]]all the kids who now get the coverage they did not have prior to the ACA and who have it now. It is the idea that insurance companies cannot discriminate against you because you have preexisting conditions.  Let's see if we can make sure we maintain that commitment. In the greatest country in the world, as Senator McCain so eloquently put it yesterday, let's see if we can work through to a way that makes this body, once again, the greatest deliberative body in the world. Let's see if we can find that common ground that would allow us to put forward legislation that at the end of the day, we would all be proud of. That is a goal worth working on.  My hope is, over the coming days, we will find that common group of Senators who will say we are going to take that path rather than the path we are on right now.  I yield the floor.

14397,topic-id,1122,"Mr.President, since the Republicans have announced that their top legislative priority in this Congress would be to rip away healthcare from millions of Americans, I have come down to the floor many times to beg them to reconsider. I shared stories about families in Massachusetts who gained quality healthcare coverage for the first time after the passage of the Affordable Care I shared statements and letters from hospitals and doctors in Massachusetts talking about the incredible difference healthcare coverage makes for the patients who walk through their doors. I have also shared many, many stories from parents with children who have complex medical needs--all of those children depending on  I know that families, doctors, hospitals, nursing homes, and patients lying in their hospital beds haven't just been sharing their stories with me; they have been begging every Republican in the Senate to listen to them as well. People share their stories because they want to make a difference. These are the stories of families we represent. They are the reason we are here in the They are supposed to be our guiding light for the choices we make and the way we vote.  Senate Republicans who voted yesterday to move forward with their effort to rip away Americans' healthcare are not listening to the people they represent. Their vote was irresponsible. It was reckless. It was cruel. It was immoral. But more than that, this was a vote that is not who we are as a country.  Let's be very clear about what is happening on the floor of the Senate right now. Fifty Republicans have voted to open debate on a series of bills, each of which would have devastating effects for healthcare in this country. Now the Republicans don't know which of these bills will actually be the ones they will be asked to vote on. Only some of the bills have been analyzed by the number crunchers over at the Congressional Budget Office, the CBO, to estimate exactly how many people would be kicked off insurance and how high premiums would go, but every version that the CBO did examine over the last few weeks was very ugly, with tens of millions of people losing their coverage and costs skyrocketing for millions more.  The latest plan Senator McConnell has been floating behind the scenes would have Republicans ultimately vote on what is called a skinny repeal bill. This bill would make a limited set of changes to the Affordable Care Act--just the important stuff. What is important to Senator McConnell? It seems to be the part of the Affordable Care Act that makes the health insurance system actually work, because the skinny bill would repeal the parts of the ACA that say everyone needs health insurance coverage. This is the individual mandate.  Republican leadership is telling their Members that if they vote for this skinny bill, they can hammer out the rest of the details in conference with the House of But make no mistake--this isn't a more moderate version of the Republicans' ugly plan to repeal the Affordable Care This isn't compromise. In fact, this may be the worst idea they have had yet because if Senate Republicans vote to repeal the individual mandate, they are getting rid of the linchpin of the insurance markets in this country. That is because this provision--the one the Republicans want to junk--is what keeps the price of insurance affordable for people with preexisting conditions.  Don't just take my word for it. Independent experts have looked at what would happen if the Republicans repeal the individual mandate. Boy, it is not pretty. Just yesterday, the American Academy of Actuaries--these are the experts who study how insurance works. They do that for a living. These are their numbers. They wrote to Senate leadership begging them not to go forward with this reckless plan. They wrote that eliminating this part of the health law ``would likely have significant implications for health care coverage and costs both to consumers and the federal government.'' They said that it would ``lead to premium increases.'' It would ``weaken insurer solvency.''  Let me do the translation on this. The actuaries--those who study insurance for a living--are saying that what the Republicans are thinking of voting on is a provision to jack up insurance costs through the roof and rip away coverage from those who can't afford to pay those higher costs.  We should be very clear about the consequences. If the Republicans go through with that vote, they will be responsible for every dollar of premium increases that occur over the weeks and months that follow as this bill sits in a conference with the House and insurance companies jack up prices because they don't know what they might be required to cover. Senate Republicans will be responsible for every single person who has to drop coverage because they can't afford those price increases. The Senate Republicans will be responsible for every single person who didn't go to the doctor when they needed to or didn't schedule surgery when they needed to because they no longer have health insurance. Senate Republicans will be responsible for every family in this country who misses a mortgage payment or can't pay their electricity bill or is forced into bankruptcy because their medical debts have become too big to ever pay off.  Every time I have come to the floor to talk about this terrible Republican bill, I have said that I am ready to work on bipartisan proposals that will actually improve healthcare in this country, and I say it again. I am still ready to do that, but we cannot move forward while Senate Republicans are still trying to take healthcare coverage away from millions of Americans and drive up costs for millions more.  Republicans seem to think they can wear us down, that they can keep us here until we get too tired or we give up or we just give in, but, boy, that is where they are wrong. They do not have a clue what they are up against because we are fighting for families. We are fighting for little kids. We are fighting for our neighbors. We are fighting for parents and brothers and sisters and loved ones. We are fighting for the American people. When you fight for the American people, the wind is always at your back, and your heart is always strong.  So Democrats will be here, fighting for as long as it takes to beat back these shameful healthcare bills. We hear the American people. We hear you. We are on your side, and we will never give up.

14505,topic-id,1534,"Madam President, something else happened this afternoon in Washington that I wish to relate today on the floor, which is that the American Enterprise Institute hosted the launch of Senator Schatz's and my American Opportunity Carbon Fee I am delighted the American Enterprise Institute did that. Their conservative credentials are rock solid, but they do not fear debate, and they were extraordinarily helpful and open-minded in allowing us to make the announcement and in hosting a discussion on the bill that followed.  Virtually every person on the Republican side who has thought the climate change problem through to a solution has come to the same place--a revenue-neutral, border-adjustable price on carbon. That means that all of the revenues are returned to the American people.  Former Treasury Secretaries Baker, Shultz, and Paulson--all Republicans--former EPA Administrators Ruckelshaus, Thomas, Reilly, and Whitman--all Republicans--and leading economists and former Presidential economic advisers Arthur Laffer, Gregory Mankiw, and Douglas Holtz-Eakin--all Republicans--along with many others, support a revenue-neutral, border-adjustable carbon fee. Well, that is what we do.  You all know the phrase ``offering an olive branch.'' Former Republican Congressman Bob Inglis described our proposal as an olive limb, not a branch, when pairing a carbon tax with corporate tax reduction. He said it provides what he called ``an opportunity for conservatives to show how free enterprise can solve climate change.''  When I first came to the Senate in 2007, this place was humming with bipartisan action on climate change for years--but, in 2010, a dead stop. The Republican Party disappeared from the field after the fossil fuel industry secured from five Justices on the Supreme Court the infamous Citizens United decision. The fossil fuel industry, as if it saw the decision coming, immediately launched a veritable Soviet May Day parade of political artillery and rocketry. No special interest had that kind of political muscle before Citizens The combination of this industry political weaponry, plus the proliferation of dark money, plus the shady science simulacrum of climate denial has been formidable.  Despite this, there is room for optimism. There are Republicans who are willing to work with us. They just need some prospect of safe passage through the political kill zone that the fossil fuel industry has created.  Over 1,000 American companies have voiced their support for the Paris climate agreement, including corporate powerhouses like Walmart, Goldman Sachs, PepsiCo, and If American companies were to mobilize in[[Page S4269]]Congress just like they did for the Paris Agreement, that would be a game-changer.  But notwithstanding all of that corporate support, the big business trade associations and lobbying groups have lined up against action on climate change. The so-called U.Chamber of Commerce--probably more accurately described as the U.chamber of carbon--is one of climate action's most implacable enemies, despite the good climate policies of so many of its member companies. How is it representing its members? It is incredible.  The American Petroleum Institute represents Shell, BP, Total, and Exxon--companies that claim to support the Paris Agreement and the Climate Leadership Council's carbon fee proposal--but API opposes anything getting done.  We all know here that corporate America commands extraordinary attention in our political system. If American corporations aligned their political engagement on climate change with their actual position on climate change, which should not be asking too much of them, we could get going.  So, in a spirit of hopefulness, Senator Schatz and I reintroduced at the American Enterprise Institute our American Opportunity Carbon Fee Act, a framework that I hope both Republicans and Democrats can embrace. The bill would establish an economy-wide carbon fee on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. The fee would be assessed where it is easiest to administer, minimizing the compliance burden. Other greenhouse gases would be tied to their carbon dioxide equivalency with a bumper for fluorocarbons to account for their high greenhouse gas potency. Sequestering, utilizing, or encapsulating carbon dioxide emissions would earn you a credit. The market would begin to work in this space.  Our bill sets the 2018 fee per ton of carbon emitted at $49--the central range of the social cost of carbon last estimated by the Office of Management and That fee would increase each year at a real 2 percent until emissions fall 80 percent below 2005 levels, and then it would follow inflation.  Border adjustments for energy-intensive goods traded with countries that have weaker or no carbon pricing will make sure that we protect our industries at home. We took care to design the border adjustments in harmony with World Trade Organization rules.  This carbon fee would produce meaningful reductions in carbon emissions. The nonpartisan Resources for the Future projects a 36-percent drop by 2025, compared to the benchmark year of 2005, exceeding the U.S.-Paris Agreement commitment significantly.  In addition to the environmental value, of course, a carbon fee also generates revenue--in this case, nearly $2.1 trillion in revenue over 10 years. Our plan would return every dime of that to the American people. Here is how.  First, the bill lowers the top corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 29 percent--a longstanding goal of This would cut American corporate taxes by almost $600 billion over the first decade.  Second, it provides workers with a $550 refundable tax credit--$1,100 for a couple--against payroll taxes. The tax credits, which would grow with inflation, would return almost $900 billion to the pocketbooks of American households over the first 10 years.  Third, it would provide a matching benefit to Social Security beneficiaries, veterans program beneficiaries, and certain other retirees. These benefits would total nearly $500 billion over 10 years.  Finally, the bill would establish a block grant program, delivering the remaining funds to our States--over $100 billion to help workers in coal country, for instance, or provide coastal protection for seaside States facing terrible threats of sea level rise, at the discretion of the State, to meet local needs and concerns.  I understand the suffering in coal country. Coal country will continue to decline as natural gas drives coal out of the energy market. There is now no mechanism to remedy that inevitability.  Remember Huey Long's old slogan, ``Every Man a King''? With a carbon fee, we could make every miner a king--a solid pension, retirement at any time, full health benefits for life, a cash bonus based on years worked, a voucher for a new vehicle, a college plan for their kids. These things become doable with carbon fee revenues.  It is not the miners' fault that the coal industry has collapsed. They worked hard. They did dangerous work. It is a rigorous occupation to be a coal miner, and they are entitled to respect. Give them their dignity. Make them kings. With a small fraction of the revenue from a carbon fee, we could assure every single coal miner a lifetime of comfort, security, and financial stability.  Senator Schatz and I extend an open hand, an olive branch. Give Senator Schatz and me a Republican to negotiate with. That shouldn't be too much to ask. Then let's talk about the economics. Let's talk about where the revenue should go. And because I know it is a part of the Baker-Schultz-Paulson proposal, let's talk about where we can get fact-based, scientifically rigorous analytics of which regulations might become unnecessary or duplicative of a carbon fee's emission reductions.  Let's restart the bipartisan conversation we had going until 2010.  Let me close with an appeal to our patriotic sense. America holds herself out as an exemplary nation, a ``City on a Hill.'' The tactics of climate denial and political menace the fossil fuel industry has deployed around here have degraded our city.  There is a remorseless functioning of the laws of physics, of chemistry, and of biology. Deny them all you want, but time will tell. And even now, everyone, from our Secretary of Defense to every single Senator's home State, State university, understands that climate change is real and urgent, is teaching the science of climate change in those universities, and is warning of the dire consequences.  When the Presiding Officer left the Environment and Public Works Committee the other day, I was talking about the Leopold Center at Iowa State University and the powerful language in which they describe the present effects on agriculture of climate change and the danger of disruption to the fundamental systems of the planet. That is the home State universities telling us what the facts are.  So one day there will be a reckoning, and the longer our American democracy lies incapacitated at the hands of the fossil fuel industry, the worse the outcome will be, and the worse the outcome, the greater the harm to the country we love that holds its example up to the world.  We are all extremely fond of John John McCain returned to the Senate yesterday and called our country ``the strong, inspiring, inspirational beacon of liberty and defender of dignity of all human beings.'' Some beacon, if we continue to get this wrong because of what one industry did to our politics, using political menace, dark money, and fake science.  America deserves better than what we are doing in this Chamber on this issue.  I thank the Presiding  I yield the floor.

In fact, the President of the United States said repeatedly over the last few months that these would be inextricably linked, that repeal and replace would go hand-in-hand. That is not what is on offer right now. What is on offer are specific changes that would actually harm  For example, no more middle-class tax credits for healthcare--that is something that is critically important to the millions of middle-class folks who are walking on an economic tightrope every month, balancing their food costs against their fuel costs, their fuel costs against their medical costs.

An analysis from the Congressional Budget Office--and this is only a week old--said that half of the country will have zero insurance choices in the private marketplace under this scheme.  I would like to repeat that so people understand that, as to this idea that there is really no pain here and that nothing starts for a long time, the Congressional Budget Office--our nonpartisan, impartial umpire--doesn't agree with that. They said just last week that half of the country will have zero insurance choices in the private marketplace under this scheme. That goes up to 75 percent of Americans with no options in later years.  So my view is that this is just legislative malpractice, first because of the pain and harm it is going to cause so many The Congressional Budget Office says that kind of misery is going to kick in quickly.  Second--and I don't think this has been discussed on the floor--this walks back months and months of Republican promises. The American people were told again and again that repeal and replace were going to be directly linked. The President said it multiple times. Then he went over the top and told people that they were going to have lower costs and better coverage.  ",CREC-2017-07-26-pt1-PgS4227-9.txt,1247,J.

What they really want to do is get them now, to put them in the budget baseline in order to open up the opportunity when tax reform comes along to have even more tax breaks for the fortunate few.

14451,topic-id,395,"My colleague has described how the Senate works best when she says: Look, bipartisanship is not about taking each other's lousy ideas. Bipartisanship is about both sides getting together, having hearings, listening to all alternatives and ideas, and often coming up with something no one has thought of.  My colleague knows a lot about bipartisanship in healthcare because my colleague was part of our effort in 2008 when we put together the first bipartisan universal coverage bill in the history of the Senate--seven Democrats, seven By the way, a number of those Republicans are still serving in the Senate today. We know that is a better path.  To wrap up this portion of the debate, I wish to say to my colleagues that the best way to proceed is with a kind of two-part effort. The first is to say that we all agree the Affordable Care Act is not perfect. We are going to take steps immediately to stabilize the private insurance market.  We have a number of our colleagues--Senator Shaheen, with her effort to make sure people can get some help when they have deductibles and copayments; our colleague from Virginia, Senator Kaine, with reinsurance; Senator McCaskill with a fine idea to help areas that are bare in terms of no coverage. We have to move to stabilize the private market quickly because at the end of August, the plans are essentially signing contracts for premiums for 2018.  My colleague is absolutely right. We ought to knock off this partisan our-way-or-the-highway approach, move on a bipartisan basis to take steps to improve the Affordable Care Act now after we have hearings, input, and the opportunity to have people in front of the committees of jurisdiction. After that, we then move to the broader array of issues, starting with the immediate challenge my colleague has led on, which is clamping down on the cost of pharmaceuticals. You take steps to stabilize the market immediately, and then you move again in a bipartisan way on what our constituents are talking about at every community meeting, which is that their Social Security checks, the benefits they get, aren't coming close to keeping up with the rise in the cost of prescriptions.

14461,topic-id,887,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague for an excellent statement and for appealing to the better angels.  Mr.President, I am rising to speak about the Donnelly amendment, which is very much needed because the President--and now Republicans--are walking back a clear commitment.  The President said in the campaign that he would not cut Medicaid, he wouldn't touch it, but even before the inauguration, the Trump team eagerly signed on to a Republican plan to slash it by more than $700 billion. They stared into television cameras, looked American voters in the eyes, and said that somehow these massive cuts to Medicaid wouldn't in any way harm the seniors. Medicaid picks up 2 out of 3 dollars with respect to seniors in nursing home beds and special needs kids and disabled youngsters.  When we hear that Medicaid picks up the cost of two out of three nursing home beds and compare that to the President's statement that he wouldn't cut Medicaid--wouldn't cut it--when we are now faced with a plan to cut it by more than $700 billion, one, that is walking back the President's solemn pledge in the campaign, and, two, it is going to make it harder for older people in this country to be able to afford long-term care.  The majority has brought the TrumpCare debate and the extreme Medicaid cuts that I just described directly to the floor of this Senate without a single committee hearing to justify this ill-advised policy.  Our colleague from Indiana, Senator Donnelly, has put forward an important amendment to stop this ideological crusade to unravel the Medicaid safety net. Senator Donnelly's proposal would send this partisan attack on Medicaid back to the Senate Finance Committee, where it should have been raised and struck down in the first place.  Mr.President, I am the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance My focus in public life has always been to try to find common ground with people of common sense. And I wrote with colleagues--many of whom still serve on the Republican side and on the Democratic side--a universal coverage bill that pulled together both sides of the political spectrum.  So unless you provide an opportunity to have a discussion about the Medicaid safety net in the Senate Finance Committee, you are not going to be able to have policies that get to common ground on this vital issue. What you are going to have is what is really on offer now--an anti-Medicaid crusade that is a grave threat to the health and well-being of tens of millions of  Over the last few months, I have heard Republican colleagues say that Medicaid is a disincentive to work and that there are too many able-bodied adults enrolled. If you look at the facts, that is not what the program is all about. Medicaid is a vital source of coverage for our neighbors and friends who live in poverty. It tells those families that healthcare is covered while they work to climb the economic ladder in the private sector.  In addition to that, for the older people I have mentioned--these are the folks who have done everything right in life. They went to school, they found jobs, they worked hard in their careers, they raised families, and they scrimped and saved all through their lives. Growing old in America is pretty costly. So what happens is that millions of seniors who have done everything right spend down their savings, and that is when Medicaid steps in to help. It covers two out of three seniors living in nursing homes. It is a major source of funding for community-based care, and people generally don't know that. Now they may have heard about nursing homes, but it also picks up the costs for community-based care, where older people are more comfortable, and it often costs less than institutional care.  Seniors who lose those benefits due to TrumpCare Medicaid cuts are going to have to find somewhere else to live. A lot of families want to be able to help elderly parents and grandparents. It is going to be pretty hard because a lot of them are walking on an economic tightrope, and if they go looking[[Page S4248]]for nursing home care, it is going to cost on average more than $90,000.  So it is seniors, and it is disabled folks who count on Medicaid to have a chance to be productive. With the Medicaid benefits under threat, people with disabilities are going to find it hard to be able to attain the productive role in our society that they so fervently want to have. Our communities are so much better off when folks with disabilities can contribute, and Medicaid makes that possible. It covers services that many private insurers don't. It helps people make it out of bed and provides safe transportation to jobs. It helps them avoid unnecessary illnesses. It is not a disincentive for people with disabilities to work; having the support of Medicaid is what makes it possible for disabled folks to work.  Across the country, there are millions of kids with special needs who rely on Medicaid every day for services--behavioral care services, mental health services. Mom or dad might have good insurance through work, but private plans don't always cover the care those vulnerable kids need.  The PRESIDING The Senator's time has expired.

14655,topic-id,384,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.1005, a bill which would provide no-cost medical model adult day healthcare at State Veterans Homes to veterans who are 70 percent or more service-connected disabled.  This bill is an extension to the Veterans Benefits, Healthcare, and Information Technology Act of 2006, which currently provides no-cost nursing home care at any State Veterans Home to veterans who are 70 percent or more service-connected disabled.  Medical model adult day healthcare provides comprehensive medical, nursing, and personal care services combined with engaging social activities for physically or cognitively impaired adults. Medical model adult day healthcare offers a complete array of rehabilitative therapies, including physical, occupational, and speech therapies, hospice and palliative care, social work, spiritual, nutritional counseling, and therapeutic recreation.  The program is designed to promote socialization and stimulation and maximize the participant's independence while enhancing their quality of life. The program is staffed by a team of multidisciplinary healthcare professionals who evaluate each participant and customize an individualized plan of care specific to their health and social needs.  Adult day healthcare is an alternative care setting that can allow some veterans who require long-term care services to remain in their homes rather than be institutionalized in a nursing home. Such veterans typically require support for some, but not all, activities of daily living--ADLs--such as bathing, dressing, or feeding. In many cases, a spouse or other family member may provide the veteran with much of their care, but they require additional support for some of the veteran's By filling these gaps, adult day healthcare can allow these veterans to remain in their homes and communities for additional months or even years and thereby lower the financial cost of caring for these heroes.  Adult day healthcare also provides family caregivers support and relief. Adult day healthcare programs can help caregivers to meet their other professional and family obligations or provide a well-deserved respite while their loved ones are participating in the program.  I would like to thank Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz for their leadership and support on this issue. Also, I would like to thank the House Veterans' Affairs Committee and the great staff for recognizing the need for this critical legislation.
