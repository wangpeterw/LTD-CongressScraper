                   HUMAN TRAFFICKING AWARENESS MONTH

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, as we observe Human Trafficking 
Awareness Month, I would like to recognize organizations in my home 
district of Miami that are working to put an end to this modern day 
slavery.
  As a tourist destination and a gateway to the Americas, south Florida 
is a preferred spot for criminals to commit these types of outrageous 
human rights violations. But thanks to organizations like Kristi House 
and The Women's Fund of Miami-Dade, there is a critical campaign afoot 
to bring public awareness and to stop this terrible scourge.
  St. Thomas University has created the Human Trafficking Academy, 
which offers training and technical assistance to law enforcement, 
lawyers, and the general public.
  Resources like the Human Trafficking Miami Hotline, led by our 
esteemed Miami-Dade State attorney's office, serves victims and 
survivors of human trafficking by encouraging calls to 305-350-5567.
  We are also blessed to have devoted law enforcement officers who are 
committed to a zero tolerance campaign to protect victims, to prosecute 
and dismantle traffickers.
  As you can see, Mr. Speaker, south Florida is dedicated to fighting 
this crime. A future free of human trafficking is out there, and I urge 
every American to make that a reality.
