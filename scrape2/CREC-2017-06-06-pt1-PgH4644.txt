    RECOGNIZING LIONS CLUBS INTERNATIONAL ON IT'S 100TH ANNIVERSARY

  (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 100th 
anniversary of Lions Clubs International, the largest service club 
organization in the world. With more than 46,000 clubs and 1.4 million 
members, including 31 clubs and over 1,100 members in my home State of 
Rhode Island, Lions Club members are transforming lives through 
dedicated service to communities across the country and around the 
world.
  Since 1917, Lions Club members have dedicated themselves to living up 
to founder Melvin Jones' inspiring words: ``You can't get very far 
until you start doing something for somebody else.''
  In Rhode Island, Lions Club members have transformed the lives of 
visually impaired and blind Rhode Islanders by hosting Camp Mauchatea 
for children and working to expand access to high-quality, affordable 
vision care. The incredible support of Rhode Island Lions for the 
Ronald McDonald House has unquestionably saved lives, and their efforts 
to raise awareness of the need for foster parents, offer scholarships, 
and so much more have made a real difference.
  So on behalf of the people of Rhode Island, it is my privilege to 
honor Lions Clubs International for their century of service.
