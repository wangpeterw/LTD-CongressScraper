                    WELCOMING PASTOR KENNETH CODNER

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome 
Pastor Kenneth Codner to the House of Representatives as today's guest 
chaplain.
  Pastor Codner is a native of Owego, New York, and he graduated from 
Alfred Agricultural and Technical College in 1973.
  A couple of years later, through the help of a coworker, he trusted 
the Lord Jesus Christ as his personal savior. And he had a desire to 
make his life count for God.
  In 1976, he enrolled in the Bible program at Tennessee Temple 
University. Two years later, he transferred to North Star Bible 
Institute in Rochester, New York, graduating in 1983, with a degree in 
theology.
  In June 1983, he moved to Kansas to be the pastor of the Gove Bible 
Baptist Church, serving there for 17 years.
  He is married to Eileen Garrison, and God blessed their union with 
five wonderful children.
  In September of 2000, they moved to Bellefonte, Pennsylvania. In 
2002, he founded the Grace Baptist Church, where he has served as 
pastor ever since.
  Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to have Pastor Codner and his family here 
today.
