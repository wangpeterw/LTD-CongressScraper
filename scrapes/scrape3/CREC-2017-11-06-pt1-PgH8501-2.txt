              ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER TRAGEDY HERE IN AMERICA

  (Mr. JEFFRIES asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, another day, another tragedy here in 
America. These are difficult times in this country, and it seems that 
we have spent the last several months careening from one tragedy to the 
next: from the congressional baseball shooting to Charlottesville, from 
Charlottesville to Las Vegas, from Las Vegas to the terrorist attack in 
New York, from the terrorist attack in New York to a mass shooting at a 
Baptist Church in south Texas.
  Something is wrong here in America, yet all we seem to do is to come 
to Congress, have a respectful moment of silence, and then move on as 
if everything is okay. It is not okay.
  It is time for this ``do-nothing Congress'' to do something, do 
anything to help stop the carnage that is taking place in our great 
country.
