                  HONORING ANGELA McQUEEN, A TRUE HERO

  (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Angela McQueen, whose 
actions saved the lives of Mattoon High School students after a student 
gunman opened fire in the cafeteria. Angela tackled the student, 
eventually disarming and holding the assailant on the ground until 
police arrived.
  Angela taught math and physical education in Mattoon, Illinois, for 
over a decade. She is an Illinois native and graduated from Marshall 
High School, where she was a standout high school basketball player. 
She then attended Eastern Illinois University, earning a bachelor's 
degree in mathematics and physical education and her master's in 
education administration.
  Angela became a teacher because she wanted a platform to be able to 
make the world a better place. She is highly involved in the Mattoon 
community and is a member of B.I.O.N.I.C., Believe It Or Not I Care 
teacher's program, founded in 2014 and funded by the Rotary Club. She 
is also part of the school's grief support research team.
  I honor Angela McQueen's dedication to her students' safety and her 
courageous actions in the face of adversity. If she had not selflessly 
acted, the situation could have been much worse.
  Mr. Speaker, Angela McQueen is a true hero and deserves nothing less 
than our highest admiration.
