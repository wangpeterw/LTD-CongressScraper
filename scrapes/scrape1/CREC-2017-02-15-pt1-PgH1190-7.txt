                    RECOGNIZING AMERICAN HEART MONTH

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, as our Nation celebrates American 
Heart Month, I want to highlight the groups and individuals working to 
ensure that south Florida is filled with healthy hearts.
  Organizations like the Ft. Lauderdale-Miami chapter of the American 
Heart Association work tirelessly every day to raise awareness and 
support patients, as well as caregivers. The members will be hosting 
the Miami Heart and Stroke Ball to help fund lifesaving research and 
prevention programs in our community.
  I would also like to recognize the medical researchers, the doctors, 
and the nurses at the Miami Cardiac and Vascular Institute and so many 
other medical centers that are working to pioneer innovative treatments 
that save lives in south Florida every day.
  This American Heart Month, let us unite as a community to promote 
exercise, healthy eating habits, and frequent checkups to ensure that 
south Florida is heart-healthy throughout the entire year.
