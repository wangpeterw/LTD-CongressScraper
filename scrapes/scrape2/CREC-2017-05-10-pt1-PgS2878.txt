                          NOMINATION OBJECTION

  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am placing a hold on the nomination 
of Sigal Mandelker to be Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism 
and Financial Intelligence. I will maintain that hold until the 
Treasury Department provides the Senate Intelligence Committee and 
Senate Finance Committee information and documents related to Russia 
and its financial dealings with President Trump and his associates. As 
announced by Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Warner on 
Tuesday, May 9; the Intelligence Committee has made a request to the 
Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, FinCEN.
  I have stated repeatedly that we must follow the money if we are 
going to get to the bottom of how Russia has attacked our democracy. 
That means thoroughly reviewing any information that relates to 
financial connections between Russia and President Trump and his 
associates, whether direct or laundered through hidden or illicit 
transactions.
  The office which Ms. Mandelker is nominated to head is responsible 
for much of this information. The Office of Terrorism and Financial 
Intelligence marshals the Treasury Department's intelligence and 
enforcement functions to combat financial crimes and threats, including 
money laundering.
