                         SENATE ACCOMPLISHMENTS

  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly today about 
the year we have had here in Washington, DC.
  At times along the way, it wasn't easy. There were more than one or 
two bumps in the road, and there were times when we got discouraged 
because we weren't able to accomplish everything we wanted to 
accomplish on the part of the American people. But looking back, I am 
proud of what we were able to get done.
  The first thing is to notice the speed with which President Trump was 
able to nominate and we were able to confirm Federal judges. Everyone 
remembers last January when President

[[Page S8194]]

Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court. This was an 
excellent choice. He is an experienced Federal judge and accomplished 
scholar who understands the proper role of a judge under our 
Constitution.
  I think the weather and my sinuses are not cooperating here at this 
moment.
  I will be back later.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
