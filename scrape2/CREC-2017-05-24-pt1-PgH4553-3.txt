                      OUR VETERANS ARE REAL HEROES

  (Mr. BISHOP of Michigan asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank our brave 
servicemen and -women who have put their lives on the line every day to 
protect us. Since the founding of our Nation, millions of Americans 
have proudly served and sacrificed in preservation of our democracy.
  Our veterans have paid a tremendous price to defend our freedom, yet 
leaving the battlefield does not always mean their battles are over. It 
is, therefore, our duty as a nation to ensure that our servicemembers 
are properly and respectfully cared for when they return home.
  Our veterans are real-life heroes living quietly among us. They are 
the patriots who were willing to give up everything--everything they 
had--for their God, their country, and for one another.
  The Holy Scripture tells us, in John 15:13: ``Greater love hath no 
man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.'' This 
weekend, let's call to mind all those who have made the ultimate 
sacrifice. It is because of their valor, strength, and bravery that I 
stand here before you today. They selflessly put their lives on the 
line to fight for us, and I am proud to continue fighting for them.
  Our men and women of the military represent the very best of America. 
On behalf of Michigan's Eighth Congressional District, we are eternally 
grateful for their service.
  Happy and safe Memorial Day weekend.
