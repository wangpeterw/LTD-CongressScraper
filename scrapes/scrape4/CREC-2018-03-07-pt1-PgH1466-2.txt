  RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF THE YMCA IN COMMUNITIES NATIONWIDE

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak 
about an institution that influences our Nation's culture and helps our 
people and communities to learn, grow, and thrive.
  That organization is the YMCA. The Y engages more than 10,000 
neighborhoods across the United States. By nurturing the potential of 
every child and teen, improving the Nation's health and well-being, and 
supporting and serving its neighbors, the Y ensures that everyone has 
the opportunity to become healthier, more confident, connected, and 
secure.
  The Y was founded in 1844 in London by George Williams. He organized 
the first Young Men's Christian Association meeting: a refuge of Bible 
study and prayer for young men seeking escape from the dangers of life 
on the streets. The fellowship and sense of community was compelling.
  Years later, Thomas Valentine Sullivan was inspired by the stories of 
the Y and founded the first U.S. YMCA in Boston in 1851. Since then, 
the Y has been strengthening communities across the Nation. It brings 
people together, regardless of age, income, or background, and helps 
everyone reach their full potential. For that, Mr. Speaker, I am 
grateful.
