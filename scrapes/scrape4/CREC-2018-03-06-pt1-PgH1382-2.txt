           SUPPORTING THE COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY REVIEW ACT

  (Mr. ARRINGTON asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Comprehensive 
Regulatory Review Act.
  As a former regulator at the FDIC, I can tell you that the road to a 
really bad economy is paved with seemingly good regulations. 
Regulations like the ones that came out of Dodd-Frank were intended to 
protect the consumer, but ended up creating more burden, more 
complexity, more cost, and fewer choices.
  By the way, it destroys relationship banking in rural America and 
districts I represent. The best way to protect consumers and weed out 
the bad-acting businesses is a healthy market with robust competition, 
transparency, and more choices for the consumer.
  The last 8 years gave us an administrative state in place of the 
freest and greatest economy in the world. We inherited trillions of 
dollars in regulatory costs, millions of hours in paperwork, and an 
economy that has grinded to a near halt.
  Let's continue to rein in the unnecessary regulations. Let's get this 
economy growing again, and let's make America great again.
