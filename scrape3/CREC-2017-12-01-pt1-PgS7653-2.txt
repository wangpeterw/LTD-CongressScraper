                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal God, You have truly been good to us. Even when we stumble and 
fall, Your mercy continues to sustain us.
  Lead our lawmakers to realize that the abilities You have given them 
are maximized only when they are used for Your purposes. Show them the 
best way to use their talents and opportunities to honor and serve You 
and humanity.
  May our Senators this day speak words that are constructive and 
helpful, bringing encouragement as well as vision to their labors. Give 
them the wisdom to know Your will and the courage to do it. Let Your 
presence be felt in this Chamber and everywhere on Earth.
  We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen.
