                                 ______
                                 

    SENATE RESOLUTION 391--CALLING FOR THE IMMEDIATE EXTRADITION OR 
  RENDERING TO THE UNITED STATES OF CONVICTED FELONS WILLIAM MORALES, 
    JOANNE CHESIMARD, AND ALL OTHER FUGITIVES FROM JUSTICE WHO ARE 
    RECEIVING SAFE HARBOR IN CUBA IN ORDER TO ESCAPE PROSECUTION OR 
    CONFINEMENT FOR CRIMINAL OFFENSES COMMITTED IN THE UNITED STATES

  Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself and Mr. Rubio) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:

                              S. Res. 391

       Whereas William Morales, leader and chief bomb-maker for 
     the terrorist organization Fuerzas Armadas de Liberacion 
     Nacional, committed numerous terrorist attacks on United 
     States soil, including the bombings of Fraunces Tavern in 
     lower Manhattan in 1975 and the Mobil Oil employment office 
     in New York in 1977, which killed 5 people and injured over 
     60 others;
       Whereas Joanne Chesimard, one of the most wanted terrorists 
     of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, was convicted of 
     murdering New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster;
       Whereas more than 70 fugitives from the United States, 
     charged with offenses ranging from hijacking to kidnapping to 
     drug offenses to murder, are believed to be receiving safe 
     harbor in Cuba;
       Whereas other fugitives from United States justice who are 
     receiving safe harbor in Cuba include Charles Hill, wanted 
     for the killing of a state trooper in New Mexico, and Victor 
     Manuel Gerena, on the list of the 10 most wanted fugitives of 
     the Federal Bureau of Investigation for carrying out a brutal 
     robbery of a Wells Fargo armored car in Connecticut;
       Whereas, according to the Treaty Between the United States 
     and Cuba for the Mutual Extradition of Fugitives from 
     Justice, signed at Washington April 6, 1904 (33 Stat. 2265), 
     and the Additional Extradition Treaty Between the United 
     States and Cuba, signed at Havana, January 14, 1926 (44 Stat. 
     2392), the United States has a bilateral extradition treaty 
     with Cuba;
       Whereas, in January 2002, the Government of Cuba deported 
     to the United States Jesse James Bell, a United States 
     fugitive wanted on drug charges;
       Whereas, in March 2002, the Government of Cuba extradited 
     drug trafficker Luis Hernando Gomez Bustamante to Colombia, 
     and Gomez Bustamante was subsequently extradited to the 
     United States in July 2007 to face drug trafficking charges; 
     and
       Whereas it is imperative that the Government of Cuba abide 
     by its extradition treaty with the United States and 
     immediately extradite or render to the United States those 
     legally indicted or convicted of serious criminal offenses in 
     the United States: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) calls for the immediate extradition or rendering to the 
     United States of convicted felons William Morales, Joanne 
     Chesimard, and all other fugitives from justice who are 
     receiving safe harbor in Cuba in order to escape prosecution 
     or confinement for criminal offenses committed in the United 
     States;
       (2) urges the international community to continue to press 
     for the immediate extradition or rendering of all fugitives 
     from justice that are receiving safe harbor in Cuba; and
       (3) calls on the Secretary of State and the Attorney 
     General to continue to press for the immediate extradition or 
     rendering of all fugitives from United States justice so that 
     they may be tried and, if convicted, serve out their 
     sentences.
