                  AMERICAN FAMILIES LEFT BEHIND AGAIN

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I guess for the second day in a 
row, this House voted for massive tax cuts for people at the very top 
and left behind a lot of working Americans. In fact, it gave permanent 
tax cuts to corporations and only temporary help for some American 
families. They said that the marketplace and corporations needed 
certainty. That is why those tax cuts were permanent.
  Now, we have a continuing resolution for 28 days of funding after 11 
months of not doing anything about it.
  What about the certainty for veterans that they are going to get the 
healthcare that they deserve?
  It is not a priority.
  What about the certainty for children who depend on CHIP?
  It is not a priority.
  What about the certainty for those families who are struggling with a 
family member fighting opioid abuse?
  All the promises ring hollow because they are not a priority. 
Corporations are the top priority. With this tax bill, and now the 
continuing resolution, the American people, who struggle every single 
day, are just not a priority. After 11 months of complete Republican 
control and false promises, American families get left behind again. It 
is a shame.
