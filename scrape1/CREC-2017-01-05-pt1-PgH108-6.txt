                     THE LEGACY OF PRESIDENT OBAMA

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, in an Associated Press 
article titled, ``As Obama accomplished goals, the Democratic party 
floundered,'' the disastrous statistics of the Obama legacy were 
revealed.

  The Associated Press analyzed:

       There's one number you will almost never hear: more than 
     1,030 seats. That's the number of spots in State 
     legislatures, Governor's mansions, and Congress lost by 
     Democrats during Obama's Presidency. It is a statistic that 
     reveals an unexpected twist of the Obama years.

  The Associated Press went on to say:

       The defeats have all but wiped out a generation of young 
     Democrats, leaving the party with limited power in 
     statehouses and a thin bench to challenge an ascendant GOP 
     majority eager to undo many of the President's policies . . . 
     but, say experts, Obama's tenure has marked the greatest 
     number of losses under any President in decades.

  When it comes time to the battle of programs, American families 
overwhelmingly choose limited government and expanded freedom over the 
alternative: Big Government and lesser freedom. This is clear with the 
failing of ObamaCare destroying jobs.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his 
actions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on 
terrorism.
  Congratulations to our colleague Congressman Ted Poe on his remission 
under treatment of cancer. God bless Ted Poe.
