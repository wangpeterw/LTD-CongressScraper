                        IN HONOR OF VETERANS DAY

  (Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of 
Veterans Day, which is Saturday, November 11. On this Veterans Day, I 
know all Tennesseans join me in honoring the brave men and women who 
have served in our Armed Forces.
  There is no greater sacrifice than to lay your life on the line for 
your family, friends, neighbors, and country. We must remember the 
great debt that we owe our veterans and members of the armed services 
who fight to maintain our freedom.
  To all those who have lost loved ones to war, we join you in honoring 
their remarkable service. Their courage is what makes the United States 
of America the greatest nation on Earth.
  Our veterans have sacrificed so much on our behalf, so it is our duty 
to ensure that their sacrifice ends when they come back home. I promise 
to always fight to protect our veterans and active servicemembers.
