     CONGRATULATING YOUNGSVILLE HIGH SCHOOL ON WINNING IRISH BAND 
                              COMPETITION

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate the Youngsville High School Marching Band for winning the 
48th annual Limerick International Band Championship in Ireland.
  The Youngsville Marching Eagles stole the show as they were crowned 
the overall winners in the band competition. The Warren County students 
braved blizzard-like conditions to bring home the top prize. Snow was 
piled high on umbrellas, hats; and even big brass instruments were 
coated in snowflakes. But the weather couldn't dampen the spirits of 
the musicians or the spectators. Spirits are also flying high for the 
proud parents, friends, and supporters in Youngsville, Pennsylvania.
  Mr. Speaker, the Youngsville Marching Eagles worked hard to fundraise 
to make this international trip possible. For many, it was the first 
time they traveled outside the Commonwealth, let alone the country. The 
band also performed in Dublin at the St. Patrick's Festival Parade, 
where they were named ``Best Small Band.''
  These Youngsville teens really dazzled the crowd, and I am so proud 
of their incredible international achievement. Congratulations to the 
band and Band Director Cindy Scheid
