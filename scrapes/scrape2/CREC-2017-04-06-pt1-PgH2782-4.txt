     day from Thursday, April 6, 2017, through Friday, April 21, 
     2017, on a motion offered pursuant to this concurrent 
     resolution by its Majority Leader or his designee, it stand 
     adjourned until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, April 25, 2017, or until 
     the time of any reassembly pursuant to section 2 of this 
     concurrent resolution, whichever occurs first.
       Sec. 2. (a) The Speaker or his designee, after consultation 
     with the Minority Leader of the House, shall notify the

     shall again stand adjourned pursuant to the first section of 
     this concurrent resolution.

  The concurrent resolution was agreed to.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
