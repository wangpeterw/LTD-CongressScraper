                      THANKING THE MAJORITY LEADER

  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, let me thank the distinguished majority 
leader for his generous remarks about my service in the Senate, as has 
been reflected by the last long number of years. It is heartwarming, 
and it also reminds me of how important our collective efforts are for 
the future of our country, our economy, peace in our time, and in 
helping ensure that we make our time here a positive influence over the 
opportunities that are available for our citizens to enjoy life, safe 
and secure, with good leaders and commonsense leaders. That is what our 
leader is.
  I yield the floor.
