      IF YOU DON'T WANT A TAX CUT, YOU CAN MAIL IT BACK TO THE IRS

  (Mr. BABIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, some folks in Washington are upset because we 
just passed the largest tax cut in American history. They think that 
this money is Washington's money and that politicians and bureaucrats 
should decide how to spend it.
  I couldn't disagree more. You and I know that this money belongs to 
the American people. It came out of their wallets.
  Under our new law, we put hardworking families first by helping them 
cope with the costs of raising children by doubling the child tax 
credit.
  We also help small businesses by cutting their taxes so that they can 
compete with foreign companies and create jobs right here in America.
  For those folks who don't think that they need an average extra 
$1,500 or more a year to spend, or who think that politicians and 
bureaucrats can spend their money better, I have a good solution: go 
ahead and drop your new refund check in the mail. Send it to the 
Internal Revenue Service. The IRS will be glad to take your money.
