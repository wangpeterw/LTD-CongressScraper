                       OUR DEMOCRACY UNDER ATTACK

  (Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, it pains me to come to this 
Chamber this morning to say that nothing was done as our democracy came 
under attack.
  We know Russia intervened in our Presidential election. This was not 
done in the interest of the people, by the people, or for the people of 
America. It was done to make America a vehicle for Russian interests.
  You know that, in 2016, President Trump said he hoped Russia would 
hack our former Secretary of State's emails. You know General Michael 
Flynn was forced to resign due to his

unreported contact with Russian agents, who he also had business ties 
to.
  Yesterday, you learned that the President had a contractor meet with 
Russian officials on his behalf to have a back channel to the Kremlin.
  Where is the transparency from the White House? How is it that Meals 
on Wheels is the enemy, but you turn a blind eye to an attack on 
democracy by Vladimir Putin?
  Russian spies have long attacked American businesses. Now they are 
attacking our freedom. You must investigate the Russian grip on our 
government. We must investigate swiftly and seriously.
  Mr. Speaker, this is on your watch.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas). Members are reminded to 
address their remarks to the Chair.
