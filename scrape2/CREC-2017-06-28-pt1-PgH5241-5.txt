  CONGRATULATING PENNSYLVANIA STUDENTS AT CONGRESS OF FUTURE MEDICAL 
                                LEADERS

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
five high school honors students from Pennsylvania's Fifth 
Congressional District chosen to represent the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania as delegates at the Congress of Future Medical Leaders.
  The following students were selected to attend the event which began 
Sunday and concluded yesterday in Lowell, Massachusetts:
  Donovan Brubaker of Boalsburg;
  Catherine McQuitty of Rixford;
  Hannah Mull of Genesee;
  Mackenzie Wilcox of Duke Center; and
  Sarah Zakrzwski of Tyrone.
  They were nominated by their teachers or The National Academy of 
Future Physicians and Medical Scientists based on their academic 
excellence and aspiration to join the medical field. Each of these 
dedicated students achieved a minimum 3.5 GPA to be nominated for the 
honors-only program.
  The event aims to encourage and guide the top students in our country 
who hope to become physicians or medical scientists. Chosen delegates 
at the Congress represent all 50 States including Puerto Rico.
  I wish these students the best of luck in their future studies to 
lead our country's medical profession.
  Congratulations.

                          ____________________
