                          GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

  (Mr. PEARCE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I was proud to just cast a ``yes'' vote to 
open the government back up.
  I would observe coming into the Capitol tonight that they had Members 
and staff all kind of in the same car line, so I just barely made it 
here for that vote.
  I have heard all day long that we should be funding the government 
for the full year, and we should be doing it right. In fact, we in the 
House have passed all 12 appropriations bills. They are sitting over in 
the Senate.
  If the Senate Schumer shutdown was desired not to occur, then all 
they could do is bring up those full-year funding bills, allow them to 
come to the floor, and we fund our military, we fund all of the 
healthcare, the opioids, and every other single thing.
  That would require the Senate Democrats working with the Republicans 
over there, and we saw 2 days ago that is not going to happen. Today, 
under duress, it did, but we are still facing the same problem. We need 
nine Democrats in the Senate to help the Republicans get to the 60-vote 
majority.
