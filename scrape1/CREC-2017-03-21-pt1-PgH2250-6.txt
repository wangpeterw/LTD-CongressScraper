                    COMMEMORATING ROSIE THE RIVETER

  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in commemoration of 
National Rosie the Riveter Day, an effort to raise awareness for the 16 
million women working during World War II.
  These women left their homes to work or volunteer full-time in 
factories, farms, shipyards, banks, and other institutions in support 
of our military. These brave women worked with the USO and the Red 
Cross. They drove trucks, riveted airplanes, collected critical 
materials, rolled bandages, and served on rationing boards.
  These Rosie the Riveters embodied the ``we can do it spirit'' forever 
connected with them by Norman Rockwell's iconic painting.
  As we mark the contributions and triumphs of women this Women's 
History Month, I am proud to join the effort and recognize these brave 
heroes with a National Rosie the Riveter Day.
  I am especially proud to represent a ``Rosie'' and Bucks County 
native, Mae Krier, for her efforts in advocating for this long-deserved 
recognition. Mae was a riveter on Boeing aircraft in Seattle. She was a 
builder of B-17s and B-29s, which went off to fly missions over Europe.
  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize National Rosie the Riveter Day 
and have the pleasure of welcoming Rosies from around the Nation here 
at the Capitol today.
