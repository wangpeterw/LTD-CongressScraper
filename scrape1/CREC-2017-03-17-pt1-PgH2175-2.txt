                          I CANNOT TELL A LIE

  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I am a proud member of the House of 
Representatives. Yet, at the same time, I am embarrassed that, in 
somewhat of a Felliniesque nature, we have followed down the rabbit's 
hole.
  Our current President suggests that President Obama wiretapped Trump 
Tower. Our President has the FBI and the intelligence agencies at his 
beck and call. He can easily make a phone call and know whether or not 
it is true; but, instead, he asks Congress to make an investigation, 
and Congress agrees.
  This is absurd. It didn't happen. In fact, his security adviser 
called the British to apologize for suggesting that the British were 
listening in at Trump Tower.
  Our Nation needs to be more like it was when George Washington was 
President. He was known to have said: ``I cannot tell a lie.''
  We need to be straight with the American people. Microwaves cannot 
take pictures or surveil your house. The past President is an honorable 
man and committed no crime. He should not be accused of such.
  I hope this Fellini movie ends quickly.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from 
engaging in personalities toward the President.
