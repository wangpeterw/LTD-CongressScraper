                 ALZHEIMER'S AND BRAIN AWARENESS MONTH

  (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, June is Alzheimer's and Brain Awareness 
Month.
  Alzheimer's is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, 
impacting more than 500,000 people in Florida, and 5 million Americans 
nationwide. It is also the only top 10 cause of death in America that 
cannot be prevented or cured.
  Beyond the statistics, finding treatments and cures for Alzheimer's 
is a deeply personal mission to so many people, including myself.
  In Florida, the Byrd Alzheimer's Institute at USF is one of the 
largest freestanding institutes dedicated to Alzheimer's research in 
the Nation. Their work brings us closer to cures and treatments every 
day.
  We are also making great strides in the fight against Alzheimer's 
with the 21st Century Cures Act. This historic, nonpartisan 
legislation, which was signed into law late last year, creates a 
national data collection system for neurological diseases. Better data 
will pave the path forward to better treatments.
