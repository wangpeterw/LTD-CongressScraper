                   THE CFPB--HOW TO KILL A GOOD THING

  (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, a leader must 
believe in the mission of the organization he or she heads.
  But Donald Trump turned this principle on its head by appointing Mick 
Mulvaney to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
  Mr. Mulvaney doesn't believe in the agency's mission to protect 
consumers. In fact, he once said that he doesn't ``like the fact that 
the CFPB even exists.''
  When he was a Member of Congress, he cosponsored legislation to 
eliminate it. Now, as Director of the CFPB, he wants to zero out its 
budget for this year.
  He eviscerated the CFBP's rules against predatory payday lending, and 
then dropped all the lawsuits against them. He halted its investigation 
into Equifax.
  As Senator Elizabeth Warren pointed out, you should not put someone 
in charge of an agency when they want to destroy it. He is running it 
into the ground, and we must stop it. Consumers will pay dearly.
