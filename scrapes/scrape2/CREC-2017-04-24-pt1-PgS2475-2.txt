                      NOMINATION OF ROD ROSENSTEIN

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, finally, one final issue, the nomination 
of Rod Rosenstein to be Deputy Attorney General, which we will vote to 
proceed on later tonight.
  I sat down with Mr. Rosenstein a few weeks ago and spent time asking 
him about his career, his views on the Department of Justice, and 
protecting the integrity of the Department. I came away with the 
impression that he is someone who is independent, who would stand up 
for the law, regardless of which party controlled the White House, and 
his career backs that up.
  With respect to the executive branch investigation into ties between 
the Trump campaign and Russia, Mr. Rosenstein committed to me he would 
appoint a special counsel to conduct that investigation if one is 
required. He has developed a reputation for integrity. He has promised 
to give this issue careful consideration. I believe, if he studies the 
Department regulations, he will come to the same conclusion many of us 
have; that a special counsel is merited.
  For those reasons, I will be voting for cloture this evening and 
voting for his confirmation.
  Thank you, Mr. President.
  I yield the floor.
