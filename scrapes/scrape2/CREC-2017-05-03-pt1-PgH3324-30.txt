           By Ms. KELLY of Illinois:
       H.R. 2331.
       Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       Article 1, Section 8, Clause 1 ``to provide for the common 
     defense and general welfare of the United States.''
       Provided that low income individuals without access to 
     computers primarily access the internet through their 
     smartphones, this bill would improve their welfare by 
     ensuring that those without computers have convenient online 
     access to their government.
