                 PRESERVING OUR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS

  (Mr. BABIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Concealed 
Carry Reciprocity Act.
  Our bill allows law-abiding citizens who are qualified to carry 
concealed firearms in one State to also carry in other States that 
allow residents to do so.
  Constitutional rights do not end at State lines, and this must 
include an individual's ability to exercise their Second Amendment 
rights. A recent survey shows that 73 percent of Americans agree and 
support concealed carry reciprocity.
  The current system is simply too confusing and, unfortunately, 
results in some concealed carry permit holders to unknowingly break the 
law and suffer arrest while preventing others from carrying across 
State lines at all.
  Our bill corrects this infringement on Americans' Second Amendment 
rights and allows concealed carry permit holders the ability to travel 
freely between the States, just like a driver's license.
  As a lifelong gun owner and fervent supporter of the Second 
Amendment, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bill and 
empower law-abiding citizens with the ability to exercise their 
constitutional rights as they travel across State lines.
