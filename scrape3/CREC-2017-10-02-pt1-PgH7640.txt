              SOUTH CAROLINA GUARD EFFORTS IN PUERTO RICO

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, our thoughts and prayers 
are with the families impacted by the massacre in Las Vegas. We are 
blessed with courageous law enforcement.
  I am extremely grateful to the South Carolina National Guard for 
sending nearly 150 engineer soldiers to assist Puerto Rico in relief 
efforts after Hurricane Maria. This was a devastating storm for the 
people of Puerto Rico, and they have been in our thoughts and prayers 
each and every day.
  These dedicated soldiers are part of a multi-State engineer task 
force with North Carolina, Louisiana, and New York Army National 
Guards. They will be assisting in clearing roads, debris, and working 
to reach areas that have been deemed unreachable due to the storm. They 
will also work on restoring infrastructure.
  As a veteran of the South Carolina Army National Guard and the father 
of three sons who have served in the Guard, I am grateful that our 
State is able to assist the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico in their time 
of need. On my visits to San Juan, I have been very impressed by its 
dynamic citizens.
  I am very appreciative of the leadership of South Carolina Adjutant 
General Robert Livingston, the experienced South Carolina Army National 
Guard members, as well as the leadership of Governor Henry McMaster.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forgot 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
