7189,topic-id,2707,"Mr.President, I am voting for Betsy DeVos because she will implement our law fixing No Child Left Behind the way we wrote it--to reverse the trend to a national school board and restore control to classroom teachers, to local school boards, to Governors, and legislators--because she has been at the forefront of the most important public school reform in the last 30 years--public charter schools--and because she has worked tirelessly to give low-income children more of the same kind of choices that wealthy families have.

7190,topic-id,536,"Mr.President, was there not enough time to question her? I wonder. We treated her just like we did President Obama's Education She offered to meet with the Democrats in They refused. She finally met with them in their offices.  Then she testified for 90 minutes longer than either of President Obama's Education Secretaries before our committees.  Then there were followup questions. We asked President Obama's Education Secretaries 53 and 56 questions; they asked her 1,400 questions. Then they met, and one of their Members announced that they all agreed to vote against her before she had a chance to answer the questions. What does that say about those questions?  She has conflicts of interest? We have a procedure for that, an independent conflicts of interest office, the Office of Government The head was appointed by President Obama, confirmed by the He has an agreement with every Cabinet member about conflicts of interest. He wrote a letter to us 8 days before we voted on her and said she would have no conflict of interest if she followed this agreement.  So plenty of time for questions, no conflict of interest. What is the problem?  One, her support for public charter schools. Some people don't like that. But 2.7 million children attend them. They were founded by the Democratic Farmer-Labor Party in They have now grown to 6,800 schools. They are the most effective public school reform in 30 years.  School choice. What is wrong with giving low-income Americans more choice and better schools? We have done it since the GI bill from 1944--taxpayer money following veteran students to Notre Dame, Yeshiva, Harvard, the National Auto Diesel Has it hurt the public universities, of which I used to be President of one? It has helped them. Then, more people went to private schools, and now more people go to public colleges.  Betsy DeVos has committed to no more Washington mandates. No more national school board, no Washington mandates for vouchers, no Washington mandates for common core, no Washington mandates for specific kinds of teacher evaluations with Betsy DeVos in charge of the Department of  One year ago, we had no Education I asked President Obama to appoint one, even though I knew he would appoint John King, with whom I disagreed. I promised that if he did, we would promptly confirm him, and we did. We asked him 53 questions, not 1,397. We didn't say he had conflicts of interest when the Office of Government Ethics said he did not.  I know my friends are surprised about the election, but wouldn't they be really surprised if he appointed someone from within the education establishment to be the Secretary of Education? Wouldn't you be surprised that a Republican President would be for charter schools? Are you really surprised that a Republican President has appointed an Education Secretary who wants to give low-income children more choices of schools? Are you surprised that a Republican President has nominated an Education Secretary who wants to reverse the trend to a national school board and restore local control?

These are times that call for bold leadership and bold action. Over the last couple of years, my observation is that we don't need new solutions. We have reforms for immigration, reforms for regulations, reforms for our Tax What we need is courage: courage to act, courage to keep our promises, as our President said last night, and finish what we started.  ObamaCare is a disaster, to repeat what the President said. The facts are undisputable. This isn't a situation where we have a leaky roof in need of repair. We are on faulty foundation, and it is shifting under our feet. If we don't act swiftly and decisively, the house will collapse.  Leadership is about courage. Leadership is about keeping our promises. We all owe it to the American people to act accordingly.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-01-pt1-PgH1403-3.txt,99999999999999,HIRE VETS ACT,2017.0,1.0,February

Mr.Speaker, you see, I grew up reading about soldiers of justice like Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth, Nat Turner, Crispus Attucks, and so many more.  Then, Mr.Speaker, I lived through the legacy of legends and civil rights leaders like Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Coretta Scott King, Malcolm X and Betty Shabazz, Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm, Maya Angelou, James Baldwin, and Fannie Lou Hamer, all heroes and sheroes that allowed me to stand on their shoulders, to stand with them to continue to fight for justice and equality.  Today, we stand up during Black History Month, as 49 members of the Congressional Black Caucus, 49 strong, making our place in American history as African Americans, members like the iconic Assistant Leader James Clyburn, who you will hear from tonight; Congressman John Lewis; Chairman Cedric Richmond; Congresswoman Maxine Waters, who serves as the ranking member on the prestigious Financial Services Committee; Congresswoman Marcia Fudge, the 21st national president of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority; Senator Kamala Harris, the second Black woman to serve in the United States Senate; Congresswoman Robin Kelly, chairwoman of our healthcare brain trust; and so many more who serve in Congress, and who served as mayors of cities, mayors like Congressman Emanuel Cleaver, Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence, and so many more.  You see, Mr.Speaker, we are a part of that history. We are fighting. And so I tell you, I end with one of my favorite quotes by Martin Luther King, Jr.: ``The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.''  Well, Mr.Speaker, it is clear that we are in a challenging time with the new Trump administration, and so I say to you, we are fighting, we are uniting in a movement to fight for our democracy.

7109,topic-id,1054,"Mr.President, the hour is late, or early in the morning, and my colleague from Hawaii is here. Before I leave the floor, I want to say how pleased I am to see the Senate actually debating the state of education in  I said earlier today when I was here that if you are born poor in this country, you arrive at kindergarten having heard 30 million fewer words than your more affluent peers, and if you are born poor in this country, by the time you get to the fourth grade, only about one in four kids is proficient in mathematics, fewer than that are proficient readers. What it all adds up to is that if you are poor in the United States, your chances of getting a college degree by the time you turn 25 are about 9 in 100.  I often think about that when I am in this Chamber because there are 100 desks here, and if we were poor kids living in America, the desks that would be occupied by college graduates would be the three desks that my colleague from Hawaii is sitting at in the front row over there, the four desks behind him, and then two more desks in the following row. Every other desk in this Chamber if they were occupied by poor children in this country, would be occupied by somebody who didn't have a college degree.  Sometimes people say to me: Well, don't you know that not everybody will go to college. College isn't for everybody. I find that when people say that, they are often talking about other people's children, not their own children. Even if that is true--and I do believe we should build a robust system in this country that is not about a college degree but is about acquiring skills and knowledge that can put people on the path to acquiring a salary that is actually worth something. In fact, the Presiding Offer and I have a bill together that would allow students to use Pell grants for those kinds of educational opportunities that may not get you to a college degree but will put you on the pathway to acquiring greater skills.  I think it is very important that we have a system where people are acquiring that kind of knowledge, but it also is true that it is, I think, completely at war with who we are as Americans; that there is a class of people in the United States, in the land of opportunity, who because they are unlucky enough to be born poor, are unlucky enough to go to schools that nobody in this Chamber would ever be content sending their kid or their grandkid to.  In fact, if we had the results that we have for poor children in America for the children and grandchildren of the Members of this body, I am sure we would all leave and go back home and fix this problem. We don't talk enough about the State of public education in this country. We almost don't talk about it at all.  We just had a Presidential election in this country where the issue didn't come up almost at all. I am glad we are having the debate, and I strongly believe that the person President Trump has nominated is ill-equipped to help the country overcome the challenges we face in public education and put us on the path we need to be on, which is a path that says that we are going to provide in the United States robust, high-quality early childhood education for every family in America that wants it.  We are going to have a system of public education in this country that provides a K-12 school for every single child in America that is a school that any Senator would be proud to send their kid. We are going to make sure that every young person in the United States, and maybe even people who aren't so young, has the ability to graduate from college or acquire the skills and knowledge they need to compete in the 21st century and do that without acquiring a mountain of debt that requires them--in the case of people graduating now from colleges in Colorado--to take 22 years of their lives to pay that debt back. It doesn't make any sense.  This is the land of opportunity. The gateway to opportunity is a high-quality education, and too many of our kids in this country in the 21st century don't have access to it. My hope is that when we get through this debate, we can focus on the work that is happening in places like Denver, CO, where we have seen, in just a 10-year period, a 60-percent increase in the number of kids who are graduating from high school.  I am the first to say that we have a long way to go in Denver in terms of making sure that a kid's ZIP Code doesn't determine the education they get. I said earlier tonight and I believe if we could say that every single city in America, every single urban district and every single rural district where there are poor children and kids of color going to school that we had increased the graduation rate over the last 10 years by 60 percent, I think we would feel a lot better about where we are headed as a country.  That is a fundamental challenge for this country. It is the most important domestic issue we face, and I hope this debate tonight, this 24 hours we are spending on this nominee, is not the end of our debate.  As I said the other day in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, I think it would be a useful exercise for that committee to spend the next year studying what is going on in public education in this country, what is working well, what is not working well, and figure out how we can work--the Federal Government can work--with States, local governments, and local school districts to provide the kind of opportunity that every kid in America deserves.  With that, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

7132,topic-id,622,"Mr.President, I am honored to follow my great colleague and a champion of education and consumer rights, Senator Durbin of Illinois, and to address this body and, most particularly, the Presiding Officer, who has contributed so much himself to the cause of education. We know, better than anyone, how important the Federal commitment to quality education is--not just a C or D education but excellence in education.  The American people deserve a Secretary of Education who embodies and exemplifies that commitment to excellence. Unfortunately, the nominee before us, Betsy DeVos, fails on every[[Page S798]]count to meet that standard. So I am here today to voice my continuing concern about this nomination, which is antithetical to the very mission of the Department she has been selected to lead.  She is unquestionably unqualified, unknowledgeable, unprepared for this job. She is unfit to run the Department of As hard and as unkind as that verdict sounds, we have an obligation to speak truth here and speak that truth to power, even when it is the President of the United States, even when it is a job as critically important as Secretary of Education--especially when it is as important as this job.  She is wealthy. She is a billionaire. She has committed her career to pushing for private school vouchers and unregulated charter schools. Having reviewed her full record, including her confirmation hearing and her responses and lack of responses to followup questions that my colleagues sent to her, I respectfully say to my colleagues: We should not approve this person.  She has committed her career to pushing for private school vouchers and unregulated charter schools, not to the public education our students deserve. The incoming Secretary of Education will face a myriad of challenging and constantly evolving problems that will demand a high level of leadership and guidance, from soaring student debt to faltering school and student achievement scores across the country, to the pervasive school violence and bullying that threatens so many of our students, to unscrupulous for-profit schools, profiteering off students and veterans.  Clearly, the problems, these problems and others, require a Secretary who will not just rubberstamp or approve the policies of special interests or delegate systematic problems to private schools.  The Secretary of Education is responsible for overseeing a budget of Federal spending over $36 billion--that is K-12 education funding--and $150 billion in higher education funding each year. In addition, there is a portfolio of more than $1.2 trillion in outstanding Federal loans. That is the largest consumer debt in this country other than mortgage loans.  The leader of this Department is responsible for determining policies that affect our neighborhood public schools. She is responsible, if she is confirmed, for enforcing key protections under a number of civil rights laws designed to ensure every child access to education. This job requires a singular level of intellect and energy, preparation, devotion to the welfare of students, parents, and, yes, educators and teachers. Our educators and teachers are the real heroes of our educational system. Our public schoolteachers are second to none in the world for their commitment to opening businesses, creating dreams, and enabling students to achieve those dreams, and those dreams will be in peril if Betsy DeVos is our Secretary of Education because she has demonstrated her disrespect for the enterprise of public education.  From implementing the Every Student Succeeds Act, improving education quality, protecting Pell Grant Programs, and reducing pervasive student debt in higher education, to policing the epidemic of campus sexual assault and protecting students' civil rights at schools across the country, clearly our Nation's chief education executive needs to be immensely qualified--not just questionably qualified--but unchallengeably prepared and well versed in these complicated issues.

7145,topic-id,2242,"Mr.President, it is pretty clear. It is pretty simple. There never has been a nominee for Secretary of Education as unqualified as Betsy That is clear to pretty much every Member of this body--not that every Member of this body is going to stand up and vote the way that probably their conscience suggests they do. Whether they like her ideology or not, whether they like the hundreds of millions of dollars they have contributed to all kinds of political campaigns or not, they clearly understand that this nominee, from her performance and her lack of depth of knowledge of education, is simply not qualified.  As many have said on this floor, based on her confirmation hearing, it appears she has a complete lack of knowledge as to what the Department of Education actually does. She didn't seem to understand the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which requires public schools to provide free and appropriate education to all students with disabilities.  I think that when I first ran for Congress some years ago--I assume it was the same for the Presiding Officer; I know it was the same for the ranking member from Washington State who sits here in this Chamber and who has led the opposition to Betsy DeVos--from my first days in Congress, every time I met with school boards, every time I met with teachers, every time I met with school administrators, with principals, they would talk to me about They would talk to me about school districts and the costs and their obligation and duty and desire to serve these students. Yet the designee for Secretary of Education put her hands up when there were discussions in the committee on the Individuals with Disabilities Education  It is astonishing that a nominee for Secretary of Education would demonstrate complete ignorance on something as crucial and important to public school education--to education as a whole--on this. It isn't her hearing performance alone that should disqualify her; it is her record. She has no experience with public schools at all.  The President of the United States has nominated for Secretary of Education someone with no experience in public schools at all--not as a teacher, not as an administrator, not as a student, not even as a parent. Her only experience in education is as[[Page S813]]a wealthy donor inheriting tens of millions of dollars herself. Her only experience in education is as a wealthy donor who spent millions of dollars advocating for for-profit--not charter schools like KIPP and Breakthrough in my State but for-profit charters in her State, the same policy that has ripped off taxpayers and failed students in It betrays students, and it undermines and fleeces taxpayers.  It is obvious that if she and her family hadn't donated $200 million to Republicans and to conservative causes, there is no chance someone this unqualified would ever have been nominated for a position as exalted, as crucial, as important as Secretary of Two hundred million dollars apparently is the price for the Cabinet slot.  So much for the President's campaign promise of draining the swamp. We see nominee after nominee, appointee after appointee coming from Wall Now we see a $200 million contributor has also earned a Cabinet slot.  Because of her crusade, more than 80 percent of Michigan's charter schools are operated for profit. She helped design one of the least effective charter school systems in the country in This matters to me because I know a lot about what has happened with for-profit charter schools in For-profit charters have failed in They have led to a charter school sector. Again, taking out KIPP and Breakthrough and the good charters that we have seen in Ohio, we have seen a charter school sector that has wasted taxpayers' money, that has funneled it to unaccountable for-profit companies, and that have been plagued by scandal after scandal.  I take that personally in Ohio because I know how students have been betrayed by this for-profit sector, I know how taxpayers have been fleeced in my State in this for-profit sector, and I know the devastation it leaves behind in less money, fewer dollars for public schools.  People call my State, regrettably, the ``Wild Wild West of charter schools.'' What a name to earn--Ohio is the ``Wild Wild West'' of for-profit charter schools. Students suffer as a result. Students in public schools, students in for-profit charter schools, and students in not-for-profit charter schools suffer as a result. The last thing we need to do is take the Wild Wild West model in Ohio or, even worse, the for-profit charter school structure and model in Michigan and replicate it at a national level.  This is important to remember: Of all the K-12 students in the country, public schools educate 90 percent of them, 90 percent of the students in this country. Betsy DeVos called traditional public education a ``dead end.'' Dead end for whom? She called traditional public education a ``dead end.''  Think of what we have done in this country. From 1789, when George Washington took the oath of office, up until now, public education has built this country. It has given all kinds of people opportunity, given all kinds of people a chance to get ahead. It has educated our children. We should be proud of our public school system.  We may confirm in the vote today a nominee who called a traditional public education a ``dead end,'' someone who has never worked in a public school, never gone to a public school, never been a parent of somebody in a public school.  She said she doesn't think that all schools that receive taxpayer dollars--whether they are public or for-profit charter--should be held to the same standards of accountability.  To me, one of the most telling moments of the committee hearing was when she would not commit to the same accountability standards for for-profit charters as she did for public schools. Do you know why? Because she knows her for-profit charters that she is so proud of don't live up to the same standards and that they are simply not as good. That is why she doesn't want accountability measures applied equally to for-profit charters and public education.  In Michigan, she fought a rescue plan for Detroit Public Schools that would have finally provided accountability for charters schools. She is against that. Why have lower standards for for-profit charters schools? Maybe that is because--I don't know about her investments. I don't think she has disclosed everything to the committee, but neither did Secretary-Designee Neither did Secretary-Designee I can go on and on. She doesn't want the same accountability for profit charters because it might hurt some of her investor friends.  She funneled $25,000--mostly inherited money--every day to legislators of Michigan until this accountability proposal was defeated. It was probably not $25,000 every day, but over time it averaged $25,000 a day to legislators in Michigan so she could have her way. Talk about draining the swamp. Yet she can't seem to come up with--this I take personally too--the $5 million she owes to Ohio taxpayers for violating State election laws. What is that about? She came into Ohio with a political action committee that she mostly funded and that she was involved in in a number of ways.  The Ohio Elections Commission and Ohio officials in a nonpartisan way found her guilty of campaign finance law violation. This committee was assessed a $5 million fine. Guess what. She quit putting money in this committee because she didn't want it to be subject to the fine. Our attorney general has not gone after her. He wants to be Governor, and he is a member of her party. I don't know their relationship or much care, but she is depriving our State of $5 million that she owes through this committee. Legally, she has found a way, with very expensive lawyers, to weasel out of it, to navigate her way through it.  The fact is, by any standards of decency, she owes my State $5 million. That could be 60 or 70 or 80 teachers. She cares about education. Paying a $5 million fine is probably like me paying 50 bucks. She is a billionaire, and $5 million won't break her. She will hardly notice it. But she is going to be in charge of the Department of Education, which collects student loan debt from people coming out of school making $30 or $40 or $50,000 a year, burdened with tens of thousands in student loan debt and struggling every month to make those payments. Yet she owes $5 million, and she just says: Sorry, I am not going to pay it.  Through this confirmation process, she will not even pay the debt of $5 million. Are my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle saying it is OK to nominate her and confirm her even though she owes this money to my State? She sent us a letter finally last week because I asked her to explain herself in the promise to repay taxpayers in my  She sent us a letter last week again refusing to take any personal responsibility for the legal action of this political action committee she founded. She chaired it at the time it broke the law, she paid the legal bills for it, but she wouldn't pay the fine that this committee owes, saying: I don't owe it.  Is that who you want? Is that the kind of person you want in terms of personal integrity, personal responsibility? I don't know how many times I have been preached at in this body by my colleagues on personal responsibility. But she will not pay her $5 million debt. Again, she founded a political action committee. She chaired it at the time she broke the law. She paid the legal fees for it, but she will not pay the money she owes that could hire 60, 70, 80 teachers in my  She spent millions pushing the same for-profit education model agenda that has ripped off Ohio taxpayers and shortchanged our students.  Most people in this country used to think that billionaires are not above the law. In fact, some people--3 million fewer than voted for the other candidate--some people voted for this President because he said he would drain the swamp. If billionaires are, in fact, above the law--if we are not holding Betsy DeVos accountable, it is hard to argue that billionaires are not above the law.  She is opposed by the disability community. She is opposed by the civil rights community. She is opposed by a number of people in the more legitimate charter school community. She is opposed by teachers. Even the National Association of Principals has come out against her nomination. If Senator Murray's words are correct about this--and I know they are because we have talked to them--this is the first time in history that the National Association of Principals has come out against a Secretary of Education.[[Page S814]]  I can't support Betsy DeVos because I can't look Ohio's parents in the eye and tell them she will not put profits ahead of their children's education. Our children deserve better than that.  In closing, I will come back to my comments about the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, about which she knew nothing or knew little. I think how could a Secretary of Education-designate, who prides herself on knowing a lot about education, how could she not know much about IDEA? And then it occurred to me. If you are running a for-profit charter school, you don't want disabled kids coming to your school. Why? Because it costs more to educate a disabled child than it does a child without any disabilities. It costs more because you might need more use of a nurse, a student aide, wheelchair accessibility, you might need special tutors. It costs more to educate a disabled child. A for-profit charter school doesn't want children with disabilities to walk through their doors or come in through a wheelchair through their doors. They can't make as much money.  This is how we do privatization in this country: Let the public schools take care of the disabled, the child with disabilities, because we are in this for profit. It is a little bit like The private for-profit insurance companies want the youngest, healthiest people in Medicare, the 65- and 70-year-olds who are active, who take walks, do all that. They don't really want the sickest and the oldest. Let taxpayers pay for them. That is exactly what her model of education is all about. Let the for-profit charters skim the cream, if you will; take the children who cost the least and are easiest to educate, but the public schools take care of the children with disabilities.  Let the public schools take care of the children who maybe didn't have as much advantage in life as Betsy DeVos growing up. Let the public schools worry about the kids who might be a little more difficult because of discipline and other issues and what is going on in their homes. That is pretty clear how she looks at the world and looks at this job and, most importantly, how she looks at education in our country.  That is what disturbs me. That is fundamentally why I oppose Betsy DeVos and plan to vote emphatically today, no.  I yield the floor.

H.1009 already codifies and improves upon the practices of the Office of Information and Regulatory My amendment strengthens the language even further, requiring OIRA to hold Federal agencies accountable for coordinating and consulting with State, local, and tribal governments before issuing new regulations. In other words, we are giving governors, local officials, and tribal leaders a say in the regulations that affect them. These local officials know what their communities need much better than the bureaucrats in  Unfortunately, our Federal agencies have a habit of issuing regulations and policies without consulting local and State governments. For example, we just need to look at the EPA waters of the United States rule.[[Page H1440]]  Historically, States have had significant authority over water management. Governors have worked with local and tribal leaders to set up their own laws and regulations to ensure that water is properly allocated, that water meets certain quality standards, and that water in their State is protected from misuse.  The EPA's WOTUS rule is excessive and burdensome because they disregarded the role of the States in crafting waterway regulations. The agency held no substantive consultation with State governments prior to issuing the rule, despite States' historical roles in regulating their water supplies, despite the State-level experts who could have helped the EPA craft a better regulation, despite President Clinton's Executive Order 13132 ensuring that Federal agencies consult with State, local, and tribal officials before issuing a rule.  Federal officials never gave State, local, and tribal officials the opportunity to explain how their States were currently handling the situation and how this rule could negatively impact their jurisdictions. Since the EPA bureaucrats barreled ahead without State, local, or tribal input, they proposed an overreaching rule.  This amendment would require the EPA and other Federal agencies to account for how proposed rules will affect impacted States, localities, and tribes.  The amendment under consideration simply requires Washington to listen to and learn from local governments because local governments are closer to the people. And the people of this Nation should have a say in the rules and regulations that are affecting their livelihoods.  In closing, this amendment is simple.

I have also had an opportunity to meet with her and talk personally about her vision of the United Nations and the United States' role in how she would conduct her leadership at the United  I must say, originally there was some concern because of her lack of foreign policy experience, but I must tell you, I was extremely impressed about her competency as Governor of South Carolina--the work that she did, dealing with some very difficult issues, including a tragedy that occurred in her State, as well as dealing with the Confederate flag and removing it from the State  She handled these issues with real professionalism and sensitivity to all communities, and during her confirmation hearing, she displayed a willingness to reach out, to understand more about world affairs, and to become fully knowledgeable in these areas. She[[Page S429]]exercised, I thought, a commitment and passion for the commitments that are important to this country--good governance, human rights, and democracy.  I was impressed during the confirmation hearing about her commitment to the importance of the United Nations and the important work that it does. The United Nations, as we all know, does do work as peacekeepers to try to avoid conflicts but also does an incredible job on humanitarian needs with refugee assistance, as well as the sustainable development goals that provide help to people around the world, increasing maternal health, reducing infant mortality, dealing with women's education needs.

I might tell you, she was very strong about her sensitivity that the United Nations has not been fair to one of our key allies, Israel, and she would be a strong voice to make sure those types of issues are dealt with and the United States uses all the tools at its disposal to fight against those types of bias and prejudice within the United  We have talked a great deal in our committee about moral clarity from our nominees, so there is no misunderstanding anywhere in the world that the United States stands for human rights, that the United States stands against abuses that take place around the world, and that it will fight for democracy in all parts of the world and support those causes through our diplomacy, through our development assistance, through our tools.  She was very clear about the moral certainty issue. Just to give a few examples, we talked a great deal about Russia and its conduct and what it is doing in the United States about the attack on our free election system. She was very clear about how outraged she was with that type of conduct--what Russia has done in Ukraine, its occupation of She acknowledged that Crimea is not Russian, that it belongs to Ukraine, and she spoke very strongly about defending Ukraine's rights and sovereignty.  We talked specifically about what was happening in Syria and Russia's support for the Assad regime and the atrocities that have taken place in that country, most recently in When we asked if she would characterize that type of conduct as war crimes, without any equivocation she said: Absolutely--that this was a matter that required international accountability.  I also brought up with her what was happening in the Philippines, one of our allies, where the President of the Philippines, Mr.Duterte, has done extrajudicial killings and how she would characterize that as gross violations of human rights. She agreed that type of conduct cannot be tolerated, that we need to speak to whether they are friend or foe when they commit this type of conduct, that this is wrong and the United States must stand up for our principles. I was impressed by the way that she spoke to those types of issues.  One of the more telling questions that we asked was whether she would support any registry for any subgroup of ethnic or religious Americans, and she said: Absolutely not.  We had, I thought, moral clarity in her response to some of the most important questions. I think all of us feel that she has the passion to represent the United States and our views well at the United  What was particularly important to us is how she would speak out to power within the United Nations; that she had no problem in dealing with Mr.Putin and calling his conduct exactly what it was and would not be intimidated by Mr.Putin saying ``Well, you need me for some other issue''; that we have to be clear that we will not tolerate that type of conduct that violates basic human rights.  She gave us confidence that, on behalf of the American people, she would speak up in the Cabinet room with Mr.Trump and the Cabinet as to these values. For all those reasons, it was a comfortable vote for me to support her nomination and confirmation.  I do want to relay the fact that she does represent the American story. She is a daughter of immigrants who came to this country at great risk in order to seek a better life for their children. She experienced some of the discrimination against immigrant communities as she grew up in this country and tried to participate in the business and political sphere. She overcame all of those types of challenges and is extremely sensitive, I think, to all the needs of  For all those reasons, I am proud to recommend her to our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I hope we will support her confirmation. I think she is the right person now to represent us at the United For all those reasons, I will support her nomination.  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

7147,topic-id,1165,"Mr.President, thank you for your leadership on this issue, and God knows, how many others. You are a force of nature. I am happy to be with you on this day.  I come from Delaware, and we have about a million people who live in Delaware, and they are not shy about telling their congressional delegation--Senator Coons, Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester, and me--what they are thinking. We go home just about every night. They get to tell us a lot of times in person. They also call our office. We have three offices in They call our office here in They send us emails. We used to get a lot of letters, but now mostly we receive emails, not too many letters.  I have never seen the kind of outcry, if you will, from the people of my State[[Page S815]]on any nomination. I have been privileged to serve. This is my 17th year. So we have seen a lot of nominations come and go, seen a number of Presidents come and go, but I have never seen anything quite like this.  I asked my staff to compile for me, through yesterday, the number of folks who either called us or emailed or sent us letters on the nomination of Betsy DeVos to be Secretary of  As of yesterday, over 3,700 people had contacted my office. That may not be a lot from That may not be a lot from That is a lot in I ask my staff to break down--let us know if we heard from anybody outside of Delaware: over 700. Then I said, for the folks who contacted us from Delaware with respect to this nomination of Betsy DeVos, how many were for her? Out of over 3,700--10. I have never seen anything like that.  So that means there are over 3,700 people in my State who raised their voice up against her nomination. Just because the numbers are like 370 to 1 against the nomination, that doesn't necessarily mean I should oppose the nomination, but it certainly makes me stop and think if I had been inclined to do so.  I rise today, not just as a United States Senator, but as a recovering Governor and a father, one who knows the value of public education from personal experience. My wife and I grew up--she in North Carolina and me in West Virginia, a little bit of Ohio, and mostly Virginia--we grew up in public schools. Our sons attended public schools throughout high school, graduated and went off to college, and we are proud of what they have accomplished. They are 26 and 28 years old today. I am very proud of what they have accomplished. I have a stepson from my first marriage. He lives in He raised a family, four children and his wife, and I am very proud of what he accomplished--again, a product of public schools.  When I graduated from high school, I was fortunate to win a Navy ROTC scholarship and go to Ohio I worked a couple of jobs while I was going to school and was able to become one of the first people in my family ever to go to college and to graduate from college. I spent five as a naval flight officer during the Vietnam war. At the end of the war, I came back to the United States and moved to There, thanks to the GI bill and continuing to fly as a Reserve P-3 aircraft mission commander, I was able to make ends meet and get a graduate degree in business administration from the University of  The 8 years I was Governor, from 1993 to 2001, I spent a big part of those 8 years focusing on creating a more nurturing environment for job creation, job preservation. Our Presiding Officer has heard me wax on in our committee--more often than he probably wants to remember--about a major job of government under State, local, Federal, is to create a nurturing environment for job creation, job preservation. In a family, you have breadwinners, people earning an income, making a way for themselves, for the rest, and our job is a whole lot easier.  One of the keys to that nurturing environment is to make sure the young men and women coming out of our colleges, our high schools, our trade schools have the ability to read, to write, to think, to use the technology, and to have a good work ethic and go out and be a good employee for any employer who might hire them.  Public education is personal for me. I have had this remarkable connection to it for my whole life. In our little State, I visit schools almost every week. We have a program called Principal for a I have been Principal for a It is from the State chamber of commerce. I joke and tell people I have been Principal for a Day in about half the schools in It is probably not quite right but probably 30 or more. I keep running into kids who went to high school and say: ``I was your principal, did you know that? Only for a day, but it was a good day.'' I learned a lot from doing that.  I mentored, for probably a couple of decades, a bunch of different kids, trying to help be a good role model for them and give them an extra person to be able to lean on and to count on.  Just recently, I was over at the school a couple of miles from our home at Mount Pleasant Elementary, which has a terrific elementary school in the Brandywine School District in Northern The Teacher of the Year there for the State was good enough to let me come by and shadow her for part of her day and see what a really terrific teacher does. During the 8 years I was Governor, one of the highlights of every year was the day I would host, in June at the end of the school year. We have 19 school districts. Each school district picked the Teacher of the They have the chance to have lunch--the Delaware Teachers of the Year--and just to focus on their school districts and their schools and their classes, what was working to raise student achievement and really be inspired by all of them.

I was going by a Wawa on Philadelphia Pike, just north of Some guy came by and he rolled down his window. As I ran along, he said, ``Don't vote for that Betsy DeVos.''  I said, ``Can't get away from it.''  But I hear it a lot. I hear the message loud and clear.  Many of our colleges have covered this nomination at some length. But I think it bears repeating.

If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. This motion to recommit is to defend ethical conduct throughout our government.  In response to the Watergate scandal, Congress created the Office of Government Ethics to protect against unethical behavior in the executive branch. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed into law a bill to strengthen the Office of Government Ethics by removing it from the Office of Personnel Management and giving it greater independence from the White                              {time}  1800  Now Congress is attempting to undo this vision of a strong, independent Office of Government Ethics at a time when we need it more than ever. This bill would put the Office of Government Ethics right back under the control of the White House, and that is why this motion to recommit simply excludes OGE from this bill.  We appreciate the need for strong ethical guidelines most strongly when people act unethically. Every day we witness this White House struggle with honesty and credibility. We heard the promises last night, the ones we have been hearing all along.  When you promise to create family-sustaining jobs by revitalizing American infrastructure and then we find out he means to do it with tax breaks to huge corporations and none of the regular guarantees that the people actually doing the work will be treated right and paid fairly, that is when you have a credibility problem.  When you promote yourself as a man of the people but then we find out you have stuffed your Cabinet with out-of-touch billionaire friends, that is when you have a credibility problem.  When you promise to fix America's education system but then we see you appoint Betsy DeVos to head the Department of Education, someone with no education experience, someone who wants to gut public education, that is when you have a credibility problem.  When you address Congress and promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act in a way that guarantees increased access, coverage of preexisting conditions, and that costs will go down but no one in America knows how you plan to pay for that, that is when you have a credibility problem.  We don't need a White House with a credibility problem. We need these promises the President has made to come true. We need a stronger economy full of family-sustaining jobs. We need Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare to be protected. We need to have an executive branch we can trust. This is our future, and we need to be smart about it. I believe that smart people trust, but they verify.  The problem is we do seem to have a President whose relationship with the truth is, at best, a nodding acquaintance. This is why we need a strong Office of Government Ethics more than ever.  Ronald Reagan was right; it needs to be an office independent of control by the White  We need it to keep our leaders from enriching themselves in public office, to keep our leaders honest, to help us trust, but verify that our elected officials do what is best for the American people and not their own pocketbooks.  We need it to ensure that our President is acting in our best interest with nations around the world.

In the 1830s--the early 1830s, to be exact--a debate started in Pennsylvania about public education, the culmination of which led to the enactment under State law of the Free School Act in 1834 in We have had a bedrock foundation of free public education all these generations. It is part of who we are as a  In our Commonwealth, even today with all of the changes in education and all of the change in policy over time, we are still a State where 92 percent of our schoolchildren are educated in public schools. That is the State we are. We don't have any for-profit charter schools, and that has been the subject of debate in this nomination.  We have, by law, public nonprofit entities as charter schools. It is a significant point of difference between what is law in Pennsylvania and what is part of our education traditions and what the nominee has stood for in her time as a private citizen. We will get to that a little bit later.  I wanted to start tonight with a basic assessment, and then I will go through a series of issues. The basic assessment and determination that I have made is that I should vote against the nomination of Betsy DeVos to be the next U.Secretary of The principle reason for that is her views on public education--what I believe to be a lack of total commitment to public education and what that would mean for the country.  I have heard from people across my State--urban and rural, suburban, Democrats, Republicans, all kinds of people--who have spoken with one voice against this nomination.

7275,topic-id,2549,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  We are here to consider H.1009. This is a bill sponsored by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.Mitchell). It is cosponsored on the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.Meadows) and the gentleman from Alabama (Mr.Palmer). We are also pleased to have the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Sessions), chairman of the Committee on Rules, as well as the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.Walberg) as cosponsors.  Mr.Chairman, I rise today in support of H.1009, the OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability OIRA stands for the Office of Information and Regulatory It has many responsibilities. It is a little known agency, but very powerful and very important. Some of its most well-known responsibilities are governed by an executive order. Executive Order 12866 was issued by President Clinton in 1993. The order was maintained under President Bush and reaffirmed by President Obama in 2009.  The OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act puts into statute the basic structure that has existed for more than two decades. The legislation also includes some minor adjustments for increased transparency and accountability. For example, agencies are required to provide OIRA with a redline of any changes the agency chooses to make during the review process. This allows the public to better understand how centralized review can improve the quality of rulemaking.  The bill clarifies the process for extending the time for OIRA to review regulations. Currently, OIRA has 90 days to review a regulation, but at the[[Page H1431]]request of the issuing agency, OIRA can extend the review indefinitely without notice to the public. Under the Obama administration, many rules were under review for more than a year with no explanation whatsoever. H.1009 requires OIRA and the regulating agency to agree upon the extension and provide a written explanation to the public, including an estimated date of completion.  The government works for the people. You would think if they are going to miss deadlines and be late and go beyond the current rules, the people who are involved in the rulemaking would at least offer a little bit of a written explanation. The bill also requires OIRA to update the explanation and estimated completion date every 30 days after that moving forward.  Another significant difference from the executive order is H.1009 includes independent agencies in OIRA's review of significant regulations. Independent regulatory agencies already submit their regulations to OIRA for the unified agenda and the annual regulatory plans. Under the Paperwork Reduction Act, independent agencies submit information collection requests, which is another way to say government forms, to OIRA for approval. For decades, experts across the political spectrum, including the Administrative Conference of the United States and the American Bar Association, have called for the inclusion of independent agencies in the significant regulation review process. Again, a good group there, the Administrative Conference of the United States, as well as the American Bar Association also asking for these independent agencies.  There is significant bipartisan agreement on including the independent agencies. In fact, President Obama's Jobs Council recommended including independent agencies in OIRA's regulatory review. Sally Katzen, OIRA administrator under President Clinton, said: ``For all practical purposes, the way executive branch agencies and independent agencies conduct rulemaking is the same, so they both should be expected to gather and use information on the costs and benefits of new regulatory proposals.'' She went on to suggest: ``Congress could adapt that approach for OIRA review of the analysis underlying independent agency rulemakings.'' And she goes on.  That is exactly what the bill does, which brings me to the last major difference between this bill and the executive order. This bill requires OIRA to report on what it reviewed and the results of that review. The Oversight Committee conducted an extensive investigation into the Waters of the United States rulemaking, also known as During the course of the investigation, it was clear OIRA was not conducting the analysis I think we should all expect. OIRA even shortchanged the interagency review process in order to meet the self-imposed arbitrary deadline.  H.1009 requires OIRA to issue a report on each significant regulation it reviews so the public can see exactly what legal requirements OIRA focused on and what OIRA found. H.1009 asks OIRA to consider: Did the agency technically comply with the requirement? Did it make solid effort to improve the regulation through the process? Or was the agency just going through the motions? These are very legitimate, easy, simple questions that we think can be answered.  Agencies are supposed to consider the public's comments, but what if the final rule is drafted before the comments are even reviewed? Perhaps the law does not explicitly prohibit that, but is it really an effective regulatory practice? The question is more than just whether agencies have simply complied. It is whether the agency is doing everything it can to limit the burden and make its regulations effective and easy to understand.  By requiring OIRA to make the results of its review of rulemakings available to the public, this bill will encourage agency accountability and improve the public's understanding of the rulemaking process. The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform approved this bill, without amendment, on February 14 of this year.  I again want to thank the leadership of Congressman Mitchell for doing all that he has done to bring us to this point where we are debating this on the floor of the I also want to thank Katy Rother for her tireless work on this bill. She has done an awful lot of work, working with both sides of the aisle. Hats off to her as well. Again, I urge the passage of this bill.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

Jason Chaffetz,     Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, House          of Representatives, Washington,       Dear Mr.Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has      prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.1009, the OIRA      Insight, Reform, and Accountability       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be      pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Matthew                Sincerely,                                                       Keith              H.1009--OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability ActAs ordered reported by the House Committee on Oversight and Government                       Reform on February 14, 2017                                SUMMARY       H.1009 would codify many executive orders and practices      of the federal government related to the process of issuing      federal regulations. The legislation also would expand the      role of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs      (OIRA) in the regulatory process and authorize OIRA to review      rules proposed by certain independent federal agencies.       CBO estimates that implementing the bill would increase      administrative costs to OIRA and federal agencies by a total      of $20 million over the 2018-2022 period; such spending would      be subject to the availability of appropriated funds. CBO      estimates that enacting the bill would increase direct      spending by $3 million over the 2018-2027 period and would      reduce revenues by $2 million over the same period. Because      the bill would affect revenues and direct spending, pay-as-     you-go procedures apply.       CBO also expects that enacting H.1009 could delay the      issuance of some rules. However, because of the large number      and variety of federal rules issued each year, CBO cannot      determine whether a delay in the effective date of some rules      would have a cost or savings to the federal government.       CBO estimates that enacting H.1009 would not increase      net direct spending or on-budget deficits by more than $5      billion in one or more of the four consecutive 10-year      periods beginning in 2028.       H.1009 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector      mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act      (UMRA) and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or      tribal governments.                ESTIMATED COST TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT       The estimated budgetary effect of H.1009 is shown in the      following table. The costs of this legislation fall within      all budget functions that include agencies that issue or      review regulations.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                  By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--                                                   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                     2018    2019    2020    2021    2022    2023    2024    2025    2026    2027   2018-2022  2018-2027--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                     INCREASES IN SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION Estimated Authorization Level.....................       4       4       4       4       4       4       4       4       4       4        20         40Estimated Outlays.................................       4       4       4       4       4       4       4       4       4       4        20         40                                                               INCREASES IN DIRECT SPENDING Estimated Budget Authority........................       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *         2          3Estimated Outlays.................................       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *         2          3                                                                   DECREASES IN REVENUES Estimated Revenues................................       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *        -1         -2                                         NET INCREASE IN THE DEFICIT FROM CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING AND REVENUES Impact on Deficit.................................       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *         3          5--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Note: *= between -$500,000 and $500,000.[[Page H1432]]                             BASIS OF ESTIMATE       For this estimate, CBO assumes that H.1009 will be      enacted near the end of fiscal year 2017 and that spending      will follow historical patterns for these and similar      activities.       CBO is not aware of any comprehensive information on      current spending for regulatory activities governmentwide.      However, according to the Congressional Research Service,      federal agencies issue 3,000 to 4,000 final rules each year.      Most are promulgated by the Departments of Transportation,      Homeland Security, and Commerce, and the Environmental      Protection Agency (EPA). Agencies that issue the most major      rules (those with an estimated economic impact on the economy      of more than $100 million per year) include the Department of      Health and Human Services, the Department of Agriculture, and      the       H.1009 would codify certain regulatory policies and      practices that are currently being implemented pursuant to      several executive orders. Those instructions require agencies      in the executive branch to analyze the impacts of regulations      (including costs and benefits), to coordinate with OIRA      during the rulemaking process, and to perform other      activities and analyses related to considering the effects of      proposed rules.                   Spending Subject to Appropriation       On the basis of information from OIRA and several federal      agencies on the cost of the rulemaking process, CBO estimates      that more personnel would be needed to produce additional      analyses and to perform other administrative tasks under H.     1009. CBO estimates that spending would increase by about $4      million annually and $20 million over the 2018-2022 period to      hire and train sufficient staff. Such spending would be      subject to the availability of appropriated funds.                            Direct Spending       CBO estimates that some independent regulatory agencies      would face an increased administrative workload under H.     1009 because, under current law, most independent regulatory      agencies are not required to submit regulatory analyses to      Some of those agencies, primarily the Federal Deposit      Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Consumer Financial      Protection Bureau (CFPB), can spend funds for such activities      without further appropriation. CBO estimates that enacting      H.1009 would cost about $3 million over the 2018-2027      period for the FDIC and CFPB to prepare additional reports      and analyses of proposed regulations for                                Revenues       H.1009 would affect revenues by changing the cost of the      operations of the Federal Reserve System, which remits its      net earnings to the Treasury; those remittances are      classified as revenues in the federal budget. The legislation      would impose additional administrative expenses on the      Federal Reserve to prepare reports and analyses for      Based on the cost of similar administrative work of the      Federal Reserve, CBO estimates those additional      administrative costs would reduce remittances by the Federal      Reserve to the Treasury by $2 million over the 2018-2027      period.                      PAY-AS-YOU-GO CONSIDERATIONS       The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 establishes budget-     reporting and enforcement procedures for legislation      affecting direct spending or revenues.

7289,topic-id,4490,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  I just want to simply point out that the bill does extend OIRA to review independent agencies. I also would point out, as I did earlier, the Administrative Conference of the United States recommended OIRA review be extended to independent agencies back in 1988.  In fact, the American Bar Association recommended OIRA review be extended to independent agencies in 1990 and reaffirmed the need again in 2016. They said: ``We strongly urge you to bring the independent regulatory commissions within the requirements for cost-benefit analysis''--I am going to just inject my own words here in the middle.  Cost-benefit analysis, isn't that something reasonable that we should all look at? That is not asking an agency too much, especially if they already have the information.  They went on to say: ``OMB review, and retrospective review of rules currently reflected in Executive Order 12866. . . . `'  Those are not overly burdensome requests. In fact, in 2011, Sally Katzen, the OIRA Administrator under President Clinton, urged Congress to support extending OIRA review to independent agencies, when she wrote: ``Our concern is that independent agencies are not typically engaging in the analysis that has come to be expected as a form of governmental best practice for regulatory agencies.''  It seems like a reasonable expectation to employ best practices. And all that bill does is--again, it does not interfere with independent agencies' rulemaking process or their policy decision. It simply requires OIRA to review the regulations to ensure these agencies are complying with legal requirements just the same as any other agency.  That is a reasonable request. That is why we urge its passage.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR (Mr.Tipton). All time for general debate has expired.  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5-minute rule.  It shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115-4. That amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as read. =========================== NOTE ===========================     March 1, 2017, on page H1435, the following appeared: . . . original bill for the purpose of an amendment under the 5-minute rule an    The online version has been corrected to read: . . . original bill for the purpose of amendment under the 5-minute rule an ========================= END NOTE =========================   The text of the amendment in the nature of a substitute is as follows:                               H.1009       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

7315,topic-id,367,"Mr.Chairman, this amendment requires OIRA to maintain records on each significant regulatory action reviewed such that it is easily accessible and transferrable when responding to congressional requests.  Unfortunately, in the last Congress, Mr.Chairman, the committee asked for the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OIRA--asked Administrator Shelanski for records relating to the review of the Waters of the United States, often known as WOTUS, and that rulemaking process. The administrator repeatedly failed to take the requests seriously, which led me, as the chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, to issue a subpoena in July of 2015.  Even upon issuance of a subpoena, OIRA resisted responding to the request, blowing past deadlines and being totally nonresponsive. We held multiple hearings. We conducted transcribed interviews. We had lengthy staff-to-staff conversations, but still OIRA did not seem to take the request seriously. I don't know how much money they wasted in time and effort to slow this process down and resist our being able to get the information that they said they had in order to make this decision.  It was not until the committee, myself, as the chairman, getting on the phone with the head of OMB, when I told him that I had every intention to hold Mr.Shelanski in contempt and issue a contempt report, that we actually received a full set of documents. This was well past a year since the initial request. You should not have to go through those gyrations whatsoever.  I will think the resistance was largely a political maneuvering--this is my own opinion--by the administration that did not want us to see how rushed, incomplete, and politically involved this regulatory review was. That is my own personal opinion.  But for those who are here and the future generations, it seems reasonable that they have to have their act in order if they are actually going to issue a rule. And if Congress asks for the underlying information, as Representatives of the people, that should be easily transferrable to Congress upon request.  That is what this amendment does. This is why it should pass, and that is what this amendment is intended to do.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

7215,topic-id,932,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  In a very short number of weeks here in Congress, she has already made her mark as a passionate advocate not only for her State, but in this important fight to protect access to affordable, quality health care, and she has been an extraordinary member of the Judiciary It has been an honor to serve with her, and I thank her for yielding and thank her for her great leadership.  Mr.Speaker, we are here to continue our fight to protect access to quality, affordable health care and to defeat  TrumpCare will produce higher costs for our constituents, forcing families to pay higher premiums, higher deductibles, and higher out-of-pocket expenses.  It also will provide less Americans coverage. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, 24 million Americans will lose their health insurance when TrumpCare becomes law.  Thirdly, it imposes a crushing age tax. TrumpCare allows individuals age 50 to 64 to pay premiums five times higher than others pay for health care, no matter how healthy they are.  It is higher premiums, higher deductibles, higher out-of-pocket expenses, 24 million people will lose insurance, older people will pay an age tax. And TrumpCare, in addition to all of those terrible things, shortens the life of the Medicare trust fund by 3 years and ransacks the funds that seniors depend on, particularly, to get their long-term care. And finally, the best estimates are that it will destroy nearly 2 million jobs in this country if passed.  So why is this happening? Why would someone construct a bill that does this?  Well, in large part, it is to finance an extraordinarily big tax cut, a tax cut for the wealthiest people in this country. The richest 400 families will receive a tax cut, each, of about $7 million. Then there are tax cuts for drug companies, insurance company  And to finance this tax cut, which totals $600 billion over the decade, in order to finance that, this bill robs 24 million Americans of health insurance, cheats seniors out of the care that they deserve in nursing homes, imposes higher premiums and higher deductibles on working families, and imposes a crushing age tax on older This is wrong.  And, you know, the President ran on a campaign of helping working people and being for the middle class. This piece of legislation is a gift to the richest people in this country and the most powerful special interests and a betrayal of the promise to work for middle class and working families.  I want to end, with the indulgence of the gentlewoman from Washington, you know, we talk about these numbers, and they are staggering: 24 million, $600 billion. Behind each of those numbers are real people whose lives will be affected by TrumpCare and by the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, individuals whose lives will be devastated, families who will be ruined because they no longer have access to the care that they need. In the richest, most powerful country in the world, this does not have to be the case, and I want to give you two examples.  Just this week I heard from Sara from, Woonsocket, Rhode She wrote to me:[[Page H2335]]         I am writing to you to encourage you to vote against the      American Health Care Act proposed by Paul Ryan and the      Republican My brother has developmental disabilities      and relies on Medicaid for insurance.       Experts who have reviewed this bill have determined that it      will ultimately cut funding for people like my brother, but      the working class in this country cannot afford the burden      that this bill would impose. And the wealthiest among us do      not need any more handouts from the Federal       Please vote against this bill.  I had correspondence, again, with another constituent, who talks about the important services that the ACA provided to her family. She was heartbroken at the death of her son Anthony who passed away on August 9 due to an overdose, and she describes Anthony as a compassionate and deep person who, unfortunately, like many Americans, suffered from severe anxiety and depression. To deal with his condition, he started self-medicating with prescription drugs. After returning home from a sober house, he, unfortunately, relapsed and took some designer drugs that he had ordered online, causing him to overdoes.  She called me just this week. Anthony's sister Cara also suffers from anxiety and depression, in part because of the post-traumatic stress disorder that she suffered after discovering her brother who had died. Thanks to the ACA, she is able to receive coverage for critical mental health services since her mother doesn't have coverage through her employer.  Like many of my constituents, Cara relies on the coverage she has gained, and she writes:       I am worried for my future without my support system. The      discontinuation of coverage would be detrimental to our      efforts to combat mental health disorders and the opioid      epidemic which continues to plague families and has been such      a support to my family.  These are just two examples. We have millions of examples all across this country of people whose lives have been protected and saved and helped because of access to quality, affordable health care. This will undo all of that progress. We have to do everything we can to stop it.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for leading this Special Order hour tonight so we can continue to make sure the voices of the American people are heard and we defeat TrumpCare and protect access to affordable, quality health care in this country.

7287,topic-id,706,"I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.[[Page H1435]]  Mr.Chair, I rise in opposition to H.1009, the OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act, yet another radical bill, part of a corporate agenda designed to eviscerate public protections under the Clean Water Act and other laws designed to ensure the safety of American families.  As the ranking member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, I have several serious concerns with this measure.  First, H.1009 would eviscerate the independence of agencies that are critical to holding corporations accountable and protecting consumers, such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Securities and Exchange Congress established these expert agencies with the express purpose of exercising independence from the policy whims of the White  Section 3423 of H.1009, however, would task the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OIRA, with a governmentwide review of significant regulatory actions, effectively placing this obscure entity as the gatekeeper of the rulemaking system.  Currently, OIRA only reviews a small portion of significant regulatory actions, allowing it to effectively allocate its finite resources to review the most pressing rules. But by substantially expanding OIRA's mandate to include every significant regulatory action, this legislation would simultaneously water down agency oversight while also subjecting independent agencies to the influence of the Trump administration, facilitating political interference in the rulemaking process.  One of the overriding goals of OIRA review is to ensure that the President's policies are reflected in agency rules. Greater Presidential control over rulemaking, particularly in this administration's hands, could have devastating consequences in terms of public health and safety. It would not only provide special interests with an additional tool for regulatory capture, but it would also allow the White House to substitute its own policy preferences for those of  As Senator Ron Johnson, the Republican chair of the Senate committee with jurisdiction over administrative law, observed in a report last year: ``Limits on the President's power over independent agencies--like the Federal Communications Commission--demonstrate the importance of maintaining the agency's independence.''  Furthermore, because President Trump has made the outrageous and unprecedented choice not to divest his business holdings, I am also very concerned that H.1009 would only serve to convert the regulatory system into his own personal investment account.  Robert Weissman, the president of Public Citizen, recently noted: ``The Nation's golfer-in-chief'' owns or brands businesses across the country that would be affected by protections promulgated under the Clean Water Increasing the White House's role in the rulemaking system will only serve to undermine what little transparency exists into the President's regulatory conflicts of interest.  The Government Accountability Office has reported in multiple studies that OIRA has not addressed transparency concerns that GAO has raised, and for this reason I offered an amendment.  I was pleased to hear my friend from Utah talk about the transparency benefits, but I offered an amendment to H.1009 that was designed to ferret out crony capitalism by requiring that OIRA reports whether a significant regulatory action would financially benefit the President or his senior advisers. That seems like a really sensible idea if you really want to get at the issue of transparency.  Very disappointingly, my Republican colleagues refused to make my amendment in order, really tacitly acknowledging their concerns with what this type of transparency might mean for the Trump administration.  Finally, while supporters of this proposal argue that it merely codifies executive orders that were issued under Democratic administrations, the reality is that H.1009 was drafted without Democratic input, contains several poison pill provisions designed to ensure its partisan and unworkable nature, and would only have been vetoed by the Obama administration.  As the Obama administration noted in the context of a veto threat of another antiregulatory bill, agencies already adhere to the robust and well-understood procedural and analytical requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act, and the Congressional Review  Passage of antiregulatory legislation to ``replace this established framework with layers of additional procedural requirements,'' the Obama administration cautioned, ``would undermine the ability of agencies to execute their statutory mandates.'' Because H.1009 does this very thing, I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.  I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.

So they, in 1970, celebrated what they called Black History  Now, 6 years later, President Gerald Ford signed legislation creating Black History When he signed that legislation, he said it was to honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of Black  The Association for the Study of African American Life and History is entrusted with the celebration every year, and it falls upon them to select a theme for each year. This year they have selected the theme which I think is very timely, ``The Crisis in Black Education.'' Having started my professional career as a public school teacher, I totally embrace this particular topic for this year.  Throughout our history, especially post-Civil War history, there has always been a focus on Black education. As we all know, slaves were not allowed to be educated, and, as a result, when the Civil War came to a close, there was this big push to get the former slaves educated.  One of the leaders of that push was one of my heroes, Robert Robert Smalls, though he was not allowed to be educated himself because he was born into slavery, used his God-given intellect to study the currents of the Charleston Harbor and to study the whistles that were used on the ship that he was working on as a slave. He decided that he could, at some point, find his way to freedom.  Because he learned those currents so well, and because he became very proficient at studying the sounds of the whistles on the ships, one night, when the opportunity presented itself, he absconded The Planter that he was working on, navigated the waters out of the Charleston Harbor, picked up his wife and friends, and sailed them into freedom. And when he delivered that ship to the Union soldiers, he was rewarded with his freedom and a cash award.  Robert Smalls, after the war, went back to Beaufort and, in 1867, founded a school to educate the newly freed slaves. He also participated as a delegate to the 1868 South Carolina Constitutional Convention, and in that Convention, he authored and got passed a resolution that created the first free public schools for all in  He turned his wealth--or his financial reward into great wealth. And also, he became a very, I would say, successful politician. He served 10 years in the South Carolina Legislature and a total of 10 years here in this House of  While he was participating in politics, Robert Smalls authored a piece of legislation that created what is now South Carolina State Therein lies a part of my presentation I would like to concentrate on tonight.  When South Carolina State University was created--I want to first get people to understand, there are more than 100 Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the country. Now, there is a difference between--we commonly call them There is a difference between an HBCU and what we call an MSI, a Minority Serving All HBCUs are MSIs, but not all MSIs are HBCUs, simply because the definition means that you must have been in existence before 1964.  We have had a lot of Minority Serving Institutions that have been created since 1964; to name just a few, Malcolm X College, Medgar Evers These are all Minority Serving There are a lot of Hispanic Serving Institutions, but they are not necessarily  The reason I point this out, because here in this Congress, in this body, currently, 19 members of the Congressional Black Caucus are graduates of Now, the reason I point this out is because I think it is necessary for us to understand the role that these colleges and universities play in our society.  I often spend a lot of time with friends, many of whom are graduates of HBCUs, and I knew Astronaut Ronald McNair very well. I have a good friend, a cardiologist, recently retired, David I also have a friend, a California businesswoman who I interact with quite a bit, Janice All three of these people graduated from North Carolina A&T State  I have talked a lot with another former Member, Carrie Meek, a former Member of Congress; her son, Kendrick Meek; former Congresswoman Corrine Brown; and the chairman of the board of Microsoft, John All four of these individuals are graduates of Florida A&M University, an These are people who have made significant and are making significant contributions in our thrust toward a more perfect union.  I came before this body several times the week before last highlighting some of the HBCUs that are in my congressional district. Of the more than 100 in the country, 8 of them are in South Seven are in my congressional district. I talked about six of them when I came before this body before. Tonight I want to close out my discussion of these HBCUs by talking about two of them, Claflin University and South Carolina State University, both located adjacent to each other in Orangeburg, South                              {time}  2100  Now, Claflin University was founded in 1869, by Methodist missionaries to provide education for newly freed slaves in order to prepare them for full citizenship. The university was named for William Claflin, then-Governor of Massachusetts, and his father, Lee Claflin, both prominent abolitionists and They provided a large portion of the funds needed to purchase the land for the campus. Claflin is the oldest Historically Black College in South In its beginning, it had a law school which was headed by former South Carolina Supreme Court Justice Jonathan Jasper Wright, the first African American to serve on South Carolina's highest court.  In 1948, under the leadership of its first alumnus to serve as president, John Seabrook, Claflin was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and It has always featured a strong music program, and the Claflin University collegiate choir performed at the 1965 World's Fair in New Claflin graduate and Kingstree, South Carolina native, Henry Tisdale has served as the university's president since 1994. Under his leadership, Claflin has thrived and grown to new heights. He has built Claflin to an enrollment of almost 2,000 students and consistently seen it ranked in the top 10 nationally for In 1999, through funds from the HBCU Historic Preservation program by this body, the historic Ministers' Hall was restored.  The auditorium at Ministers' Hall was named for former Chief Justice Ernest Finney, one of Claflin's most notable graduates. Finney graduated from South Carolina State's law school and would go on to serve on the South Carolina Supreme Court from 1985 through 2000, including 6 years as Chief Early in his career, Ernest Finney represented the Friendship 9, a group of Rock Hill students who were jailed in 1961 for a sit-in in McCrory's lunch counter. In 2015, Finney represented the surviving eight members of this group to see their convictions overturned--54 years after they were originally prosecuted.  Claflin is still affiliated with the United Methodist Church and offers multiple master's degrees, as well as a highly regarded honors program. For 148 years, Claflin has been a beacon of[[Page H1349]]hope and a place of refuge for those who desired a quality education regardless of race and/or gender.  Mr.Speaker, the final HBCU in this series is my alma mater, South Carolina State South Carolina State University has its roots in the Morrill Acts, the first of which was passed by Congress in 1862. The Morrill Act of 1862 created land grant colleges, a system of agriculture, science, and engineering and military science schools. One of the schools established under this law was Clemson But after Reconstruction ended, Southern States refused to admit African Americans to these institutions; consequently, Congress passed a second Morrill Act in 1890, which stipulated that Blacks must be included in the land grant system. Southern States had the choice to either admit Blacks to the 1862 institutions or create new land grant institutions which would be open to  In South Carolina, by the 1890s, White supremacists had gained total control over State government. Though the State was still majority African American, through illegal and violent intimidation, extreme voter suppression, and outright fraud, Benjamin Tillman was elected Governor in 1890. The Constitutional Convention of 1895 subsequently codified White supremacy and the disenfranchisement of African Americans into the State's system of governance. When the United States Supreme Court sanctioned segregation the following year in Plessy v. Ferguson, segregation was firmly the law of the land.  This was the context for the founding, in 1896, of the Colored Normal, Industrial, Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina, as South Carolina State was originally named. The State of South Carolina continued to resist but relented when land was acquired from Claflin University, and the campus of what is now known as South Carolina State University was born. It continues to be the only publicly supported HBCU in South  Now, I know, Mr.Speaker, that I have consumed a lot of time, and I don't want to take all of the time from my colleagues, so let me just close by saying this: South Carolina State's first president was a man named Thomas Miller who served as a Member of this body. Thomas Miller guided the school for several years. Notable graduates of this institution are folks like Benjamin Mays, the noted president of Morehouse  South Carolina State has a reputation as producing more African-American general officers than any other school in this country. I entered South Carolina State in 1957, and, of course, I was there during the turbulent sixties. It was my great honor to help organize the first sit-in in South You talk about grassroots. That took place on March 15, 1960. Now, I was jailed as a result of that sit-in, but it just so happens that sometimes good things can come out of jail. While I was there, a young lady came to bring food. I was so grateful for that hamburger she gave me, I married her 18 months later, and if all goes well, come June 24, she and I will celebrate our 56th wedding anniversary.  Now, when all of these cases took place growing out of these demonstrations and sit-ins, one stands out which I will close with. I mentioned Kent State in 1968, Jackson State, and South Carolina A lot of people have heard of Kent Few people know about the deaths of three students and the injuries of 27 others in an incident called the Orangeburg massacre that took place in 1968, all over the integration of a bowling alley.  Mr.Speaker, I am going to close my comments by thanking the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands for giving me this opportunity and the gentleman from Texas and thank them very much for highlighting Black History  Mr.Speaker, it is impossible for me to really share the real impact that schools like Claflin, South Carolina State, and the over 100 other HBCUs have had on our great country.

7364,topic-id,577,"Mr.Speaker, I rise to continue honoring HBCUs, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, for their significant contributions to our Nation's history.  While only 3 percent of our Nation's higher education institutions are Historically Black, HBCUs produce 20 percent of the African-American college graduates. Today, I recognize and celebrate two of the seven HBCUs in my congressional district, Voorhees College and Denmark Technical College, both in Denmark, South  Voorhees College was founded as Denmark Industrial School in 1897 by Elizabeth Evelyn Wright when she was just 23 years old. Wright studied at Tuskegee Institute and was a devotee of Booker She had previously led efforts to start schools for African Americans in South Carolina, which were always met with arson and threats of violence. She persisted in her efforts to offer African Americans an opportunity for a better life and, with Voorhees, created an institution that would stand the test of time.  Wright originally taught classes in an old store in Denmark, but, in 1902, New Jersey philanthropist Ralph Voorhees donated money to purchase land and construct a building for the school. A high school at first, Voorhees offered classes at this level for African Americans in the area.  In 1924, the Episcopal Church partnered with Voorhees, and an affiliation with that church continues to this day. The college began to offer junior college degrees in 1947 and 4-year degrees in 1962. While originally founded on the principles of Booker Washington to teach job and trade skills to African Americans, Voorhees now proudly claims to offer a blend of Washington's philosophy and that of Du Bois, who believed a classical liberal arts education was vital to the development of African  The college's recently retired president, Cleveland Sellers, is a Denmark native who graduated from Voorhees High Sellers went on to Howard University, where he became active with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, participating in its 1966 March against  In 1968, after returning to South Carolina, Sellers was arrested and imprisoned for supposedly inciting the confrontation between students and police that became known as the Orangeburg massacre, when police opened fire on students, killing 3 and injuring 27.  Voorhees' College's new president, Franklin Evans, previously served as interim president of my alma mater, South Carolina In that role, he successfully led South Carolina State out of a financial crisis. I sincerely believe that Voorhees College is well-positioned for the future with Evans at its helm.  Denmark Technical College, whose campus is adjacent to Voorhees, was originally a branch of the South Carolina Trade School It was created in 1948 by the South Carolina General Assembly and mandated to provide trade skills to African During the ``separate but equal'' era, Denmark Tech was one of the few opportunities for trade school education offered to African Americans by the  In the early 1960s, Governor Fritz Hollings and then-Senator John West led the effort to create the South Carolina Technical College In 1969, the existing trade school in Denmark was transferred into the system and the modern Denmark Technical College was created. Its total enrollment is approximately 2,000, 96 percent of whom are minority students. Denmark Tech continues to provide technical education and trade skills in its assigned region of Bamberg, Barnwell, and Allendale  Voorhees College and Denmark Technical College, like their fellow HBCUs, have made an indelible impact on their communities, South Carolina, and the They have provided generations of African Americans educational opportunities, and I look forward to their continued success.

7250,topic-id,623,"Mr.President, after careful consideration, I have decided to oppose the confirmation of Scott Pruitt, the nominee for Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, I have met at length with Mr.Pruitt, who is an accomplished attorney with considerable knowledge about environmental laws. We discussed many important environmental issues about which I care deeply--from EPA's enforcement of landmark environmental laws, including the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, to climate change and the Clean Power Plan, to protections from harmful pollutants such as lead and mercury. I also have reviewed testimony from his confirmation hearing.  In keeping with my past practice, regardless of which party is in the White House, I will vote for cloture on his nomination so that every Senator can have a clear, up-or-down vote on this important nomination of a member of the President's But I will vote no on Mr.Pruitt's confirmation.  The fact is Mr.Pruitt and I have fundamentally different views of the role and mission of the That does not mean that I agree with every regulatory action that EPA has taken. At times, the Agency has been difficult to work with and unresponsive to bipartisan congressional concerns, but the EPA plays a vital role in implementing and enforcing landmark laws that protect not only our environment but also public health.  Specifically, I have significant concerns that Mr.Pruitt has actively opposed and sued EPA on numerous issues that are of great importance to the State of Maine, including mercury controls for coal-fired power plants and efforts to reduce cross-State air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. His actions leave me with considerable doubts about whether his vision for the EPA is consistent with the Agency's critical mission to protect human health and the environment.  The State of Maine, located at the end of our Nation's ``air pollution tailpipe,'' is on the receiving end of pollution generated by coal-fired power plants in other Reducing harmful air pollutants is critical for public health, particularly for Maine, which has among the highest rates of asthma in the country. Controls for mercury, one of the most persistent and dangerous pollutants, are especially important for children and pregnant women. Moreover, there is no doubt that the greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change pose a significant threat to our State's economy and our natural resources, from our working forests, fishing, and agricultural industries, to tourism and recreation.  The opposition to the nominee expressed by Friends of Acadia is grounded in concerns about the importance of emissions reductions for lessening the impacts of climate change that affect this gem of a national park. The changes we are already seeing in the aquatic life in Casco Bay and the Gulf of Maine, for example, are cause for alarm. The incidence of Lyme disease in northern Maine and high asthma rates throughout the State are also linked to environmental changes that threaten the health and well-being of too many Maine people.[[Page S1217]]  These are among the reasons why I have voted to uphold the EPA rule governing mercury and air toxics standards from coal-fired power plants and the cross-State air pollution rule, as well as the Clean Power Plan to limit carbon pollution from existing and new fossil fuel-fired power plants.  I reject the false choice of pitting the environment against the economy because, for much of the State of Maine, the economy and the environment are inextricably linked. A strong commitment to protecting the health of our Nation's environment is critical for protecting Maine's natural beauty, the State's economy, and the health of those of us fortunate enough to call Maine home.  Due to my concerns about Mr.Pruitt's commitment to the mission of the EPA, I will cast my vote in opposition to his confirmation.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgS1216-3.txt,2121,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,15.0,February

7320,topic-id,395,"Mr.Chairman, first, I would like to note I do oppose the underlying bill. This bill would require independent agencies, for the first time, to submit their rules to OIRA for review.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would increase direct spending by $3 million and reduce revenues by $2 million. CBO also estimates that the bill would cost Federal agencies an additional $20 million in administrative costs for compliance.  The reason the bill costs money is because it does not simply codify an executive order as its proponents suggest. The bill would require independent agencies, for the first time, to submit[[Page H1443]]their rules to OIRA for review. Independent agencies such as the FCC, SEC, and CFPB do not currently have to get the approval of the White House for regulations they issue.  Congress designed independent agencies to be just that--independent. This bill would enshrine in law the ability for the White House to engage in political interference with those agencies.  The Consumer Federation of America sent a letter to House Members today opposing this bill. The letter said, inter alia:       H.1009 will jeopardize independence of agencies like the      Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Securities and      Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading      Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, as well as      other independent agencies because it will give the Office of      Information and Regulatory Affairs the ability to review      significant rules. Authorizing OIRA to conduct its own      analysis would not only add pressure from the executive      branch and add time and expense to that process, but would      also give special interests seeking to quash a safety      measure, for example, yet another avenue to prevent a rule      from ever being promulgated.  Indeed, one suspects that is the intent of the bill.  A 2013 editorial in The New York Times warned of the dangers of subjecting independent agencies to OIRA review. The editorial foresaw what we are now dealing with 4 years later: ``Subjecting independent agencies to executive regulatory review would not improve the rule-making process, but it would ensure that ostensibly regulated industries are as unregulated and deregulated as possible.''  It also said: ``There is no question that making independent agencies less independent is a bad idea.''  My amendment would take care of that by repealing that portion of this bill. I urge all Members to support the amendment.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-03-01-pt1-PgH1430.txt,1959,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,1.0,February

Just a little bit before that, my friend from North Carolina and I agreed on some real problems in terms of the process OIRA uses in the process of its mission. So it is hardly like our committee found or I found that OIRA is without problem.  I believe the bottom line here, however, is independent means independent.

7135,topic-id,317,"Mr.President, I would like to thank my colleague from the State of Oregon for his detailed, lengthy, and compelling remarks on the floor this morning about why he will vote against Betsy DeVos for Secretary of Education for the United You have heard from my colleagues last night, this morning, and for an entire day the concerns they have come away with from her confirmation hearing and the concerns they heard from their home State and from educators and parents, teachers, and administrators--all concerned about education in their home  I am honored to have a chance to add my few brief words this morning to explain to my constituents and to everyone in this Chamber why I, too, believe that Betsy DeVos is not qualified to serve as Secretary of Education of the United A simple question for any parent out there is this: Why would a parent want a classroom teacher who wasn't qualified to stand before that class and teach their children? Why would any community leader, civic leader, parent, or educator want a principal who wasn't qualified to lead the school building, to lead instruction, and to make sure that the school was moving forward in a good and positive way? The answer is that they wouldn't. Why would any parent, why would any business leader, why would any legislator want a superintendent for a school district who had no previous experience in public education and whose agenda was well outside the mainstream in education? The answer is that they wouldn't.  So I think the question before us in the Senate today is, Why would any of us want, support, or vote for a nominee to be Secretary of Education who has demonstrated a lack of grasp for the basics of education, which makes her, obviously, unqualified? The answer is, I don't. We don't. We shouldn't.  As we saw during her abbreviated Senate hearing, ",CREC-2017-02-06-pt2-PgS763-2.txt,1984,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,6.0,March

7080,topic-id,547,"Mr.President, I am going to speak only for a few minutes so that we can have the vote occur at 5:30, on time. I wanted to say that I am pleased to be here to support Governor Nikki Haley as our Ambassador to the United  The United Nations is at a crossroads and really needs someone who is very reform-minded for the United States to lead our efforts in that regard. That not only would benefit U.interests, but candidly it would benefit the world. She is someone who has shown that ability as Governor of South  She also has a clarity about her as it relates to representing U.interests. People on both sides of the aisle in our committee were able to recognize that her instincts relative to where the United States needs to be on certain issues--I think most of us understand that the United States leading on issues of human rights, leading on issues of conscience, that the American values we all hold dear and want to promote around the world are things that she has the ability to communicate and cares deeply about, and I think people were very impressed.  The United Nations has multiple issues relative to peacekeeping that have not been addressed. Sexual exportation and abuse by peacekeepers have been rampant, and things have not been done in that regard to curtail that activity or at least not in the ways that they should, and I know she is very passionate about that issue.  There is no question that she is not the most adept person at foreign policy. She would be the first person to say that. She has spent most of her time out of the country solely on economic development trips. I think where the United Nations is today is at a place where we need a really driven person who cares about our own U.national interests but also has the ability to break through the clutter and reform.  She has worked with legislators to bring people together, to make that happen in her own She has had an exemplary record in that regard. My guess is that is really the first effort that needs to take place. Over time, through the relationships she develops there, the travel that will take place, I am absolutely certain--especially with the drive that she has--she will develop some of the other capacity that I know she will want to utilize there at the United  I am here to recommend her. I look forward to supporting her. Our committee did so in a voice vote with only two dissents.  In spite of the fact that I am disappointed that we are handling our Secretary of State in a manner that is not in keeping with bipartisan precedent, and in spite of the fact that we[[Page S430]]are not going to handle that in a way that we should and could today, through a vote on that, I am appreciative of the minority leader allowing this vote to take place today, and I am glad she is going to be confirmed overwhelmingly as our United Nations  With that, I yield the floor.

He has contributed to the community in the fields of education and emergency services. Golden Valley County is located in the middle of Montana, and Lyle has been in the middle of events in the county for many years.  After graduating from Eastern Montana College, now known as Montana State University-Billings, Lyle began a 30-year career as a school teacher at Ryegate High A few years after he started teaching, Lyle began serving as a first responder with the Golden Valley County Emergency Medical Although he is now retired from teaching, Lyle continues to serve his community: he went on to become the director of Today he still serves in that role. As director, Lyle is responsible for training new first responders and getting them ready to be Emergency Medical The familiar saying ``once a teacher, always a teacher'' rings true for Mr.Golden Valley County Sheriff Robert Pallas referred to Lyle and his colleague at EMS, Mary Ann Schladweiler, as the ``staples'' of the program.  Golden Valley County is home to just about 800 residents. The rural setting magnifies the necessity of having great folks like Lyle and Mary Ann offer their time and talent in the service of others. Montana is a State blessed with many treasures, and the greatest treasure of all is the people.

The question before us is the nomination of Betsy DeVos to be Secretary of It is possibly the most controversial nomination made by our new President  This is an office which doesn't usually attract this kind of controversy.

He was the first to be appointed in the first term of President Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee--who is a friend of mine and whom I have served with--before his service in the Senate, was also the Secretary of  The choice is usually one that is bipartisan and largely supported by not only teachers but parents and administrators and education officials from across the United In this case, though, we have in Betsy DeVos of Michigan a person of some controversy.  Last Saturday, I spoke to the Illinois Education Association, a group of about 150 teachers who had gathered in Springfield, They have been my friends for many years. Cinda Klickna, who is the President of the organization--we have a relationship that goes back to the days when she was a classroom teacher--she now has risen through the ranks and heads up one of the major teachers organizations in our  Cinda is a true teacher at heart and really cares for students, cares for schools. She has devoted her life to it. She brought together 150 of her best teachers from around the State, preparing them to become more active politically in our State and  Naturally, they were tuned into this nomination of Betsy They have a lot on their minds these days with the selection of the new Nearly all of them have written me, sent me an email, or contacted me personally opposing the nomination of Betsy  I have not met Betsy We tried to set up our schedules so I could, but it didn't work. I take as much blame as necessary for that not happening. I have studied her background. I have paid close attention to what she has said since she has been nominated and tried to understand where she comes from.  It is true that she is a person of wealth. The Prince family, which she was born into, is well known in the Midwest and in Michigan for its success in the automotive industry and many other endeavors. Then, she married into the DeVoses of Amway, another legendary business, where she has been able to accumulate some money.  There is nothing wrong with that in In fact, many people aspire to it and reach that goal and are admired for reaching it. It doesn't disqualify her for anything in life as far as I am concerned, but it does not necessarily qualify her for certain things in life.  It is not clear to me from her record, when it comes to the field of education, that she is prepared to serve this Nation as our next Secretary of I don't find in her background qualifications for the job that I found when the Presiding Officer was chosen as Secretary of Education or when my friend Arne Duncan of Chicago, whom I had breakfast with yesterday, was chosen for the same position.

7252,topic-id,3897,"Mr.Speaker, we are back in session. We were out of session last week. It was great to get all over east It is just good to be an east Texan and from around east I had occasion to talk to a whole bunch of folks from part of my district, even tonight.  As I think about the headlines, I think about this group called Indivisible demanding townhalls, and I keep coming back to last Monday at Jack Ryan's restaurant in downtown Tyler Young Professionals had asked me to speak there. I knew the gentleman that had white hair and looked distinguished was probably not one of the Tyler Young Professionals but probably one of the Indivisible people, the Democrats that--yes, some of them say they are nonpartisan, but so much for that. But I knew when I called on him to ask the first question, he probably wasn't one of the Tyler Young  I offered to him, I said: Look, I give you my word. You come, bring somebody with you. Let's sit down at a conference table and I will hear you out. I will give you a chance.  No, he said. That is not what I want. I demand a townhall.  So I keep coming back to that answer because that seems to make very, very clear this whole Indivisible movement. It is not about being heard. That can be best done, as the Founders realized when they put together the Constitution--a complete democracy is where you have mob rule, that a majority is always going to prevail; but they figured out that, far better than having a big mob rule so you don't end up with lynchings and crowds convincing themselves to do something dramatic that they would never, ever do individually--it would be too much of a violation of their conscience. But there is something about a group dynamic that people can get whipped up into a frenzy as a group that doesn't happen when you sit down one-on-one with them.  So this has never been about townhalls. It has never been about being heard. It has been about headlines, trying to intimidate some of us from keeping the promises that we made to our constituents before we got elected.  I think God has a way of preparing us for what lies ahead. Had I not been a felony judge for a decade and been threatened by all kinds of felons, then I might have been at least somewhat intimidated. But it all seems rather interesting, this frenzy. Really good, decent people get in a group and get worked up into a frenzy.  One of them did ask an interesting question there in east Texas on the east Texas Indivisible Facebook page: Well, what would be wrong with sitting down with him on an individual basis or something like that? That individual understood that, if all we want is to be heard, why wouldn't we just want to sit down and talk.  What that individual didn't understand is Indivisible is not about being heard. It is exactly about what is in the Indivisible playbook, the The idea is to disrupt those who won with a majority of the vote in congressional seats and Senate seats, disrupt those who won with a majority and prevent them from keeping their promises.  It reminded me somewhat of what happened back when George H.Bush was He had run saying, ``Read my lips: no new taxes.'' I wasn't in politics back when he was running and saying that, but I sure got involved in late 1991, I guess December, and in 1992. I guess that was back in the 1988 election.[[Page H1351]]  It cost him the 1992 election because he kept saying, ``Read my lips: no new taxes.'' Then he had to deal with the majority of Democrats in the House and They kept luring, trying to suck him in: Come on, if we are going to reach an agreement, you are going to have to give up on that pledge just a little bit, just a little bit. We are not going to reach it. You are going to have to give up just a little bit. You are going to have to allow just a little bit of a tax.  After enough cajoling, they finally convinced George H.Bush that they were not going to allow the bill to go through unless he had at least a little bit of a tax increase. As soon as they lured him into that--kind of sounds like something that happened in the Garden of But as soon as they lured him into it and he agreed to a very small increase in taxes, then immediately the cries became: You are a liar. You broke your promise of no new taxes.  He got lured into it. He thought they were acting in good faith, when all they were trying to do was get him to break his promise so they could call him a liar. They lured him into it. They trapped him into it. He should have told them, ``Read my lips: no new taxes.'' But being a benevolent man, he thought they were acting in good faith, as he was, and he found out differently. It cost him the 1992 election.  So we have people demanding: Oh, yes, just give us the townhall. That is all we want. Just give us the townhall. They know and most of us, thank goodness, on my side of the aisle know, if we give the bullying mobs, what they are demanding when they are saying: We are going to harass you--as one man did--we are going to harass you at church, everywhere you go, until you finally give in, fine. No matter how big the mobs get, no matter how mean and frenzied they get, no matter how big of bullies they become, I know what I promised my constituents and I know what we have got to deliver.  I am starting to hear from people on my side of the aisle: Well, maybe we shouldn't repeal. Maybe we shouldn't do what we did in 2015.  Everything we did in 2015 was consistent with the rules that are in play right now. We ought to be able to do the same thing again. We should. We did it in 2015. We ought to be able to do it now--we just should--House Members and Senate We had a majority both places then. We have got a majority now. We need to do it again.  We don't have to have this huge government program as a replacement. That is the beauty of a free market. But in order to have a free market, you have got to have honesty and integrity in the system. That means nobody on my side of the aisle, nobody in the Senate on the Republican side of the aisle, and nobody in the White House should be intimidated no matter how frenzied the insurance lobby may become about what we can't do.  Those same people embraced ObamaCare, which was about to destroy them. Some of them said: Well, you have got to understand we had to have a seat at the table. I tried to explain, you don't want a seat at the table when you are on the menu. But no, they dove in. Big Pharma and those folks dove right in.  Now, I could understand AARP jumping in and endorsing ObamaCare even though it cut Medicare by $716 billion, even though it stabbed seniors in the back by dramatic cuts to I could understand AARP endorsing They were going to be able to sell more insurance than they had ever sold before.  I had seen 1 year before--I think it was 2007 or 2008--they had over $4 million in profit, which is pretty good for a nonprofit, selling insurance or endorsing the policies that were sold. So, of course, then you get to the deal in ObamaCare that all these other policies are going to have an extra 2 percent tax on them, but not the kind of policies you sell.  I can understand AARP getting behind ObamaCare, even though it did so much damage to the health care of seniors because they were going to make a lot of money. No telling how much money they have made since ObamaCare passed.  I couldn't understand health insurance companies. I couldn't understand Big I guess I could, because they were going to make tens of billions of dollars more in the short run than they had made in the past. That is why President Obama got them to offer to give billions of it back. You don't get billions given back unless you are going to make a lot more billions than you put back. I am sure they did, but that was short term. If ObamaCare continued into the future, it wouldn't be--probably within the next decade that you would see them heading toward their demise.                              {time}  2130  But the big executives would be fine. They would have gotten their golden parachute and taken off with all the money that appeared to be rolling in at that point, even though the day of reckoning was going to come for them down the road.  But we shouldn't be listening to people who sold out knowing they will make money short term, but it probably will destroy them long term. People who were guided by the mentality that embraced that bill should not be dictating what is in the replacement plan. And I say plan, because when you are going to use free market to have a better healthcare environment, you have got to have free market; and you can't have free market unless everybody knows how much things cost.  I was seeing again tonight from constituents, people think they ought to know how much a medical visit costs. Whether it is Blue Cross, Aetna, Humana, Anthem, whether it is an HMO, whatever, they ought to know how much that costs, whoever is paying for it. Whether it is the government--whether it is the Federal Government, State government, whether it is an insurance company, people have a right to know what a medical visit, procedure, whatever it is--they have a right to know how much it costs.  Only when we have truth in treatment are we going to be able to fix so many of the wrongs in health care. Then we can move toward a free market, where insurance will have a high deductible. This is the ultimate goal, I think, where you have a high deductible, but you will have every dime of that deductible in a health savings account either put in there by your employer or by you. In a proper program, it ought to be every dime of it put in there pretax, no tax on that money that you put in there. I still believe that every dime that is put in there should then be marked for health care only. If the person owning that health savings account passes away before it is spent for health care, it ought to keep that healthcare designation and roll over into the heirs' health savings account. And if there are not heirs or it's not in the will, it could go to a charity's health savings account, as I feel sure you would have every worthwhile charity set up a health savings account that could be used to have people donate from their own health savings accounts to help the poor, help those who are chronically ill.  As a Christian, I believe God knew it blesses us, it helps us as individuals when we are charitable toward others. That does not mean when the government, with the threat of the IRS, some SWAT team behind them, or some threat to come take your home, all of your assets, says you will give so that we can give to who the government thinks should receive the charity--that is not charity. That is not charity at all. That is a much too powerful government.  What we find is that the United States has been the most charitable country in the history of the world. We have got a lot of benevolent Of course, that doesn't include George He makes his money. It seems like one of the ways he makes money is if he can topple an economy, bring it down; and through all of the suffering that is brought about, he makes money.  When we heard tape recordings made in the past year by people who were saying, ``Oh, yeah, we funded the violence at those Trump rallies,'' or ``We funded violence here, there or yon,'' or ``We funded efforts to help bring down this activity or that activity,'' then it sure seems like that is worthy of investigation, because what you have when you have people giving money to create violence at events, some people would call that basically a racketeer influenced and corrupt organization, It ought to be worthy of investigation. If people are giving money when they[[Page H1352]]should know that money is going to be contributed to create chaos, get somebody hurt, then it sure seems like that is the kind of criminal conduct people have gone to prison for.  I hope our new Justice Department will continue its trend toward getting out of litigation that they never should have been in in the first place and getting in where there is corruption. We know under the Attorney General Eric Holder that as long as the people who were carrying billy clubs and threatening voters outside of polling places were Democrats, then certainly they did not need to be investigated, nothing needed to be done to them because they are Apparently under that old Department of Justice that was just about them, just us, then as long as it is one of us, we don't need to prosecute them. But, whoa, if it is a Republican, yeah, we need to go after them.  But the great irony is there could be no greater dissolution of the right to vote when then loading the deck with people who have no right to vote, who vote and completely dissolve law-abiding people's right to vote, you just canceled out their right to vote with illegality. So it seems strange to some of us that you would have a Justice Department that would say: No, no, no, don't you dare purge those records of the dead people. You have got to leave those dead people in. Some of those dead people may want to vote. It is important to let dead people vote if they feel like voting.  To have a Department of Justice that doesn't want counties to clean up their voter registration so that there can't be fraud, people that are dead, people that are living in other States or other voting districts don't come and also vote there. It just was incredible lawlessness to have a Department of Justice fighting against cleaning up voter registration rolls so that only people alive and living in that district could vote.  Why would anybody do that? Why would anybody fight against cleaning up voter registration?  The only reason I can think of conceivably would be they must still want people who are dead or don't live there to vote illegally. What else could there be?  I mean, there are some people willing to have the Department of Justice: We are even okay if you supervise to make sure we don't throw out somebody who is alive. But this Justice Department under President Obama's administration, they didn't want voter registration rolls cleaned up.  The lawlessness, thankfully, has come to an end. I know that there are people who have been stirring up fear in American hearts about Jeff Sessions, but Jeff Sessions is a good man. He is a good person. He will enforce the law fairly across the board, and I am grateful that we finally have a Justice Department that will be about justice.  In the meantime, I saw this story today from Peter Hasson from The Daily Caller:  ``Leaked audio from an anti-Trump protest group meeting reveals activists with anti-Trump group Indivisible plotting how to best manufacture a hostile environment at a town hall with Republican Bill Cassidy in Breaux Bridge, . . .  ``The audio, obtained by local radio station KPEL, reveals a coordinated effort to create the public impression that Cassidy's support for Trump is unpopular with his constituents. The activists, who describe themselves as liberals in the audio, can be heard strategizing how to best turn a local town hall into a political victory.  ``The activists split up into an `inside team'--tasked with occupying `as many seats as we can' and an `outside team,' whose job was to `give the media the coverage they want' before joining the others inside. Activists were instructed to dress like conservatives and leave at home `any signifier that you're a liberal' in order to blend in with constituents.  ``The leftist activists strategized how best to `dominate' the question-and-answer section of the town hall and keep anyone `sympathetic' to Cassidy from asking a question.  ``The audio also reveals the activists laughing about `the poor people of Breaux Bridge'--local constituents--who might get stuck behind them. Local news coverage of the town hall said that `many attendees were turned away' from the town hall due to `capacity restrictions.'  ``'Game plan number one is to fill as many seats as we can, right? If it's all of us in there and the poor people of Breaux Bridge are sitting behind us, well then tough luck for them,' said one organizer, identified by KPEL as James His `poor people' comment drew laughs from the other activists.  `` `If we can arrange it so he doesn't hear one sympathetic question--great. That only magnifies our impact,' Proctor said.  ``KPEL identified Proctor as the leader of Indivisible Acadiana, a local branch of the national Indivisible organization, which has organized hostile Republican town halls all around the country.  `` `The Indivisible Guide does say that when you start to lose the meeting, that's when you boo and hiss,' one unidentified activist can be heard saying. `Right, I was going to say that,' another activist replied. Local news outlet The Advertiser reported that members of the crowd `frequently interrupted, expressing disagreement with some of Cassidy's positions and shouting out their own questions.'  `` `The outside team will join the inside team in the hall after media coverage'. . . . `So what we'll do is we'll try to dominate enough, because--remember, the camera people especially are looking for some `b-roll' and some quotes.'  `` `They've got three or four things to cover that day, this is just one of them'. . . . `So we make sure we give them the coverage they want, and then everyone breaks and goes inside.' ''  That reminds me of an article that was written in Gregg County, the largest newspaper. Obviously they know what Indivisible is, and they were demanding a townhall belittling me. It just shows how partisan, how malicious. They showed their malice toward me repeatedly. Fortunately, for the people of east Texas, they don't count for a whole lot. Their opinion is so biased; it is what it is. They know that these people are doing just what is talked about here, what is talked about in the Indivisible handbook, and that is what they want. They want me out of office, and there is such a problem with envy, with emotions that I have just never had like that. They can't stand it.  So, anyway, here is one, Todd Starnes from FOX News, today's article:  ``A group of enraged protesters exploded in anger after a chaplain prayed in the name of Jesus at a town hall meeting in Louisiana hosted by U.Bill  ``The verbally-abusive crowd''--and it is talking about this same townhall that this tape came from, where they were plotting and planning to disrupt and to keep the people from Breaux Bridge from actually being able to participate in their own townhall.                              {time}  2145  Anyway:  ``Louisiana State chaplain Michael Sprague and the unidentified Vietnam War veteran should be commended for maintaining their composure in the face of verbal barbarism.  ``The February 22, town hall meeting in Metairie, was quickly overrun by the angry mob--much like other town hall meetings hosted by Republican lawmakers across the country.  ``The mainstream media would have us believe the unruly demonstrations are part of an organic, grassroots effort.  ``But I sincerely doubt many in the mob were actually residents of Louisiana--because I know the good people of Louisiana and nobody behaves like that in the Bayou  ``Folks are raised right in Cajun There's no way anybody would embarrass their mommas by acting the fool in public.  ``I'd be willing to bet a cup of Community Coffee that the Jesus-hating rabble-rousers were shipped in from some God-forsaken place like Berkeley or Brooklyn.''

Someone filmed the prayer and words do not do justice to the amount of hate directed at the chaplain.  `` `I've never been shouted down throughout a time of prayer like that,' Chaplain Sprague told me. `I've never been in a situation like that. It's sad there wasn't honor and respect for God.'  ``But they became absolutely unhinged when he concluded his prayer in the name of  `` `Wow, they booed the name of Jesus,' Cassidy said in remarks reported by the Times- ``I thought several of the agitators were going to spontaneously combust.  ``The chaplain said the overwhelming majority of people in the room were causing a disruption--but he harbors no ill will toward the mob.  `` `I'm not mad at people. My heart is bigger than that,' he said. `My heart's prayer is that everybody be treated with dignity and respect.'  ``The chaplain was especially disappointed by how the mob insulted the Vietnam War veteran.  `` `There was a lot of shouting. Some turned their backs.

7218,topic-id,885,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for not only managing the time, but her leadership and great work in  Mr.Speaker, I rise to speak about the millions of Americans who will suffer under this oxymoron called This bill will result in higher costs and less coverage for hardworking Americans, especially the poor and the elderly. The only winners in this bill are the wealthy who are getting their $600 billion tax cut.  Earlier this week, an official with the American College of Physicians put it best when he said:       In 38 years of advocating for doctors and patients, I have      never seen a bill that will do more harm than the  This is a powerful statement.  You know, Mr.Speaker, what I can't figure out is what problem this bill is trying to solve. If the Republicans were looking to cover fewer people, make insurance more expensive, and give tax cuts to the rich, then I guess this Republican bill is the answer.  Let's take a quick look at what this bill does or, as my Republican colleagues refer to it, promises kept.  First and foremost, 24 million Americans are going to lose coverage. Let me repeat that, 24 million. That is not only unacceptable, it is cruel.  And even for those lucky enough not to lose coverage, things are not going to be very good.  Under the Republican healthcare scheme, older Americans will be paying five times more. In what world does anyone think that it is a good idea to make health care even more expensive for the elderly? This is one of those crazy but true things about this bill. So this is what the GOP calls promises kept.  Well, let's take a moment to remember what promises were actually made. In an interview with ``60 Minutes'' in 2015, President Trump promised:       Everybody is going to be covered. I am going to take care      of everybody. I don't care if it costs me votes or not,      everybody is going to be taken care of much better than they      are being taken care of now.  Then just 2 days before the election, Trump went to Sioux City, Iowa, and said:       I am going to protect and save your Social Security and      your You made a deal a long, long time ago.[[Page H2336]]                                {time}  1630  So how does this repeal bill stack up with those promises? Premiums will spike 750 percent with far fewer tax credits to help shoulder that burden; 30 million Americans with preexisting conditions would lose the certainty of coverage they have enjoyed under ObamaCare; Medicare will be slashed by $170 billion; Medicaid will be cut 25 percent. That is $880 billion being ripped away from the most vulnerable Americans, resulting in 14 million people losing coverage immediately.  So who wins here with TrumpCare? The rich, who will reap $600 billion in tax cuts at the expense of medical treatment for the most vulnerable and working folks in this country; Big Pharma is a winner who can now look forward to more obscene profits and less oversight; and, of course, the private health insurance companies, who, once again, will be in total charge of America's health care.  Who loses? Hardworking, regular folks who simply can't afford to underwrite a tax cut for the rich at the expense of their health.  Take my constituent, Shawn, for example. He wrote me to share his ACA story. In 2006, Shawn was diagnosed with HIV and a rare heart condition, and his premiums skyrocketed from $123 a month in 2005, all the way up to $1,473 a month in 2012. That is an average increase of between 35 and 40 percent per year. At the same time, his deductible climbed to $2,900, meaning his insurance wouldn't offer him a dime until he coughed up nearly $3,000 first.  When ObamaCare kicked in in 2014, Shawn had at least a dozen plans to choose from. He selected a platinum plan which delivered better coverage than he previously had for only half the price that he had previously been paying. Let me repeat: because of ObamaCare, Shawn started paying half the price for a better plan. How was it better? As Shawn put it, he no longer faced lifetime caps; he had free wellness visits included in his coverage; instead of a nearly $3,000 deductible, he now had just a small copay.  If the ACA is repealed, Shawn will be uninsured for the first time in his life. For the first time in 54 years, Shawn will be forced to pay out of his own pocket for lifesaving medications. His HIV medications alone cost nearly $30,000 per year--that is three times as much as he pays right now for all of his medical expenses. If he is hospitalized for his heart condition--which has occurred already twice--he will incur tens of thousands of dollars in additional charges. In short, under the Republican's healthcare scheme, Shawn will be financially ruined.  Mr.Speaker, this is utterly unacceptable. The American people deserve access to affordable, accessible, and high quality health care. TrumpCare achieves the opposite. It is a bad deal and a threat to the well-being of our Nation and our people. Beyond that, it is shameful and inhumane.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose TrumpCare in its entirety and vote it down tomorrow.  ",CREC-2017-03-22-pt1-PgH2333-6.txt,1708,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,22.0,March

7070,topic-id,2305,"Mr.President, 70 years ago this May, the Senate Appropriations Committee sent to the full Senate a constitutional amendment to require a balanced Federal budget. It had been proposed by Senator Millard Tydings, a Democrat from In its report, the committee said this: ``In no other way except by an amendment to the Constitution can Congress be compelled to balance its budget in peacetime.''  Seven decades of experience proved that the Appropriations Committee was right, and we have never been in a more serious, perilous situation than we are today.  Two essential facts compel me once again to introduce a constitutional amendment to require fiscal responsibility: the gravity of the national debt crisis and the fact that neither willpower nor legislation will solve it.  The greatest challenge in describing the gravity of the national debt crisis is deciding how much of the bad news to present at one time. During the 2008 Presidential campaign, one of the candidates criticized the outgoing President for adding $4 trillion to the national debt. That increase, Barack Obama said, was not only irresponsible but ``unpatriotic.'' The national debt on inauguration day 2009 was $10.6 trillion, and on inauguration day 2017 it was $19.9 trillion. If a $4 trillion increase was irresponsible and unpatriotic, what words describe a $9.3 trillion increase?  President Obama won the 2008 election with the Government Accountability Office warning that the Nation's long-term fiscal outlook was unsustainable. In its January 2017 assessment of the Nation's fiscal health, GAO reports that the national debt as a share of GDP in 2016 was 75 percent higher than the average since World War As it had been before, GAO concluded that ``the federal government's fiscal path is unsustainable.''  One way to understand the gravity of the national debt is to compare it to the size of the economy, or the gross domestic product. In other words, we can compare what we owe to our ability to pay. When President Obama took office, the national debt was 82 percent of GDP and is now 105 percent of GDP today. Some economists prefer to evaluate the national debt as a percentage of tax revenue; that is, by comparing what we owe to what we earn. The national debt rose from approximately 350 percent of Federal revenue when President Obama took office to 600 percent of Federal revenue today.  But neither numbers nor percentages tell the whole story because the national debt crisis is becoming not only a bigger crisis but a different kind of crisis. During the last several years of skyrocketing national debt, the interest rate on that debt has been nearly zero. If interest rates had been at the historical average, annual interest costs would be more than twice what they are today and on their way to consuming more than half of all Federal revenue. And now interest rates are starting to creep up. The Concord Coalition and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget both anticipate that over the next decade, interest payments on the national debt alone will approach $1 trillion per year. That is interest payments. In other words, as GAO found in its new fiscal report, the growing national debt now means that the rising cost of servicing that debt becomes one of the drivers of the growing debt itself. This is becoming what one study calls a self-propelling crisis.  A national debt of this magnitude dampens the economic growth necessary to minimize borrowing to fund the government, and rising interest costs for such a monstrous debt add to the debt on which more interest must then be paid. Last month, for instance, the Treasury Department echoed this point in its financial report with the U.Government for fiscal year 2016. The Treasury Department concluded:       The debt-to-GDP ratio rises at an accelerating rate despite      primary deficits that flatten out because higher levels of      debt lead to higher net interest expenditures, and higher net      interest expenditures lead to[[Page S1451]]     higher debt. The continuous rise of the debt-to-GDP ratio . .      . indicates that current policy is unsustainable.  We can also consider the legislative budget and economic outlook from the Congressional Budget I want to highlight a few things that stood out to me.  First, annual budget deficits are on their way back up after 6 years of decline. In fact, the budget deficit for fiscal year 2016 will be one-third larger than in 2015.  Second, CBO projects that the national debt will rise by nearly $10 trillion over the next decade. Looking beyond the next decade, CBO says that under current law, the national debt will explode to more than 150 percent of GDP--by far the highest level in American history.  Third, CBO also says that interest on the national debt is itself an increasingly forceful engine driving the debt even higher. Interest payments on the national debt are increasing nearly twice as fast as spending on Social Security and Just last month, CBO Director Keith Hall said that over the next 10 years, interest payments are expected to triple in nominal terms and double relative to  Fourth, CBO repeated some of the serious negative consequences of this national debt for the budget, the economy, and the In addition to substantially higher interest payments, these include lower productivity and wages, less flexibility by lawmakers to respond to fiscal challenges, and increased likelihood of a fiscal crisis.  In addition to these problems, former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Michael Mullen and experts from the Heritage Foundation to the Brookings Institution warn that the national debt crisis is a serious threat to national security.  Economists tell us that national debt above 90 percent of GDP for a sustained period of time will lead to substantially slower economic growth and higher interest rates. The United States is now in the longest period in its history with the national debt above that toxic 90-percent level. Not surprisingly, since the recession ended in June 2009, the national debt has grown more than twice as fast and GDP has grown less than half as fast as during the comparable period after previous recessions.  It is no wonder to me and to many others that more than two-thirds of Americans say that their concern over the national debt is growing and more than three-quarters of Americans say that the national debt should be among Congress's top three priorities. The national debt was once such a top priority. In fact, America's Founders were so determined to avoid debt that their commitment to fiscal balance was often called our unwritten fiscal constitution. President George Washington, for example, told Congress that the regular redemption of the public debt was the most urgent fiscal priority. That was George Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1798 that if he could add a single amendment to the Constitution, it would prohibit the Federal Government from borrowing. That commitment, of course, is long gone. The Federal budget has been balanced in only a dozen of the last 80 years. And, as I said earlier, we are in the longest period in American history with a debt above 90 percent of  As its fiscal willpower failed, Congress has also tried to address the debt crisis by legislation. The first bill requiring a balanced budget was introduced in 1934 when the national debt was 40 percent of Fifty years later, Congress enacted the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Since then, we have enacted multiple budget control acts and budget enforcement acts, only to see the national debt climb from 42 percent of GDP in 1985 to 105 percent of GDP today.  Good intentions will not balance the Nation's checkbook. Statutes that Congress can change or ignore will not keep our fiscal house in order. Neither willpower nor legislation will tackle the national debt crisis. Pretending otherwise is the fiscal equivalent of fiddling while Rome burns.  All the evidence--every bit of it--proves true the conclusion drawn by the Appropriations Committee 70 years ago. In no other way except by amendment to the Constitution can Congress be compelled to balanced its budget in peacetime. We have, as lawyers put it, exhausted our other remedies for this crisis. This would be a very different country--a freer and more prosperous country--if Congress had already proposed the only solution that exists, a constitutional amendment which requires fiscal responsibility.  The first balanced budget amendment was introduced in the House of Representatives in 1936. As you can see, the national debt as a percentage of GDP has been going up by leaps and bounds. I introduced my first balanced budget amendment in June of 1979, during my first term in the Senate when the national debt was 32 percent of That share of GDP doubled by 1997 when the Senate came within one vote of passing a balanced budget amendment that I introduced--one vote. It rose to 95 percent when the Senate last voted on a balanced budget amendment in 2011 and is 105 percent of GDP today.  Since this crisis is already so grave and getting worse, since the only way to tackle it is through the Constitution, we should propose a balanced budget amendment and let the American people decide whether to take this step. After all, Congress cannot amend the A requirement that Congress keep its fiscal house in order cannot become part of the Constitution until that is approved by three-quarters of the  Congress, however, is not the only way to propose constitutional amendments. Article V of the Constitution also allows the States to apply for a convention to propose constitutional amendments. Concerned citizens have been working since the mid-1970s to reach the two-thirds threshold for calling such a convention to propose a balanced budget amendment and are only six States away from that goal. Since Congress has never called an article V convention, questions remain unresolved and theories untested regarding that method of proposing an amendment. I can assure my colleagues, however, that Congress's continued failure to propose a balanced budget--and a balanced budget amendment at that--guarantees that our fellow citizens will continue working to force that course upon us.  There are two facts that we must face: the gravity of the nation's debt crisis and the failure to address it by willpower or legislation. Perhaps some of my colleagues believe that the Congressional Budget Office is wrong in its disturbing projections and dire warnings; that the Government Accountability Office is mistaken and the fiscal path we are on is sustainable after all; that the Treasury Department is wrong about the spiral of increased debt and growing interest payments--some people feel that way; that the Concord Coalition and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget are wrong about how national debt interest payments will continue to grow and add to the debt; and that economists are wrong to warn about the impact of sustained national debt of this magnitude.  If my colleagues are convinced that everyone else is wrong and our fiscal future is just fine after all, then they should say so and then try to make that case to the American people. Even they will not do that because they know they are wrong, yet we can't seem to get them to do what is right. I, for one, think that would be a very tough sell for them to make. Americans have been polled about this issue dozens of times over the years by major polling firms and national news organizations. Three-quarters of Americans supported a balanced budget amendment in 1976, and three-quarters support it today.  Perhaps all of these polls over the last 40 years are wrong. Perhaps the American people are content watching their national debt swallow the economy. Perhaps our fellow citizens are actually OK with slower economic growth, a rising threat to national security, the greater likelihood of a fiscal crisis, and an unsustainable path to fiscal disaster. If that is what the American people actually believe, then they certainly are inclined to ratify a balanced budget amendment.  The real reason Members of Congress refuse to give the American people this choice is that they know what the American people will say. I say with respect, but as strongly as I can, that this is not a legitimate basis for refusing to propose a balanced budget[[Page S1452]]amendment. In our system of government, as Founder James Wilson once put it, the people are the masters of government. They alone have authority to set rules for government. This choice must be theirs, not ours.  Here is the heart of the matter. First, the national debt crisis poses a significant and growing threat to the economic and national security of this country. In fact, we have never been in such an extended, perilous period as we are right now. Second, Congress has tried and failed to address this crisis by either willpower or legislation and will actually do so only if the Constitution requires it. Third, the decision of whether to use the Constitution to require fiscal responsibility belongs to the American people, not to  We can either take the responsibility we were elected for and propose a balanced budget amendment or the American people may do it for us. I hope we have the guts to do what is right. Our very country is hanging in the balance. The rest of the world depends on the United States and the strong principles of the United States, and we need to do what is right.  I think it is time for us to wake up and realize this is the Congress that can make the difference. After all these years of impropriety and excessive spending, we can do it. We can live within certain constraints. It may take a period of time to wind this down, but we can do it. This amendment does provide for some ways of getting there.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-27-pt1-PgS1449.txt,1351,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2017.0,27.0,February

7229,topic-id,882,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my good colleague from Connecticut so much for that incredibly compelling testimony of why we cannot let this bill pass.  Let me summarize what you heard in this last hour from Members across our country who are terrified. Frankly, this plan--TrumpCare, the pay more get less plan, the broken promises plan--might actually pass. We have to make sure that it does not pass.  So, in summary, TrumpCare strips healthcare coverage from 24 million It cuts $880 billion--that is almost a trillion dollars--from Medicaid expansion, and it gives $600 billion in tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans and corporations while cutting benefits for seniors, working families, and the most vulnerable among us.  Frankly, we don't know everything it does because there have been amendments after amendments that have been passed today. We still don't know what the full impact of this bill is, yet they are pushing through a vote tomorrow if they can get enough votes to pass it.  TrumpCare is going to raise the cost of health care by about $14,000 for those between the ages of 50 and 64. That is the age tax you have heard about on the floor tonight. And it is going to raise premiums for almost everyone. It puts a 30 percent penalty for getting health care to anyone who suffers any kind of a catastrophic event that throws you off of health care. If you lose your job and somehow you end up without health care for a couple months, you are going to have to pay 30 percent more in order to get your health care back.  You heard from Representative Kennedy about mental health, you heard from Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton about work requirements, and that is just a piece of what this TrumpCare bill does.  Tomorrow I will join my Democratic colleagues and hopefully enough Republican colleagues who know that our job is to make sure we provide health care for everyone across this country. Tomorrow I will vote ``no'' for the 24 million people who will lose their coverage. I will vote ``no'' for the almost 15 million people who will lose their coverage under Medicaid expansion alone. I will vote ``no'' for the millions of low-income women who rely on services from Planned I will vote ``no'' for the tens of thousands of people who will literally die each year if the Republicans succeed in repealing the health care that we have now.  Let's be clear that the Republican majority has been passing legislation and voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act for 7 years, yet they could not come up with a plan that would, in fact, do what they promised, which is to make sure that we are covering more Americans at lower prices. As my friend, Representative Raskin, said, this is not a healthcare plan. A[[Page H2340]]healthcare plan would cover more people. This is a tax plan to take the benefits that working families were receiving on healthcare coverage across the country and convert it into tax benefits for the wealthiest, $600 billion in tax benefits.  People around the country are calling in to say if you care about the American people and if you care about providing health care for all of us, this is a bad plan, you should not vote for it. And Republicans are hopefully listening to constituents across the country, to their Governors in Republican States, Republican Governors who have said how much Medicaid expansion has helped their They have asked and pleaded for people to keep what we have; to make it better, yes, but not to strip $880 billion away.  Just recently, Paul Ryan, the Speaker of our House, was quoted as saying that he has been dreaming about yanking health care away from the people who need it the most since he was ``drinking at a keg.''  This is what he said: ``So Medicaid, sending it back to the states, capping its growth rate, we've been dreaming of this since I have been around--since you and I were drinking at the keg. . . .''  Well, I don't know what he was thinking about when he was drinking at the keg, but I can tell you that what we have been dreaming about as Democrats, as people who care about the health care of people across this country is that we cover people, that we don't put anyone in a position where they are one healthcare crisis away from bankruptcy, that we make sure that kids can get asthma inhalers, that we make sure that grandma and grandpa can go into the nursing home and get the care that they need. If we pass this bill tomorrow, those grandparents are not going to have the care that they need. Nursing homes are going to shut down. We are going to take away jobs from rural areas, rural hospitals across this country.  Mr.Speaker, today, as we close this Progressive Caucus Special Order hour, I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that I believe we all have the interests of the American people at heart, and if we do, then I hope we will stop this TrumpCare bill from moving forward tomorrow.

7220,topic-id,835,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for adding her voice on such an important issue before our country today and for leading our efforts here this afternoon on the House floor.  There are an awful lot of important components to this bill that we are debating now and that will supposedly come before us tomorrow afternoon. One of the critical pieces of it is how we are going to treat people suffering from mental illness.  Now, the bill itself does a number of things across insurance marketplaces and across Medicaid and Medicaid expansion, but I think it is critically important that we look at this through the framework of what health care is supposed to be all about. Health care, at least from my understanding, boils down to one simple principle. It is how we treat each other in our time of need and this commitment that we make as a country to each other, that, yes, I care about you and your family and want to make sure that you get the care that you need when you need it. Because with health care, at some point, I am going to need that same care as well: a loved one of mine, my children, my family members, and I hope that you would be there for me the same way that I would be there for you.  So if you look at this bill through that prism, one of the pieces that stands out is the fact that, for the Medicaid expansion population, about 11 million people across our country, this bill strips what is called the essential healthcare benefits from those 11 million people. Now, that is a bureaucratic term, but it means some of the most basic aspects of health care: maternal care and newborn care, preventive services, wellness, ambulatory care, and, yes, mental health services and addiction, behavioral health.  So what does that actually mean? It means that because of existing legislation, the Federal law, mental health parity, which says that if mental health benefits are, in fact, offered as part of a healthcare package, insurance package, that it has to be offered in the same way that physical health care is. You should treat your access to behavioral health care the same way we would treat access to health care if you needed cancer treatment or a broken leg. But the mental health parity law does not require mental health benefits to be offered at all. The Affordable Care Act, however, says that in order for a plan to be qualified, it does have to offer an essential health benefits package, included in that being access to mental health care.  So those two laws together work in tandem to have created a massive increase in access to behavioral health and mental health services, including, critically for the moment that we are in our country, access to opioid treatment.  What this bill does is strip those essential benefits, including access to addiction services and mental health care, from that essential benefits package and says to the States: Good luck, you can pay for them if you want to, providing nowhere near the sufficient funding to cover all of the demands that our Republican colleague says the funding will be there for.  Now, to make matters even more convoluted in this, it was clear, during the debate in our committee 2 weeks ago for 28 straight hours, that some of our colleagues actually thought these protections were maintained when we pointed out that, in fact, they were stripped. There was then a different version of this bill that was brought forth for consideration called the manager's amendment. That manager's amendment happened to reinstate those benefits, which was great, and I applaud my Republican colleagues for doing so, aside from the fact that they then realized that they included those benefits and they offered an amendment to strip them back out, just in the past 36 hours, recognizing that there was a bill that they thought offered these benefits--the package of essential health benefits--for 11 million people to begin with, they found out that it didn't, in fact, offer it; they fixed it and put them back in a bill, realized they did it inadvertently and took it out again and are now laying that bill supposedly before our consideration tomorrow.  If health care is, in fact, that commitment we make to each other in our time of need, how does this bill answer that question? The average cost of a birth in this country is roughly $10,000. Medicaid itself pays for half of the births in our Maternal care and newborn care are covered under the essential health benefits, but not anymore for the Medicaid expansion population. For that population, having a child could very literally bring you to bankruptcy. That is the bill that this Republican Congress is putting forward for your consideration tomorrow.[[Page H2337]]  That is one of the many reasons why I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''

7075,topic-id,1661,"Mr.President, it has become fashionable, particularly among supporters of the Trump administration, to accuse the United Nations of just about everything. This is, however, nothing new. The U.N has been an easy target, especially for some Republicans, for a long time, because like any unwieldy international organization comprised of member states with very different priorities and interests it will probably never be as efficient or effective as we would like.  But there is simply no question that the U.serves many vital functions that are fully consistent with key U.interests and values. For that reason, it is essential that the U.continues to play a leadership role in the U.N., which we were instrumental in creating seven decades ago, in a manner that strengthens the institution.  At times, I have expressed my own frustrations with the U.It wastes inordinate amounts of time debating and adopting redundant resolutions that accomplish next to nothing. It has suffered from personnel policies that make it difficult if not impossible to fire underperforming employees. It pays its officials at rates that dwarf what many could earn in their own countries. It has been too slow to implement procedures to ensure transparency and accountability, including for whistleblowers who have suffered retaliation for exposing corruption and other misconduct.  So there is no dispute that the U.needs to do better. The new Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, knows this as well as anyone and he has made clear that he is going to do his best to put the institution on a road to real reform.  But, of course, he cannot do that by himself. He is empowered only to the extent that the U.member states, and particularly the permanent members of the Security Council, support him.  Attempts by past the Secretary Generals to implement reforms have been partly stymied by resistance from governments that prefer the status quo. While I believe the prospects for U.N.reform have never been better, that will not be possible without the active leadership and skillful diplomacy of the United  And that is where our U.Ambassador comes in.  I have known many of them, although I was only 7 years old in 1947 when Warren Austin of Vermont, nominated by President Truman, became our third U. The position of U.Ambassador to the U.has also been held by such accomplished people as Henry Cabot Lodge, Adlai Stevenson, George H.Bush, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Thomas Pickering, and Madeleine Each was recognized and widely admired across the political spectrum for his or her depth of foreign policy experience and wisdom.  Today we are considering the nomination of Nikki Haley to be the next U.Governor Haley's record as Governor of South Carolina was decidedly mixed, and I will not take time today to discuss that record. What is most relevant here, however, is her dearth of experience for the job she has been selected for. That is not so much a criticism of Governor Haley as it is of President Trump, as there are certainly well qualified, seasoned diplomats in the Republican Party who would be well received by members of both parties.  Instead, we are asked to support a nominee who will no doubt be confirmed but will be starting from square one. If there ever were a case of having to learn on the job, this will be it. That might not concern me if it were not for the indispensable role of the United Nations in an increasingly dangerous and polarized world, the importance of this position, and the complex challenges the next U.Ambassador will face on her first day on the job.  It was painfully apparent during her confirmation hearing that virtually everything Governor Haley said in her opening remarks and in her responses to questions of Senators, she had learned in the previous 2 months since she was chosen for the job. Her answers largely parroted popular Republican talking points with little substance to back up her response and revealed only an elementary understanding of how the U.functions. Her stated interest in U.reform is well placed, but it did not appear that she grasps what U.reform entails or what it takes to build the necessary support for reform.  Again, I do not blame her for that. Her career has focused entirely on issues relevant to the State of South But that does not make her qualified to be our Ambassador to the U. As Governor, she jumped on the politically expedient bandwagon and opposed the resettlement of any Syrian refugees in her State over ``security concerns,'' although it being a Federal decision some Syrians have been resettled there. In other words, she supported a blanket prohibition against an entire nationality of people--men, women, and children--regardless of the merits of their individual status as refugees fleeing war.  She stated, in spite of the fact that all of our major European allies supported the nuclear agreement with Iran, that Russia's and China's support was a ``red flag,'' without acknowledging the reality that without their support it would be impossible to achieve an agreement to halt Iran's nuclear weapons program or any of our other key objectives at the U. She condemned the U.abstention on U.Security Council Resolution[[Page S428]]2334 regarding Israeli settlements and incorrectly implied that it is inconsistent with longstanding U.policy and interests. In fact, she insisted that the resolution, not settlements themselves, makes peace negotiations more difficult--a view with which I disagree. She seemed to acknowledge that the U.does not support settlement construction, but stated that the U.should have vetoed the resolution anyway.  She mischaracterized U.law regarding our share of dues in support of U.peacekeeping missions that the U.S.--Republican and Democratic administrations--voted for, failing to acknowledge that we have a treaty obligation to pay 28.5 percent of U.peacekeeping costs. She made little mention of and gave little if any credit to the troop-contributing countries themselves, other than to highlight incidents of sexual exploitation and abuse. This is a critical issue that I and others here have been working with the U.Mission to the U.to address, and progress is being made in developing meaningful accountability procedures.  She stated that the cut-off of U.funding for UNESCO as a result of the vote of a majority of its members to accept Palestine as a member state, which led to our loss of influence, is a ``good thing'' and that she would continue to support the cut-off of funding. She and I disagree about that and what it could mean for the future. I think even the Israeli Government has come to recognize that it is better for the U.to be at the table, using our influence to deflect attempts to unfairly target Israel, than on the sidelines.  Governor Haley suggested that the U.may want to reconsider participation in and funding for the U.Human Rights Council, despite overwhelming evidence that our role serves to protect our interests and has reduced substantially the council's disproportionate and wasteful focus on At no time did she acknowledge the many council resolutions that are fully consistent with U.interests or that the influence lost by the U.is simply ceded to the very governments she opposes having a say in the council.  On the other hand, Governor Haley did repeatedly reject what she described as ``slash and burn'' tactics when it comes to budget cutting, and on that, I fully agree with her.  She said she supports moving our embassy to Jerusalem, although there is no compelling need to do so, it is strongly opposed by our ally Jordan, would likely incite a violent reaction in Arab countries, and could do more to drive a nail in the coffin of what little remains of the Middle East peace process than anything else.  In responses to written questions she betrayed a serious lack of understanding about Cuba, its economy, and the failures of the 55-year-old U.embargo. Indeed, if she were to apply her answers regarding Cuba to other countries with repressive governments, we would have to close dozens of U.Embassies, end diplomatic relations, and impose ineffective, unilateral sanctions against each of them.  I urge Governor Haley, as our U.Ambassador, to listen to the overwhelming majority of Americans and Cubans, including many Republican Members of Congress, who support a policy of engagement. I urge her to travel to Cuba and see and hear for herself, unlike those who continue to favor a Cold War embargo that has been exploited by the Cuban Government to justify its repressive policies and that has hurt the Cuban people.  I have been a congressional delegate to the United Nations three times, after being nominated by Presidents of both Republican and Democratic parties. I appreciated that opportunity because I have long believed that it is in the strong interest of the United States to play an active, leadership role in the U. That is only possible if we, by far the world's wealthiest country, meet our financial commitments. And it is only possible if we build coalitions through skillful diplomacy and refrain from the tactics that some critics of the U.advocate, such as bullying and ultimatums, which are often self-defeating.  I recognize that Governor Haley will be confirmed, and I wish her the best. I hope she becomes a great U.I urge her to seek out and listens to a wide range of views, particularly on controversial issues like the Middle East, Iran, and how the U.can best help make the U.work better for everyone.  I will do everything I can to support Secretary General Guterres, the budget of the U.Mission to the U.N., and funding for U.agencies like the World Food Program, the U.Development Program, UNICEF, the U.Environment Program, the U.Population Fund, U.Women, the U.Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture, and so many others that carry out lifesaving humanitarian and development programs around the world.  And if there are other ways that I can help soon-to-be Ambassador Haley to defend the values and effectively advance the interests of the United States at the U.and to bring about needed reforms I will gladly do so.

7306,topic-id,338,"Mr.Chairman, I appreciate the leadership of the chairman of the full committee on matters of transparency and accountability. I can tell you that there is no one who has a greater definitive desire to make sure that we hold our government accountable and certainly accountable to the American people.  So, it is with that goal in mind that I rise to ask my colleagues to support an amendment that we are offering that would actually just keep a log of any of the pre-review consultations with agencies that OIRA actually has and conducts, and to publish that list upon completion of review.  Dating back to some 2003, the Government Accountability Office had made the recommendation about increasing this transparency at the Office of Information and Regulatory GAO actually made one recommendation targeted at what they call informal review, Mr.Chairman, that OIRA conducts before an agency actually formally submits a rule for review.  Indeed, the GAO recommended that the Director of the Office of Management and Budget should define a transparency requirement that would be applicable to agencies and OIRA, in Section 6 of Executive Order 12866, in such a way that would not include not only the formal review, but it would also include the informal review period when OIRA says that it has sometimes, considering some of the most important facts as it relates to new rules.  This recommendation remains unimplemented today, and I can tell you, Mr.Chairman, we have had a number of hearings where we have had this particular group in. I know my colleagues, the gentleman opposite from Virginia, and I believe that OIRA plays a critical role. And yet, at the same time, some of these meetings were going on without the knowledge, and even after the fact, when they went into effect, and we had really no understanding of some of the deliberation that went on.  So this is just a great transparency, commonsense amendment, and I would urge my colleagues to support it.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

We see the passion that has arisen across America, ordinary citizens calling us up on the phone, inundating our phones, thousands of phone calls--I had more phone calls in a single day than I normally get in a couple of weeks--inundating us with thousands of emails and letters.  Why is there so much public passion about this nomination? The short answer is that public education is a cherished institution in the United States of Public schools are a vital pathway through which our children have the opportunity to gain the knowledge that allows them to thrive in our society. We don't want to see that system of public education, that gateway for a successful life, destroyed by Betsy That is why the American people are sending us so many letters and emails and making so many phone calls--because Betsy DeVos has no education experience, no public school experience.  Our students, teachers, communities, and our Nation deserve leadership that does have public education experience, someone who does have a passion for the success of every child, not someone who is simply dedicated to trying to tear down public schools so she can run private profit institutions and put money in the bank.  What do we really care about in the United States of America? Do we care about the education of our children or about an entrepreneur hijacking the public education system for personal profit? That is why the citizens of this country are so outraged by this nomination and outraged that Senators on this floor are planning to vote for her later today.  I had the chance to go to school starting in first grade down in Roseburg, Roseburg is a timber town. My mother showed me the path that was somewhere between a quarter of a mile and half a mile long.

7278,topic-id,588,"Mr.Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Utah for yielding.  Last night, President Trump stood feet from here and spoke about the need and his commitment to regulatory reform.  I would like to echo those comments. One of the chief reasons the voters sent most of us here is because they know that Federal regulation is killing our economy and placing a heavy burden on families. I am proud to deliver on a promise I made during the campaign, and to have done so in the first 100 days. The OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act codifies the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, known as OIRA serves as the regulatory gatekeeper, a safety valve, providing a process and review to hold back the floodgates of unnecessary burdensome and duplicative regulations.  OIRA is a bipartisan office within the executive branch that was originally created during the Reagan administration and further outlined by President Clinton in an executive order. President Clinton put it well when he said:  ``The American people deserve a regulatory system that works for them, not against them: a regulatory system that protects and improves their health, safety, environment, and well-being and improves the performance of the economy without imposing unacceptable or unreasonable costs on society; regulatory policies that recognize that the private sector and private markets are the best engine for economic growth; regulatory approaches that respect the role of State, local, and tribal governments; and regulations that are effective, consistent, sensible, and understandable.''  I agree with President Clinton's words in 1993. This is about making sure government solves problems, rather than creates them. And create them, it has.  In recent years, the regulatory state has grown to impressive levels. Between 2006 and 2015, agencies published over 36,000 final rules, of which 555 were considered economically significant. That is, they anticipated an economic effect of $100 million or more.  Many of these regulations have been imposed without thorough cost-benefit analysis, placing huge burdens on families and businesses. What is worse, Americans have had little, if any, influence on regulations that impact their lives as unelected bureaucrats regularly have exceeded their authority while imposing regulations that negatively impact them. It is our responsibility as the people's representatives to protect them from this ever-expanding regulatory state.  This bill is simple and plain. The bill locks into place existing transparency requirements like the unified agenda and the annual regulatory plan.  The bill also requires OIRA to tell us more about what they are currently doing.  After OIRA conducts a review of significant regulations, H.1009 requires OIRA to give us a readout. Imagine that, we want them to tell us what they are doing. How did the agency do? Is the regulation well drafted? Did the agency meet the requirements of the law? That is a novel approach. Did the agency pick the best way to regulate? OIRA is already required to conduct this review under Executive Order 12886.  The bill asks OIRA to tell us the results. I am surprised and disappointed that even on this bill we have seen significant opposition.  My minority counterparts have made complaints based on strained legal arguments, but they haven't offered an amendment to fix the alleged problem. Why? Because they don't like the basic concepts of the bill. These are not partisan concepts. We have heard their concerns in committee. We obviously disagree at this point. And as the chairman said, this is passed by committee without amendment. We look forward to support, and I ask my colleagues to support the bill.

7291,topic-id,431,"Mr.Chair, this amendment makes technical changes to H.1009 to ensure consistency in dates and terms, require OIRA to review significant guidance, and prohibit authorization of additional funds. It allows OIRA 4 weeks to review the Unified Agenda submissions, requires a mutual agreement to extend the regulatory review beyond 90 days, and requires a written explanation of each 30 days of the extension.  That is critical. They must explain to us, to the people, any extension.  It clarifies the timing of the post-review disclosure to occur as soon as the agency makes the proposed final rule public, clarifies that disclosure of interagency communication is limited to exchanges with senior-level OIRA staff, requires a written explanation[[Page H1439]]for any exempt regulations, and expands OIRA to review the guidance document per a Bush-era executive order.                              {time}  1645  This amendment primarily makes technical changes to the bill that were developed in consultation with OIRA staff. We took their concerns and suggestions into account, and we incorporated most of those in this amendment. For example, this amendment clarifies the review extension process that has been the subject of some conversation here.  Our minority counterparts have claimed that OIRA has 90 days, plus a 30-day extension to review under current executive order. That is clearly not true under the executive order or in practice. Under the Obama administration, OIRA review, at times, exceeded 2 years without explanation. This limitless extension is permissible under the governing executive order, which allows an automatic 30-day extension at the request of OIRA and a limitless extension at the request of the agency.  We have heard that when OIRA needs that additional time, they simply call up an agency and ask for an extension. So this bill requires transparency in the review process, puts limits on that, and requires the disclosure of that.  OIRA has suggested the term is a mutual agreement between the agencies so that, in fact, we could put limits on the review and extension process.  Another important addition to this amendment is that we are extending OIRA's review to guidance documents. This is not a new practice. In 2007, President Bush issued Executive Order 13422, which extended OIRA's review to guidance documents.  While President Obama rescinded that executive order, OIRA Administrator Shelanski affirmed to the Oversight and Government Reform Committee in the past Congress that OIRA should continue the practice of reviewing significant guidance documents.  These guidance documents will only rise to the level of OIRA review if they meet the significant standard.  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

Public education from the very beginning of this country has been at the root of that uniquely American idea--the idea that you can succeed despite any barriers that may have been presented in front of you by circumstance or by birth.  Public education at the outset was in those one-room schoolhouses. Everybody packed into one place, all sorts of ages and learning abilities, and one teacher, normally a female, at the front of the classroom. But over time, this country adapted. We learned from others. It was Horace Mann, the famous Massachusetts educator, who borrowed from ideas that he had found in Prussia and brought to the United States, the idea of the professionalization of public education, the professionalization of teachers, the sorting of students into grades, the idea that it wasn't just enough to put a whole bunch of kids into one classroom, that we needed to actually think through pedagogy. We needed to put some time into making sure there were high-quality teachers and instruction in all of our classrooms.  You can go around the country and find a lot of schools named after Horace Mann because what we have today springs forth from many of his ideas, from his commitment to high-quality public education.  The system that he helped create is the one in which many of us grew up in. I went to public schools in Wethersfield, My mother went to public schools in Wethersfield, My father went to public schools in Wethersfield, They met in public schools in Wethersfield, My wife went to public schools in Fairfield, My kids go to public school today. So when I try to figure out why my office got 13,000 phone calls and emails with regard to this nomination, I think it is because public education is so deeply connected to who we feel we are as a country. We feel we are the most powerful, the most affluent Nation on Earth because of our unique commitment to public education; this idea that in order to succeed, you need first to have access to learning, to the ability to read and write, to do arithmetic, to be able to think creatively about science and the history of your country and your people, but also because public education is personal.  When we talk about who we are, when we all think about our own personal biographies, it starts with where we went to school. Not everybody went to public school, but the vast majority of people in this country went to public school.  When you think about who you are today, almost everybody's story runs through a great public school teacher. The things that you learn that make you who you are today, they probably come first and foremost from your parents or from whoever raised you, but, boy, you learn an awful lot about how to relate to people, about values. You make mistakes; you correct those mistakes in school, whether it be in the classroom or out on the playground.

7133,topic-id,716,"Mr.President, I have been so impressed by the large number of Senators who have come to the floor to tell their stories of why public education is so personal and important to them and to their constituents.  I want to thank all of the staff who were here all night long--our clerks, pages, people in the cloakrooms--everyone who has given time of their own to be here to support us to be able to talk about this critical important nomination, the Secretary of  I think all of my colleagues will agree with me that there has been an unprecedented outpouring of concern from across the country about this Cabinet nominee. Why is that? Why is it that the Secretary of Education has brought such emotion and discussion to this country? For a very important reason: Education is a critical part of everyone's life.  The Founders of this country knew that when they determined we in this country were going to have a free public education system. Why? Because they want to make sure that every citizen had the opportunity to read and write and participate in this democracy, a core principle to assure that all of us would have a voice in who our President and elected officials were so we would understand and be educated and make the right decisions.  That core principle is so important to this country and has allowed us for centuries to be the kind of country where we have a middle class. People who are born into poverty know there is a school they can go to, to learn to read and write and get the skills they need to be a participant in our democracy and in our economy. That is what is at stake in this nomination. People across the country are writing in, calling, holding rallies, talking to their neighbors and friends, and letting us know how important this is because they do not want to lose that principle. In this nominee who has been sent to us is a threat to that very basic core value that so many people believe in, in this country; that no matter who you are or where you grow up or how much money you have and who your parents are, you will have that public education, that public school in your community that you will be able to go to.  I was a school board member before I was a U.Senator, before I was in the State senate. Those school board meetings were jammed with parents who wanted to know what was happening in their schools, who would call me at midnight and complain about a school policy and what was going on. As a school board member, I had to listen and respond to that. People value their schools. They want to know they are there. Our schools are the heart of our communities. It is where people from different backgrounds who may be fighting with their neighbor across the street during the day, show up Friday night to cheer together for that football team. It is the center and epicenter of our communities. It is the epicenter of our country, and that is what is at stake in this nomination.  People want the Secretary of Education to be a champion for their public schools. In this nomination that has been sent to us by the President, Betsy DeVos, we have someone who values and speaks out for--and has used her fortune to fight for--something very different. She has denigrated public schools. She says they need to end. She advocates giving our young kids a voucher and telling them to find a private school, leaving behind kids who can't afford to go hours to another school or to pay the extra money the voucher doesn't cover, leaving kids in poverty, robbing really critical money from our schools and from the kids who would be left behind.  Yes, our kids want choices. This is not a debate about charter schools. Many States, including mine, have charter schools, but the difference is, in those States--in my State and many--those charter schools are held accountable, just like the public schools so you know your child is getting the education they have been promised and that it is held accountable to taxpayers.

The Senator from Michigan is absolutely right. Our schools are not about profits. They are not profit centers, and we can never run them that way because there is a core principle that this country was founded on that our forefathers very wisely thought of. They wanted to make sure that every young person in this country, no matter who they were and how much money they had, would get a public education.  You can't run that as a for-profit business because there are kids who come to our schools who are very hard.

They blocked Democrats from asking more than 5 minutes of questions, forcing a vote before all of our questions were answered about her tangled finances and her potential conflicts of interest, and rushed straight from the committee vote to the shortest possible floor debate they could manage.  So I won't spend more time on that today because the truth is that despite Republicans' best efforts, people across the country have learned a whole lot about Betsy DeVos over the past few weeks, and the more they have learned about her, the less they have liked and the more outraged they have become.  Over the past few weeks, people have learned about Betsy DeVos's tangled finances and potential conflicts of interest and how she and her family have given hundreds of millions of dollars to Republicans and extreme conservative groups. They have learned about her failed record, how she spent her career and her inherited fortune pushing anti-public school policies that have hurt so many students in her home State of Michigan and across the country. They have learned about the extreme rightwing ideology that drives her, how she wants to bring her anti-government, free-market-above-all philosophy to an education system that she has called nothing more than ``an industry, and a dead end.''  When people saw her in her hearing, they learned even more. When they watched Betsy DeVos in that hearing room, when they saw it live on the evening news, on ``The Daily Show,'' on ``The View,'' and on many other shows covering it, and one of the many clips that went viral on social media or shared by a friend or a family member, a whole lot of people were introduced to Betsy DeVos for that first time in that hearing, and they were not impressed. People across the country saw a nominee who was clearly ill-informed and confused, who gave a number of very concerning responses to serious and reasonable questions.  In that hearing, Betsy DeVos refused to rule out slashing investments in or privatizing public schools. She was confused that Federal law provides protections for students with disabilities. She didn't understand a basic issue in education policy--the debate surrounding whether students should be measured based on their proficiency or their growth. She argued that guns needed to be allowed in schools across the county to ``protect from Grizzlies.'' And even though she was willing to say that President Trump's behavior toward women should be considered sexual assault, she would not commit to actually enforcing Federal law protecting women and girls in our schools. Those were just a few of the moments in that hearing that made it clear why Betsy DeVos is not qualified to do this job. There were many more.[[Page S821]]  What people saw in that hearing wasn't just a nominee who didn't understand the issues; they saw a nominee for Secretary of Education who clearly didn't think about public education and public schools the way they do. For most people, public education hits really close to home. It is part of who we are, our families, and our communities. So many of us owe everything we have to public education. We have watched our kids and our grandkids and our neighbors get on the bus to go to their local public school. Many of us have taught in public schools or have family or friends who walk into classrooms every single day to help our students learn. And so many of us believe in a commitment to strong public schools that offer an education and opportunity to every student. It is a core part of the American promise.  So when we saw someone nominated to this position who knows so little about public education, who so clearly cares so little about public education, whose strongest connection to public schools is through her dedication to tearing them down, that struck a real chord with a whole lot of people, and they decided to make their voices heard.  Over the past two weeks, we have seen an unprecedented level of engagement from people on this nomination--tens of thousands of calls, thousands of letters, hundreds of people calling in, social media, and many of them have never been involved or made their voices heard before. It made a difference. Right now, every single Democrat is opposing this nomination, and two Republicans who listened to their constituents are joining us. So we are dead even--the first time in history that the Vice President will be called on shortly to cast a tie-breaking vote on a Cabinet nominee. We just need one more Republican to join us to prevent that from happening, one more to help us show the people across this country that their voice matters in this debate, one more to stand with people across the country and say no.  So I am here to finish this debate where we started--standing with students and parents and teachers, with the people of my home State of Washington and across the country who strongly support public schools and true education opportunity for all, and with Democrats and Republicans across the country who have poured their heart and soul into opposing this nominee.

I want to thank my colleagues for presenting their profound thoughts on this most important legislation that we will consider tomorrow. The simple truth is that what this bill does is it removes 24 million people and takes them away from having affordable health care and health insurance, while, at the same time, giving $600 billion in tax cuts for the richest people in Some pundits have described it as one of the biggest transfers of wealth and travesties perpetuated upon the American people in American history.  I am calling upon the Republicans here in this Chamber and President Trump to withdraw this legislation, sit down in a bipartisan way--the way this Congress operated for several hundred years under open rules--and see what we can do to fix what is wrong with the American healthcare system, not do away with it and scrap it in the devastating manner that they have chosen to do so.  The simple truth is, as I said, this guts Medicaid, and it guts health care. Under this $600 billion tax break, think about it, if you make $1 million a year, every year you are going to get a $67,000 a year tax cut. Imagine that. That is more money than the average person makes in America in a year, and they are going to get that every year going forward in perpetuity, while we are saying to a young family who is struggling maybe because someone in the family has cancer or maybe somebody got hurt or injured in an accident, oh, that is going to cost too much money to insure you, you are one of the 24 million who we are getting rid of.  What kind of a country is it that would do something like that? My colleague, Mr.Kennedy, I thought, stated it so well. We are all in this together. That is what insurance does. Life is perilous at best. We don't know who is going to get sick. We don't know who is going to have an accident. It may be when you are elderly; it may be when you are young. That is what health care and health insurance is all about, coming together and making sure that we all are cared for and get the care that we need when we need it.  Senator Kennedy talked about preventive care. If you can catch prostate cancer or if you can catch lung cancer at a stage I or a stage II level, you save a life. But you have to have insurance to go do that and see your doctor. If you don't have insurance, guess what? You don't get a diagnosis until it is at the third or fourth stage level, at which point it is too late, costs tremendous amounts of money to treat, and, most likely, the prospects for survival are not good.  Mr.Speaker, I call on the President and my colleagues, please, the President in particular, honor the promise that you made to the American people in your campaign which resonated with enough people to get you elected President of the United Stand up for the elderly, stand up for urban and rural, stand up for all Americans, stand up for rural communities, and rural hospitals.

If you think I am going to let the Republicans take away near universal health care from my district, the District of Columbia, without a fight, just watch me, and watch my colleagues.  We had a healthcare townhall. Unlike some of the townhalls of my colleagues, there were not people jumping up saying: Why are you taking away my health care? Instead, they were people like  Debbie is a lifetime sufferer of asthma. She also has diabetes. She reached her cap. That meant that the medicine she was on, which cost $10,000 a month, would have to be paid by her. She worked every day. How many of you--how many of us--could pay $10,000 a month, no matter what job we have? That, along with her diabetes, makes her a paradigm of the kind of person whose life and death depends on this bill.  I want to just say a few words not about all of the important information you have had, but about what I call the worst of the worst.  First, let me congratulate my Republican colleagues on doubling down on the number without health care because you double the number without health care. As we are rising with the number who have health care, you now turn downward. We can't possibly live with that, and I don't think the American people will allow you to get away with it.  I think about our hospitals, and people say: Why should we pay any attention to the hospitals? Well, when we get back in the era of uncompensated care, what you will have is the Federal Government will never compensate your hospital, so you will compensate your hospital. We are back in the era of free health care, except there is no such thing as free health care. You and I will be paying for it out of our pockets.  What they do to the tax credits is shameful. Flat tax credits, unrelated to the costs, replace the kind of tax credits we have in the Affordable Care Act, which are just, as you might expect, up and down according to the value of insurance.  What good is a flat tax credit unrelated to the cost of insurance or to your income? Do my Republican colleagues really think they are going to fool anybody with those kinds of replacements?  What is perhaps worst of the worst is the work requirement. You get sick, you can't afford to work, you have got to be on the Affordable Care Act, and you need Medicaid in order to do it. They tell you that you have got to go to work in order to--while you are sick, I guess--get your Get sick, go to work, and qualify for health care under the Republican plan.  Those are just some of the worst of the worst. I have got a whole list here, but I thought it important to focus on who gets hurt and why, and why we are simply not going to let that happen.

7271,topic-id,1141,"I thank you so much, Mr.James There can never be enough time for you to tell these stories and to educate and highlight to all of us the experiences that you have had personally, as well as the importance of Black History Month, and particularly Historically Black Colleges and Universities to the fabric of the United Thank you so much, sir.  Mr.Speaker, as we have been discussing, often grassroots organizations are actually born out of necessity, not only because the system has not worked for them oftentimes, but sometimes because the system has been created, has been reorganized, or is actively fighting against them. Virgin Islanders understand the importance and the value of grassroots organizations. It is our nature and our lifeblood. We are a small people on a small island who have a history that was born out of oppression. So the very need for grassroots organizations and people who are resilient and willing to resist and fight in a passionate manner has been our very nature.  Our first experience with grassroots organizations was in 1733, on the island of John in the Virgin Islands, which is probably the first slave uprising in the Western Hemisphere where a group of 150 slaves decided that they had had enough, and those Akwamu slaves of Ghana decided that they were going to throw off the shackles and rebel and organize themselves. They were so effective at it, Mr.Speaker, that they were able to hold the island of John for 6 months against the Danish The Danes had to organize in such a manner that they brought the French and the Swiss Government to provide assistance to them. The slaves of John were quelled after that rebellion, but it took a grassroots group of organized individuals to be able to do that.  Again, on July 3 of 1848, many people don't know that the Virgin Islands became the second place in the Western Hemisphere to receive emancipation after We did that on July 3, 1848, through the work of General But what people do not know is that John Buddhoe had an enormous organizational group that plotted and planned for months before the actual staging of that uprising, which was so effective and so organized that when they went to storm the fort against an armed militia, the militia didn't realize that all of the gun powder had been taken out of the cannons and had been replaced with molasses. The slaves were so organized and so quiet and kept to themselves so much that they didn't even realize that it had been done.  The Governor of Denmark who was assigned to the Virgin Islands had to sign the emancipation on that date because he knew that this group of people were so organized that that rebellion could take the entire island out. So we received our emancipation earlier than the African Americans received theirs through that organization of grassroots.  Again, in October of 1878, the slaves had been moved not from slavery to slavery but to an organized serfdom where there were labor contracts that had to be signed. People were oppressed and living in what many here would understand as the sharecropping system but was really a serf system. Four women organized the labor rebellion at that time which we in the Virgin Islands call the They were willing to burn the islands down for just wages for themselves and laborers throughout the islands. They forced the signed contracts to have much better wage laws in them, much better terms in them for individuals. Those women were imprisoned and sent to Denmark--many of them burned at the stake for that rebellion. But it was grassroots organizations that were able to do that.  More recently, in the 1950s, there was the creation of the Virgin Islands Labor Union, the organizing of cane workers and field workers. I am proud to say that my own uncle, Raymond Plaskett, was one of the organizers of that. They were able to force the sugar plantation owners, the sugar industry, to sit down and create unionized, collective bargaining labels. But we would be remiss as a people if we kept those organizational skills to ourselves, and we brought that to the United States as well.  Many people know about Denmark Vesey who organized slave rebellions in[[Page H1350]]South He did that as a freeman, coming from the Virgin Islands and understanding that oppression anywhere of anyone was an oppression of himself, and gladly laid down his life and gave up his freedom to help organize the people of Charleston, South Carolina, that my great colleague, James Clyburn, represents to bring freedom to those individuals.  Hubert Harrison from the island of Croix was a civil rights activist. He was the mind of Pan-Africanism, along with Edward Blyden of Thomas, who gave form and shape to Marcus Garvey and his organizing of his Back-to-Africa movement.                              {time}  2115  More recently, Roy Innis, another relative of mine, was one of the leaders of CORE, the Congress of Racial Stokely Carmichael and Malcolm X are people of the Caribbean who have come to the United States and recognized that grassroots organizations must be formed to push for equal rights.  The accomplishments of the civil rights movement have given us much. It created the momentum of the Civil Rights Act, Brown v. Board of Education, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, ended housing discrimination, the desegregation of schools. We saw Democratic political gains and the March on  But we have organized groups still growing today, because equality has not come to its full fruition in There is still income equality, achievement gaps, poverty, unemployment, and an increase in the use of for-profit prisons that have incarcerated Black men disproportionately. Because of that, we have seen other movements now today: Black Lives Matter, founded in 2012 after the death of Trayvon Martin; Moral Mondays, which began in April 2013 by the Reverend William Barber II of Greenleaf Christian Church in Goldsboro, North Carolina, after the Governor's mansion and the State legislature was taken over related to voting rights.  These are injustices that are continuing today, which African Americans and others are standing up for, whether it be Standing Rock or the Muslim ban. We had the March on Washington and the grassroots group Indivisible, which has grown with African Americans and others who stood with their constituents at recent townhalls to make sure that their Congressmen and -women hear their voices on all issues of importance.  Mr.Speaker, we understand that the people of the United States need to understand the importance of grassroots organizations as we end Black History This has been an outstanding time for Congress, as well as the people of America, to hear about the grassroots organizations and how they may close.

7276,topic-id,663,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I oppose this bill. My colleagues on the other side have portrayed this bill as simply a codification of an executive order President Clinton issued. That simply is not the case. This bill makes significant changes to the regulatory process. The bill would require independent agencies to submit rules to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OIRA, for review. Independent agencies do not currently have to get the approval of the White House for regulations they issue. Congress designed independent agencies to be just that, independent. This bill would change that.  In February of 2015, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Jason Chaffetz sent four letters to the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission alleging that the White House had ``an improper influence'' on the FCC's net neutrality plan and that the FCC ``failed to establish the appearance that this rulemaking is independent, fair, and transparent.''  The bill we are considering would enshrine in law that very allegation my esteemed colleague Chairman[[Page H1433]]Chaffetz had concerns about, political interference by the White House with the FCC and other independent agencies. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this bill would increase direct spending by $3 million and reduce revenues by $2 million. These direct spending and revenue effects are caused by the fact that the bill covers independent agencies. CBO has also estimated that the bill would cost Federal agencies an additional $20 million in administrative costs. I am fighting to keep the budget down in this matter.  The bill does not include offsets for any additional spending. The bill also omits critical phrases from Executive Order 12866 that ensures that OIRA reviews do not contradict existing law. For example, the executive order requires agencies to provide the cost and benefits of alternatives to a proposed rule ``unless prohibited by law.'' The bill does not include this exception, and my colleagues on the other side have still not explained why it does not include this language.                              {time}  1615  It is unclear how the bill would impact laws that prohibit agencies from considering costs when setting public health standards.  The Coalition for Sensible Safeguards--an alliance over 150 labor, scientific, good government, health, and environmental groups--sent a letter to the House Members yesterday opposing this bill. That letter said in part:  ``Particularly concerning, H.1009 would in effect rewrite dozens of public interest laws containing congressional mandates that require agencies to prioritize public health and safety and the preservation of the environment, clean air, and clean water over concerns for industry profits. This consequence flows from another key difference between H.1009 and the Executive Orders it purports codify: Whereas the Orders impose their requirements only to the extent consistent with applicable laws, H.1009 recognizes no such limitations.''  Mr.Chairman, this bill would also give OIRA the ability to hold up rulemaking indefinitely.  Under Executive Order 12866, the administrator over OIRA has 90 days to review a rule, and that period can be extended one time for 30 days. This bill would allow OIRA to extend its review ``for any number of additional 30-day periods upon written request by the administrator or the head of the agency.''  The bill also gives the rulemaking agencies the ability to object to an extension of OIRA review period, but it is not realistic to think that an agency would refuse a request for an extension from the White  The Union of Concerned Scientists also sent a letter to House Members opposing this bill. That letter said:       Of particular concern is the fact that H.1009 aims to      codify some of the most burdensome requirements of previous      executive orders while gutting the much-needed flexibility      that the orders provide to Federal agencies in charge of      ensuring science-based protections for the public. Congress      should increase protections for our constituents rather than      preventing agencies from issuing science-based protections.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.

7279,topic-id,535,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  We are opposed to the bill because we have received letters and concerns from a cross section of Americans, a cross section of organizations, who recognize that this is not really a codification of an executive order, but this is overreach on the part of the majority of Congress at this time. They feel that they are able to do it, and so they are going to ram this through.  H.1009 would add another layer of bureaucracy to an already slow rulemaking process. The Consumer Federation of America says:       The bill creates a regulatory working group to provide      input to agencies about how to improve their regulatory      process, including an evaluation of risk assessment      techniques.  It appears like this is what we are going to be doing throughout Oversight and Government Reform, is creating new task forces and new groups to review rulemaking and review regulations at the cost of the taxpayer.  H.1009 would jeopardize the independence of agencies like the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, as well as other independent agencies because it will give the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OIRA, the ability to[[Page H1434]]review significant rules which are outside of their scope now. That is why these agencies are called independent, because Congress wanted them to be independent. We are now giving OIRA overreach into independent agencies.  The Consumer Federation of America goes on to say:       Authorizing OIRA to conduct its own analysis would not only      add pressure from the executive branch and add time and      expense to the already slow regulatory process, but would      also give the special interests seeking to quash a safety      measure yet another avenue to prevent a rule from being      promulgated.  Significantly, independent agencies were created by Congress to prioritize public health and safety, ensure a fair financial marketplace, and consumer privacy. This bill would undermine the authorizing statutes and the missions of these independent agencies by allowing those agencies to be in some way touched by the White  Again, we have the Natural Resources Defense Their letter to all of the Members said:       The bill would also revive legislative language that      Congress repealed elsewhere because it made it impossible to      protect the public.  Specifically, in H.1009, OIRA was charged with ensuring that the regulation imposes the least burden on society. Congress removed such language when it updated TSCA because the phrase had made it impossible for chemical safety regulations to pass judicial muster, even when the chemical was asbestos, well known to be a potential carcinogen.  No one wants to impose unnecessary burdens on society, but the phrase ``least burdensome'' has been interpreted to put an agency in an impossible position of providing that there is no other conceivable way to accomplish its goal of having to cost out every theoretical option.  The reason we are opposed to this bill is because it makes it more difficult for independent agencies to remain independent and not be moved by the White House by political machinations that this Congress is now trying to impose on them.

7293,topic-id,363,"Mr.Chair, this manager's amendment does not fix the flaws in the bill we are considering.  One of the major flaws in the bill is the authority it gives to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs to hold up rules indefinitely. This amendment attempts to address that concern by requiring that any extension be agreed to by both the White House and the agency issuing the rule.  It is just not realistic to believe that an agency whose top official is appointed by the President would tell the White House it cannot have an extension if the White House asks. This amendment also does nothing to address the concern that the bill could interfere with other laws.  The Natural Resources Defense Council sent a letter to House Members opposing H.1009. That letter states:  ``The bill would also revive legislative language that Congress repealed elsewhere because it made it impossible to protect the public. Specifically, in H.1009, OIRA is charged with ensuring that a regulation imposes the least burden on society. Congress removed such language when it updated the Toxic Substances Control Act because the phase had made it impossible for chemical safety regulations to pass judicial muster, even when the chemical was asbestos, well known to be a potent carcinogen.''  This amendment also includes language that says that no funds shall be authorized to carry out the bill. This does not change the fact that the CBO estimates that the bill will result in $3 million in direct spending. That is money that Congress has not appropriated that independent agencies like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau would have to spend.  CBO also estimates that the bill would change the operations of the Federal Reserve, which would result in $2 million in reduced revenues.  CBO also estimates that agencies would have to spend $4 million in appropriated funds each year to comply with the requirements of this bill. Making agencies comply with additional requirements without giving them more money means that agencies will have to choose between which requirements they comply with and which they ignore.

Section 6 of that executive order requires each agency to ``periodically review its existing significant regulations to determine whether any such regulations should be modified, streamlined, expanded, or repealed so as to make the agency's regulatory program more effective or less burdensome in achieving the regulatory objectives.''                              {time}  1700  There can be no real doubt that this executive order covers the review and elimination of duplicative and conflicting regulatory actions.

Agencies already keep the public apprised of their regulatory activities through the easily-accessible websites reginfo.gov and regulations.gov, both of which are managed by the Office of Information and Regulatory Through these websites, the public can search for rules, comments, adjudications, and supporting documents. The public can also access each agency's unified agenda, which contains the regulatory agenda for each agency.  The public can also access a list of pending agency rules. Each of these rules has easily accessible links that can allow the public to obtain further information about the rule, including its status and Executive Order 12866 meetings about the rule.  This amendment does nothing to improve the deficiencies in H.1009, and will force agencies to waste their time and limited resources on work that is already being done.

Mr.Chairman, I oppose this amendment, and it is unfortunate because we believe that this amendment, on its own, is something that would draw bipartisan support. Unfortunately, this amendment is attached to H.1009, because the amendment would make the role of OIRA in the rulemaking process more transparent.  The Government Accountability Office has consistently found that OIRA is not transparent about its involvement in shaping rules. The GAO testified to the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, in March of 2016, that it has made 25 recommendations to OMB to improve its process, but OMB has only implemented six of those recommendations.  This amendment would be a step in the right direction. And as usual, my colleague, the esteemed gentleman from North Carolina, always comes up with rational, well-reasoned amendments and ideas that can be supported across the aisle; and for that, you know, we believe and we are hopeful that Mr.Meadows will work with the committee on a bipartisan basis to pursue these types of productive transparency reforms.

7227,topic-id,725,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Jayapal for her leadership on this Special  I think the message is getting through to the American people: 24 million of us are about to lose health care if this legislation goes through.  In my home State of Maryland, 375,000 people are estimated to be on the chopping block in terms of their health insurance. In my district, the Eighth Congressional District--Montgomery, Frederick, and Carroll Counties--we could have 75,000 or 80,000 people lose their health care.  We were able to cut the uninsured rate in half with passage of the Affordable Care Act 7 years ago, and now they want to turn the clock back and take us in exactly the wrong direction.  If a foreign power like Russia, for example, tried to throw 24 million Americans off of their health care, we would consider it an act of sabotage, aggression, and war, but this is something that is happening inside the country. Nobody knows why they want to do that to older people with this age tax, why they want to do it to children, to people who have special health needs, to the sick.  It is also getting through that there is going to be $600 billion that travels upwards in America through a tax break to the wealthiest That is $600 billion that is moving upwards. This is not a healthcare plan, primarily. It is a wealth transfer plan, while we toss millions of our co-citizens to the curbside.  Seven years ago, we passed the Affordable Care Millions of Americans have gotten health care for the first time, dramatically improving public health in lots of different ways, making sure that people could not be denied insurance coverage because of a preexisting condition, making sure that people in their twenties could stay on their parents' plan, ending lifetime insurance limits, ending annual limits, requiring insurance plans to pay for preventive services like flu shots and cancer screenings and mammograms, dramatically improving the public health. This has been a great success.  Tom Paine once said you cannot ``make a man unknow his knowledge, or unthink his thoughts.'' The American people know that we have made dramatic progress under the Affordable Care We need to be moving more in the direction of covering more people and improving quality and reducing people's premiums and copays and deductibles.  This legislation, the repeal nightmare, goes in exactly the wrong direction. It jacks up everybody's premiums, increases the copays and[[Page H2339]]deductibles, while throwing millions of people to the sidelines.                              {time}  1700  I want to make one final point, which is the message has gotten through. The public opinion polls are showing that the American people are turning sharply against this terrible repeal plan, which means here in Congress the organizers of the plan are getting increasingly desperate, and they are making deals.  One of the deals that they have made with some upstate Republicans apparently is colloquially known around here as the Buffalo bribe or the Kinderhook kickback or the Hudson hustle. Someone called it today the Empire State enticement or simply Niagara calls.  There are some Republicans in upstate New York who are very nervous about voting for this bill, so what they have extracted is a promise, a very special provision that doesn't apply to the other 49 It applies only in New York, and it would say that New York State alone cannot assess its counties to participate financially in the Medicaid system. There are lots of other States that do it, but only New York could not do it. It could not assess the counties, except it could assess any jurisdiction with more than 5 million people.  Gee, what do you think that is? Maybe New York  Now, the problem with this other than it being sordid and unseemly--this Buffalo bribery, this Hudson hustle--is that it is unconstitutional because the Federal Government can try to persuade States to do something by offering money, but it cannot extract a concession through coercion, and it cannot treat one State differently from every other It violates the principle of equal sovereignty.  I would just say, Congresswoman Jayapal, this legislation is not only reactionary, taking us back to a past nobody wants to go back to, and not only dangerous, but it is also unconstitutional because of the Buffalo bribe that is built into it.

7361,topic-id,2298,"Mr.Speaker, I love magic, and I bet a lot of people out there watching today love magic, too. Ever since I was a kid, I loved the cup tricks, the card tricks, and the rabbit coming out of the hat. When I was in college, I even used to entertain at elementary school birthday parties, helping to pay my way through college.  The key move in magic, as you know, Mr.Speaker, is the sleight of hand. I looked up the definition of ``sleight of hand'' in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, which defines it as a cleverly executed deception.  A sleight of hand is also sometimes called a prestidigitation, quick fingers, or legerete de la main, which is the French phrase for ``lightness of hand.'' It is defined as the set of closely related techniques used by a stage magician to manipulate the perceptions of the audience.  Sleight of hand depends on the use of psychology, careful stage misdirection, constant blabbering, and strategic confusion to distract the audience.  Mr.Speaker, the President of the United States has been masterfully deploying sleight of hand ever since his inauguration. With his nonstop tweeting and his incessant mad antics, the President distracts us from the real action, which is what is happening here in We are witnessing a magic trick on the world's largest stage, the auditorium of American democracy. And we, the people, are the captive, bedazzled, and totally distracted audience of the The tweets are a massive sleight of hand distracting us from the serious destruction of public policy and law that is taking place right here in Congress.[[Page H1290]]                                {time}  1700  I want to say, at the outset, I prefer to think of this as a magic trick because the alternative that the President simply can't control himself is almost too horrific to contemplate.  The Constitution does have a way of dealing with that problem, too, and you can find it in the 25th  Today, we are going to assume that all of this is a magic show. I used to coach kids' soccer. And when I coached soccer, I would always tell the kids: Don't bunch. Keep your eye on the ball. Stay in your lane and pass the ball.  Without fail, the youngest kids who are just starting out, they all chase the ball. They move around the field in a big clump, a big mob. And I would say: Don't follow the mob that is following the ball. Go to where the ball is going to be going.  When they are young, they don't know how to do it.  I think that advice applies here as well to America, to the body politic. Don't follow the mob that is following the ball. Let's not be distracted full time by all the tomfoolery and tweetfoolery.  There are important and dangerous things happening right here in Congress right now. While the President is tweeting insults and fake news and inflating his slender college victory and the size of his inaugural crowd and making fun of Meryl Streep and chatting about Nordstrom's department store and talking about how he is going to make Mexico pay for his wall and so on, what is taking place in Congress is the systematic dismantling of the regulatory apparatus that the American public depends on for clean air, clean water, safe food, a decent environment, and control of criminality in the country.  The fundamental political action that we must be paying attention to now is the dismantling of the regulatory apparatus of the Federal Government, which is happening every day right here in the Halls of This is the apparatus that protects our food, our air, our water, our health care, our financial system, the ability of people to invest safely on Wall Street, occupational safety and health for our workers. All of this is being attacked in terrifying and often invisible ways.  Behind the scenes, while the wizard of odd convenes a dinner in Mar-a-Lago where he entertains a national security crisis discussion in full view of other diners who begin to tweet out and Facebook out what they are seeing happen, while all of that is happening, Congress is rolling back environmental protections to protect streams, rivers, and drinking water from pollution. They are savaging the rules that restrict the volume of greenhouse gas emissions that are leaked into the atmosphere, destabilizing our climate system. Check out H.38 and 36.  While the distractor in chief whines about leaks, while his whole campaign was based on leaks of emails that were captured by Russian agents working to get him elected, in Congress, they are rolling back financial regulations which ensure that workers have retirement savings options, H.66, and which protect consumers from excessive financial risks, H.78.  They have also targeted and rolled back labor regulations that promote safe and healthy workplaces and fair employment practices, H.37.  Amazingly, while President Trump's National Security Adviser, General Flynn, was forced to resign when it was revealed that he had been colluding with Russians to lift the sanctions that the Obama administration had imposed on Russia, here in Congress, we are passing joint resolutions to rescind anticorruption regulations that required oil and gas companies to report monetary payments that they made to foreign governments, H.41.  So Trump tweets about leaks, while his administration is one vast leak to the And here, Members of the GOP are working to throw an invisibility and secrecy cloak over corporate payments being made to foreign governments and corporations.  While the world is distracted by all of the sleight of hand, this Congress is passing bills to give government back to giant corporations and special interests that care not for the common good but simply for their own bottom line.  Mr.Speaker, as a freshman, I have been here for only 8 weeks. I have to tell you that I am disappointed that I have not voted on a single bill in the House Judiciary Committee that has had so much as a hearing. Yes, I want to repeat that. We have voted on five bills since I got here and not one of them has had a hearing.  Now, I come from the Maryland State Senate where I proudly served for 10 years as a State senator. When we had a bill coming up, no bill could be brought to the floor without a hearing first, and anybody who wanted to come testify on the bill could come testify on it. Now, that is not practicable here in the U.However, we could at least have experts relating to the bill and people who are affected by the bill come in and testify, but we haven't done that in the House Judiciary Instead, we voted on a series of bills which, to my mind, dramatically curtail the public interest.  Yesterday, we voted on a bill to dismantle, essentially to put into a stifling straightjacket, the class-action mechanism that has been used over the decades to vindicate the interest of people who are victims of sex discrimination, victims of race discrimination, victims of toxic torts, victims of asbestos poisoning. We voted basically to trash class action yesterday without even so much as a bill.  Now, on some of the other bills, it was said to me: Well, there were hearings in prior One Member said: We had a hearing on that back in 2012.  This is 2017, 5 years later. But on this particular bill that I am talking about, nobody even heard the bill. There was no hearing on it. It was simply brought up for a vote. That is irresponsible legislation. That is not real democracy when you don't even have a hearing and people who are affected by the legislation don't have the opportunity to come and talk about it.  Now, they are not having hearings because they think--and they are probably right--we're not paying attention. What are we paying attention to? We are paying attention to the magician. We are paying attention to the wizard of odd. We are paying attention to the tweets instead.  The good news is that the audience is starting to wise up. The whole country is waking up to the profound dangers of the administration's financial and political entanglements with Russia, with the Russian corporate and governmental elite.  Just this week, the National Security Adviser, Mr.Flynn, resigned after reports came out about his communications with the Russian Ambassador while President Obama was still in office, communications dealing with the lifting of sanctions on Russia, communications that General Flynn lied about and was forced from office because of it. He misled Vice President Mike Pence and other officials about his conversations with the diplomat, which was being monitored and recorded by the intelligence community.  Now, Mr.Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, my fellow Americans, let's think about this for a moment. As a former chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Mr.Flynn was no innocent about the world of spy versus spy. He must have known that his telephone call with the Russian Ambassador was being monitored and recorded. If he really wanted to go rogue and operate on his own without the permission and the license of President Trump, he never would have allowed that telephone conversation to be recorded. But he did allow it to be recorded. He made the call with presumable full knowledge that other people in the intelligence community would be listening in on it, which leads me to the inescapable, logical conclusion that Flynn knew that, in making that call, he enjoyed the full support of the one person above him who could remove him from his job, the President of the United  Now, do I know that? No, I don't know it. I surmise it. How are we going to know whether or not this is true? How do we get to the bottom of the Russian connection in the campaign? How do we get to the bottom of the Russian connection in the Trump administration?  We need to have a full, complete, independent investigation by experts, like the 9/11 Commission, which gets to the bottom of this profound danger, this dagger pointed at the throat of American democracy.[[Page H1291]]  Mr.Speaker, everybody loves magic, I think. Everybody loves the enchantment of being fooled, of being distracted, of being diverted. That is why people go to magic shows. It is diverting. It is amusing. It is fun.  Everybody loves a great magician, too. None was greater in our history than the great Houdini, who dazzled the world with his extraordinary optical illusions and effects, his amazing ability to simulate telepathy and telekinesis.  Houdini also had a very strong ethical and professional code about being a magician. He never revealed a trick. More importantly, he never tried to fool people in order to defraud them. He never tried to fool people in order to humiliate them. He never tried to fool people in order to take away their rights. He never tried to fool people in order to demoralize and crush them or to strip them of their freedom. He never tried to fool people in order to victimize them.  Indeed, in the 1920s, Mr.Houdini channeled all of his magnificent energy away from doing his magic shows and instead put it into the separate but related task of exposing psychics, mediums, con men, charlatans, and practitioners of the occult and the dark arts who did take advantage of people's good will, who did take advantage of people's impressionability to defraud them, to take their money, their belongings, and to distract them from the real world, and to undermine the moral and ethical principles that should govern human behavior and must govern social life.  Although Houdini is no longer with us, he has great heirs today in socially responsible magicians like the Amazing Randi and Penn &  Already millions of Americans themselves--millions of us in the audience--have woken up to the fact that we have been pulled into an irrational and dangerous fantasy world, an echo chamber of malignant narcissism, cruelty, and paranoia.  It is time for all of us to stop being distracted, to stop being bedazzled, and pay attention to the real game, which is, one, trying to get America to join with Vladimir Putin, a dictator and an autocrat who said that the single greatest catastrophe of the 20th century was the dissolution of the Soviet Union, in order to create an international league of dictators, demagogues, and despots to violate human rights and crush liberal democracy; and, two, to dismantle at home the public regulatory infrastructure which protects our land, our air, our water, our climate, our liberties, our freedoms, our equal rights, and our capacity to function as the greatest democracy on Earth and to function as an efficient and effective government meeting the needs of the people.  The magicians out there--there aren't many--but you have a special obligation to help us blow the whistle, and you are doing it. But it is really the American people--it is all of us who must stand up.  The Constitution talks about three branches of government. Article I is Article II is the executive. Article III is the judiciary. Let's call Congress the first branch.  But when you think about it, what is even more important than the Congress is the trunk, the roots of democracy. Everything grows up from the people. The branches are out there, but Congress works for the people. The President works for Congress and the people. The Supreme Court and the judiciary work for the people.  It is time for the people to dissolve the spells that have been cast over the country, to say this is a democracy. We operate by the Constitution and the rule of law.

7365,topic-id,453,"Mr.Speaker, we should be joined momentarily by Representative Sheila Jackson I want to close out, though, my own thoughts by responding to something I have been hearing over the last week here in the Halls of  Now that it is clear from our intelligence agencies, 16 of them, including the CIA, the FBI, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, and so on, that Vladimir Putin had a deliberate campaign of espionage, cyber sabotage, propaganda, and fake news to undermine American democracy in the 2016 election, and now that it is clear that there were high-level contacts between Trump associates and officials of the Russian Government, it is no longer being denied by anybody on either side of the aisle. What I have started to hear is, well, sure, they tried to hack our election, and, sure, they leaked thousands of emails, and, sure, they changed the dynamics of the campaign and what people were talking about in the campaign, but there is no proof that they stuffed any ballot boxes or they hacked into the computers. And that is true; we don't know that they stuffed any ballot boxes or hacked into computers, and we will have to see if anything comes out about that when we finally get to do a real comprehensive investigation. But, Mr.Speaker, the reality is that we should be terrified and appalled and outraged that they were allowed to go as far as they did.  How many people in this body would accept a foreign entity coming into our congressional districts and spending millions or hundreds of thousands of dollars against us, hacking into our computers, releasing our emails, and completely changing the dynamics of the campaign?  So when I hear from colleagues that, well, yes, they distorted the campaign, they hacked into the campaign, but they didn't steal the election, I think that they are making a distinction with no difference at all. If you derail the campaign, you kidnap the campaign, you hijack the campaign, you have altered the outcome of the election, especially one in which your opponent gets 2.9 million votes more than you did, especially in an election where you were able to torture out only the slenderest of electoral college victories in three States by 70,000 votes.                              {time}  1730  So I simply reject the constant claim that I am hearing from colleagues, Mr.Speaker, that we don't need to worry about Russian subversion of the 2016 election because it only affected the campaign; it didn't necessarily affect the election outcome. To influence the campaign is to influence the election outcome.  Mr.Speaker, I am seeing Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee is not here, so I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgH1289.txt,99999999999999,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,16.0,February

7128,topic-id,717,"Thank you, Mr. Mr.President, the nomination of Betsy DeVos has triggered an outcry of deep public opposition. It has also inspired an outpouring of popular support for public schools.  Public education is what has made America great. It is at the heart of the American dream. Our schools are much more than just a collection of classrooms. They are expressions of our communities and our values.  This is a lesson I learned from my parents. My father was the school custodian in a public school. He took tremendous pride in ensuring that the school was clean, in good repair, safe, and welcoming to the students. He was part of the public school team entrusted with our community's children. He, along with the teachers, principals, and every staff member at the school were deeply committed to public education. We saw that commitment each and every day. He spoke of that commitment when he came home in the evening. The teachers would do much more than what was asked of them to ensure that students got the best opportunities and best education. Everyone in our school was pulling for our children. That is the way it should be, and that is the way it must be. This was free public education, the hallmark of America, and perhaps one of the most important contributions that we have made to progress, prosperity, and economic growth, not only here in the United States but around the globe. That is what we are talking about today--the future of public education.  It is that kind of commitment to public education, going in early, working hard--I can remember of course in the wintertime, when the storms would rage through Rhode Island, it was not uncommon for my father and his colleagues to be out there on a Sunday afternoon, if the storm was bad enough, shoveling all night long so that Monday morning the school was open for the children, the teachers could get there, and the food could be prepared. That is the type of commitment that has been evidenced throughout our history when it comes to public education. That investment of effort but also of trying to understand and trying to improve public education has been at the heart of what we have all done.  Indeed, I believe it is that kind of commitment to public education that has caused millions of Americans to speak up about the nomination of Betsy Teachers, parents, and community members have been calling across the country, writing, emailing, urging the Senate to reject her nomination. I have received over 12,500 calls and messages from Rhode Islanders, an unprecedented negative response to a Presidential nominee.  We are the smallest State in the We have a population of just over 1 million people, and we understand that even for the most challenging and publicized issues, we rarely get this type of response. It is because this nomination touches a nerve. It touches a nerve with people who are products of public schools because they honor the success of public schools, but it also touches the nerves of people who may not have attended public schools because they recognize the value, the necessity, the need for good public education. Without it, we can't move forward as a nation; without it there is no alternative except typically very expensive private arrangements to educate our children.  Once again, free public education has been a hallmark of this country. It might have been one of the most dominant factors in ensuring equality. Our country is based on equality--equality before the law. But without a good education, how can one be equal? How can one understand their rights and use their rights, understand their abilities and use their abilities?  Our constituents all across the country want a champion for public education at the helm of the Department of They want someone committed to public schools, someone knowledgeable about the Federal role in education, and they have determined that Betsy DeVos is not that person. Having looked at her record and viewed her performance during the confirmation hearings, they are telling us that she is the wrong choice to lead the Department of Education, and we should heed their pleas.

7260,topic-id,1469,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague, Stacey Plaskett from the Virgin Islands, for taking this assignment and making sure that the Congressional Black Caucus continues its conversation with America, and to inform people on issues that are important to us, and also reflecting on how important African-American history is, not just to us, but to this country.  It is African-American history that made this country great in the first place. How our civil rights groups and people of the same kind, not necessarily the same color, came together to make this a more perfect union.  So today what I wanted to do was actually talk about some of the civil rights organizations that changed this country, made it better, made it possible for me to be here, and compare and talk about some of the movements that we see today that are making some of the same differences for the next generation. It is just a shame that in 2017 we are still fighting the same fights we fought 50 years ago for voting rights, for equality, and all of those things.  So when I say I want to talk about some of those organizations, I want to talk about organizations like SCLC, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference; or CORE, the Congress of Racial Equality; or SNCC, the Student Non-Violent Coordinating They all played an important role in launching grassroots movements that succeeded in ensuring more equality for African  Sit-ins, bus boycotts, marches, voter registration drives, and other protests--these grassroots movements spread across the South, including my home State of  Let's just talk about one specific incident. September 9, 1960, the Woolworth store lunch counter in New Orleans closed early.  What was the reason?  Seven members of the Congress of Racial Equality, five Black students and two White students, decided to hold a sit-in demonstration to protest Jim This was the first-ever sit-in in the city.  The seven students were like so many other students across the South at the time who were using nonviolent action to change the country. In fact, let me read their names because many of them I knew.  In fact, one, Jerome Smith, who was a Southern University student the year before, is actually still on the battlefield in Louisiana not only coaching Little League, but fighting for criminal justice reform and financial and economic equality.  You also had Rudy Lombard from Xavier University, a freedom fighter; Archie Allen from Dillard University; Bill Harrell from Tulane; William Harper, who was at LSU; Hugh Murray, who was also at Tulane; and Joyce Taylor, who intended to enroll at Southern  Fortunately, unlike others who held sit-ins, these seven Southern students didn't have milkshakes thrown on them. They were not beaten or bloodied. The seven students sat down at 10:30. Six police officers were on hand to keep the peace and did not try to remove the students. The students sat there determined for 2 hours.  Because of the demonstration, Woolworth blinked first. They decided to close early that day and they closed at 12:30, after the students had sat there for 2 hours.  These seven students and so many other civil rights activists are the shoulders on which we all stand. Unfortunately, the fight for equality is not over. We see this most clearly when we look at our criminal justice system. To date, the organization Black Lives Matter has launched a grassroots movement that has succeeded in exposing police brutality and making it front-page news.  The movement began in 2012, after the death of Trayvon Martin, who was killed by a neighborhood watchman on February 26, 2012. I would be remiss if I did not mention that yesterday was the fifth anniversary of Trayvon Martin's death.  Black Lives Matter is focused on all of the ways Black people are disempowered by the State, including police brutality. In addition to exposing police brutality and making it front-page news, Black Lives Matter, like the organizations during the civil rights movement, has attracted a diverse coalition of supporters.  The reality is not lost on African As I mentioned before, two of the protesters who sat in at the Woolworth store in Louisiana were If you go back to Philadelphia, Mississippi, where they found the three bodies of the civil rights workers who were registering people to vote, you saw Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner--one African American and two White Americans--who stuck together fighting in justice.  King said so eloquently: ``Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.''  So as we talk about our organizations like SNCC, CORE, and SCLC, and we talk about Black Lives Matter, it reminds me of the time when King was sitting in the Birmingham jail, and seven--eight White religious leaders in the South criticized King, asking: Why he couldn't wait. Why did he have to force the issue? And why, as an outsider, he was down in Birmingham?  King responded and initially said: ``I don't usually answer criticism because I would be doing it all day, but because I believe you to be eight men of goodwill, I will take the time to answer.''  I just want to read you an excerpt of his answer because I think it is so appropriate when we think of our groups that are coming up now.  He said: ``I think I should give the reason for my being in Birmingham, since you have been influenced by the argument of `outsiders coming in.' I have the honor of serving as president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, an organization operating in every Southern state, with headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia.''  It then goes on to say: ``So I am here, along with several members of my staff, because we were invited here. I am here because I have basic organizational ties here.''  Then he goes on to say: ``Beyond this, I am in Birmingham because injustice is here. Just as the eighth-century prophets left their little villages and carried their `thus saith the Lord' far beyond the boundaries of their hometowns; and just as the Apostle Paul left his little village of Tarsus and carried the gospel of Jesus Christ to practically every hamlet and city of the Greco-Roman world, I too am compelled to carry the gospel of freedom beyond my particular hometown. Like Paul, I must constantly respond to the Macedonian call for aid.''  So when you think of Black Lives Matter and other protests, the first comment is: We are outside agitators; why are they here?  They are here because injustice is here. So all marginalized groups must stand together in the fight against injustice. This was important during the civil rights movement and it is important now.  In that spirit, African Americans fully recognize the importance of not only joining movements in support of their rights, but also joining movements in support of the rights of others.  Standing Rock: Most recently, African Americans and others have stood with Native Americans at Standing Rock to protest the Dakota Access pipeline.  The Muslim ban: We have stood with the Muslim community to protest the Trump administration's controversial Muslim ban.  Then there was the Women's March, which was led by a diverse coalition of organizers and attracted millions of protesters across the Nation and the world to protest sexism and other gender issues. African Americans participated in the march, including several members of the Congressional Black  Then we can talk about indivisible. African Americans and others have stood with their fellow constituents at recent townhalls to make sure that their Congressman or Congresswoman hears their voices on the Affordable Care Act and other issues. Some of[[Page H1346]]these exercises in civic participation have been inspired by the guidebook ``Indivisible,'' which, as the authors state, provides best practices on getting elected officials to listen.  Then there is Moral Mondays with Reverend William It began in 2013 after the Republicans took over the Governor's mansion and State legislature in the Tar Heel State for the first time in more than a century. On what was supposed to be the first and only Monday protest, Barber led a small group of clergy and activists to the State legislature to protest the State Republicans' efforts to block Medicaid expansion, cut unemployment benefits, and roll back voting rights. The next Monday, hundreds of protesters showed up, and hundreds soon became thousands. These protests became known as Moral Mondays, and they eventually spread across the  So let me just say that from SCLC to SNCC, to CORE, to ``Indivisible,'' to Moral Mondays and Reverend Barber, to Black Lives Matter, people of like mind that fight for justice come together. And that, we learned from the civil rights movement, and that is our contribution to date to Black History Month and celebrating that civil protests and civil disobedience can change and make this a more perfect union.

Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Congressman Sablan: I write to support H.6401,      critical legislation that will provide short-term relief from      the labor shortage facing the Commonwealth that threatens our      growing economy and public health.       The latest report from Bureau of Economic Analysis      indicates the Commonwealth economy grew for the fourth      consecutive year. A growing economy needs a qualified      workforce. And while there are now more U.workers than      foreign workers in the Northern Marianas for the first time      in decades, there are still not enough to meet the labor      demand. The temporary increase in the number of Commonwealth-     Only Transitional (CW) workers provided in your bill will      particularly help small businesses retain the workers needed      to maintain operations.       Most importantly, the Commonwealth's only hospital, stand      to lose critical staff including 34 staff nurses, two      infection control nurses, a clinical laboratory scientist and      specialists in mammography, ultrasonography without the      relief provided in H.6401.       Building a qualified U.workforce in the Northern      Marianas is a priority for my administration. The CW worker      fee increase in the legislation will provide additional      funding for efforts to recruit, educate, and train these      workers and establish a permanent pool of workers to fill      local jobs.       H.6401 is critical to continued economic growth in the      Northern The bill has my full support.

7206,topic-id,2052,"Mr.President, I ask to have printed in the Record some of the finalist essays written by Vermont high school students as part of the seventh annual State of the Union essay contest conducted by my office.  The material follows:          EMMA CARLSON, ST JOHNSBURY ACADEMY JUNIOR (FINALIST)       America is one of the wealthiest countries in the world.      Home to world-leading companies in technology, consumer      goods, pharmaceutical, and financial industries, the U.has      a gross domestic product of 18.56 trillion dollars. And yet,      poverty impacts people in both rural and urban areas who are      working for minimum wage, elderly people who must live on a      fixed income, and those who have lost their jobs. For a      country as rich and resourceful as ours, we have the ability      to solve the complex situation of poverty if we work together      as a nation to find a solution.[[Page S439]]       Despite all of our wealth, we still have nearly 15% of      people living below the poverty line. In 2016, the poverty      threshold for a family of four is $24,036 per year. These      individuals are forced to make difficult choices between      paying for food, medicine, heat, gas, or rent. Today we are      seeing increase in the loss of manufacturing jobs, causing      many additional people to become unemployed and drop below      the poverty line. We are losing these jobs due to      technological advances that have replaced a lot of workers,      while other jobs have been moved to lower-cost countries      because the labor to perform those jobs is much cheaper.      Another cause of long term poverty is the lack of access to      high-quality early education. In addition, children of      families in poverty do not consistently receive a college      education, and therefore, lack the skills and opportunities      to acquire a well-paying job in today's economy.       Poverty in America needs to be solved for every individual      to receive opportunities to live a quality life. There are      several political debates as to how we can most effectively      reduce poverty, and as a result, very little gets      accomplished toward achieving this goal and poverty continues      to be on the rise. The first step toward helping to lower      poverty rates is to create more jobs in The majority      of companies in the U.are small businesses. If the      government can help small businesses thrive, it can create      more jobs for those in poverty. By pulling families out of      poverty, it gives their children better opportunities to      receive a quality education, making it easier for them to get      jobs to support their future families. This can help to break      the vicious cycle of children being born into poverty without      any control over it. In addition, we need to make a basic      college education available and affordable to any citizen who      is willing to obtain one. Without addressing the fundamental      needs of education and jobs, the cycle of poverty in America      will not be resolved.       Our politicians need to recognize that poverty is a serious      problem, and must work together on common goals towards      defeating it. There are many solutions and sometimes there      will need to be compromises as to what the best solution may      be. If we do not solve this poverty problem, our nation will      continue to decline and overall living conditions will become      worse for a lot more people.    MASON CHARLEBOIS, VERGENNES UNION HIGH SCHOOL JUNIOR (FINALIST)       We do not live in a democracy anymore. We live in an      oligarchy obscured by the word democracy. For too long our      country, a nation established upon ideals of impeccable      freedoms and liberties, has discarded the will and      determination of the American people. The rich get richer      while the poor grow poorer and there seems to exist no hope,      no persistence, and no optimism in the people, but instead      there resides feelings of despair and anguish. Why would I      blame them? Today in our nation's capital, almost every bill      that is made, every law that is passed, every donation given      proclaims in a final respect, a refusal to aid the poor and      middle class of the United The loyalties, affairs,      and interests of our government no longer lie with the      American populace, but with immense multinational      corporations and the wealthy who value profit over people.       If you don't believe me, allow me to introduce some      daunting numbers. According to Inequality.org, ``Income      disparities have become so pronounced that America's top 10      percent now average nearly nine times as much income as the      bottom 90 percent.'' But wait, there's more. They also      mention ``Americans in the top I percent tower stunningly      higher. They average over 38 times more income than the      bottom 90 percent.'' Citizens of the United States, this is      the most critical issue of the century and possibly the      history of This is not something that can be      disregarded as irrelevant because this not only hurts you, it      hurts every aspect that makes this country for the people.       So, what can we, the American people, do to vanquish this      unjust society that we find ourselves giving in? First, we      start by establishing a tax on institutions that make more      than $1,000,000 a year. For years, these monarchs of trade      and commerce have sneaked through loopholes in legislation      and haven't been paying their taxes. This is unacceptable in      the country this great nation of Secondly, we      dissolve major institutions or establishments that are taking      advantage of Americans every single day. Wells Fargo, Capital      One and Citigroup are just some of the financial institutions      paying their fair share. Finally, it is vital for Americans      to be educated on these issues in the first place. That is      why I support a universal childcare schooling program where      no one will be denied access to education based on their      annual income. When we have an informed public, we will be      one step closer to ``the people's'' victory: your victory.       To close, I would like to introduce a quote from the late      Thomas Jefferson who said ``Experience demands that man is      the only animal which devours his own kind, for I can apply      no milder term to the general prey of the rich on the poor.''      Change never takes place from the top down. It takes place      when people, just like you and me, rise up in peaceful      protest and say we want a different We want change.          RAINBOW CHEN, WINOOSKI HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR (FINALIST)       The ``American Dream'' states that every American has the      opportunity to become successful if they work hard. In      reality, the American Dream is a blatant lie that falsely      guides citizens on an idealistic path. If our country truly      wants to make the American Dream a reality, we must provide      citizens with the opportunity to best change their lives: a      new education system. Education will help us give the poor      what they need, help vulnerable children from birth to five,      and create a meaningful life for our citizens.       Right now, a poor citizen has a slim chance of rising to      middle or upper-middle class. A study from the Pew Charitable      Trust says that 70% of lower income households stay in the      lower income bracket; only 30% rise to middle class or high-     income status. In 2015, nearly 48% of Americans live in low-     income and impoverished situations, including my own family.      Vermont may only have a 12% poverty rate, but disadvantages      in resources, opportunities, and financial support have      prevented me from reaching the same level of achievement and      opportunity as my middle class peers. We need to readjust      food stamp and welfare programs to support low-income      families. Educational opportunities for the poor must become      equitable so that low-income students can perform as well as      their middle-class peers. If education becomes equitable, we      may see more people working and fewer children suffering.       A study from Concordia University showed that ``. . . high-     quality education early in a child's life leads to continued      success later in school, at work . . . spending resources      toward education earlier in life is much more fiscally      responsible than paying later to help a struggling child      catch up.'' Our country tends to take early childhood for      granted, ignoring the benefits of early education. If we      increased paid maternity/paternity leave, children could      engage with their families for a longer part of their      childhood, helping them become the strong leaders of the      future throughout early education and their futures.       A flaw in the education system consistently prevents all      students from achieving their potential. Schools need to push      away from what a Purdue University study calls the      ``superchicken'' model, which studies the ``best chickens of      the coop''. This study showed that after separating the      superchickens from the normal chickens, the superchickens      pecked each other to death while the regular chickens proved      successful regardless of productivity rates. In our      educational system, we cannot place the ``smartest kids'' in      one system, as it will damage all children's education.       Overall, education must be changed. Everyone needs access      to learning opportunities, an equitable education for the      poor and the average, and revitalize public school funding to      ensure that all schools receive a fair share of distributed      money. Fixing education will allow America to fix poverty,      improve early childhood development, and allow more citizens      to reach the American As the best country in the      world, we need to create a possible dream, which means fixing      the broken rungs in society's ``ladder of success''.          JESSICA DAIGLE, OXBOW HIGH SCHOOL JUNIOR (FINALIST)       My fellow Americans, I have one question for you. How do      we, the United States of America, have the best economy in      the world, yet can't afford to give our people basic      necessities? We're one of the richest countries in the world,      but we can't feed our population, or give them healthcare?      Why are so many people living without a roof over their head?      We can't run from these problems; we must face them and find      a solution.       First and foremost, we must address our food problem. In      2015 alone, 42.2 million Americans lived in food insecure      households; 13.1 million were children. How are we supposed      to build a strong future if we can't feed our children? In      fact, one in five children are at risk of hunger. In Latino      and African American societies, it's one in three. This is an      urgent problem we must fix. We must stop throwing away edible      food and find a way to give it to those without. Every year      in the US, 40% of food is thrown away. This equates to $165      billion's worth. All of this uneaten food could feed 25      million In order to feed those in need, we must      stop wasting resources. We cannot keep throwing away      perfectly edible food.       Healthcare is another demanding issue. In 2014, 29 million      Americans didn't have health insurance; that's ten percent of      our population. And, in that 29 million, 4.5 million were      children. Those statistics are unacceptable. We must find a      solution. In 2010, President Obama tried with the Affordable      Care Act- commonly known as This worked well, as      20 million people were able to get insurance. Yet,      Presidential Elect Donald Trump wants to repeal it. If he      does, he must instate a new and more affordable healthcare      system. We cannot go without it. What would those 29 million      people do? They're relying on Obamacare, and can't afford to      be without it.       Homelessness is defined as a social crisis in the United      States today, as it should be, considering this fact: on any      given night, about half a million Americans experience      homelessness. Out of those people, 15% have been homeless for      over a year, 50% are over the age of fifty, and 8% are      veterans. Not to mention the 1.14 million veterans who are at      risk of homelessness. Again, we're one of the richest      countries in the world, yet we can't afford to house our      population? We can't house those who fought for our country,      for[[Page S440]]     our freedom? We must do something. We must create more safe      havens or emergency shelters. We can't allow so many      Americans to be living in such horrible conditions.       Clearly, these tasks will be difficult to take on. If we      want to boast about our prestigious economy and wealth, we      must first fix our problems with poverty in the lower class.      We cannot be considered an esteemed country until every last      one of us has food, healthcare, and a roof over our      heads.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-24-pt1-PgS438-4.txt,1010,SOCIAL JUSTICE MOVEMENTS,2017.0,24.0,March
7362,topic-id,827,"Mr.Speaker, I really appreciate participating in this Special Order hour about things that, I think, the American people really ought to be caring about.  The minute that Donald Trump took the oath of office and put his hand in the air, he was in violation of the law. It is just a fact that the Trump Hotel, which is in the old post office building--there is a very explicit contract that says no elected official may enter into a contract for that hotel and profit from the business in that hotel. There was a lawsuit that was filed. It is still pending.  You may not think that is a really big deal, but how about this: What if there were delegations from somewhere else in the world, some country that really wanted to curry favor with the United States of America, and decided a really good way to do it would be to move our delegation to stay at the Trump Hotel?                              {time}  1715  Maybe we could have a big gala, we could have a party, and we could make a lot of money from that. And guess what. Maybe the President of the United States would notice that we are spending money in a hotel from which he gains a profit, and that would be a really swell idea.  Well, actually, the Framers of the Constitution thought that was not such a grand idea and very explicitly put into the Constitution something that would prohibit any foreign government from influencing U.policy. They were worried about the King of They were worried about They were worried about other countries having too much influence on the United States by currying favor with the President and the decisionmakers, and so they introduced and put into the Constitution very explicitly what they called the Emoluments Clause in Article I, section 9 of the  While ``emoluments'' is certainly not a word we use in regular conversations--emoluments, I never used it before this and never heard of it before this, actually--it is a concept that is part of our Constitution, and it is very simple: that no government official should receive benefits of any kind--of any kind--from a foreign government. President Trump is clearly violating that constitutional principle.  So, unlike any Presidents before him, President Trump has actually refused to fully separate himself and his family from his business dealings. It is also very unusual, of course, that we haven't seen his tax returns, which has been pretty standard for any President to release his tax returns, and it has been a requirement for the Cabinet that Mr.Trump has exacted from those nominees.  Because of his business holdings, Trump and his family are constantly--constantly--receiving benefits from other countries, whether it is foreign governments renting that space at the Trump Hotel in D.or the loans and business agreements that the Trump organization has with China, Russia, and many other countries. We don't know them all. We haven't seen them all. That would be in his tax returns and all the different sections of the tax return, his holdings in Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, which he has refused to put into a blind trust.  So it is troubling enough that President Trump and his family are profiting off the Presidency, but now it is becoming clearer that this lack of ethics could threaten our national security and national interests. So if you haven't cared until now, you ought to start caring.  Look at Trump has done business in Russia and has remained uncomfortably close to Vladimir He refuses to release his tax returns, which could clarify the specific financial interests that he has in  President Trump knew his National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, was compromised by Russian intelligence and had misled Vice President Pence; yet Flynn was allowed to remain in one of our most sensitive national security positions until criticism from Congress, the media, and the public became too much to ignore.  President Trump continues to gloss over the serious problems that led to Flynn's resignation. Instead, he attacks the messenger and the leaks that brought Flynn's conduct to light. These are bright red flags. These are signs that the President has something to hide.  Americans deserve a President who they can trust is putting the country's interests ahead of his own, that he is putting the country's interests instead of another country's interests because that deal might be in his interest.  There should be no question over the purity of the President's motives, especially when he is making critical security decisions on behalf of the If President Trump wants to assure the American people that he deserves our[[Page H1292]]trust, he must be transparent. We need a bipartisan, independent investigation of his conflicts of interest, particularly with Russia, but not exclusively. He must release his tax returns, and he must fully separate himself from his business dealings.  The corrupt practices of this administration must stop. Our country and our Constitution demand nothing less.  ",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgH1289.txt,1588,SOCIAL JUSTICE MOVEMENTS,2017.0,16.0,March

7111,topic-id,856,"Mr.President, I wish to tell a story about Evelyn, a young woman I met from Molokai, which is a small rural island in the State of It is the kind of place that has one radio station, one high school, and everybody knows everybody. Of course, everyone in town knows  They were all so very proud of her when she invented a pH sensor that can detect even small changes in the ocean's environment. Her device is nothing short of groundbreaking. It is actually more accurate than the devices that marine scientists at our Federal agencies have been using, and it is way less expensive. It is an estimated \1/42\nd of the price, and it requires half the maintenance.  This invention makes Evelyn an accomplished scientist, an innovator, an entrepreneur, and a passionate ocean steward, but she is also a junior in public high school, Molokai High She is proof that our public school students can compete and innovate at the highest levels and that public schools can be a path to just about anything, which is why public schools and public education are to be held up and supported and understood as the great equalizer, the bedrock of our democracy, our civil society, our country. You can trace back the history of public education in America to the Original Thirteen In 1635, boys in Boston could get a free education, and by 1647, the Massachusetts Bay Colony[[Page S770]]required every town to provide boys a basic education.  Some 340 years later, our public education system has come a long way, but some things don't change. Our communities still understand how public education lays a foundation for success. It gives every American the chance to pursue their dreams. But the nominee for Secretary of Education doesn't seem to understand that, which is why we see constituents flooding the phone lines, Facebook and Twitter, faxes, and the in-boxes of U. In terms of pure volume, this last week has been the highest point for American interaction with the U.Congress in our history. Think about that. Think about what we have been through as a country together, and yet, this week and last, more people have called their Members of the Senate than literally ever before because that is the level of passion people feel for public education and because Americans across the country are concerned and worried about what will happen to public education under Betsy My office alone has received thousands of messages about her nomination.  I just want to be clear about this. There are certainly advocacy organizations that make it easy for you to contact your Member of They have form letters. They have Web forms. They make it easy. They populate the thing. They pop off an email, and you just sign at the bottom. That isn't what I am talking about. These are organically generated, individual letters from across the State of  Talking with colleagues, that is what is happening. People are, on their own, calling because everybody has a story about public education. Everybody has a reason to be passionate about public education. Let me share a few of these concerns.  A parent on the Big Island of Hawaii wrote:       As a mother of two, and as a woman who went back to      graduate school in her 50s, I understand the importance of      free education in public schools as a fundamental American      right, one which can create a lifelong love of education and      learning.  A constituent from Kihei, Maui, wrote:       Public schools are not failing. We, as in our American      culture, are failing them.  Another one from Kahului, Maui, wrote:       Children are not a business, they are not a commodity.      Public education has its issues (of course it does), but      privatizing teachers and turning education into an      opportunity for the rich to get richer on one of the last      social services we provide to everyone in this country is not      the answer.  Here is one from a teacher on the island of Molokai:       The nominee for Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, has      zero experience serving in public schools and is not      qualified for the job. I do not believe she understands the      needs of our students and what effort it has taken to move      our schools as far along as we have. Public education is a      great responsibility and cannot be left to those who have      never worked directly with children in need.       These are children who experience school as a safe place      when they are valued, fed and educated. This serious      responsibility of public education in no way can be left or      replaced by a voucher system.  Here is another message from a constituent on the Big Island:       My family has very strong ties to the education community--     many of which are or were educators. My husband is an English      as a second language teacher, and my mother-in-law is      currently a third grade teacher, so this issue cuts deep in      our beliefs. We at a minimum deserve a leader with some      experience and who knows at least some of the laws already in      place as well as how to enforce them.

7142,topic-id,947,"Mr.President, I just listened to my friend the majority leader and the majority whip on the floor. They are able legislators, but they are sort of misleading the public as to our motivation. They have tried to paint every Democratic request as leftover resentment from the election. ``Sour grapes'' the majority leader said a few weeks ago. They can say it day after day after day, but it will never be true.  All we Democrats are insisting on is careful, careful consideration of nominees who we believe almost universally are below par. These nominees are going to have a tremendous effect on the American people.  Every mother and father in America should worry about Betsy DeVos's lack of dedication and almost negative feelings about public education. She heaps abuse on public education. Ninety percent of our children are in public schools. Of course, there should be discussion about it. She shouldn't be the nominee.  Yes, I understand, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, there is a new My guess is, if we went in their cloakroom and heard their whispers, our Republican colleagues would say: I wish he could have come up with someone else.  Betsy DeVos is the negative trifecta. She is negative on competence. She doesn't even understand the basic aspects of education. She is negative on philosophy. She disdains public education, where 90 percent of our kids are. She is negative on ethics. Her conflicts of interest are legion, and she hasn't, unlike some other of the Cabinet nominees, tried to erase them.  So of course there should be a tremendous amount of discussion. Of course Democrats ought to bring to light who Betsy DeVos is. So when she does her acts as Secretary, when she does things that hurt public education as Secretary, the American people know what is happening and can stand up against it.  I have to tell my colleagues, it is not Democrats who are bitter about the election; it is the American people who are bitter about the nomination of Betsy DeVos, and that is why millions and millions of calls--almost unprecedented on a Cabinet nomination--have poured into this Capitol, into Democratic and Republican offices alike. The distinguished chairman of this committee--who is a dear friend; I have such respect and admiration for him, and we have spent time together socially--was put in the awkward position of having to rush through a nominee, 5 minutes of questions, that is it, for each Senator; 5 minutes at night, no second rounds. There was no rationale for that, other than he was afraid of what she would say or might not say. Sure enough, when she testified, those fears were actualized because Betsy DeVos couldn't answer the most fundamental questions about public education.  She couldn't get her paperwork in on time. What kind of nominee is that? How is someone who is going to run the Department of Education, with tens of thousands of employees, unable to get her paperwork submitted in enough time to clear the ethics organizations? How was she unable to get her paperwork in on time? Every nominee of President Obama's did, and we didn't hear from them until they did.  The rush; a few extra days, some hours last night so we might examine a nominee who has tremendous power over the future of millions of American kids and their families--oh, no. If anything, we should be spending more time on Betsy DeVos, not less. What should be happening is she should go back for a second hearing now that her paperwork is in. What should happen is she should be asked more questions because she was so unable to answer so many rudiments last time. What should happen is, there should be more time, not less, on debating this nominee, not because we want to be dilatory but because we want a nominee who at least meets some basic tests, and she does not.  That is why every Democrat will be voting against her, and two Republicans, who showed tremendous courage. Again, I have been around here a while. I know the pressures. That is why I have such respect for the Senators from Alaska and Maine who voted against Betsy DeVos not for political considerations, not in frustration that they lost the election but because they knew how bad she would be for public education because their States are largely rural. In rural America, there is not much choice, which has been Betsy DeVos's watchword, although the charter schools she set up have been, by and large, a failure. They don't have that choice. So someone who decries public education, who disdains public education, is not good for their State and, I would dare say, is not good for the States of a lot of Senators on the other side of the aisle who feel compelled--that party loyalty--to vote for her. In fact, when we talk about parties demanding things, it is the Republican side demanding a vote for an unqualified candidate, not the Democrats delaying the vote.  I hope against hope that another Republican will have the courage of the Senators from Alaska and Maine and join us. Then what can happen is the President will get to make the nomination. We Democrats are not going to pick the Secretary of Education, but it will be a qualified nominee because they will have learned their lesson at the White House that they can't brush through these nominations with such little vetting.

7340,topic-id,544,"Mr.President, I rise to speak on the potential repeal of the Social Security Administration's rule that helps keep guns out of the hands of those with a severe mental illness. I voted no.  First, I want to point out that this rule only addresses a shortcoming in the existing background check law that Congress passed legislation to address. We use the National Instant Criminal Background Check system to prevent criminals and the adjudicated mentally ill from purchasing firearms.  In order for the FBI to have access to all the data they need to run those background checks, Congress passed the NICS Improvement Act in 2007--in bipartisan fashion, signed into law by President George Bush, hardly a gun safety activist--to instruct Federal agencies to send information to the NICS system about criminal records and mental illness.  This rule at the Social Security Administration is simply implementing that bipartisan law.  Second, let me underscore the point, this rule only applies to those who have severe mental health disorders, like schizophrenia. These are folks who, because of their disorder need assistance managing their own affairs and are so severely impaired that they cannot hold down a full-time job. It simply requires the Social Security Administration to pass that data on to the NICS background check system so the FBI can stop gun sales to the seriously mentally ill.  It doesn't get much more common sense than that.  Frankly, I find it absurd that the Republicans have chosen to repeal this rule as one of their first priorities in this  Does the Republican majority really think it is wise, as my colleague from Connecticut asked, that folks who are so severely mentally ill that they cannot work and require assistance managing their finances should be assumed to be able to responsibly own and protect a gun?  Mental illness is a serious topic. We have debated it many times in this body--how to better provide for treatment, how to decrease the stigma surrounding it--but I don't remember the part where we debated whether it was wise or not to allow folks with a severe, almost incapacitating, mental illness to easily purchase a gun.  Gun violence takes far too many lives each year. At the very, very least, we should be doing all that we can to prevent criminals, potential terrorists, and the adjudicated mentally ill from purchasing firearms; yet Republicans consistently line up behind the NRA to block or repeal policies that would do those things--even though 8 or 9 out of every 10 Americans supports them, though a vast majority of gunowners support them.  Whenever Republicans talk about gun violence, they say, ``Let's enforce the laws on the books!'' Well, as I mentioned, this regulation does just that; it implements the bipartisan 2007 NICS Improvement Act that Republican President George Bush signed into law.  Today, Republicans are calling their own bluff; they are not interested in enforcing the laws on the books--they just want to repeal them, even when that puts innocent American lives at risk.  If Republicans have a problem with this rule, they should have pushed the Social Security Administration to modify it, rather than repealing it outright and blocking any similar rulemaking on the subject, which is what this CRA would do.  Thank you.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgS1216-2.txt,1036,"OIRA INSIGHT, REFORM, AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT",2017.0,15.0,March

7395,topic-id,792,"Mr.President, I rise this afternoon on a few matters: first, Russia and the continuing investigation into Russian interference in our election and the ties between the Trump campaign, transition team, and  The events of this weekend, which included another troubling, baseless tweet from the President, highlight and, in fact, strengthen the argument for a special prosecutor to conduct the investigation. And the American people agree. A CNN/ORC poll this morning showed that about two-thirds of Americans think a special prosecutor should conduct the investigation--67 percent of the Independents and even 43 percent of the The trend line suggests these numbers will continue to grow.  So my Republican colleagues should understand that what they know in their hearts is the right thing to do. Do a strong, impartial investigation and get to the bottom of this. That is where the American people want them to go. The American people disagree with President Trump and want a thorough and impartial investigation--even 43 percent of They are right.  A special prosecutor is the best way to ensure that an investigation proceeds impartially for several reasons.  First, by Department of Justice guidelines that are set up for this purpose, a special counsel is not subject to day-to-day supervision by the Attorney General--now recused--or anyone else at the Justice That means the special prosecutor would have much greater latitude in whom he can subpoena, which questions he can ask, and how to conduct the investigation. Second, the prosecutor can only be removed for good cause, such as misconduct, not to quash the investigation. So there is an insularity there. He or she is protected if they are moving forward on the investigation. Third, there is built in congressional oversight. Congress is notified whenever a special counsel is appointed, removed, or finished with the investigation. Last, the special counsel has the independence to prosecute not only the subject of an investigation but anyone who attempts to interfere.  This is the right way to go. Let me quote Attorney General Jeff Sessions on this issue. Here is what he once said: ``The appropriate response when the subject matter is public and it arises in a highly-charged political atmosphere is for the Attorney General to appoint a Special Counsel of great public stature and indisputable independence to assure the public the matter will be handled without partisanship.''  If there were ever a case that fit exactly what then-Senator, now-Attorney General Sessions called for, this is it.  This week, the Senate Judiciary Committee is going to have a hearing on the nomination of Mr.Rosenstein to serve as the Deputy Attorney During that hearing, Mr.Rosenstein should commit to naming a special prosecutor to look into the Trump campaign's ties to Mr.Rosenstein, by reputation, is a fair man. He is a career prosecutor. Now that the Attorney General has recused himself, Mr.Rosenstein, pending confirmation, will have the duty to appoint a special prosecutor. If he will not appoint a special prosecutor, he will need a darn good reason. It is hard for me to see one right now.  Whether Mr.Rosenstein will appoint a special prosecutor will be front and center tomorrow at the Judiciary Committee's hearing and far and away the most important question he needs to answer. As I mentioned last week, if, pending confirmation, Mr.Rosensetin delays or refuses to appoint a special prosecutor, Congress should consider reviving a narrower version of the independent counsel law.  Also, we should make sure, certain, that the investigation has not been interfered with thus far. I sent a letter today to the inspector general of the Department of Justice, Michael Horowitz, which was made public today, urging him to open an immediate investigation to determine if anyone has interfered with this investigation up to now, either attempting to influence the direction of the investigation or those conducting it.  The Attorney General should have recused himself on day one. I asked him to do it almost 3 weeks ago, on February 14. We need to know if he or anyone else has meddled in this investigation in any way. His misleading statements to the Judiciary Committee about his meetings with the Russian Ambassador only add suspicion.  Attorney General Sessions has been in charge of this investigation for 3 weeks. We need to know if he or anyone else did anything in that time to[[Page S1591]]hinder the investigation because it is absolutely critical that we protect the integrity of this investigation. That means ensuring that it is completely independent going forward and that nothing has already occurred that could compromise it. The good news is, the inspector general can take this investigation on his own and go forward with what we asked for in the letter on his own. I would urge him to do so.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-06-pt1-PgS1590-3.txt,1036,"OIRA INSIGHT, REFORM, AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT",2017.0,6.0,March

7264,topic-id,432,"Mr.Speaker, so many people that I have memories of, some are still here and some are gone, but they really laid the foundation for a Black middle class.  Maybe Granddaddy worked at the school and Grandmother worked at someone's house or maybe they were fortunate enough to have two good labor jobs where they made union wages, but it laid that groundwork for the foundation that we have today.  King was obviously a big part of that. Sadly, on April 4, 1968, he paid his life supporting the sanitation workers in Memphis, trying to push for them to have better wages.  When King died, it wasn't about trying to open up a restaurant to make sure that all people had access to that restaurant or some other place, to make sure that people could ride on the bus; it was to make sure that people had equal opportunity in this country, again, equal opportunity for upward mobility, equal opportunity to be able to take care of their families. I just really appreciate everything that he did.  We need to continue to mobilize and organize grassroots efforts around the income inequality in this country. The income inequality that we have in this country is very, very real.  You see productivity rising in our country. You see companies recording record productivity, but wages are stagnant. There used to be a time in this country that wages would go up when productivity of companies went up, and we are not seeing that anymore. I think that is really, really sad. We need to organize around that because all people need the opportunity[[Page H1347]]to be able to advance as the country advances and as industry advances. I think that that is a big part of that.  Again, I thank all our colleagues that have come here tonight to organize, to carry the torch. We need to continue to find different ways that we can use grassroots movements in this country, not just looking back and reflecting on previous grassroots and events, but how we can learn from that history and how we can mobilize people today to better America, to better wages for all communities, for the African-American community, of course, as we celebrate and come toward the end of Black History Month, but Latino communities, White communities, people in the Rust Belt, and African-American communities in places like Gary, Indiana, that really saw their fortunes hurt more than many other parts of the country.

7118,topic-id,425,"I don't understand about reviewing it. We      talked about this in my office. There are already rules in      place.  And so on--Senator Warren's exchange there is very revealing.  I know Republicans care very deeply about waste, fraud, and abuse. I hear about it all the time, and I hope they will consider this nominee's tepid commitment to this issue as they talk with their constituents about how they are going to vote.  The third issue I am concerned about is college affordability. The rising cost of college is one of the biggest middle-class issues of our time, if not the biggest issue of our time. No generation escapes this problem. If you are a student or a parent, you worry about paying for college. I know plenty of grandparents who are worried about their children who are still paying off their college loans and are now trying to save up for their students.  The Federal Government is giving $140 billion in Federal aid to institutions of higher learning in grants and loans. That is a good thing, not a bad thing. That is Federal policy. We decided we wanted to make college affordable because higher education is the straightest line for us to develop the workforce we need and for people to move up the economic ladder. But with that $140 billion, we need to be making college more affordable, and we are actually getting the opposite result. Both in raw dollars and inflation-adjusted dollars, we are spending more in Federal grants and Pell grants, and the cost of college goes up and up and up. Average Pell grant awards have increased by almost 20 percent in the past 10 years. In the same period, Pell grants covered 25 percent less.  We are officially paying more and getting less. This is because college costs are growing faster than the cost of all other consumer goods--twice as fast as health care costs. It is impossible to get ahead nowadays without a college degree, but the growing cost of college is preventing some from getting a degree in the first place and leaving others with unmanageable levels of debt. It is clear that our system isn't working.  If we are subsidizing higher education with Federal dollars, we have a responsibility to incentivize institutions of higher education to become more affordable, provide access to lower income students, and deliver quality education. We want to reward those schools that are focused on affordability and give incentives for the rest to make affordability part of the mission.

7134,topic-id,1312,"Mr.President, before I begin my remarks, I want to make sure that everyone understands that Senator Murray has been on this floor hour after hour for a reason; that is, these nominations are enormously important. This one is right at the heart of what families and parents and communities want because it deals with education.  I heard that again this weekend. I had three townhall meetings, mostly in rural areas. We had record turnouts. As Senator Murray knows, Oregon and Washington have been pounded in the last few weeks with bad weather--had to fly all night to get back for this debate. Everybody said how important this was because they understand what Betsy DeVos, if she is confirmed, would mean for our country.  I want to start by putting a focus on this issue around what Oregonians are particularly concerned about this morning. They are concerned, when we talk about education, about boosting our high school graduation rates. Parents, teachers, and communities are all[[Page S805]]mobilized. I want to start my remarks by saying that I know people across the country are concerned about this. We worked very closely with Senator Murray and Senator Alexander on this.  The reason that Oregonians feel so strongly is that we have been first in so many areas, for example, protecting our natural treasures, but we are not where we want to be in terms of high school graduation rates. For communities across Oregon, the business community, Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives, Independents--you name it--it is top priority business for our State to improve high school graduation rates. That is because we understand that getting those graduation rates up is crucial to making sure that young people can be better prepared for their next step, whether that is college, whether it is the workforce--anything they want to do.  I want to start my remarks with respect to the DeVos nomination very specifically. I do not believe improving high school graduation rates can be built on a foundation of alternative facts. Yet that is what Betsy DeVos has been promoting. For example, she recently told the Senate that graduation rates at virtual private schools--private schools which she has invested in--were almost twice as high as the actual graduation rates at those schools.  She said that at the Nevada Virtual Academy there was a graduation rate of 100 percent. The actual graduation rate is 57 percent. She claimed that at the Ohio Virtual Academy there was a graduation rate of 92 percent. The actual rate is 46 percent.  I think this pretty much qualifies as a set of alternative facts. At home, at the kinds of townhall meetings I had this weekend, people would probably call them four-Pinocchio falsehoods and ideological hocus-pocus. The alternative facts may be the DeVos way, but they aren't the Oregon way.  As I said to Oregonians this weekend--we had teachers and community leaders come to these meetings--what we do is operate on something we call the Oregon way. The Oregon way is about Democrats and Republicans, people of all philosophies. We had great Republican Governors--Tom McCall, Mark Hatfield--who also served in this body and were independent. We want fresh, practical approaches.  We focused on our ideas that work, ideas that get results, and we focus not on alternative facts but on the truth. What I heard again this weekend at home is that we are bringing together teachers in the classrooms and parents and community leaders and trying to determine what are the key factors in why students are not graduating. At home people are asking, how do you get results? What actually is going to work in the classroom and at our schools? Educators and principals tell me that mentoring programs work. They tell me at home that summer learning programs work. They point out the track record of afterschool programs, and they have the facts to back them up. These facts aren't alternative facts. They are not inflated graduation rates, the way Betsy DeVos told the These are based on actual studies: Studies that have shown that youth--especially at-risk youth--with mentors are more likely to join extracurricular activities, take on leadership roles at school, or volunteer in their communities. Afterschool and summer learning programs, again, have very solid track records, providing a safe place to learn and keeping low-income and at-risk youngsters on a path towards graduation.  Those same educators have told me in my townhalls that they oppose elevating Betsy DeVos to a job with the important responsibility of steering the future of our Nation's children. The reason they have expressed these views is much like what I have stated to the Senate; and that is, that the evidence--not alternative facts but hard evidence--doesn't back up many of the judgments Betsy DeVos has made in guiding her work in this field.  In Oregon, citizens--thousands of them--worry that the confirmation of Betsy DeVos is going to make it harder to help students succeed in the classroom and graduate from high school. This graduation rate for us in Oregon--and I am sure we are not alone--takes on a new and important urgency because of the changes that were made last year--bipartisan changes Senators Murray and Alexander made to pass the Every Student Succeeds The whole point of this bill was because, of course, there was great frustration across the country with No Child Left Behind, the predecessor.  I remember at one point illustrating the frustration with that law. We had a wonderful school in rural Oregon with mostly low-income youngsters and mostly minority youngsters. They worked like crazy. Their parents were very involved. Their teachers rolled up their sleeves, and they were doing well at getting their test scores up. At one point, we were told they were going to be labeled a failing school, because, apparently, for a short period of time, a number of youngsters had the flu, and so the attendance rate wasn't what it should be. Those were the kinds of stories that illustrated why it was so important to fix No Child Left Behind and focus on approaches that work.  It is my view that what Senator Murray and Senator Alexander did with respect to bipartisan leadership was to work for an important bill--important for the future of students, important for their ability to get a job and do what they want in their years ahead. When you have a bipartisan bill that the President has signed into law, replacing failed education policies, and giving teachers more control over their classrooms, you ought to move quickly and boldly to carry out that law. That law included a provision that I wrote to help high schools with low graduation rates turn around student achievement by putting the most disadvantaged students on a path to success. It allows local educators--this isn't run by Washington, I am always hearing that everybody is talking about having it run from Washington, That is not what I voted for. What I voted for--and the majority of Senators voted for--was a fresh approach allowing local educators to promote and expand programs and policies that actually work in their community. They recognized that what works in Coos Bay or Roseburg, OR, may not necessarily work in  We wrote a bipartisan bill to come up with approaches tailored to what local educators want to pursue. Now as we are moving to see this law implemented in the States and as schools across the country are moving to implementation, it is more important than ever that the Senate get this right, that we get it right now, and that we use approaches grounded in the facts and grounded in the reality of public education. My concern is that--based on Betsy DeVos's record, which I have looked at in length--bipartisan work could be undercut by a system that has not been shown to improve academic outcomes for students.
