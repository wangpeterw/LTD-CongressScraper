                          ADDRESS GUN VIOLENCE

  (Ms. SHEA-PORTER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)

  Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Madam Speaker, children and families across the 
country rely on their leaders in Congress for much more than thoughts 
and prayers. They need us to take action to keep them safe.
  Gun violence in this country is a horrifying epidemic. There have 
been 18 school shootings in the past 7\1/2\ weeks. It is even hard to 
talk about this.
  It is difficult to argue, though, with people who are looking at 
Congress and wondering whether too many Members in Congress are too 
close to the NRA and the gun manufacturers. Congress actually passed a 
law to prevent the CDC from even studying gun violence.
  In difficult times, I, too, seek thoughts and prayers from friends, 
clergy, and family, but this is not stopping the slaughter. I agree 
with police officers across the country who say: Get the AR-15s out of 
the hands of dangerous people now. Our children are being massacred in 
their schools.
  Madam Speaker, Speaker Ryan must put bills on the floor to address 
gun violence or his party will go down in history as the party that 
blocked solutions to this crisis.
