              PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PROMISE TO DRAIN THE SWAMP

  (Mrs. DEMINGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, the President made big promises on the 
campaign trail to drain the swamp. He promised that his Washington 
would look different. Well, it does look different, but not in the way 
he promised.
  Instead of ethics reform, his administration rolled back ethics 
provisions that prevented officials from serving in Federal agencies 
that they lobbied in the last 2 years.
  He promised to tackle campaign finance, saying that he wouldn't 
accept campaign donations from special interest groups. Instead, he has 
invited the special interests into his Cabinet, appointing them into 
the highest position.
  He promised he would ask Congress to pass campaign finance reform 
that prevents registered foreign lobbyists from raising money in 
American politics. Instead, it turns out that some of his closest 
confidants and former campaign advisers have made millions lobbying 
foreign governments.
  He promised he would release his own tax returns, but has not. The 
American people have no way of knowing how he or his family businesses 
stand to benefit from these tax cuts.
  Mr. Speaker, this is not draining the swamp. Everyone is accountable, 
especially those in the highest levels of our government.
