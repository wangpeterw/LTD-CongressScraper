               RECOGNIZING LITTLE ROCK POLICE DEPARTMENT

  (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise today on this National Law 
Enforcement Appreciation Day to recognize this year's Little Rock 
Police Department recruit class and their efforts to fill dozens of 
sworn officer vacancies within the department.
  Little Rock's police force has suffered a loss in numbers over the 
past few years, currently with 84 sworn officer vacancies. According to 
department data, this fall's recruit class is tied for the largest 
number of starting recruits since 1993.
  Earlier this year, City Manager Bruce Moore announced that officers 
would work mandatory overtime due to the vacancies. So I thank City 
Manager Moore, Chief Buckner, and Mayor Mark Stodola for their 
leadership and efforts to address these vacancies and return this 
department to full strength.
  I respect and appreciate the important work of our police throughout 
the Nation who are charged with the critical work of protecting us in 
our States and communities.
  I wish this recruit class the very best of luck as they pursue their 
goal of joining the Little Rock Police Department and ensuring the 
safety of our citizens, our neighborhoods, and our property.
