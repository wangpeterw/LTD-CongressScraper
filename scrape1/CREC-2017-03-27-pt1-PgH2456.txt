                     STAND STRONG AGAINST PREJUDICE

  (Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to make it very 
clear that the people's House stands strong against prejudice.
  Since January, we have seen a disturbing rise in bomb threats and 
violence targeted at Jewish Community Centers all over the country, 
including the Stroum Jewish Community Center in Mercer Island, 
Washington.
  Our Nation is better than this. Today I am joining one of the 
strongest leaders I know on this issue--Representative Kustoff--in 
introducing the Combating Anti-Semitism Act. This bill is a direct 
response to the bad actors who are terrorizing our neighbors and 
friends.
  If you threaten someone because of who or how they worship, this bill 
ensures you will be prosecuted for committing a hate crime. No matter 
your background, your religion, your walk of life, you should be safe 
and free to worship without fear in this country. With this bill, we 
are supporting our Jewish communities all across the country, and I am 
proud to give it my full support.
