                          PERSONAL EXPLANATION

  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I was absent during rollcall votes No. 
328, No. 329, and No. 330 due to my spouse's health situation in 
California. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on H. Res. 
397--Solemnly reaffirming the commitment of the United States to the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization's principle of collective defense as 
enumerated in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. I would have also 
voted ``yea'' on H.R. 497--Santa Ana River Wash Plan Land Exchange Act. 
I would have also voted ``yea'' on H.R. 220--To authorize the expansion 
of an existing hydroelectric project, and for other purposes.
