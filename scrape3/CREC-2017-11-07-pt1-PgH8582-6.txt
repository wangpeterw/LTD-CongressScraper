                   CONGRATULATING THE HOUSTON ASTROS

  (Mr. GOMEZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my colleague, 
Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, and the Houston Astros for winning 
the 2017 Major League Baseball World Series. The Astros finally earned 
history this season by winning their first World Series title.
  But they weren't the only ones to earn something by beating my Los 
Angeles Dodgers. Congresswoman Jackson Lee also earned some of LA's 
iconic Philippe's French dip sandwiches as part of our friendly wager.
  We may be on opposing teams when it comes to baseball, but we both 
play for the blue team here in Congress, and I look forward to working 
with her to fight for working men and women across the United States.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
  I couldn't have had a wager with a greater Member of Congress. I love 
his orange tie. I love him looking at this sign: Beat LA.
  All of those players--LA Dodgers and the Houston Astros--had great 
character and great sportsmanship.
  I love the sandwiches. Let's do it again. Let's see them in 2018 in 
the World Series.
  Go Astros.
  Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, congratulations to Houston: Houston strong, 
and Houston proud.
