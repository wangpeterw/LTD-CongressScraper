                              GUN VIOLENCE

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, the question is: When? In 2017, there 
were 11,600 deaths linked to gun violence. In 2017, nearly four 911 
attacks. There were more than 15,000 killed by gun violence in 2016. 
There were 383 mass shootings.
  The United States ranks number one in the world in terms of firearms 
per capita. The problem is so epidemic that gun violence is now the 
third leading cause of death of our children, which includes those dear 
souls who died in Florida just a couple of weeks ago. We heard those 
children's voices. We have heard many voices.
  So let me explain to the American people: no one is grabbing the 
Second Amendment. I honor the amendments of this Nation. For your 
information, in order to change an amendment, you need a two-thirds 
vote of both the House and the Senate and three-quarters of the States. 
The last time we changed an amendment was 1933, where we repealed the 
prohibition amendment.
  This is a cause of the heart and the mind. It is not a Second 
Amendment debate. It is a debate on sensible gun legislation to save 
lives.
  Ban bump stocks.
  Extend the waiting period.
  Ensure that multiple munitions are banned and automatic weapons are 
banned.
  When is there going to be, Mr. Speaker, the coming together of a 
bipartisan effort to save the lives of our children? Enough is enough. 
We need to answer the call. Our children are dying.
