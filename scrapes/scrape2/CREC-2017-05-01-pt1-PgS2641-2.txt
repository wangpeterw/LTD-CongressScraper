                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  God of our fathers and mothers, continue to lead us with the power of 
Your wisdom and might. Empower our Senators to live this day with 
honor. Increase their faith, hope, and love that they may receive Your 
promises and claim them to accomplish Your purposes for our world.
  Lord, inspire our Senators today with the music of Your wisdom that 
through their labors, they may bring hope from despair and joy from 
sadness. Teach them to celebrate, even in the darkness, because You are 
the God who gives us strength to accomplish more than we can ask or 
imagine.
  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.
