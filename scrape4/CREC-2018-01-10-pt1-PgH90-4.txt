                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Dear God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  We ask Your special blessing upon the Members of this people's House. 
They face difficult decisions and difficult times, with many forces and 
interests demanding their attention.
  In these days, give wisdom to all Members, that they might execute 
their responsibilities to the benefit of all Americans.
  Bless them, O God, and be with them and with us all this day and 
every day to come. May all that is done be for Your greater honor and 
glory.
  Amen.
