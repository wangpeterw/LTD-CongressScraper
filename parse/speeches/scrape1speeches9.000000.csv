(d) Any witness summoned to testify at a hearing, or any      witness giving sworn testimony, may be accompanied by counsel      of his own choosing who shall be permitted, while the witness      is testifying, to advise him of his legal rights.       (e) No confidential testimony taken or confidential      material presented in an executive hearing, or any report of      the proceedings of such an executive hearing, shall be made      public, either in whole or in part or by way of summary,      unless authorized by a majority of the members of the      committee or subcommittee.       Rule 18.--Presidential nominees shall submit a statement of      their background and financial interests, including the      financial interests of their spouse and children living in      their household, on a form approved by the committee which      shall be sworn to as to its completeness and accuracy. The      committee form shall be in two parts--       (I) information relating to employment, education and      background of the nominee relating to the position to which      the individual is nominated, and which is to be made public;      and,       (II) information relating to financial and other background      of the nominee, to be made public when the committee      determines that such information bears directly on the      nominee's qualifications to hold the position to which the      individual is nominated.       Information relating to background and financial interests      (parts I and II) shall not be required of nominees for less      than full-time appointments to councils, commissions or      boards when the committee determines that some or all of the      information is not relevant to the nature of the position.      Information relating to other background and financial      interests (part II) shall not be required of any nominee when      the committee determines that it is not relevant to the      nature of the position.       Committee action on a nomination, including hearings or      meetings to consider a motion to recommend confirmation,      shall not be initiated until at least five days after the      nominee submits the form required by this rule unless the      chairman, with the concurrence of the ranking minority      member, waives this waiting period.       Rule 19.--Subject to statutory requirements imposed on the      committee with respect to procedure, the rules of the      committee may be changed, modified, amended or suspended at      any time; provided, not less than a majority of the entire      membership so determine at a regular meeting with due notice,      or at a meeting specifically called for that purpose.       Rule 20.--When the ratio of members on the committee is      even, the term ``majority'' as used in the committee's rules      and guidelines shall refer to the party of the chairman for      purposes of party identification. Numerical requirements for      quorums, votes and the like shall be unaffected.       Rule 21.--First degree amendments must be filed with the      chairman at least 24 hours before an executive session. The      chairman shall promptly distribute all filed amendments      electronically to the members of the committee. The chairman      may modify the filing requirements to meet special      circumstances with the concurrence of the ranking minority      member.       Rule 22.--In addition to the foregoing, the proceedings of      the committee shall be governed by the Standing Rules of the      Senate and the provisions of the Legislative Reorganization      Act of 1946, as amended.                         *    *    *    *    *  Guidelines of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions With Respect to Hearings, Markup Sessions, and Related Matters                                HEARINGS       Section 133A(a) of the Legislative Reorganization Act      requires each committee of the Senate to publicly announce      the date, place, and subject matter of any hearing at least      one week prior to the commencement of such hearing.       The spirit of this requirement is to assure adequate notice      to the public and other Members of the Senate as to the time      and subject matter of proposed hearings. In the spirit of      section 133A(a) and in order to assure that members of the      committee are themselves fully informed and involved in the      development of hearings:       1. Public notice of the date, place, and subject matter of      each committee or subcommittee hearing should be inserted in      the Congressional Record seven days prior to the commencement      of such hearing.       2. At least seven days prior to public notice of each      committee or subcommittee hearing, the majority should      provide notice to the minority of the time, place and      specific subject matter of such hearing.       3. At least three days prior to the date of such hearing,      the committee or subcommittee should provide to each member a      list of witnesses who have been or are proposed to be invited      to appear.       4. The committee and its subcommittee should, to the      maximum feasible extent, enforce the provisions of rule 9 of      the committee rules as it relates to the submission of      written statements of witnesses twenty-four hours in advance      of a hearing. Witnesses will be urged to submit testimony      even earlier whenever possible. When statements are received      in advance of a hearing, the committee or subcommittee (as      appropriate) should distribute copies of such statements to      each of its members. Witness testimony may be submitted and      distributed electronically.         EXECUTIVE SESSIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF MARKING UP BILLS       In order to expedite the process of marking up bills and to      assist each member of the committee so that there may be full      and fair consideration of each bill which the committee or a      subcommittee is marking up the following procedures should be      followed:       1. Seven days prior to the proposed date for an executive      session for the purpose of marking up bills the committee or      subcommittee (as appropriate) should provide written notice      to each of its members as to the time, place, and specific      subject matter of such session, including an agenda listing      each bill or other matters to be considered and including:       (a) a copy of each bill, joint resolution, or other      legislative matter (or committee print thereof) to be      considered at such executive session; and       (b) a copy of a summary of the provisions of each bill,      joint resolution, or other legislative matter to be      considered at such executive session including, whenever      possible, an explanation of changes to existing law proposed      to be made.       2. Insofar as practical, prior to the scheduled date for an      executive session for the purpose of marking up bills, the      committee or a subcommittee (as appropriate) should provide      each member with a copy of the printed record or a summary of      any hearings conducted by the committee or a subcommittee      with respect to each bill, joint resolution, or other      legislative matter to be considered at such executive      session.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-01-pt1-PgS578.txt,1695,SEC REGULATORY ACCOUNTABILITY ACT,2017.0,1.0,January

The Clerk read the title of the bill.  The text of the bill is as follows:                               H.1214       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

431,topic-id,690,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, the purpose of H.1214, the Disaster SAVE Act, is to speed up small disaster reconstruction projects and lower their costs by removing red tape.  One of my biggest priorities since becoming chairman of the subcommittee has been reducing disaster costs and losses and reducing disaster risks. I was mayor for 11 years, and I saw so many friends' and neighbors' businesses and communities impacted by disasters.  One of the things I hear most often from my colleagues in Congress is frustration about inconsistent guidance from FEMA and funding take backs, even when there is no evidence of misuse. If you have ever had a big disaster in your district, you know exactly what I am talking about.  In my district, FEMA reversed its prior approval and has been fighting for years with the local government over whether or not they should have paved a temporary access road that was built after a major flood. The cost of the gravel road was $230,000. The extra cost to pave it, which the community covered with its own funds, was about $50,000.  The amount of money FEMA has wasted in salaries, administration, and legal fees trying to take back the $230,000 likely exceeds the entire project cost. This is red tape out of control, and it doesn't serve the taxpayers well. We know there is a better way to manage these projects.  Under current law, FEMA runs projects under $130,000 in a manner similar to an insurance settlement. FEMA reviews the damage, makes a cost estimate, and issues a repair grant. The local government is responsible for managing the grant on time and on budget.  In exchange, they have greater flexibility in how they bill back, and they can enhance a project with their own funds. This approach dramatically cuts administrative costs, rebuilds infrastructure faster, eliminates the cost overruns for Federal taxpayers, and gives local governments the flexibility to rebuild in a way that best meets their needs.  The success of FEMA's small project program is well proven thanks to the prior efforts of the Transportation The former chairman of the subcommittee, from California, worked diligently to give FEMA the flexibility to administratively increase the small project threshold, which finally passed as part of the Hurricane Sandy supplemental package.  H.2114, the Disaster SAVE Act, will raise the current project cap for this program from $130,000 to $500,000 and help all of our constituents avoid the project nightmare my district is experiencing right now. This will speed up rebuilding efforts and reduce disaster recovery costs.                              {time}  1715  The vast majority of FEMA's rebuilding projects are less than $500,000, but FEMA continues to micromanage the administration of these projects at a tremendous cost in time and money. FEMA testified in 2015 that increasing this threshold would result in lower administrative costs, faster project completions, and fewer deobligations.  After 4 years, the program will sunset and Congress will decide, based on outcomes, lessons learned, and stakeholder input, if the program should continue or not. The House adopted[[Page H2450]]similar language last year when it passed the FEMA Disaster Assistance Reform  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  FEMA provides public assistance funds after a disaster or emergency to State, tribal, and local governments and some private nonprofits. These funds reimburse communities and other entities for activities such as debris removal costs, emergency protective measures, and the repair or replacement of disaster-damaged facilities.  Currently, for projects under--however they chose that number--$122,100--I am surprised they didn't add on 10 cents--reimburses grantees based on cost estimates rather than actual costs. This bill would require FEMA to increase this threshold to $500,000. This would be temporary authority, expiring on September 30, 2021. We would require that this be closely tracked. There is a strong indication that this will actually expedite reimbursement, ultimately save funds, and will not subject these projects to abuse.  I am hopeful that my colleagues will support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.

644,topic-id,227,"Mr.Speaker, we know the Tax Code is excessively complicated and takes too much money from Americans, thus we overhauled the United States Tax  Over 30 years ago, President Ronald Reagan signed the last major tax reform package. To put this in perspective, this was before the world wide web went live to the public, more than 10 years ago before ``google'' was a verb, and visiting a Blockbuster was the best way to rent a movie. America is vastly different than it was then, yet our Tax Code has largely stayed the same.  As we bring our Tax Code into the 21st century, we must simplify the code. The U.Tax Code is over 3 million words long, and Americans spend billions of hours and hundreds of billions of dollars complying with Federal tax requirements each year. Imagine if that time and money were spent on innovation and job creation instead. As we work to shrink taxes and erase the excessive compliance rules, we must also make sure that the taxes we collect are spent according to constitutional constraints.  We must propose a plan that will better serve individuals, families, and businesses across the country. We must introduce legislation that lowers taxes, reduces the corporate tax rate, minimizes government interference in the free market, and eases the overall cost to taxpayers to fully comply with the system.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-28-pt1-PgH2504-3.txt,99999999999999,1100,2017.0,28.0,January
474,topic-id,477,"Mr.Speaker, I come to the floor this morning to talk about a piece of legislation that is going to be before us this week, and we are bringing it forward through the Congressional Review  In our office, we have had so many people ask: What is a Congressional Review Act, and how is it that you can recall these rules?  This allows Congress to exercise their authority over the agencies and the administration and the executive branch interaction where they make rules. Many times they do these rules, as this previous administration did, at the last minute, as they are heading out the door, trying to put their thumb and their imprint on actions and prohibit Congress or prohibit the States from taking an action.  So as we meet in this Chamber this week, we are going to take up H.43. H.43 is a resolution which will disapprove of one of these last-minute rule changes that President Obama made as he was exiting his office. This one deals with title X funds and the grant allocations that come through title X funds.  Now, title X funds were put in place to serve women and their healthcare needs, underserved women in underserved areas, and to make certain that there were provisions so that they could access women's health and have access to preventive screenings, to annual immunizations, those checkups that they need to have each year. Many times these funds have been used by individuals who will say: We do women's health and we also do abortion services.  Now, what the rule would have done was to block the States and to take away their ability to go in and ask: Who is going to have access to these funds, and are we going to disallow them to go to entities that provide abortion services?  So H.43 repeals the previous administration's rule and it restores and gives back to the States the flexibility that they want and desire to have to distribute these title X grants under the parameters for which this program was designed.  States should be able to offer family planning funds to providers that offer a full and complete range of healthcare services for women, but do not participate in elective abortions.  Title X funds, outside of the Affordable Care Act, were intended to help keep patients healthy and to help them on the road to a better quality of life and better health outcomes, not to take away life.  H.43 also redirects title X grant funds to other clinics comprised of local health departments, hospitals, and federally qualified health centers that seek to protect life and offer healthcare services to women.  Mr.Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support H.43, which repeals the previous administrative efforts which undermine State laws and restores to the States the title X grant program for its original purpose.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgH1189-2.txt,1748,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF RULE SUBMITTED BY DEPARTMENT,2017.0,15.0,March
421,topic-id,540,"Mr.Speaker, in the aftermath of the November election, it has been exciting to watch the unprecedented outpouring of citizen concern, activism, and, in some cases, outrage. America is finding its voice so Congress can find its spine.  Most recently, the people are demanding Congress be held accountable for the outrageous efforts on behalf of Republicans to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, forcing more expensive coverage for insurance plans that will not be as good and breaking the Trump promise of better, more affordable health care.  It has become clear that the Republican plan would force older Americans between the ages of 50 and 64 to pay 60 percent more for their health insurance coverage.  The Republican plan also seeks to unwind the life-changing expansion under Medicaid that has provided care for the poor, disabled, and lower income and helps people with mental illness and opioid addiction.  Wildly increasing the ranks of the uninsured and lowering the quality of care and affordability is so unacceptable to the American public that it is exposing deep divisions within the Republican ranks.  The wrecking crew is being slowed as public awareness and citizen action spread across the country. This morning, the American public has drawn a new assignment: to resist the Trump budget. It is shocking in its reckless cuts to programs that Americans hold dear.                              {time}  1015  What does it say that the cuts proposed to the Environmental Protection Agency are so extreme that even the EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt, who has made a career out of attacking the EPA, found it too brutal even for him?  The unnecessary expansion of some defense spending, especially the trillion-dollar spending spree that we are embarking on for new nuclear weapons, is completely out of sync with our real defense needs and slashing vital State Department programs that enhance our security.  Trump would not just impose shocking reductions on peacekeeping and humanitarian action, but he would deny the State Department the ability to exercise soft power. This compromises our national security interests and leaves us less safe.  Critical and widely supported lifesaving medical research efforts will be slashed, reversing years of bipartisan effort to enhance medical research to fight disease, illness, and disability.  At a time of housing crisis across the country, some of the few Federal tools to increase affordability and combat homelessness are being cut away.  This budget disaster would even zero out Federal support for public broadcasting, even though it represents just a tiny sliver of Federal budget and supports a vital public service. Public broadcasting is supported by an overwhelming majority of Americans, even those who voted for Donald Appallingly, those cuts would punish[[Page H2087]]rural and small town America that are more dependent than anybody else on public broadcasting support to be able to maintain that service.  The people who are resisting this reckless administration have this new assignment: resist the budget; make clear to their representatives that it should be dead on arrival; that decades of bipartisan support for vital programs to protect the environment, human services, international humanitarian interest, medical research, even public broadcasting will not be tolerated.  People are making a difference, but America needs all of us to find our voice so that Congress does its job.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-16-pt1-PgH2086-2.txt,99,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF RULE SUBMITTED BY DEPARTMENT,2017.0,16.0,January
502,topic-id,507,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.57.  This resolution is an extreme measure that will disrupt and delay the implementation of the bipartisan Every Student Succeeds Act, an important law that replaces the failed policies of No Child Left Behind by carefully balancing the need for more local control in education with strong Federal civil rights protections for students.  Today, sadly, the promise of the Every Student Succeeds Act is in jeopardy. This resolution appears to be part of a larger effort to dismantle the oversight and enforcement responsibilities of the Department of Education which would harm all students.  If my Republican friends are serious about successfully implementing the[[Page H1050]]law we all worked so hard to pass, they would not be demolishing a key set of regulations, and certainly not while States are currently finalizing their plans to implement the new accountability systems and public reporting requirements outlined in the regulations.  These regulations give States considerable flexibility and guidance. For example, they provide additional time to identify schools for comprehensive and targeted support. They ensure that parents are notified if their school is identified for additional support and explain how parents can get involved in their school's improvement efforts, and they give States flexibility to use multiple indicators in evaluating schools. These regulations are reasonable clarifications that reinforce the intent of the law.  Of course, my colleagues might disagree with some elements of the regulations, but this is the wrong way to change them. If my colleagues were serious about changing the regulations, then they would involve stakeholders and have a collaborative and transparent process to amend the rules through the public notice and comment process.  Unfortunately, without critical rules for implementing the Every Student Succeeds Act and the ability to write similar rules in the future, I expect we will see two things happen, both of which are detrimental:  Some States will take an anything-goes approach, which could hurt our 15 million public school students and, historically, is particularly damaging to African-American students, Hispanic students, Native American students, students with disabilities, and English-language learners. Remember the original Elementary and Secondary Education Act was about equity.  Other States, without clear rules for compliance, will simply continue existing policies--many of which are a legacy of the No Child Left Behind era--and miss out on the important flexibility and positive changes in the new law.  Using the Congressional Review Act to dismantle important regulations for the Every Student Succeeds Act will create a great deal of uncertainty and threaten the implementation of the law. Certainty is what our school districts need, and it risks critical equity protections for disadvantaged students.  The resolution before us is an extreme measure. It is entirely avoidable. The administration can revise these regulations, but instead, the supporters of this resolution are choosing to gut this important law by making implementation essentially unfeasible and uncertain.  Mr.Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to stand with our students across this country and vote ``no'' on this resolution, and then let's work together to amend the regulations.

587,topic-id,229,"Mr.Chairman, the debate over financial regulation is not just about more versus less. It is also about the ideathat financial liberty and personal liberty are connected, and they have been for most of history.  This goes back to the Middle Ages, when widespread use of a bill of exchange--basically, a check--made it much more difficultfor government to wrongly take people's wealth. That development was one of the first building blocks of limited government.  Now, today, we see a similar principle at work in global capital. Like the bill of exchange placing gold or silver out ofthe reach of government, the connected global economy allows capital to flow away from harsh regulation. Countries that get itright are the ones that win.  There are a number of statistics that suggest that we are getting the short end of the stick in this arena. We are losingour financial competitiveness. For example, nearly 10 percent of foreign companies left the New York Stock Exchange this year,almost double the historic average. Finally, from 2010 to 2016, the United States slipped from 6th to 11th in the Index ofEconomic  While this problem has a number of causes, the Securities and Exchange Commission Regulatory Accountability Act will helpimprove our economic competitiveness by requiring that the SEC put its regulations through a strong cost-benefit analysis andreview regulations that are just plain outdated.

The preliminary inquiry shall be      of duration and scope necessary to determine whether there is      substantial credible evidence which provides substantial      cause for the Select Committee to conclude that a violation      within the jurisdiction of the Select Committee has occurred.      The Select Committee may delegate to the chairman and vice      chairman the discretion to determine the appropriate      duration, scope, and conduct of a preliminary inquiry.

The Select      Committee may delegate to the chairman and vice chairman the      authority, on behalf of the Select Committee, to dismiss any      matter that they determine, after a preliminary inquiry,      lacks substantial merit. The Select Committee shall inform      the individual who provided to the Select Committee the      complaint, allegation, or information, and the individual who      is the subject of the complaint, allegation, or information,      of the dismissal, together with an explanation of the basis      for the dismissal.       (3) If, as a result of a preliminary inquiry under      paragraph (1), the Select Committee determines that a      violation is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de      minimis nature, the Select Committee may dispose of the      matter by issuing a public or private letter of admonition,      which shall not be considered discipline.

(4) If, as a result of a preliminary inquiry under      paragraph (1), the Select Committee determines that there is      such substantial credible evidence and the matter cannot be      appropriately disposed of under paragraph (3), the Select      Committee shall promptly initiate an adjudicatory review.      Upon the conclusion of such adjudicatory review, the Select      Committee shall report to the Senate, as so on as      practicable, the results of such adjudicatory review,      together with its recommendations (if any) pursuant to      subsection (a)(2).       (e) (1) Any individual who is the subject of a reprimand or      order of restitution, or both, pursuant to subsection (a)(3)      may, within 30 days of the Select Committee's report to the      Senate of its action imposing a reprimand or order of      restitution, or both, appeal to the Senate by providing      written notice of the basis for the appeal to the Select      Committee and the presiding officer of the The      presiding officer of the Senate shall cause the notice of the      appeal to be printed in the Congressional Record and the      Senate       (2) A motion to proceed to consideration of an appeal      pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be highly privileged and not      debatable. If the motion to proceed to consideration of the      appeal is agreed to, the appeal shall be decided on the basis      of the Select Committee's report to the Debate on the      appeal shall be limited to 10 hours, which shall be divided      equally between, and controlled by, those favoring and those      opposing the appeal.       (f) The Select Committee may, in its discretion, employ      hearing examiners to hear testimony and make findings of fact      and/or recommendations to the Select Committee concerning the      disposition of complaints.       (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no      adjudicatory review shall be initiated of any alleged      violation of any law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct,      rule, or regulation which was not in effect at the time the      alleged violation occurred. No provisions of the Senate Code      of Official Conduct shall apply to or require disclosure of      any act, relationship, or transaction which occurred prior to      the effective date of the applicable provision of the      The Select Committee may initiate an adjudicatory review of      any alleged violation of a rule or law which was in effect      prior to the enactment of the Senate Code of Official Conduct      if the alleged violation occurred while such rule or law was      in effect and the violation was not a matter resolved on the      merits by the predecessor Select       (h) The Select Committee shall adopt written rules setting      forth procedures to be used in conducting preliminary      inquiries and adjudicatory reviews.

(b) BASIS FOR PRELIMINARY INQUIRY: The Committee shall      promptly commence a preliminary inquiry whenever it has      received a sworn complaint, or other allegation of, or      information about, alleged misconduct or violations pursuant      to Rule 2.       (c) SCOPE OF PRELIMINARY INQUIRY:       (1) The preliminary inquiry shall be of such duration and      scope as is necessary to determine whether there is      substantial credible evidence which provides substantial      cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within      the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. The Chairman      and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, on behalf of the Committee      may supervise and determine the appropriate duration, scope,      and conduct of a preliminary inquiry. Whether a preliminary      inquiry is conducted jointly by the Chairman and Vice      Chairman or by the Committee as a hole, the day to day      supervision of a preliminary inquiry rests with the Chairman      and Vice Chairman, acting jointly.

(g) COMMITTEE ACTION: As soon as practicable following      submission of the report on the preliminary inquiry, the      Committee shall determine by a recorded vote whether there is      substantial credible evidence which provides substantial      cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within      the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. The Committee      may make any of the following determinations:       (1) The Committee may determine that there is not such      substantial credible evidence and, in such case, the      Committee shall dismiss the matter. The Committee, or      Chairman and Vice Chairman acting jointly on behalf of the      Committee, may dismiss any matter which, after a preliminary      inquiry, is determined to lack substantial merit. The      Committee shall inform the complainant of the dismissal.       (2) The Committee may determine that there is such      substantial credible evidence, but that the alleged violation      is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de minimis      nature. In such case, the Committee may dispose of the matter      by issuing a public or private letter of admonition, which      shall not be considered discipline and which shall not be      subject to appeal to the The issuance of a letter of      admonition must be approved by the affirmative recorded vote      of no fewer than four members of the Committee voting.

(b) SCOPE OF ADJUDICATORY REVIEW: When the Committee      decides to conduct an adjudicatory review , it shall be of      such duration and scope as is necessary for the Committee to      determine whether a violation within its jurisdiction has      occurred.

(4) Promptly, after the conclusion of the adjudicatory      review, the Committee's report and recommendation, if any,      shall be forwarded to the Secretary of the Senate, and a copy      shall be provided to the complainant and the respondent. The      full report and recommendation, if any, shall be printed and      made public, unless the Committee determines by the recorded      vote of not less than four members of the Committee that it      should remain confidential.

JDAM can be launched from very low      to very high altitudes in a dive, toss and loft, or in      straight and level flight with an on-axis or off-axis      delivery. JDAM enables multiple weapons to be directed      against single or multiple targets on a single pass. The JDAM      All Up Round and all of its components are UNCLASSIFIED;      technical data for JDAM is classified up to       2. If a technologically advanced adversary obtains      knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the      information could be used to develop countermeasures or[[Page S15]]     equivalent systems that might reduce weapon system      effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with      similar or advanced capabilities.       3.

TRANSMITTAL 16-66  Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to Section                 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                           Annex Item vii       (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:       1. Components considered to contain sensitive technology in      the proposed sale are as follows:       a. M1A2 Thermal Imaging System (TIS)--The TIS constitutes a      target acquisition system which, when operated with other      tank systems gives the tank crew a substantial advantage over      the potential threat. The TIS provides the crew with the      ability to effectively aim and fire the tank main armament      system under a broad range of adverse battlefield conditions.      The hardware itself is The engineering design      and manufacturing data associated with the detector and      infrared (IR) optics and coatings are considered sensitive.      The technical data package is UNCLASSIFIED with the exception      of the specifications for target acquisition range which is      CONFIDENTIAL and hardening data is classified up to      The consequences of such compromise would increase potential      enemy capabilities to neutralize effectiveness of the tank      main armament system by denying the crew ability to acquire      targets.       b. Special Armor--Major components of special armor are      fabricated in sealed modules and in serialized removable      subassemblies. Special armor vulnerability data for both      chemical and kinetic energy rounds are classified      Engineering design and manufacturing data related to special      armor are also classified The consequences of such      compromise of classified information would be the capability      to neutralize or defeat the armor. The sale or transfer of      armor modules are done on a government-to-government basis.      This serves to minimize, but not eliminate, the danger of      compromise.       c. 120mm Gun--the gun is composed of a 120mm smoothbore gun      (cannon) manufactured at Watervliet Arsenal; ``long rod''      APFSDS warheads; and combustible cartridge case ammunition.      There may be a need to procure/produce new gun cannon tubes      from Watervliet New cannons inducted at Anniston      Army Depot would be inspected according to established      criteria and shipped to Lima Army Tank Plant for tank upgrade      process. Gun production and technology are generally known.      Disclosure of gun production and technology specific to the      120mm (advance materials and tolerances) would degrade the      advantage.       d. AGT-1500 Gas Turbine Propulsion System--The use of a gas      turbine propulsion system in the M1A2 is a unique application      of armored vehicle power pack technology. The hardware is      composed of the AGT-1500 engine and transmission and is not      Manufacturing processes associated with the      production of turbine blades, recuperator, bearings and      shafts, and hydrostatic pump and motor are propriety and      therefore commercially competition sensitive. Unauthorized      release and exploitation of sensitive propulsion information      would adversely impact U.commercial interests. Acquisition      of production data by a potential enemy could enhance its      ability to design and produce gas turbine engine propulsion      system with application to land vehicles.       e. Compartmentation--A major survivability feature of the      MI tank is the compartmentation of fuel and ammunition.      Compartmentation is the positive separation of the crew and      critical components from combustible materials such that in      the event that the fuel or ammunition is ignited or      deteriorated by an incoming threat round, the crew is fully      protected. Sensitive information includes the performance of      the ammunition compartments as well as the compartment design      parameters. The design of the compartments cannot be      protected, however the guidelines, parametric inductions and      test data used to develop the compartments do not have to be      disclosed to permit a sale.       f. Common Remotely Operated Weapons Station--Low Profile      (CROWS-LP)--The CROWS-LP (M153A2E1) is a commanders' weapon      station. It allows for under armor operation of weapons--     M2HB, M2A1, M250B, and The CROWS-LP is an updated      version of the M153A2 CROWS that is approximately 10 inches      shorter; the CROWS-LP M153A2E1 increases visibility over the      weapon station. The fire control system of the CROWS-LP      allows the ``first-burst'' on target capability from      stationary and moving platforms. The CROWS-LP ingratiates a      day camera (VIM-C), thermal camera (TIM 1500), and laser      range finder (STORM/STORM-PI). Engineering design and      manufacturing data would provide potential enemy with the      means to increase small arms fire control from under armor.      The consequences of this would be improved enemy equipment in      the field and decrease technological fire control advantages.       2. The Ml tank will include the following communications      suite: Defense Advanced Global Positioning System (GPS)      Receiver (DAGR); AN/VAS-5 Driver's Vision Enhancer (DVE) and      Rear View Sensor System (RVSS); and Single Channel Ground and      Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS).       a. Defense Advanced Global Positioning System (GPS)      Receiver (DAGR)--DAGR is a lightweight (less than two pounds)      hand-held or host platform-mounted, dual frequency, Selective      Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) based, Precise      Positioning Service (PPS) device. The DAGR provides real-time      positioning, velocity (ground speed), navigation, and timing      (PVNT) information, in standalone (dismounted) and mounted      (ground facilities, sea, air, and land vehicles)      configurations. The DAGR can support missions involving land-     based war-fighting and non-war fighting operations. The DAGR      can also be used as a secondary or supplemental aid to      aviation-based missions which involve operations in low-     dynamic aircraft, and as an aid to navigation in water-borne      operations. DAGR AN/PSN-13(A) is fitted with the Selective      Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) 3.7 and can accept      cryptographic keys for increased PVNT accuracy and protection      from intentional false or spoofed satellite signals. The AN/     PSN-13(A) DAGR does not output classified information. If a      technology advanced adversary were to obtain knowledge of the      specific hardware and software elements, the information      could be used to identify ways of countering the detection      capabilities of the DAGR or improve the performance of their      GPS receivers; however, information available for the SAASM      would not be obtainable. SAASM is a tamper-resistant security      module. The remaining hardware used in the DAGR is considered      mature and available in other industrial nation's comparable      performance thresholds.       b. Drivers Vision Enhancer (DVE) AN/VAS-5 and Rear View      Sensor System (RVSS)--The AN/VAS-5 and RVSS are un-cooled      thermal imaging systems developed for use while driving      Combat Vehicles and Tactical Wheeled DVE and RVSS      allow for tactical vehicle movement in support of operational      missions in all environment conditions (day/night and all      weather) and provides enhanced driving capability during      limited visibility conditions (darkness, smoke, dust, fog,      etc.). The DVE program provides night vision targeting      capabilities for armored vehicles and long-range night vision      reconnaissance capability to the warfighter. Engineering      design and manufacturing data would provide a potential enemy      with the means to upgrade the quality of efficiency of      thermal devices production. The consequences of this would be      improved enemy equipment of the field. Technical information      regarding DVE and RVSS, including UNCLASSIFIED information,      should generally not be considered for release.       The highest level of information that must be disclosed for      production, operation or sale of the end item is      UNCLASSIFIED/FOR OFFICIAL USE       c. Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System      (SINCGARS)--The AN/VRC-92E and RT-1702 SINCGARS provides war-     fighting commanders and troops with a highly reliable,      secure, easily maintained Combat Net Radio (CNR) that has      both voice and data handling capability in support of command      and control operations. SINCGARS, with the Internet      Controller, provides the communications link for the      digitized force. SINCGARS is a radio fielded to tactical      field elements. It facilitates the transmission of voice and/     or data information, which allows for the conducting of a      myriad of missions across the operational continuum. SINCGARS      is available for the dismounted soldier, ground and aviation      platforms. Training will vary for the radio (RT-1702) and      spare and repair parts for the RT-1702 model are not      supported by the Standard Army Supply There is      sensitive or restricted information contained in the AN/[[Page S18]]     VRC-92E or software. There would be adverse consequences of      the AN/VRC-92E and software were to be lost to a technically      advanced adversary. If a technology advances adversary were      to obtain knowledge of the specific hardware and software      elements, the information could be used to identify ways of      countering the Electronic Counter-Counter Measures (ECCM).      The hardware used in the AN/VRC-92E and RT-1702 is considered      mature.       3. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.     foreign policy and national security objectives outlined in      the Policy Moreover, the benefits to be      derived from this sale, as outlined in the Policy      Justification, outweigh the potential damage that could      result if the sensitive technology were revealed to      unauthorized persons.       4. All defense articles and services listed in this      transmittal have been authorized for release and export to      the Government of                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-03-pt1-PgS14.txt,1825,REPEALING OBAMACARE,2017.0,3.0,March

505,topic-id,289,"Mr.Speaker, I stand here today in strong opposition to H.57. Not only is the rollback of these substantive measures incredibly detrimental, but the process by which my Republican colleagues are facilitating their actions is, quite simply, wrong. This regulation is a product of months of work to come to a consensus on what is best for all of our students.  Mr.Speaker, the Every Student Succeeds Act received strong bipartisan support, and it received bicameral support when it passed when 359 Members of the House and 85 Senators voted in favor of this legislation. In fact, Senator Lamar Alexander, who serves as chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, said back then that this bill was truly a Christmas miracle for American children. However, just weeks into this administration, Republicans, for purely political reasons and for political purposes, are actively working to strip States and districts of the stability and clarity they need to implement this law.  Approximately 50 million children attend public schools in the United About 1.1 million of those students are in New York City Public I think everyone agrees that we should be doing all we can do to help and prepare our students, but this resolution does the exact opposite. This regulation provides important guidance to ensure the students are college and career ready. It helps schools identify subgroups of students in need of additional academic support and help.  Dismantling this regulation will disrupt ways in which information used to measure school performance and resource equity is reported, ultimately resulting in our parents, teachers, and policymakers not being equipped with the necessary data to make important decisions.

407,topic-id,463,"Mr.Speaker, this year, Texas has the great honor of hosting the Super In just a couple of weeks,Houston will host the largest event of the year in the United States with approximately 100,000 people expected to attend andmore than 100 million expected to tune in on television.  The Department of Homeland Security calls the Super Bowl the most attractive target for those who want to commit harm.Thanks to partnerships between local, state, and Federal officials, K9s will be deployed for bomb detections, officers on thelookout for suspicious activity, and air security will be ramped up, to name just a few of the precautions.  Law enforcement is doing a great job of reminding everyone who plans to attend: if you see something, say something. Sinceit is January and it is Human Trafficking Awareness Month, I want to remind everyone that ``see something, say something''doesn't just apply to unattended backpacks.  During a recent meeting on Capitol Hill, DHS reminded all of us that events such as the Super Bowl bring the good, the bad,and the ugly. While a majority of the attendees are coming to have a good time and with good intentions, the few who do not candisrupt and ruin many lives.  So I ask those who attend to help us in keeping Texas one of the safest and best States in the country by reporting anythingto law enforcement they may believe to be suspicious and allow trained officers to investigate. This includes suspected humantrafficking.  According to the Polaris Project, warning signs of someone being a victim of human trafficking include not being allowed toleave or come and go as they wish; appearing malnourished; not being in control of his or her own identification documents; notbeing allowed to speak for themselves; and showing signs of physical abuse, torture, or physical restraint.  While law enforcement will be ramping up efforts to reach out to victims and give them the resources they need to get help,it lies on each and every one of us to be aware of our surroundings and help when someone is in trouble or something is notright.  It is important to remember that human trafficking doesn't just happen during large sporting events. It happens every day,often going unseen. While events like the Super Bowl help bring it to our attention, it is important to remember that, when theevent is over, men and women, boys and girls are still being victimized each and every day.  UNICEF has estimated there were 1.5 million victims of human trafficking in the United States alone in 2014, and that numbersoars to 27 million worldwide. This is a problem that is going to continue to need our attention 365 days a year. We have got towork together to end this form of human slavery.

Voting in support of this resolution ensures that the Federal Government will stay out of our children's classrooms and give the power back to the local authorities to make good, solid education decisions.  Throughout my congressional campaign, the people of the Third District of Georgia of all backgrounds and income continued to express their frustration that the Federal Government continued to get involved in policies that should be the domain of local and State governments.  I have spoken with education leaders in the Third District of Georgia, in places like Troup County and Fayette County, and they were very pleased with the bipartisan effort of the Every Student Succeeds Act passed last They told me that they felt hopeful with the new flexibility written into the law granting the power to the States and the local leaders to decide what accountability measures work best for their students. However, as time went on, they expressed great concern as the Department of Education began writing this new accountability regulation.  The accountability measures that will work for my home State of Georgia and my home district won't always work best for students elsewhere. Trying to educate students in the Third District of Georgia the exact same way you do students in Detroit, Michigan, or Spokane, Washington, or Prescott, Arizona, just simply will not work.  Every child deserves access to quality education, but imposing a nationwide standard will only hamper this goal with burdensome regulations, and we have seen that failed policy under the No Child Left Behind This resolution pulls back the Federal overreach, ensuring that the decisions will remain at the local level, and that is why I support H.57 today.

496,topic-id,440,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank my colleague Mr.Rokita for yielding time and for handling this on the floor today.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.57. For years, the Federal Government operated under the flawed idea that Washington knows best when it comes to education. Policies put in place in recent decades vastly expanded the Federal footprint in the K-12 schools and prevented State and local education leaders from delivering the high-quality education all children deserve.  Something needed to change. Yet, under the Obama administration, the problem only got worse. For years, the last administration used regulations, waivers, and pet projects to unilaterally exert its control over education. Its heavy-handed, one-size-fits-all policies only increased the Federal role in America's classrooms, moving K-12 education in the wrong direction. That is why Republicans and Democrats came together to pass the Every Student Succeeds  Enacted just over a year ago, the law was built on three important principles: empowering parents, reducing the Federal role, and restoring local control. It sent a clear message that the American people were done with the top-down approach to education.  Unfortunately, the previous administration didn't get the message. The Department of Education continued using rules and regulations to push its failed education agenda--the same agenda Congress rejected with overwhelming bipartisan support. We are here today to put a stop to two of those rules.  The resolution under consideration, H.57, will roll back a regulation implementing accountability provisions in the Every Student Succeeds The law empowers States to develop ways to hold schools accountable to the students and parents they serve, and ensure taxpayer dollars are being spent responsibly. The Department's accountability rule, however, does the exact opposite. Not only does it impose prescriptive accountability requirements on State education leaders, but it also violates specific prohibitions the law places on the Secretary of Education's authority.  We also considered, a few moments ago, H.58, which will block implementation of a regulation that significantly expands the Federal Government's involvement in teacher preparation.  Yet, another example of Obama overreach, the teacher preparation rule essentially creates a Federal system for evaluating teacher performance. It would be virtually impossible to implement and could lead to fewer teachers serving low-income students.  Together, these two resolutions of disapproval will move us towards limiting the Federal role in education and protect the local control promised with recent education reforms.  I want to thank Representatives Rokita and Guthrie for their work to fight against the flawed policies of the past and for leading the way in delivering a more positive, more limited, and more responsible Federal role in education.  I urge my colleagues to support both resolutions.  ",CREC-2017-02-07-pt1-PgH1046.txt,1791,SEC REGULATORY ACCOUNTABILITY ACT,2017.0,7.0,February

450,topic-id,2845,"Mr.Speaker, it is the end of another week in session.  Mr.Speaker, I want to revisit an important issue. It seems that what some of us were trying to point out for 8 years under the Obama administration fell on deaf ears, that there really are radical Islamists who want to destroy our way of life in the United States, who look at us as infidels, and not just Christians, Jews, secularists, and others, but even Muslims who do not adapt and accept the radical Islamic ways.  That works to the advantage of some because we have seen for 8 years CAIR, Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated groups, groups that were listed as co-conspirators in the Holy Land Foundation trial[[Page H2046]]back in 2008, where the named defendants were convicted of many counts, and they were supporting terrorism. They have ties all over the United States and they have ties to people who constantly had access to President Obama's White House, the State Department, and so many other areas.  We saw time and time again the Obama administration looking the other way as serious matters arose involving radical Islamists, both in the United States and abroad. The Obama administration's approach was: If we can just teach these racist, bigoted, Americans to love all Because they wouldn't point out that some are radicals, as my Muslim friends don't hesitate to point out.  But this administration didn't want to point out that there are radical Islamists, that they are part of Islam, that many of them are experts in Islam, like Baghdadi, who heads up the Islamic He has a Ph.in Islamic studies, so it is kind of difficult to say that he has nothing to do with Islam when that is the basis for everything he said and did.  If one goes and looks at the pleading that the judge declassified from 2008 of testimony given by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in a court at Guantanamo Bay, he makes very clear that he is not insane, that he is very lucid. He files a very impressive document explaining himself.  For everything that he said, for example, about the need to kill Christians and Jews, he had a direct quote, not from the Like where often Members of Congress, if you bring something up on the floor about Islam or the Koran, then it is amazing. It hasn't happened in a while, but Members who bring something like that up, they frequently find themselves being presented a Somebody drops off a  But, as an expert in the field pointed out to me when I showed him the Koran that was dropped off at my House, he says, that is a Koran, it is not a Holy Koran; because what they have done is they have taken what they call the Holy Koran and they have eliminated the verses that support terrorism and the killing of Jews and So if you read from cover to cover this Koran, you don't see any of the verses that the most radical Islamists rely on for their killing, their beheading, their betraying, their lies. And it is okay, they believe, to lie if it ends up supporting the cause of their radical beliefs about  One of the reasons that I contend with so many others here that Egypt ought to be one of our dearest friends is because they have an elected president. Yes, he was a former general, like Eisenhower, like George Washington, like Andrew Jackson, like so many who had been generals before they became They understand warfare.  But the radical Islamists in the United States, so many of them, Muslim Brotherhood-related groups, they pointed out time and again: Look, we know we are going to have to get to violence at some point. But for now, we are making so much progress in taking over the United States without using violence that right now violence distracts from what we are trying to do.  Some of us continue to point out that what the Obama administration constantly used as their fight against, not radical Islam--they couldn't say that like President Trump does--but they would say against violent extremism: We have got to spend millions and millions, and hundreds of millions of dollars fighting violent extremism.  They believed what the often Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated individuals would say: Yes, if we spend that money teaching people to love and accept Islam, then the problem goes away and there is no more violence.  Which is, in and of itself, a complete lie.  So the Obama administration has been spending money on things. I am told by someone who was looking at the ways that the Obama administration spent hard-earned taxpayer dollars paid to the government, and then the Obama administration would turn around and spend it. I am told by someone in Homeland Security--I haven't seen it--but they even had a project spending taxpayer dollars to fight radical Islam by teaching schoolchildren pro-Islamic songs to sing. It is one of the reasons I am so glad we have had a change of  I know that there are so many people across the aisle, not necessarily people here in this body, but across the country, who keep saying: Oh, there is so much prejudice against Muslims, and that is the whole problem. If we can eliminate the prejudice against Islam, against Muslims, there will be no more violence.  There are those that are in this body here who have gone so far to show how open-minded they are and how much they embrace the ideals of Islam, and are in no way bigoted, that they have exposed this body to criminals, to hacking; and who knows just how far the security breaches go.  Mr.Speaker, we brought this up, but it is important to take note that this body--there were no Republicans that hired them, but Imran Awan seemed to be the ring leader, Abid Awan, Jamal Awan, Hina Alvi, Natalia Sova, each making $160,000-plus from the House of The Awan brothers are of Pakistani descent. I am told the leader is now back in Pakistan while they are being investigated, but their immigration status appears unclear right now. They had been hired as IT specialists, computer specialists, to help some of my Democratic friends with their computer systems. And as suspicious activity continued to mount over the last 12 years, it was dismissed.  And I am reading from an article that Luke Rosiak, March 8, from The Daily Caller wrote.                              {time}  1230  I'm reading from an article that Luke Rosiak, March 8, of the Daily Caller wrote:       It was dismissed because these five individuals were being      unfairly picked on because they are  Well, some of us don't care what their religious beliefs are unless their religious beliefs happen to cause them to believe that our Constitution needed to be eliminated and replaced by nothing but sharia law, and our elected leaders needed to be replaced by what they believe is a holy appointment of a caliph or an imam.  This article from March 8 says that congressional staffers suspected of improperly accessing sensitive data allegedly controlled their stepmother with violent threats in a plan to use her to access assets stored in the Middle East in their father's name.  So just when we thought this whole matter could not get any more bizarre, these five, according to one of their employers here in this House, he says--and I have no reason to doubt him--that they are But I know my friends. They don't want to ever be perceived as being bigoted because they are not. But they have gone so far overboard in trying to show how open-minded they are, they have exposed this body to security breaches that are really unbelievable.  I understand from my friend, Devin Nunes, that these individuals were not, best they can tell, ever given access to the classified material in the separate classified system that the intel community has.  Talking about running the Democratic House Members' computer networks, this article says: ``Days before U.Capitol Police told House Members three Pakistani brothers who ran their computer networks may have stolen congressional data, their stepmother called Fairfax County, Virginia, police to say the Democratic staffers were keeping her from her husband's deathbed.''  A relative described her situation as being kept in captivity by the brothers for months while they schemed to take their father's life insurance.  The brothers, as IT professionals--computer experts--for Congress, could read House Members' emails and also had full access to their calendars: who they were meeting with and where they were meeting.  Anyway, the article says they ``allegedly used wiretapping devices on their own stepmother and threatened to abduct loved ones in Pakistan if she didn't give them access to money stowed away in that country.  ``On February 2, House officials banned Imran, Abid, and Jamal Awan from the House of Representatives network as part of a Capitol Police criminal investigation into House computer security.''  But longtime employers, including--and it has been in the news--our friend, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman[[Page H2047]]Schultz, and others are named have stood by these suspected criminals. But they did say they had access to their data.  They say we have `` `seen no evidence that they were doing anything that was nefarious' like steal or hack, and were being unfairly picked on for being  ``But a Fairfax police report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group says that separately from that investigation, on Thursday, on January 5 at 2 p.m., `Samani Galani called police after her stepchildren were denying her access to her husband of 8 years, Muhammad Shah, who is currently hospitalized,' and police responded to the Springfield home she shared with him.  `` `I made contact with her stepson, Abid, who responded to location and was obviously upset with the situation. He stated he has full power of attorney over his father and produced an unsigned, undated document as proof,' officers wrote.''  Then the officer said: ``He refused to disclose his father's location.''  So he didn't even have a signed power of attorney yet continued to assert--and, again, this is someone who is given access to the privileged computer material of people here on Capitol I am told by other IT professionals that do work here that, if you know what you are doing and you have access to even one Congress Member's computer, which means their calendar, their emails, and notes taken and stored on the computer about meetings, then it is very easy--you are good--to access virtually anybody else's information here in  I was told some time back by one of my friends in Intelligence that at one time there was concern about positions I had taken like in support of Egypt against the Muslim Brotherhood and that there were those who were monitoring people that came to my office. I was told that they know everybody that walks into your office.  So when you see these kinds of reports, Mr.Speaker, it is a little disconcerting. It is disconcerting that people are not more concerned here in this body about the potential for the kind of breach that is being stated here.  Anyway the article goes on: ``The father died days later, with his children denying him a final moment with his loved one, and the body was taken to Pakistan, where there were significant assets in their father's name. Galani was shocked to learn that his death certificate''--that of her husband--``listed him as divorced, according to a relative of Galani's. The relative spoke only on condition of anonymity.  `` `They kept their stepmother in sort of illegal captivity from October 16, 2016, to February 2,' the relative said, telling her they were in charge of her life and said she was not allowed to speak to anyone. The fact that she did not speak English made it easy for them to take advantage of her.  ``As Shah laid hospitalized, `they would not let the father communicate with the wife, they would say he'd be meeting her when they said so.'  ``The brothers bugged her house with hidden listening devices and told her `her movements were under constant surveillance and conversations within the house and over the telephone were being listened to. They would repeat what she had told people to prove that they were really listening.'  ```This happened in the United States of America, can you believe it?' the relative asked.  ``Galani obtained a secret cellphone and stood in the yard to communicate with relatives, who encouraged her to call the police. . . .  ``After she did, Abid `threatened her very severely, made her fearful, they told her they are going to abduct or kidnap her family back in Pakistan, and she had to apologize.' ''  Imran is the individual who had done computer work here for so many of our Democratic friends here in the  ``Imran then tried `to manipulate her. She said to him, ``if you say you are my son, then why are you keeping my phone conversations listened to?'' So he said he would remove the devices. He came into the house and she saw him remove a couple,' including under the kitchen counter.''  So it is interesting. We have these guys who Members of Congress said: They don't need a background check. We can trust them. We are open-minded. They are Muslims, but we are not prejudiced. We don't even require a background check because we know we can trust them.  Mr.Speaker, we don't know what they did here in the House, but in their stepmother's house they planted listening devices. Apparently, they knew where to get them, and they knew how to use them in the home. It still leads one to wonder: What all did they do during the 12 years they were working on computer systems here on Capitol Hill?  Still, we know the allegations have been talked about at length in the media about the hacking of the Democratic National Committee, but I keep asking: Are these the guys that set up the Democratic National Committee's computers, guys that are good at planting listening devices and who are good at setting up cameras to monitor movement and what is going on? Did these guys help the Democratic National Committee set up their system without any background checks? Are these the guys that made it so vulnerable to being hacked by Russians or most anyone else who cared to try?  ``Galani learned from a life insurance executive that `a few days before the father's death, the beneficiary was changed and Abid became the beneficiary,' the relative said. On top of that, the Springfield house where she lived would go to  ``Galani fled from the brothers and has filed a second police complaint with Fairfax County over insurance fraud and other abuses.  ``Abid did not return a request for comment from'' the Daily  It also pointed out that, after Mr.Shah passed away, these people that were doing computer work for Members of Congress without background checks came into her house. She said that whatever documents were there they stole, along with a couple of laptops that were their father's property, and they left for  Now, I heard somebody that should have known that the ringleader here that headed up the computer company that serviced so many of the--well, this article talks about a handful of Democrats, but I have been hearing that at one time, over the years, over the last 12 years, they may have serviced as many as 80 different Democratic Members of Congress' computers.  But the relatives are coming forward now, according to the article, because Members of Congress have attempted to downplay the brothers' potential crimes and have limited the investigation to just the Capitol Police, who lack the ability to investigate cyber breaches and international crimes, and despite naming the brothers as suspects, have not even arrested them. This is, apparently, a Muslim woman who says that she is fighting to protect the country--talking about the United States--these are very bad people.  This kind of reminds one of the father who came forward to point out that his son had become radicalized and was a terrorist threat because, under the Obama administration, they purged the training documents so FBI agents, State Department officials, and intelligence officials would not know what to look for to spot radical  We know most Muslims are not terrorists.

566,topic-id,474,"Mr.Chair, I rise today in support of H.78, the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act, which would improve andstrengthen the SEC's rulemaking process by requiring more rigorous economic analysis.  What exactly does that mean?  Well, an economic analysis is quite simple, frankly. It is a systemic approach to determine the optimum use of scarceresources involving comparison of two or more alternatives to achieve a specific objective under the given assumptions andconstraints. That is a whole lot of words and jumbo. But what we need to do is make a comparison, what is going to be thebenefit.  Economic analysis takes into account the opportunity costs of resources employed and attempts to measure, in monetary terms,the private and social costs and benefits of a project to a community, an economy, or to an individual.  In its simplest terms, the SEC would have to determine the costs and benefits of proposed regulations, as well as potentialalternatives to determine a best direction forward, basically ensuring that the SEC is thoroughly assessing both the need forthe regulation and adequately evaluating the potential consequences, both intended and unintended, and is there a benefit.  Mr.Chairman, requiring economic analysis by Federal regulators is not a partisan issue. In fact, both President Clinton andPresident Obama issued executive orders requiring regulators to ensure that their rules were maximizing and achieving a netbenefit.  H.78, the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act, would ensure consistent and effective application of the SEC's economicanalysis guidance by building on the bipartisan effort to strengthen economic analysis requirements, as well as require aretrospective review of existing regulations for independent agencies like the  Specifically, the bill would enhance the SEC's existing economic analysis requirements by requiring the Commission to firstclearly identify the nature of the problem that would be addressed before issuing a new regulation--too often, we are justshooting at a target that we don't even know is actually a target--and to prohibit the SEC from issuing a rule when it cannotmake ``a reasoned determination that the benefits of the intended regulation justify the costs of the regulation.''  Additionally, H.78 would require the SEC to assess the costs and the benefits of available regulatory alternatives,including the alternative of not issuing a regulation, and choose the approach that would maximize the net benefit. The SEC mustalso evaluate whether a proposed regulation is inconsistent or incompatible or duplicative of other Federal regulations.  In testimony before the Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises last year, former SECCommissioner Dan Gallagher noted that the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act would ``promote and improve economic analysis at theSEC and make the agency even more accountable to the investing public.''

588,topic-id,1821,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  I would just like to point out to those watching on TV the earlier Democrat-sponsored hot air portion of the bill today.  You heard about the Export-Import You heard about Bernie You heard about the Dodd-Frank Act being the onlyanswer to an economic crisis that was caused by a housing crisis which, by the way, the Dodd-Frank Act did nothing about. By theway, on the Bernie Madoff situation, the SEC ignored a whistleblower for 10 years.  This bill has nothing to do with fraud, and it is not about a trial of the effectiveness or lack thereof of the SEC today.This is about a commonsense notion that we ought to actually identify the target that these rules are trying to hit and thenfind out if it is the right target and analyze that.  What you see on the other side of the aisle is the philosophy that more is better: the more regulation that the SEC has, themore paperwork, a bigger budget with more employees. We are not sure what their effectiveness is, and we are not sure whatexactly they are trying to achieve here, but all we can tell you is that more is better. Damn the costs; it doesn't matter.  That is, obviously, not the intent that we have on this side of the aisle. We are trying to make sure that the[[Page H437]]properprotection of the investors is there. We are trying to make sure that the three parts of the SEC's mandate, of which one ofthose is capital formation and creating a robust atmosphere, are actually happening.  I urge passage of the bill.  Mr.Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting All time for general debate has expired.  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5-minute rule and shall be considered as read.

It doesn't matter what the words say,just let's have more of them.  We already have the SEC Chairman and the Commissioners covered by both governmentwide ethics laws and regulations as well asSEC supplemental ethics regulations which apply to all SEC employees. For example, they cannot participate personally andsubstantially in any matter that would have direct or predictable effect on his or her financial interests or imputed financialinterests in the future, as required under the code.  Also, unless they are specifically authorized by the SEC's ethics counsel, they should recuse from any matter in which he orshe has a ``covered relationship.'' Well, what is a covered relationship? Well, a covered relationship includes formeremployees, clients, and even a spouse's employer. Further, the SEC employees must report their financial holdings to the SEC'sethics counsel; and this requirement goes beyond, frankly, the governmentwide reporting requirement.  Finally, the SEC Chairman or a Commissioner must not engage in any other business, employment, or vocation while in office;nor may he or she ever use the power of their office to influence their name to promote the business interests of others, asrequired by law.  As such, I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing this amendment.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

599,topic-id,230,"Mr.Chairman, I just find it a bit ironic that the other side is not interested in doing this cost-benefitanalysis which is in the underlying bill here because it is too burdensome. But what do they want to do? They want to add morepaperwork and more burden in their amendments.  Despite what you have heard, the SEC is not a systemic risk regulator; and even the former chairman of the Committee onFinancial Services, Barney Frank, noted at the time when the FSOC was reviewing asset managers for systemic designations, herecognized that these are not entities that pose a systemic risk to the financial system. And while the SEC does not regulatesystemic risk, I am afraid that this amendment could be potentially politically misinterpreted and applied to a number ofcapital market participants and activities which they, frankly, have no business regulating. So it would lead to the same fire,aim, ready kind of situation rulemaking that we have seen from the current administration that hinders growth and that capitalmarket formation that we have just talked about in the last amendment.  The bill before us will ensure that future SEC rulemakings are prudently proposed and adopted to achieve the maximum netbenefit, and that is what we are really talking about here today.

And there is a staff-level rule letter.  With this underlying bill, we are trying to codify that. We are trying to make sure, not just with a letter, but by law,that they do what they are being ordered to do. And I will remind all of my colleagues and those of you out watching us, theSecurities and Exchange Commission has a mission that has three parts.  The first part is to protect investors. Nothing in this bill weakens there. Nothing in this bill takes anything away fromthat. We, in fact, underscore that.  The second mission that it has is to maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets. Emphasis again, fair, orderly, andefficient markets. What we are seeing is inefficiency that is being built into the marketplace right now, and we are here toclarify that. Let's find out, as the SEC is preparing a rule, what the goal and objective is and what is going to be the impacton it. Yes, cost is part of that, and we are able to look at that.  The third thing the SEC intended to do is to facilitate capital formation.  Why is that important and what exactly does that mean?

412,topic-id,729,"Mr.Speaker, I was reflecting the other day. Last week, we all joined together in this Chamber, we held upour right hand, and we swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.  That is an oath I have taken both as a Member of Congress--now on my fourth term--and as a military pilot, something similarto that, talking about the importance of the military to protect and defend the In both of these roles, I haveseen firsthand the sacrifice that men and women of the military have been willing to make to defend their freedoms, to defendthe Constitution, defend the country.  This last month was especially tough for our Nation's security and for our foreign policy. The 8-year decline of Americanglobal leadership, under the President, came to a head. A sad trend built by the Obama administration continued as the WhiteHouse worked with our enemies and abandoned our friends.  For one, the recent ceasefire in Syria was reached without United States' input, ultimately empowering tyrants in Iran andin In fact, to think about the situation in Syria, I want to remind people there are half a million dead Syrians rightnow, innocent civilians. And I have heard people say, completely incorrectly, that it doesn't matter; they are all basicallyterrorists. But let's say it is.  There are 50,000 children in Syria that did not get an opportunity to go be a teacher or a police officer or a firefighteror a doctor because of tyrants in Iran, because of Bashar al-Assad and because of Russia empowering them and using precision-guided munitions to hit innocent civilians and take their life away.  Last week, the U.abstained from a vote in the United Nations Security Council on the biased resolution targeting our ally Mr.Speaker, rather than turning on freedom-loving nations around the world, we must stand with them. Nowhere is this moreimportant than in the fight against terrorism.  Before the holidays, a list went out from ISIS accounts with the names of churches in the United States that should beattacked over the holidays. Then, an attack in Berlin took the lives of 12 innocent civilians and injured more than 50 in aChristmas market. On New Year's Eve, there was a savage attack at a nightclub in Istanbul, killing 39 revelers and injuringdozens.  Both attacks were claimed by ISIS seeking to strike fear into freedom-loving people around the world. While we all mustremain vigilant, we cannot give in to that fear, and we must continue to live our lives.  What we need right now, Mr.Speaker, is a renewed American moment, renewed American leadership after 8 years of decline. Weneed a Churchill moment. I think about Winston Churchill after the bombs rained down in London, and instead of hiding andcowering and talking about how terrible it is, he goes out on the streets, rallies the people, and says that you cannot shatterus. And the people unite behind him.  It is time for America to exhibit the same kind of leadership exhibited by George Bush in the bullhorn speech after thefall of the World Trade He showed Americans unity, strength, resolve, and he reminded the world that our foundationswill not be shaken even if you shake the foundations of our biggest buildings. And you can shatter our steel, but you can'tshatter the steel of American resolve. I haven't heard speeches like that in quite a while from the oval office.  Mr.Speaker, it has been a rough election cycle for our country. It has been a tough, very divisive, and difficult time, butnow it is time to come together. We are going to have our partisan differences and battles, and that is fine. That is what weare out here for.  But, Mr.Speaker, America needs to remember our mission, our God-given mission. I believe that is to be an example of self-governance to billions of people that don't have what we have, but are desperate for it.  We used that kind of leadership in the cold war as millions lived behind the Iron Curtain and saw what freedom could be. Andthere are iron curtains that exist today; terrorism, strongmen, a resurgent Russia--an iron curtain of soft expectations and lowexpectations of people.  For the last 8 years, we failed to articulate that mission. Mr.Speaker, we are a nation in need of remembering thatmission, and it is my sincere hope that this will change very soon.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-11-pt1-PgH304.txt,2014,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF RULE SUBMITTED BY DEPARTMENT,2017.0,11.0,January

660,topic-id,1200,"Mr.Speaker, I rise to a question of the privileges of the House, and offer the resolution that was previously noticed.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the resolution.  The Clerk read as follows:       Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that      the President shall immediately disclose his tax return      information to Congress and the American people.       Whereas, the Emoluments Clause was included in the U.     Constitution for the express purpose of preventing federal      officials from accepting any ``present, Emolument, Office, or      Title . . . from any King, Prince, or foreign State'';       Whereas, in Federalist 22 (Alexander Hamilton) it is      said, ``One of the weak sides of republics, among their      numerous advantages, is that they afford too easy an inlet to      foreign corruption,'' and;       Whereas, the delegates to the Constitutional Convention      specifically designed the Emoluments Clause as an antidote to      potentially corrupting foreign practices of a kind that the      Framers had observed during the period of the Confederation,      and;       Whereas, Article 1, section 9, clause 8 of the Constitution      states: ``no person holding any office of profit or trust . .      . shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept of any      present, Emolument, Office, or Title of any kind whatever,      from any King, Prince, or foreign State'', and;       Whereas, in 2009, the Office of Legal Counsel clarified      that corporations owned or controlled by foreign governments      presumptively qualify as foreign States under the foreign      Emoluments Clause, and;       Whereas, the word ``emoluments'' means profit, salary,      fees, or compensation which would include direct payment, as      well as other benefits, including extension of credit,      forgiveness of debt, or the granting of rights of pecuniary      value, and;       Whereas, according to The New Yorker, in 2012, The Trump      Organization entered into a deal with Ziya Mammadov to build      the Trump Tower Baku in the notoriously corrupt country      Azerbaijan in possible violation of the Foreign Corrupt      Practices Act and, by profiting from business with the      Mammadov family, due to their financial entanglements with      the Iran Revolutionary Guard may have also violated the      Emoluments Clause if income from this project continues to      flow to The Trump Organization, and;       Whereas, The Trump Organization has deals in Turkey,      admitted by the President himself during a 2015 Brietbart      interview, and when the President announced his travel ban,      Turkey's President called for President Trump's name to be      removed from Trump Towers Istanbul, according to The Wall      Street Journal, and President Trump's company is currently      involved in major licensing deals for that property which may      implicate the Emoluments Clause, and;       Whereas, shortly after election, the President met with the      former U.Independence Party leader, Nigel Farage, to get      help to stop obstructions of the view from one of his golf      resorts in Scotland, and according to The New York Times,      both of the resorts he owns there are promoted by Scotland's      official tourism agency, a benefit that may violate the      Emoluments Clause, and;       Whereas, at Trump Tower in New York, the Industrial and      Commercial Bank of China is a large tenant, according to      Bloomberg; the United Arab Emirates leases space, according      to the Abu Dhabi Tourism & Culture Authority; and the Saudi      Mission to the U.makes annual payments, according to the      New York Daily News, and money from these foreign countries      goes to the President, and;       Whereas, according to NPR, in February China gave      provisional approval for 38 new trademarks for The Trump      Organization, which have been sought for a decade to no      avail, until President Trump won the election. This is a      benefit the Chinese Government gave to the President's      businesses in possible violation of the Emoluments Clause,      and;       Whereas, the President is part owner of a New York building      carrying a $950 million loan, partially held by the Bank of      China, according to The New York Times, when owing the      Government of China by the extension of loans and credits by      a foreign State to an officer of the United States would      violate the Emoluments Clause, and;       Whereas, NPR reported that the Embassy of Kuwait held its      600 guest National Day celebration at Trump Hotel in      Washington, D.C., last month, proceeds to Trump, and;       Whereas, according to The Washington Post, the Trump      International Hotel in Washington, D.C., has hired a      ``director of diplomatic sales'' to generate high-priced      business among foreign leaders and diplomatic delegations,      and;       Whereas, according to his 2016 candidate filing with the      Federal Election Commission, the President has 564 financial      positions in[[Page H2502]]     companies located in the United States and around the world,      and;       Whereas, against the advice of ethics attorneys and the      Office of Government Ethics, the President has refused to      divest his ownership stake in his businesses, and;       Whereas, the Director of the nonpartisan Office of      Government Ethics said that the President's plan to transfer      his business holdings to a trust managed by family members is      ``meaningless'' and ``does not meet the standards that . . .      every President in the past four decades has met'', and;       Whereas, in the United States' system of checks and      balances, Congress has a responsibility to hold the executive      branch of government to the highest standard of transparency      to ensure the public interest is placed first and the      Constitution is adhered to, and;       Whereas, the House Judiciary Committee has the first      responsibility among the committees of the House to see that      elements of our Constitution are adhered to and, in      furtherance of that responsibility, Judiciary Committee      members have historically utilized fact-finding and research      prior to formal hearings, and;       Whereas, tax returns provide an important baseline      disclosure because they contain highly instructive      information including whether the filer paid taxes, what they      own, what they have borrowed and from whom, whether they have      made any charitable donations, and whether they have taken      advantage of tax loopholes and that such information would be      material to members of the Judiciary Committee as research is      undertaken on whether President Trump is in violation of the      Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, and;       Whereas, disclosure of the President's tax returns would be      an effective means for the President to provide evidence      either refuting or confirming claims of violations of the      Emoluments Clause, and;       Whereas, the President's tax returns are likely to be      essential as members of the Judiciary Committee work to      research potential violations of the Emoluments Clause, and;       Whereas, the chairmen of the Ways and Means Committee,      Joint Committee on Taxation, and Senate Finance Committee      have the authority to request the President's tax returns      under section 6103 of the Tax Code, and this power is an      essential tool in learning whether the President may be in      violation of the Emoluments Clause, and;       Whereas, questions involving constitutional functions and      the House's constitutionally granted powers have been      recognized as valid questions of the privileges of the       Resolved, That the House of Representatives shall--       1.

662,topic-id,720,"Mr.Speaker, under clause 1 of rule IX, questions of the privileges of the House are: ``those affecting the rights of the House collectively, its safety, dignity, and the integrity of its proceedings.''  The dignity and integrity of the House's proceedings have been violated, and continue to be violated, because Congress has not had the constitutionally afforded opportunity to consent to emoluments being received by the President or to enforce, if consent is not given.  I would note that Congress has the authority to request the President's taxes under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code, and use of this authority would not be unprecedented, as it was used in 1974 to request President Nixon's tax returns that revealed that he owed nearly half a million dollars in back taxes.  I would note that issues of the Constitution and the House's prerogatives under the Constitution have a precedent in using rule IX as a privileged resolution.  For example, if a revenue measure is initiated in the Senate instead of in the House as required by the Constitution, that is a matter of a privilege of the I would argue that the Emoluments Clause is at least as important, possibly more important, than the origination of a revenue measure in either the House or  I have been a member of the Judiciary Committee for 22 years. I am well aware of how the Judiciary Committee operates and the need for individual Members to do research before any official action is taken in that committee. And since it is the Judiciary Committee, it has the first responsibility for adhering to the Constitution among the committees of the I think it is absolutely essential for the President's tax returns to be released so that the members of the Judiciary Committee can do their job to research whether the Emoluments Clause has been violated and whether permission should be given to the President to receive payments from foreign states.  I would note that there is no question that the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution was placed there to prevent corruption in the system. It was based on a sad experience during the Articles of It is necessary to make sure that the President and all other officers of the United States have loyalty to only one thing, and that is to the United States of America, not to any foreign power.  In order to do that, we need to review the data. As I say, the dignity and integrity of the House requires that the Constitution be upheld, and in order to uphold the Constitution, we must have this information.  For these reasons, the resolution raises a question of the privileges of the House and should be permitted, Mr. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The resolution offered by the gentlewoman from California directs the House to request the President's tax return information as part of a determination as to whether the President is in violation of the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the  Section 702 of the House Rules and Manual states that ``rule IX is concerned not with the privileges of the Congress, as a legislative branch, but only with the privileges of the House, as a House.''

It is because unelected bureaucrats bypass this body of Congress and continually push out hundreds ofburdensome regulations onto American families who are struggling just to get by.

Butthis isn't always the case for the Securities and Exchange While the SEC is subject to some cost-benefitrequirements when a new regulation could have an overbearing impact on our marketplaces, they are exempt from having to identifyalternative policies.  I rise today in support of the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act because it will require the SEC to follow its own core principle of disclosure that it, in itself, enforces on the securities industry in this Nation.This bill would require the SEC to disclose all the costs and benefits of each proposed regulation to the public.  We must not allow regulatory agencies to be a roadblock to job creation by failing to consider the impact proposed ruleswould have on our securities market. Additionally, this bill requires the SEC to clearly identify the nature of the issue beforeestablishing a new regulation.  Mr.Chairman, our economy cannot flourish without healthy capital markets.

I frequently hear from parents, teachers, and school boards in my district that with more local flexibility, they can better meet the needs of local students. This is why the Every Student Succeeds Act replaced the one-size-fits-all approach to K-12 education, and gave power back to states and school districts. Unfortunately, the previous administration used executive authority to impose an inflexible accountability system and take away the local voices; voices that are critical in determining how schools should be held accountable. Local schools, teachers, and parents, not Washington bureaucrats, know best what success looks like.

455,topic-id,565,"Mr.Speaker, the month of March is when social workers throughout the country celebrate Social Work I am here today to honor a special group of social workers who work in one of the most important institutions in our society: our schools.  To honor the vital role school social workers serve in our communities, I am proud to introduce H.171, to recognize the many contributions of school social workers and to designate this week, March 5 through 11, as School Social Work  School social workers are critical members of a school's educational team. They strengthen partnerships between students' homes, schools, and communities as they work to ensure student academic success. School social workers are uniquely trained and specially equipped to mentor students who face emotional, academic, and behavioral barriers to learning.  Their expertise guides students through serious life challenges, including poverty, disability, sexual and physical abuse, addiction, bullying, and various forms of familial separation such as military deployment, divorce,[[Page H1958]]and incarceration. We now understand how these adverse childhood experiences and chronic exposures to the stressors affect the developing brain, particularly in a school setting where the academic demands are high and the social pressures can be life changing.  We must better support these students to overcome these barriers to success. We now have the science and research to inform our policies so that we are not just funneling these children out of a school system and into a prison system. We must prioritize the economic benefits of effective and preventive solutions and provide the necessary supports.  School social workers provide these services in our schools by connecting students and families to available resources in the community, particularly in areas that have been hit hardest by poverty. School social workers improve the success rate of children coming from a disadvantaged background, lending a much-needed hand in our efforts to create a more equal society. Families and communities want these services for their children. School districts should prioritize and invest in staffing models and programs that offer mental health services.  Research tells us that individuals who suffer from mental illness will have developed these symptoms by age 14. The Centers for Disease Control finds that behavioral disorders are increasing in youth and presenting themselves at younger ages. Fewer than one in five of these children will ever receive needed mental health services.  We also know that suicide is the second leading cause of death for young people ages 10 through 24. School mental health programs provided and enhanced by school social workers are critical to early identification of mental health problems.  Research indicates that school mental health programs improve educational outcomes by decreasing absences, decreasing disciplinary referrals, and improving academic achievement. Our students deserve the support. Our students need school social workers to help them succeed.  Unfortunately, there are often not enough school social workers available in school districts to meet the many, many needs of at-risk youth. The 1-to-250 maximum recommended ratio of school social workers to students is exceeded in almost all school districts in the United States, with some experiencing ratios as high as 1 to 21,000.  As we seek to improve our educational opportunities, maximizing the new opportunities and flexibility of the Every Student Achieves Act, let us use this week to recognize the contributions of school social workers and the vital role they play in helping our children reach their fullest potential.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgH1957-2.txt,1676,SEC REGULATORY ACCOUNTABILITY ACT,2017.0,9.0,January

494,topic-id,889,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to the resolution before us, which would overturn the accountability regulations in the Every Student Succeeds Act, our Nation's most important K-12 education law.  These accountability guidelines promulgated by the Department are not only allowed under the Every Student Succeeds Act, but they are essentially required. This legislative body last session put language into the Every Student Succeeds Act calling upon the Department and the Secretary to clarify this. It is a very different perspective on what that legislative intent was.  There are items in the Every Student Succeeds Act that we agreed--Democrats and Republicans--the Secretary and the Department would be prohibited from promulgating rules regarding. For instance, one of those is the promulgation of rules in support of the Common Core curriculum.                              {time}  1545  Democrats and Republicans agree that the Federal Government should[[Page H1048]]not be setting curriculum. That is a matter for the We prohibit it, specifically, in language in We prohibit the Federal Government from promulgating rules that require, in any way, shape, or form, the adoption of the common core standards at the State level.  What is not prohibited is rules regarding State accountability systems. Quite to the contrary, it is important work. In fact, it is the core work under the Every Student Succeeds Act, that very core commitment to civil rights that so many Democrats and Republicans feel passionate about that is contained through these rules.  When the Elementary and Secondary Education Act first passed in 1965, it was a critical piece of civil rights legislation, and it still is to this day. It was written with the intent that every student, no matter their race, background, ZIP Code, deserved a great education. And today, the Every Student Succeeds Act maintains that spirit.  If it had some of the prohibition that my colleague on the other side of the aisle believes it has, but won't be able to cite specific statute that it has, Democrats wouldn't have supported that bill, and it wouldn't have passed with nearly every Democrat--if not every Democratic vote--in the House and the  For months, States have been working diligently to write their own State plans to comply with the Every Student Succeeds My home State of Colorado has undertaken an extensive process. I got to attend one of the stakeholder meetings as part of that process, gathering feedback from educators, and parents, and students to write a State plan that works for Colorado and meets the requirements of the new law and the rules that this CRA would undo.  This resolution would undo all of that State-level work, all of the work that people in Colorado have done, that people in other States have done; create massive chaos and uncertainty in public education; and destroy the civil rights safeguards that Republicans and Democrats worked so diligently to put in place in the Every Student Succeeds  Not only would this CRA overturn the regulations, but it would prevent the Department of Education from looking at accountability again. It would tie the hands of the newly confirmed Secretary of Education, preventing her from improving or building upon the accountability measures that Congress, through the language of ESSA, asked the Department to take on.  This regulation was written after the Department of Education received thousands of comments from stakeholders, including parents, teachers, school boards, and advocates. Without a rule, the approval of the State accountability plans would be entirely at the discretion of the new Secretary, Secretary DeVos--the exact type of scenario the Republicans wanted to avoid by rewriting ESSA, essentially arguing--and many Democrats agreed with the argument--that effectively it was arbitrary use of power that then-Secretary Duncan wielded, and then-Secretary King, to grant the necessary waivers under the No Child Left Behind Act by removing these rules that had been promulgated.  Effectively, we would be back to where we started without criteria for approval or denial of State plans; without adequate safeguards for civil rights; and without the assurance that we can improve and build upon progress.  How can we trust any Secretary--Duncan, King, DeVos, future Secretaries--to know what a good accountability plan and bad accountability plan look like? Why should our legislative body delegate that level of authority without rules and regulations that we derive and allow them to make an arbitrary and capricious decisionmaking process that could involve approving bad accountability plans, or failing to approve strong accountability plans? That should be a huge concern for parents, teachers, students, and the public system.  You know what? Republicans were right, as were Democrats, when we argued that we needed criteria for the approval of accountability plans. And the answer is not to give blanket authority to any Secretary with regard to approval or denial of their plans, and that is what these rules do. And if they need to be improved and built upon, let's work with the new Secretary to do that.  But by not only undoing those rules, but by actually prohibiting the Secretary from promulgating additional rules, it will give the Department of Education effective arbitrary veto over every State in our country and an unprecedented level of federalized control of our schools, which might be the real Republican agenda with this bill here today.

514,topic-id,2587,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, we have heard a lot about the legal implications and the chaos that this resolution would create if it were passed. I want to share with you a brief story from a parent who has two sons with special needs and who depends on strong accountability for her son's success.  What parents across this country who have kids in public schools want to see is a system that works for them. They are not so caught up in which rule is being passed by who and who is doing what. They want to make sure the learning needs of their child are met.  Frankly, a strong accountability system and a reliable accountability system with parameters that are clear rather than a chaotic and unpredictable one goes a long way to reassuring parents across this country that the needs of their child are being met.  Here is a brief story from a parent with two sons with special needs:       My son Jacob is a freshman in high school. Today, he's a      straight A student well on his way to a great future. But it      wasn't always that way. He spent his early elementary school      years lacking the supports he needed to be successful in the      classroom.       At the beginning of fourth grade, he was in a self-     contained classroom, which supported his behavioral needs,      but not his academic needs. We were given the choice to ``opt      out'' of grade-level testing, but refused. It was the results      of those tests that gave us the data we needed to see where      he needed support and to see where he could excel      academically. We all saw he was working at or above grade-     level in many areas. It kept us accountable to planning his      successful future.       By the end of fourth grade, he was partially included in a      general education classroom. By middle school, he was fully      included in the general education classroom with minimal      supports in place. Without accountability standards in place      for students like Jacob, none of us--his parents, his      teachers, and even Jacob himself--would have been able to      track his upward trajectory.  I hear stories like this from so many of my constituents, Mr.Speaker: kids with learning disabilities, kids who attend schools that have pervasive achievement gaps between higher- and lower-income students and students of color and White students.  Frankly, the accountability system that we have had and the improvements that we built into it through the Every Student Succeeds Act and this rulemaking process are the prime civil rights safeguards that families across the country have so that they can, with confidence, know that the public schools are required to meet the learning needs of their child and that somebody is watching that, who will watch the watchers, and that their only recourse isn't just expensive litigation,[[Page H1052]]which the repeal of this rule would lead to more of, but, frankly, is where the money is coming from and making sure that there is a degree of controls in place that the learning of the child is being met.

Now, Congressional      Republicans are ripping apart regulation to guide      implementation of the most important equity provisions of our      nation's new K-12 law.       ``As leaders of the Congressional Asian Pacific American,      Black, and Hispanic Caucuses we fought to couple ESSA's      unprecedented state and local flexibility over school      accountability and improvement with strong federal      protections for our most vulnerable students. Without the      stability and clarity provided through regulation, plan      development stops, systems halt, and students and teachers      lose. While this regulation reflects the consensus of the      education and civil rights community, it is within the      purview of the new Republican administration to reexamine and      amend it as they see fit. However, rather than take this      responsible approach to implementing the new law, Republicans      have chosen to put politics before students.       ``H.57 would leave key provisions of the law      completely unregulated indefinitely, leaving state systems      that serve our nation's more than 50 million public school      students in limbo and important civil rights obligations      unfulfilled. Faithful implementation of ESSA must honor both      the bipartisan intent of Congress and the longstanding civil      rights legacy of the Elementary and Secondary Education      This reckless measure flies in the face of both. For these      reasons, we firmly oppose H.57.''                                  ____                                           Consortium for Citizens                                            With Disabilities,                                                 February 6, 2017.       Dear Representative: The co-chairs of the Consortium for      Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) Education Task Force, on      behalf of the CCD Education Taskforce, write in opposition of      H.Res 57 to rescind the accountability regulations under      the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA).       The CCD Education Task Force advocates for Federal public      policy that ensures the self-determination, independence,      empowerment, integration, and inclusion of children and      adults with disabilities in all aspects of society. The CCD      Task Force sees these principles as critical elements in a      society that recognizes and respects the dignity and worth of      all its members.       The CCD Ed Task Force believes that the ESSA accountability      regulations are critical for meaningful implementation of      The regulations clarify the statutory language in ESSA,      build upon ESSA's flexibility for school improvement and      provide a clarified role for families, educators and      stakeholders to share in the implementation process. Perhaps,      most importantly, the final regulations help assure that      States meaningfully develop accountability plans that will      create statewide systems to identify schools and districts      which need to target funds to intervene and support students      not meeting state-determined standards. We view this as      critical to helping shine a needed light on the education gap      for groups of students, including students with disabilities      so they can make important gains and achieve the same      education outcomes as their peers.       The passage of ESSA was a successful bi-partisan effort to      improve education for all students built upon the frame of      accountability. To rescind these regulations would not only      be a disservice to the spirit of ESSA and diminish the      efficacy of the law, but would also serve to undermine the      equity of educational opportunity for all students, including      students with disabilities.       Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to      contact any of the co-chairs listed below.

Keep ESSA Implementation Moving Forward--Oppose H.57.       Dear Representative: On behalf of The Leadership Conference      on Civil and Human Rights and the 29 undersigned      organizations, we urge you to oppose H.57 and to      support continued implementation of the bipartisan Every      Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). In order for the latest      reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act      of 1965 to fulfill its purpose as a civil rights law and for      implementation to comply with the requirements Congress set      forth, federal oversight is critical. The underlying      accountability and state plan regulation will help states,      districts, and schools to faithfully implement the law and      meet their legal obligations to historically marginalized      groups of students including students of color, students with      disabilities, and students who are English learners,      immigrants, girls, Native American, LGBTQ or low-income.      Congress should reject the effort to overturn these      regulations under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) and      should preserve critical protections for marginalized      students.       Over the course of legislative debate in 2015, Congress      reached several compromises which enshrined both meaningful      guardrails and state flexibility into the new law. It was      these compromises--the allowance of flexibility while still      maintaining core principles of fiscal responsibility and      protections for marginalized students--which led to the      passage of the At the core is an offer to states--     federal funding in exchange for compliance with requirements      regarding accountability, protections for students, and      fiscal responsibility. States must not be permitted to take      federal funds while flouting the law's mandates. The      accountability and state plan regulation provides      clarification and timelines which will support the vital role      of the U.Department of Education in ensuring that states      hold up their end of that deal.       The process of soliciting public feedback on potential ESSA      regulations began long before a draft rule was even      published. On December 22, 2015 the Department of Education      issued a request for information and[[Page H1053]]     noticed two public meetings, ``soliciting advice and      recommendations from interested parties prior to publishing      proposed regulations.'' Then, when draft rules were issued      more than five months later, the agency received over 21,000      public comments in response to the notice of proposed      rulemaking. After considering the voluminous feedback, the      Department of Education issued a final rule on November 29,      2016. This robust and transparent engagement process was      appropriate and needed--questions regarding the responsible      use of federal funds and the need to ensure that every      student succeeds generate considerable interest. Support for      the CRA and discarding this important regulation diminishes      the important time and thought dedicated to this process, and      the voices of parents, students, advocates, educators and      others who have sought to be heard.       ESSA can and should, ``provide all children significant      opportunity to receive a fair, equitable, and high-quality      education, and to close educational achievement gaps.'' These      lofty objectives, however, require vigilance and oversight by      the Department of Education and support from Members of      We urge you to oppose this resolution and to allow      for the continued implementation of the law.

Paul Ryan,     Speaker, House of Representatives,     Washington,     Nancy Pelosi,     Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: Over the past two      years, our organizations have worked together--across lines      that often divide us on matters of public policy--to secure      provisions in the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) that we      all think are vitally important to our nation's future, and      ensure those provisions are implemented well in the states.      Our common goals include:       State-adopted standards aligned with the demands of      postsecondary education and the workforce;       Annual statewide assessment of all students in grades 3-8      and once again in high school, with a strictly limited      exception for students with the most significant cognitive      disabilities;       Transparent, accessible reporting of data--disaggregated by      race, income, disability status, and English proficiency--at      the state, district, and school levels, so educators,      parents, and students themselves have objective information      on where they are on their journey to college and career      readiness; and       Statewide accountability systems that include achievement      and graduation-rate goals for all groups of students, rate      schools in large part on the academic performance of all      groups of students, and require action when any group of      students consistently underperforms.       The overwhelmingly bipartisan legislation reflects these      principles. It grants states broad discretion to design their      systems while holding them responsible for working within-     federal guardrails to design systems that ensure genuine      equity and excellence for all students.       Since ESSA's passage, we have collectively been working in      states across the country to equip diverse partners to push      for and support the development of state systems focused on      equity and improvement.       One important piece of this process is the adoption of      regulations, which provide clarity and certainty on both the      key principles of the statute and the processes for      implementation.       The U.Department of Education finalized those      regulations in But just as states and state      advocates are putting pen to paper on their state plans, you      are considering a resolution disapproving of the regulations.      This action will cause unnecessary confusion, disrupting the      work in states and wasting time that we cannot afford to      waste.       Just as we believe the Every Student Succeeds Act      incorporates our principles, we believe the regulations do as      well. And they provide states with the clarity they need to      move forward. We do not support H.Res 57 and we ask you to      vote no.

I also want to point out that I was opposed to the earlier resolution on the floor today, which would unravel the Department of Education's regulation on teacher preparation.  The intent of the teacher preparation program, as was argued here, was to provide more transparency and accountability around the quality of teacher preparation programs.  This Republican quest to abolish accountability for our public schools is exactly the opposite of what I hear from parents and families in my district who want to make sure that we have more transparency and more accountability, not less.  While I think we all can agree that a great education starts with a great teacher, we ought to be able to make sure that teacher preparation programs are charged with adequately preparing teachers and that we have some objective criteria for checking whether teacher preparation programs are doing a good job or doing a poor job.  The regulation also requires that TEACH Grant recipients attend high-performing teacher preparation programs. It is not a matter of picking winners or losers. It is simply a solution towards making sure our limited taxpayer dollars for professional development and teacher training are used effectively. If money is going to be invested in teachers at high-needs schools, we want to make sure that teachers are attending high-quality programs.  Now we have had a robust debate about the implications of accountability and the real impact it has for States, districts, and students; but I want people to focus on the story of parents and families in their district who benefited from the accountability system that previously existed and is improved upon through the Every Student Succeeds  It walks away from accountability--that is what this CRA does. If this CRA passes, it doesn't just get rid of a particular set of rules around accountability. Everybody might have things they want to change. There is a process for changing those and a new Secretary in place who can certainly begin that process. No, it wouldn't do that.  It would abolish the entire rules and effectively prevent the Secretary from promulgating new rules around accountability, leaving it completely unknown to the States and the school districts what criteria the Federal Government was looking for in improving State-based accountability programs.  Parents like Jacob's wouldn't know if the Federal Government would be there to make sure that school districts had a plan to meet the learning needs of every child.  The reason it is opposed so vociferously by civil rights organizations is none of us would know whether the State accountability plan had a plan to close the achievement gap to make sure that schools can cater to the needs of all kids, regardless of their race or income.  That is what is lacking by passage of this It would effectively handcuff the Secretary of Education, prevent her from implementing the overwhelming will of this body, Democratic and Republican, to maintain the civil[[Page H1054]]rights and accountability safeguards of No Child Left Behind; by moving away from the one-size-fits-all accountability formula towards increased State flexibility, so long as the basic goal of meeting the learning needs of all students were met by State level plans.  That is at the heart of why we need accountability in the Every Student Succeeds This is why we need guidance from the Department of Education through rules and regulations.  The resolution before us today would completely undermine the civil rights provisions of the Every Student Succeeds Act and would prevent the Department of Education from even considering new rules and regulations to protect the civil rights of Americans across our country.  Those with learning disabilities and those without, parents across the country have banded together to oppose this Congressional Review  I urge my colleagues to reject this attempt to undermine our public schools and undermine accountability.

446,topic-id,796,"Mr.Speaker, 7 years ago this week, in this Chamber, the House gave final passage to the Affordable Care Act, better known as  I wasn't in Congress then. Many of us weren't. But for my fellow conservatives here today, that vote 7 years ago marked a decision point, or a moment of affirmation, to answer the call to public service and to help chart a better way for this country.  And for 7 years, we have made the case against As the law has been implemented, that case has been largely made for us. Millions have been forced away from the healthcare plan and doctor they liked, despite being told otherwise.  This year alone, in Alabama, health insurance premiums are rising by 58 percent. That is on top of the already steep increases the past 2 years. Our average deductible for the supposedly affordable bronze plan is now $6,000.  I have heard from countless constituents about the negative impact of I have listened to their stories about how higher costs and fewer choices have made it that much harder to keep their families healthy and make ends meet.  And in response, I made a promise--the same promise President Trump and every conservative in Congress has made over and over: Give us the majority in the House and the Senate, give us a Republican in the White House, and we will repeal ObamaCare and replace it with reforms that work.  So, Mr.Speaker, I am pleased that we are finally in a position to deliver on that promise. The voters gave us what we asked of them, and it is only right that we keep our end of the bargain.  With the American Health Care Act, we begin the process of repealing ObamaCare once and for all. This bill dismantles the taxes, mandates, and entitlement spending that make up the core of It cuts taxes on prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, insurance premiums, and medical devices. It eliminates the individual and employer mandate penalties that have forced millions into expensive, inadequate plans. It replaces the ObamaCare entitlement with refundable tax credits so that people who don't receive insurance through work can put their own tax dollars toward a health plan of their choice.  Mr.Speaker, many people have asked why our plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare is a process. Why is this bill only one step and not the full package? It is an understandable question. For the last several years, Americans have been sold the false hope that government has a magic wand with which they can solve all of their problems. The truth is, of course, that it can't. It never can. And the only proof you need is ObamaCare itself.  That is why congressional Republicans and the Trump administration are taking a completely different approach than President Obama and the Democrats used 7 years ago. Instead of claiming we need to pass the bill so you can find out what is in it, we have worked in a transparent way. The bill text has been posted online for 3 weeks. It has gone through three separate committee markups, and will come to the House floor in regular order.  Instead of one giant bill like ObamaCare, we are using a more responsible, three-step process. First, we will repeal ObamaCare with all its taxes, mandates, and spending through budget reconciliation. Next, the Trump administration will use executive authority to weed out the more intricate ObamaCare policies one by one to stabilize the market and lower costs. And finally, Congress will move forward with legislation addressing more specific policies, such as allowing individuals to purchase insurance across State lines.  I believe this will ultimately lead to better, more stable healthcare policy that empowers patients, increases choices, and lowers costs.  Mr.Speaker, no bill is perfect. I am sure if every Member of this body came up with their ideal health reform bill, they would each be pretty different. It is supposed to be that way, because we all represent different districts in different parts of the country with different needs.  There may well be some changes made here in the House or in the Senate that can make the bill better. That is part of the process, so I certainly remain open to those.  But, Mr.Speaker, I am confident this bill puts us on a path toward lower cost and better care, and away from government-controlled health insurance. It represents our opportunity to undo the damage of ObamaCare and help American families like we said we would.  For 7 years, we have been promising, and this is our chance to deliver.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the American Health Care Act and send it to the Senate, and get us one step closer to delivering on our promise.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-22-pt1-PgH2294.txt,1986,RAISING A QUESTION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE,2017.0,22.0,March

493,topic-id,1291,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise today in strong support of H.57.  Mr.Speaker, I was here also on this floor listening to the debate that just finished on H.58, and I have a feeling a lot of the same things are going to carry over because we are dealing with the same In fact, we are dealing with the prior administration generally.  I was struck by the words that we need to ``give direction to the States.'' I think, by definition, those words demonstrate how one side here thinks that they know best; that their judgment is somehow better than the judgment of governors, of State legislators,[[Page H1047]]of parents, teachers, and superintendents themselves when it comes to this issue and, in fact, in a larger perspective, when it comes to most issues around here. We must give direction to the States--no.  The fact of the matter is, when the President signed into law, when we passed ESSA--the Every Student Succeeds Act--in a lot of ways we were saying to the States: You give the direction. You set the way that you think is best to educate your best assets. Your best assets, of course, being our next generation.  While we at the Federal level would like to be partners, the fact of the matter is it is their property. The tax dollars we are talking about are the property of the individuals living in the 50 States and other jurisdictions.  So now here we are using the Congressional Review Act to get rid of some regulations that are doing that very thing. We wrote a very specific law saying the States are in charge. Here we have a Federal agency inserting itself, not just interpreting law, but actually making law and taking us in the exact opposite direction that all of us intended.  When I say all of us, I say that in a very bipartisan way, Mr.Speaker, because--I am now in my fifth year of being chairman of the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education here in the My first 4 years were consumed working with past Chairman John Kline, current Chairwoman Virginia Foxx, other members of the committee, and all our Democratic counterparts in getting this very bipartisan law passed and signed into law.  Let me go back, Mr.Speaker, and set the table here. You will have to remember that under the No Child Left Behind law, which was the law of the land for some 13 years--perhaps a well-intentioned law, but completely unreasonable in terms of its forced, ridged, one-size-fits-all accountability system that heavily dictated how we would gauge and address school performance--that system represented a top-down approach in K-12 education. After 13 years, the data is in and the results are in. It simply didn't work.  So that is why just a little more than a year ago, Congress passed--again, former President Obama signed into law in a very bipartisan way--the Every Student Succeeds With this law, Republicans and Democrats worked together to reform our education system to ensure that all children are able to receive the education they deserve. It represents a fundamentally different approach to education and, in the words of one superintendent, empowers local leaders to ``dream and lead and transform public education in this country.''  Unfortunately, almost immediately after the bill became law, the Obama administration began its attempt to roll back these bipartisan reforms. With the Every Student Succeeds Act, Congress promised to reduce the Federal role and restore State and local control over K-12 education. The law empowers States to develop their own policies to hold schools accountable to parents and taxpayers.  For accountability to work, Mr.Speaker, it must be driven by the State and local leaders who are best equipped to directly address the issues in their school. Those leaders know better than any Federal bureaucrat in the Department of Education what their kids need, even down to what their kids' names are. I challenge any Federal bureaucrat to know better.  Unfortunately, the Obama administration's flawed accountability regulation would reestablish the Washington-knows-best approach to accountability. It is the very same thing I mentioned earlier that we just heard regarding H.58. It is an approach that is deeply flawed.  How do I know? What is the best metric to prove the point that that Washington-knows-best approach is deeply flawed?  Look at it. Look at the test scores since the Federal Government has been involved in education. You see that they haven't gone up. Yet we have spent billions and billions of dollars since the 1970s here at the Federal level on local education to see no improvement in the test scores.  Not only does the regulation dictate prescriptive accountability requirements, but it violates many of the prohibitions that we put in on the Secretary of As we all saw, the top-down approach simply didn't work. So that is why we repealed No Child Left Behind and passed a bill to transform K-12 education.  Our students deserve better than the failed policies of the past, and that is what the Every Student Succeeds Act does, if implemented as Congress intended.  Now, our intent was not ambiguous, and the law is far from silent. We were very specific in the law we wrote. Our specificity dictated that the States and localities were back in charge. They were driving the bus again. No pun intended.  The Department has taken some kind of ambiguity, I guess, some kind of silence, and has inserted themselves into the lawmaking role. That wasn't our intent.  Our intent was for a new role for the Department, a much smaller role for the Department, a less supervisory role for the Department, and a less punitive role for the Department, one that would simply ensure that our specifically written law, as passed off this floor, passed off the Senate floor, and eventually signed into law, was followed as we wrote it. So an example of that was we require the States to have plans for how they were going to test, that they would test, but nothing more prescriptive than that. That is just one example, the testing. There were some other parameters.  Then they were to submit those plans to the Federal Government, and the Department of Education was simply to check the box and make sure that the plans were done and otherwise comply with the law. The Department wasn't to be more prescriptive than that. It wasn't to give any more regulation than that. It wasn't to, frankly, give too much more direction than that because we recognize that this responsibility is primarily that of governors, State legislators, school superintendents, parents, and teachers.  Now, States are already working to implement the law in their school districts. I want to be very clear that this resolution in no way does anything to stymie those efforts. States should move straight ahead.  Instead, the resolution gives States the certainty they need to continue moving forward, confident that their plans will be reviewed by the Department of Education against the requirements of the statute and nothing more, with deference given to the judgment of these local legislators, local superintendents, et cetera, as the law requires.  We are also committed to working with the new administration to ensure States receive the support they need consistent with the limits placed in the statute.  So, my colleagues, by passing this resolution and blocking implementation of the Obama administration's flawed accountability rule, we can ensure that the promises we made under the Every Student Succeeds Act to restore State and local control in K-12 education are kept.

516,topic-id,1100,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  The gentleman talks about accountability. I want to reassure all the Members here that will be voting on this joint resolution that we are not throwing accountability out the window.  What we decided last year when we passed the Every Student Succeeds Act is that accountability was a good thing. But the best leaders and the best persons to determine what that accountability should be and what that accountability should look like are found in our States and are found in our local jurisdictions. They know our best assets the best--our best assets being our children. They know what they need.  So we are not throwing accountability out the window. We are saying accountability is to be measured at the State level by the States, by the local jurisdictions, and they are to simply report to the Department of Education what their accountability plan is in a transparent way so that, again, parents, teachers, and taxpayers can decide if that State is doing a good job, so that people like the NAACP--if they are and should be, as we all should be, worried about achievement gaps--could affect how to close those achievement gaps in those respective States and, by the way, perhaps come up with a more effective way, a better plan, a more aggressive plan to close that achievement gap rather than the one-size-fits-all bureaucracy that is the Federal Department of That is the whole point.  Secondly, regarding civil rights. Nothing in this resolution that takes back this draconian rulemaking from the Department of Education affects civil rights. We are very clear in the Every Student Succeeds Act that the civil rights protections remain. We agreed with that in a bipartisan way, and all of that remains. Don't let the gentleman from Colorado scare you into thinking anything different.  There was a lot of talk about uncertainty from previous speakers--uncertainty for States--and that blocking implementation of these regulations will create that uncertainty. Let me address that for just a couple of minutes.  We, Congress, cannot allow Federal agencies to ignore the clear prohibitions against executive overreach. These regulations clearly attempt to reassert Federal control that was returned to the States by Congress under                              {time}  1630  Repealing these regulations is the only way to give States and school districts the certainty that they need with sufficient time to move the implementation process forward. The law itself provides enough guidance. We were very specific how we wrote this law. We were very specific in the requirements needed. That removes the need to have the kind of rulemaking that the Department of Education, either through habit or through direct intent, is trying to do here. We don't need to do it here.  The law itself lays out clear criteria for the State plans. It states explicitly that the onus is on the Department of Education to demonstrate how a plan does not comply with the law that we wrote and that the President signed into law. It does not require, and the States are not required, to go jump through the hoops that the Department is trying to have them jump through now through this rulemaking.  The law also requires the Department to review the State plans with deference to State and local judgments. The Department is trying to take that judgment away from the States and put it under its own umbrella.  Under the law, as long as States can demonstrate that their plans comply with the statute, they will be approved. We wrote that into the law. Because of this, States can have the certainty that the work they began can continue. The Department, with this rule, is trying to unravel all that. The resolution stops the Department from doing that.  I know Congressman Costello mentioned teacher performance. Others have talked about student assessment participation rates. Let me give you a few examples for the record, Mr.ESSA allowed States to determine how to hold schools accountable for assessing students. The final rule limits States to only four options for assessing students and requires schools to implement a plan to address low test participation--not required in the law, not part of what we are doing here. The Department, by doing that, is making up law.  Regarding teacher performance and some things that Mr.Costello referenced, ESSA explicitly prohibited the Secretary from mandating the creation of teacher evaluation systems. As the Federal Government, we are getting out of the business of teacher evaluation systems. It didn't mean the States couldn't do it. It didn't mean that most States wouldn't do it. However, the final rule requires States to establish a statewide definition for what an ineffective teacher means that differentiates between categories of teachers.  Now, if you look at this in effect, in practical terms, it would be almost impossible for States to fulfill this requirement without implementing a teacher and school leader evaluation, something the law specifically didn't require, specifically prohibited. Yet, here we are with the Department's rule basically making States do it. Not what was intended. Not what we wrote. Not what we voted on on the floor of this House, and not what was signed into law by the President of the United States at the time.  So these are the kinds of things that we are fighting against here, Mr.These are the kinds of things that H.57, and H.58 for that matter, would stop the Department from doing. H.57 protects the positive reforms Congress made with Every Student Succeeds Act and ensures that those reforms are implemented as Congress intended. In doing so, the resolution preserves State and local control over K-12 education and provides States and school districts the certainty they need to proceed with the plans that they are already in the process of writing.  That is why a number of groups--including the National Governors Association; AASA, the School Superintendents Association; and the Council of the Great City Schools--have spoken out in support of the resolution. It is also why the National School Boards Association supports this resolution, and it is why H.57 is supported by Citizens Against Government  I am confident that Congress will continue working in a bipartisan manner to empower our State and local communities to take the lead in accountability. There will be accountability. By putting a stop to the Obama administration's flawed and overreaching accountability regulation, however, we can keep the promise we made to reduce the Federal role, restore local control, and ensure all children receive the high-quality education that they deserve.

It undermines the success of the Paris Agreement and damages our relations with the signatories, including China and At the same time, the order makes it harder for our government and military to plan for the already occurring consequences of climate change--including assessing its impact on national security policy.

528,topic-id,684,"Mr.President, yesterday, President Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, was introduced in the Judiciary Committee for opening statements. We all look forward to today's round of questioning, during which I hope the nominee will be more forthcoming than he was with me. I am very sympathetic to the fact that judges should not offer opinions on cases that could come before the Court lest they bias themselves. Every Senator is aware of that. We know to ask general questions or questions about cases previously decided to get a sense of a judge's philosophy.  In our meeting, Judge Gorsuch refused to even answer those questions. For instance, I asked him a very simple question. I said forget about the case that was then pending in the Ninth Circuit on the Executive order. I said: Let's say Congress passed a law: No Muslim could enter the United Would that be unconstitutional?  He even refused to answer that question. So I hope he will be more willing to answer questions in the Judiciary Committee today, particularly about his views of important Supreme Court cases of the past and his own ideology. This idea that judges judge regardless of ideology is totally belied by the fact that there is a coalition right now--four judges on one side, four judges on the other. Four appointed by Democratic Presidents who generally rule one way, four appointed by Republican Presidents who generally rule the other.  If it was just interpreting the law without any input from a person's life and thoughts and ideology, we would not have that stark breakdown, but we do. In my view, the hard right, in trying to populate the bench with people way over, has adopted this philosophy, starting with Miguel Estrada: Don't answer the questions because if the American people knew how you really felt, they would not want you on the bench.  Let's take the case of President Of course President Trump considered ideology when he selected Judge Gorsuch off a list culled by the far-right Heritage Foundation and Federalist He did not pick the judges himself. He went to these extreme groups and said: You make a list. I promise I will pick people from that list.  Do you think organizations--these organizations--dedicated to a certain ideological viewpoint, did not consider ideology when building their list of possible Supreme Court picks? Of course they did.  President Trump said himself, he wanted to appoint a Justice who would overturn Roe v. The idea that he selected a judicious, neutral judge is belied by the selection process, totally and amazingly. That is how the President considered these judges. So it is not unreasonable for Senators to consider and question the ideology of a nominee in committee. President Trump sure did when he came up with a list. The only way for the Judiciary Committee to do that is if the nominee is willing to answer specific questions. If he is not willing to answer specific questions, what is the purpose of even holding a 4-day hearing?

I am deeply troubled that the Republican majority and seemingly the President-elect are plotting, as one of their firstcampaigns in the new Congress, a full-scale assault on the American health care system, not just the Affordable Care Act butMedicare and Medicaid as well because they are inextricably bound. Those are the pillars that support the American health caresystem, but as its first order of legislative business, the Republican majority has decided to put forward a budget resolutionto repeal health care reform. Although he promised not to cut Medicare in the campaign, the President-elect has nominated a manwho spent his career strategizing health care's demise, and he chose him to be Secretary of I don't think that is somethinga vast majority of Americans or even Republicans believe in.  It is too clear that President-Elect Trump and the Republican Congress are intent on making America sick again. Republicansseem determined to create chaos, not affordable care, for the American people.  Today, I would like to focus on the budget resolution on the Affordable Care I understand why the majority thinks theyhave to do it. Over the past 8 years, they promised every group--conservative group and audience in the country, they wouldrepeal the law, ``root and branch.''  For a long time, it has been only a conservative fever dream. Republicans knew they could make extreme promises aboutreplacing it with something better without ever having to consider the consequences or even come up with a reasonable plan toreplace it because they knew the Democrats or President Obama would ultimately block their attempts to roll back the law.  Now things are different. The consequences of repealing the Affordable Care Act are real. I sincerely urge my colleagues todeeply consider the consequences. It is no longer just a game or a political line to say ``repeal'' because now you have toreplace. So far, it has been 5 years of repeal, repeal, repeal; not one replace plan has garnered[[Page S31]]a lot of support even onthe Republican side of the aisle, let alone in  What will it mean for average Americans if you repeal the law without any viable replacement? Not just the 30 million whomight lose coverage right away--that is a staggering number, many of them in very red and poor States and rural areas. What willhappen to the overall marketplace if you rip away all the safeguards of the ACA and have put nothing in its place?  It doesn't matter if you repeal and delay, as some of my friends on the other side of the aisle call it, for 1 year or 2years--however long. Folks will lose a lot of benefits, and the insurance marketplace could fall apart long before repeal goesinto place. As insurers raise their prices because they have to with repeal, costs to the average American who has employerinsurance will go up as well. My colleagues will own that, just as we owned everything that happened previous to this election.  Let me tell you, if Republicans pull the plug on health reform, on Medicaid, and privatize Medicare, it could mean absolutechaos, not affordable care. It would likely increase prescription drug costs, premiums, and out-of-pocket costs to Americanfamilies--not, as I said, just for the families that got coverage on the exchanges but for all American families, even if you getinsurance through your employer. I repeat that to Everyone who has employer-based insurance and is not part of the ACAshould worry about this repeal with no replace because their costs will go up, sure as we are here together. It would putinsurance companies back in charge. It would allow them to discriminate against individuals with preexisting conditions.  We all know of people. Parents--their kid has cancer. They would look for an insurance company. Oh, no, your son has cancer,your daughter has cancer, you can't get it. What are our colleagues going to do about that one? No answers yet. I doubt theyhave good ones. It would cause premiums to skyrocket. It would unravel the insurance market.  I would ask my colleagues before they jump into this repeal to talk to their local rural hospitals. In my State, ruralhospitals are a mainstay of our rural economy. They are the largest employer in many of our towns and villages. Remember, NewYork has New York City, but we are the third largest rural State in the Nation, only behind Pennsylvania and North Inthose areas, merely repealing the ACA and not doing anything else is going to hurt those hospitals dramatically. In fact, today,in 11 State capitals, rural hospitals--many of them in red States--protested a repeal of the  It could also exacerbate--I don't want to forget--the opioid epidemic by ripping away coverage from 1.6 million newly insuredindividuals struggling with substance abuse disorders. We worked so hard in the Cures Act to cover people. Far more would beundone by this act of repeal in terms of fighting opioid abuse.  For all my deficit-hawk friends, your proposal causes a trillion-dollar hole in the budget--at least a trillion. My colleaguefrom Washington thinks it might be even higher, and I rarely doubt her. What are you going to do, deficit hawks, once you repealand that hole in the budget becomes enormous?  This is not conjecture. My Republican colleagues would be wise to remember how the American health care system operatedbefore health care reform. Health care costs were growing at a much faster rate than they are today, eating into workers'paychecks and dissuading them from taking risks and changing jobs lest they lose a good coverage plan. A debilitating illnesscould wipe out a lifetime of hard-earned savings because there was no cap on health care costs. Women were charged more than menfor the same health coverage. It was outrageous. We will go back to those days with repeal.  Many couldn't get insurance if they had a preexisting condition. Some insurance companies would simply delete you from theirrolls if you got sick. You want to go back to those ``good old days''?  Today, because of health care reform, those things are no longer true. Health care costs are rising much more slowly thanbefore, and the uninsured rate is the lowest it has ever been. I don't think any American would want to go back to the healthcare world of yesteryear where insurance companies wrote the rules and costs spiraled up unchecked, but Republicans seem all tooeager to dial back the clock and make America sick again.  Democrats are united in our opposition to cutting Medicare, to cutting Medicaid, and to repealing health care reform, and wewill hold the Republican majority and the President-elect accountable for the consequences of repealing health care reform.

583,topic-id,280,"Mr.Chairman, the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act subjects the SEC to enhanced cost-benefit analysisrequirements and requires a review of existing regulations.  By promoting economic analysis requirements during the regulatory process, this bill ensures that regulation writing is datadriven and not done on an ad hoc basis with little thought to the true impact the expanding regulatory net has on businesses andthe economy.  It is a mistake for regulators overseeing our financial system and the capital markets, including the SEC, to promulgateregulations without fully considering the costs and benefits, as well as all of the available regulatory alternatives.  This bill also takes the commonsense approach of requiring the SEC to evaluate whether a proposed regulation is inconsistentwith, or duplicative of, other Federal regulations. When our businesses are being overwhelmed by compliance obligations thatdemand more and more time and resources, it is crucial that our regulators do everything in their power to ensure thatregulations are effective, streamlined, and nonduplicative to minimize impact.  It is important to note that this legislation does not limit the SEC's rulemaking authority in any capacity. The billappropriately strengthens the SEC's existing cost-benefit-related requirements to ensure that the true impact of regulations canbe calculated.  To advocate for the status quo and against this legislation shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the financial system andthe regulatory process. This legislation is a vote of confidence that, with the appropriate tools and a data-driven approach,our regulatory agencies can create a framework of safety and soundness that does not unduly burden our economy.

593,topic-id,341,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, my amendment is simple and straightforward. It will help ensure the SEC fulfills one of its core missionfunctions--protecting investors.  As Members of Congress, we must never forget the lessons of the financial crisis and the Great Americans lost $14trillion, suffering sharp declines in retirement savings, pension funds, and overall wealth. This was due, in part, to beingpushed into abstract and sophisticated financial products and securities that they knew little or nothing about.  I was here in 2008, Mr.I listened to the people. I heard their stories. Unfortunately, for many of them, thefinancial crisis and the Great Recession caused deep and lasting harm. Many may never recover.  I proudly supported the Dodd-Frank Act and believe the SEC has implemented many regulations that will guard against anotherfinancial crisis and help preserve the financial future of American families for generations to come. For these reasons, I amconcerned the regulatory reviews required by the underlying bill do not properly account for investor protection.  To that end, my amendment ensures the SEC does more than just consider how a proposed regulation will impact businesses. Itexpressly instructs the SEC to weigh the safeguards of investors when changing a rule or regulation. My amendment instructs theSEC to continue focusing on investor protection not only when drafting new rules but also when reviewing existing regulations.Let me be clear: it is vitally important that this language be included to ensure investors' needs do not take a backseat toindustry concerns.  We must never go back to the days leading up to the crisis, Mr.By simply instructing the SEC to take into accountinvestor protections when reviewing and considering new or existing regulations, my amendment helps ensure the safeguards we putin place under the Dodd-Frank Act are preserved. This will mean retirement savings and household wealth are more secure, and weare not once again risking deep and lasting harm to our economy and financial markets. For these reasons, I urge the adoption ofmy amendment.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

564,topic-id,472,"Mr.Chair, I thank Chairman Hensarling, the gentleman from Texas, for his leadership on this issue and onso many regulatory reform issues that we will be addressing this week and in the future.  Mr.Chair, I am proud to sponsor and bring to the floor H.78, the SEC Regulatory Accountability This legislationfits perfectly with the theme of the week here in the House to advance key regulatory reform ideas as a change of pace from theoutgoing administration.  For the past 8 years, the amount of regulatory burden that has been placed on Americans and small businesses has beencrushing. In 2015, Federal regulation cost almost $1.9 trillion. That is nearly $15,000 per household in a hidden compliancetax.  The Obama administration issued over 600 economically significant rules, which are those that have an economic impact ofover $100 million. As a result of this wave of regulations, we have been part of the slowest economic recovery in our lifetimes.  We now have an opportunity to enact policy that ensures smart regulation going forward so that we are doing things in thebest and most efficient way. The people have spoken, Mr.Business as usual in Washington is over and it is time to dothings differently. There is, indeed, a better way.  This legislation is really about what everyday Americans do when they are making major life decisions in weighing the costsand the benefits, the pros and the cons. Whether it is buying a car, buying a home, deciding whether to take out a loan to go toschool, everyone must consider the core economic factors when making important life decisions.  The SEC Regulatory Accountability Act places statutory requirements on the SEC when issuing rulemaking that ensures that,first, they identify the problem that regulation is trying to address; second, they weigh the cost and benefits to ensure thatthe benefits justify costs of compliance; and thirdly, they identify and assess whether there are any available alternatives torulemaking.  Additionally, this bill contains a provision that requires the SEC to review its existing regulations every 5 years, at theminimum, to determine whether any such regulations are outdated, ineffective, or excessively burdensome, as well as requiringthe SEC to modify, streamline, repeal, or even to expand regulations based on that review.  As a regulator of our capital markets, the SEC has an immeasurable influence on our economy and the ability of smallbusiness and entrepreneurs to be able to access capital in order to innovate, grow, and most of all, create jobs.  I strongly believe that this legislation is nonpartisan and common sense and what our government regulators should have beendoing in the first place. The American people deserve a break from the irresponsible regulation they have grown accustom to overthe past 8 years. There is a better way.  I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense piece of legislation and urge passage of it through the  ",CREC-2017-01-12-pt1-PgH428.txt,2137,SEC REGULATORY ACCOUNTABILITY ACT,2017.0,12.0,February
