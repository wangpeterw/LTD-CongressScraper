  Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand 
before the House today to recognize Vice Admiral Diego ``Duke'' 
Hernandez, a decorated war hero and patriot who passed away on Friday, 
July 7, at 83 years old.
  Admiral Hernandez was born and raised in Puerto Rico, the son of two 
schoolteachers who became a three-star admiral and the highest ranking 
Hispanic officer in the United States Navy at the time. Throughout his 
distinguished 35-year career, he served as a commander to various naval 
forces earning the Silver Star, the Distinguished Flying Cross, and the 
Purple Heart. He exemplified the valor and commitment that his brothers 
in arms from Puerto Rico have demonstrated since the Great War.
  On July 14, 1998, Admiral Hernandez testified before the Senate and 
highlighted Puerto Rican participation in our Nation's wars and the 
reality of their marginalization from the democracy they fought to 
defend and uphold. He urged Congress to respond to the people of Puerto 
Rico so they can achieve political self-determination.
  In his honor, I echo the same. Today, I ask the House to join me in 
expressing our profound gratitude to Admiral Hernandez and his 
contributions to the United States of America.
