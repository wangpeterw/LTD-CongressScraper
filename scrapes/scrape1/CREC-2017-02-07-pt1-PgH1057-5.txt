minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, 2 years ago, right here, I congratulated 
our New England Patriots on winning their fourth Super Bowl 
championship. Today I am proud to share the excitement of my fellow 
Mainers to congratulate our Patriots on capturing their fifth world 
championship.
  Mr. Speaker, on Sunday night, more than 100 million football fans 
from around the world witnessed the greatest comeback in Super Bowl 
history. Against an outstanding Atlanta Falcons team, our mighty 
Patriots battled back from 25 points down with only 17 minutes left to 
play.
  Now, our Patriots, Mr. Speaker, showed the world what can be achieved 
if you work together and you never give up. We in Congress, all of us, 
can learn from that example.
  Coach Belichick, you have earned your place in history as the 
greatest coach in NFL history. And co-captain Brady, you, sir, have 
earned your place as the greatest quarterback of all time.
  Mr. Speaker, Maine is so proud of all of our New England Patriots, 
and I humbly congratulate them. I will see everybody on this team at 
the White House this spring.
