                         FIGHTING FOR MEDICARE

  (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, what is the message?
  I rise today because I am fighting for Medicare, and I oppose any 
attempts to balance the budget on the backs of seniors byprivatizing 
Medicare.
  For over 50 years, Medicare has guaranteed health care to all 
Americans 65 years or older and continues to do so for morethan 50 
million Americans today. Seniors, like my constituent Linda and her 
mother, who rely on Medicare for their healthcareneeds, do not want 
Republicans to dismantle it.
  What is the message, Mr. Speaker?
  In my home State of Ohio, about 2 million seniors and disabled 
individuals, including 1 million women, 260,000 AfricanAmericans, are 
at risk of losing their Medicare benefits if Republicans privatize it.
  Mr. Speaker, I am here to fight for Linda, her mother, for Janet and 
Mary and Robert and many other seniors who count onMedicare for their 
doctor's visits, their prescription assistance, and many other medical 
needs.
  Mr. Speaker, what is the message?

[[Page H404]]

  We cannot let our seniors down. Democrats will fight to preserve 
Medicare to protect our seniors for generations to come.
