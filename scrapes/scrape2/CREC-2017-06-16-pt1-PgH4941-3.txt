                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Gracious and merciful God, we give You thanks for giving us another 
day.
  In this Chamber where the people's House gathers, we pause to offer 
You gratitude for the gift of this good land on which we live, and for 
this great Nation which You have inspired in developing over so many 
years. Continue to inspire the American people, that through the 
difficulties of these days we might keep liberty and justice alive in 
our Nation and in our world.
  We thank You for a great evening of recreation and celebration of 
what we have in common as Americans last night at the annual 
Congressional Baseball Game. Bless all those who contributed to making 
the event such a success, and continue to send Your healing spirit upon 
our brother Steve Scalise, and all who were injured at last Wednesday's 
practice.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
