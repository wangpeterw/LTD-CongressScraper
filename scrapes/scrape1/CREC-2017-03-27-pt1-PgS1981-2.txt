                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal God, our hearts are steadfast toward You. Lead us safely to 
the refuge of Your choosing, for You desire to give us a future and a 
hope. Provide us with grateful hearts to appreciate Your mercies that 
are new each day.
  Today, give our Senators the power to do Your will, as they realize 
more fully that they are servants of Heaven and stewards of Your 
mysteries. Lord, give them Your perspective on their daily tasks and 
every decision they must make. May faithfulness to You become the focus 
of their living, keeping them from becoming careless about their 
spiritual and moral growth.
  We pray in Your sacred Name. Amen.
