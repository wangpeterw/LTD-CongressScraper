                  STOP FUNDING PALESTINIAN TERRORISTS

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, last Friday night, an Israeli family 
sat down for Shabbat dinner to celebrate the birth of a new grandchild, 
but a 19-year-old Palestinian terrorist put an end to this joyous 
occasion.
  The terrorist brutally attacked the Salomon family with a large 
knife. Pictures of the family's home show a white floor stained red 
with the blood of the innocents.
  A father and two of his children were murdered that night. Upon 
learning of the tragic event, Palestinians in Gaza took to the streets 
to sing, dance, and celebrate. No Palestinian leader has even condemned 
this grizzly attack.
  Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, this is our U.S. tax dollars at work. The 
millions the United States sends to the Palestinians are funneled to 
terrorists and their families through the so-called martyrs fund. The 
leaders we prop up glorify terrorists and incite violence.
  The American people refuse to continue this insanity. We refuse to 
continue enabling terror against the Israeli people.
  And that is just the way it is.
