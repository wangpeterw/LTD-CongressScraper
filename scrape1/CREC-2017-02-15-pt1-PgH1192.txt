                   VOTERS TRUST TRUMP, NOT THE MEDIA

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, despite the saturation of negative 
media coverage of President Trump, the people have spoken. A recent 
poll found that President Trump is thought more trustworthy than the 
news media.
  The administration is considered truthful by 49 percent of registered 
voters, but the media is less trusted than the administration, with 
only 39 percent finding it honest. So President Trump is more credible 
than the liberal national media.
  That is no surprise. If the media wants to increase their 
credibility, they should report the news fairly, objectively, and 
without malice.
