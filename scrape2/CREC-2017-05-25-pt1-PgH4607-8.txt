           By Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina:
       H.R. 2654.
       Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       Because this legislation adjusts the formula the federal 
     government uses to spend money on federal contracts, it is 
     authorized by the Constitution under Article 1, Section 8, 
     Clause 1, which grants Congress its spending power.
