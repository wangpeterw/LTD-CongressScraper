                        WELCOMING PRESIDENT MOON

  (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in 
welcoming President Moon Jae-in of the Republic of Korea on the 
occasion of his visit to Washington this week. This visit is an 
important opportunity to further the strong bonds of cooperation and 
friendship between our two countries.
  As North Korea continues to threat our allies and pursue its 
destabilizing missile program, including tests of intercontinental 
ballistic missiles, this meeting comes at a pivotal time. The United 
States and the Republic of Korea must continue to stand together to 
contain this threat and ensure the security and safety of this 
strategically important region.
  Earlier I sent a letter urging Speaker Ryan to invite President Moon 
Jae-in to speak before a joint meeting of Congress so all Members can 
hear firsthand his perspective of these shared challenges. If not 
possible during this brief visit, I hope he will address this body in 
the future.
  Once again, I extend my heartfelt welcome to President Moon Jae-in, 
and I express my commitment to furthering the vital economic, security, 
and cultural relationships between our two countries.
