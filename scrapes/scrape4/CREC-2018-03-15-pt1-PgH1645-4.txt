                   FRANKLIN-SIMPSON SPORTS ANNOUNCERS

  (Mr. COMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. James Mooneyhan 
and Mr. Steve Thurmond for their contributions to Simpson County in the 
First Congressional District of Kentucky.
  These two community leaders have not only served as ambassadors for 
Franklin-Simpson High School throughout their careers and collectively 
witnessed over 33 years of sports history, but have contributed to the 
economic development and well-being of their fellow citizens during 
their careers in public service.
  Off air, Steve Thurmond is the executive director of the Franklin-
Simpson Chamber of Commerce, and James Mooneyhan has served as Simpson 
County's jailer. From state championship titles to their children's 
successes, their commentary continually showcased the fervent pride 
Simpson Countians hold for their community.
  The excitement and spirit resulting from the unique blend of their 
personalities will be extremely difficult to replace, and their 
retirement marks the end of an era for this storied program.
  Although the voices of Franklin-Simpson athletics will soon be 
broadcast throughout the region for the last time, I join with the 
entire community to thank them for the laughs and unforgettable 
memories they have provided over the last 25 years. I look forward to 
seeing these Wildcat fans on the sidelines for years to come.
