SENATE RESOLUTION 319--SUPPORTING THE GOALS, ACTIVITIES, AND IDEALS OF 
                      PREMATURITY AWARENESS MONTH

  Mr. BROWN (for himself and Mr. Isakson) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, 
Labor, and Pensions:

                              S. Res. 319

       Whereas, according to the World Health Organization, 
     complications of preterm birth is now the number one killer 
     of children under 5 years of age worldwide;
       Whereas 1,100,000 children die every year due to 
     complications of preterm birth;
       Whereas preterm birth is a global problem that exacts a 
     harsh toll on families from all parts of society in every 
     country;
       Whereas there are stark inequalities in the survival rates 
     of preterm babies born around the world;
       Whereas complications from preterm birth have lifelong 
     consequences for the health, growth, and development of 
     infants;
       Whereas up to 75 percent of deaths resulting from preterm 
     birth worldwide can be prevented through proven low-cost 
     interventions;
       Whereas countries can improve maternal health and the 
     survival rate of babies born prematurely by making strategic 
     investments in health care systems to ensure access to high-
     quality adolescent and pre-pregnancy care, prenatal care, 
     childbirth services, emergency obstetric care, postnatal 
     care, and comprehensive care for affected newborns;
       Whereas according to data collected by the Centers for 
     Disease Control and Prevention, preterm-related causes are 
     the leading contributors to infant death in the United 
     States, accounting for more than \1/3\ of infant deaths;
       Whereas while the preterm birth rate in the United States 
     decreased from a peak of 12.8 percent in 2006, the preterm 
     birth rate of 9.8 percent in 2016 is still too high;
       Whereas there are significant racial and ethnic disparities 
     in preterm birth rates among many communities in the United 
     States;

       Whereas the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies 
     estimated in 2006 that the annual societal economic cost 
     associated with preterm birth in the United States was 
     $26,200,000,000;
       Whereas many preterm births can be prevented through 
     evidence-based public health programs focused on reducing 
     risk factors such as tobacco use, inadequate birth spacing, 
     and early elective deliveries; and
       Whereas, in the United States and around the world, 
     November is recognized as Prematurity Awareness Month: Now, 
     therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) supports the recognition of Prematurity Awareness 
     Month;
       (2) supports efforts at home and abroad--
       (A) to reduce the impact of preterm births by improving 
     maternal health during and after pregnancy; and
       (B) to advance the care and treatment of infants born 
     preterm;
       (3) honors individuals working domestically and 
     internationally to reduce preterm births; and
       (4) expresses the intent of the Senate to promote evidence-
     based prevention interventions to prevent preterm birth and 
     improve outcomes for affected infants.
