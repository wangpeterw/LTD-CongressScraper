                          H.R. 7 AND GAG RULE

  (Mr. LARSEN of Washington asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 
7, the latest attack on women's reproductive rights.
  Today's bill comes on the coattails of the new administration's 
yesterday reinstating the global gag rule, which limits women's 
reproductive health care outside the U.S.--and all of this after 3.2 
million women and men across the country participated in the women's 
march last Saturday. The march sent a clear message that this 
administration should not undermine women's rights and women's health 
care.
  And this is the response--to undermine women's reproductive health 
care?
  Madam Speaker, the people of our country are watching; they are 
showing up; they are paying attention; and they will not back down in 
the face of attempts to move this country backwards.
  I urge my colleagues to oppose 
H.R. 7.
