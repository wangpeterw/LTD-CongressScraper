                            SCHUMER SHUTDOWN

  (Mrs. WAGNER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because I am frustrated, I am 
fed up, and I am concerned for our soldiers, their families, my 
constituents, and all Americans. People are filled with uncertainty. 
They are confused, and, honestly, so am I.
  Chuck Schumer and the Senate Democrats shut down the government over 
a deadline that does not exist. They voted against a bill they have no 
issues with. Democrats have recklessly put 9 million children at risk 
of losing their health insurance. Over 2 million members of our 
military, the men and women who risk their lives to protect us, are not 
being paid.
  It is time for Senate Democrats to join us and reopen the government. 
They need to join us in passing the Children's Health Insurance 
Program, and they need to join us in putting our military readiness, 
our American soldiers, and our country before political gamesmanship.
  Stop the Schumer shutdown.
