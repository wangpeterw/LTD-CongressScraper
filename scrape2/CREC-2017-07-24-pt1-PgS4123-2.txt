                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal Father, our souls long for You, for we find strength and joy 
in Your presence. Guide our lawmakers to put their trust in You, 
seeking in every undertaking to know Your will. Lord, when they go 
through difficulties, may they remember that with Your help they can 
accomplish the seemingly impossible. Give them a faith that will trust 
You even when the darkness is blacker than a hundred midnights. May 
they renew their commitment to You, finding strength and courage from 
Your guidance. Inspire them to always trust You to direct their steps.
  We pray in Your strong Name. Amen.
