                       REJECT REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, Democrats agree that we need to simplify our 
Tax Code and provide tax relief to middle-income families. 
Unfortunately, this Republican tax plan gives big tax cuts to the rich, 
huge tax cuts to corporations, and raises taxes--yes, the details 
matter--on tens of millions of American families, middle-income 
families making $100,000 or less.
  It takes away for some the ability to deduct interest on their home 
mortgage; takes away the ability to deduct interest on student loans, 
for goodness' sake; and takes away the ability to deduct interest on 
medical expenses.
  But for the loopholes that apply to the people at the very top, for 
the loopholes that apply to corporations, they leave them alone. They 
bring down their rates and let them keep their loopholes, and force us 
to borrow money from our children and our grandchildren to give great 
big tax breaks to people at the very top.
  This is wrong. This is not what the American people elected us to do. 
We need to shut this down now. We need tax relief for middle-income 
Americans, not tax giveaways to the people at the very top. We ought to 
reject this plan, and we ought to do it now.
