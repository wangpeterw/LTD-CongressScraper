           By Mr. McHENRY:
       H.R. 350.
       Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       Article I, Section 8, Clause 3: ``To regulate Commerce with 
     foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the 
     Indian Tribes.''
       Because the federal government has extended Article I, 
     Section 8, Clause 3 beyond its intended boundaries, it 
     follows that efforts to rein in excessive federal government 
     encroachment in this area can be justified by Article I, 
     Section 8, Clause 3.
