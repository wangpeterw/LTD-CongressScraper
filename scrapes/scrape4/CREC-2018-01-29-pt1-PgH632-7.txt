               REBUILD AMERICA'S CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow President Trump will give his first 
State of the Union Address. It is an opportunity for the President to 
demonstrate leadership and bring to this floor a discussion for both 
parties to come together and pass, number one, a long-term budget that 
reflects the priorities of the American people.
  I have come to this floor many times to express my disagreement with 
this President on a number of issues. I have disagreed on his efforts 
to take away healthcare for millions of people, adding costs to people 
I represent who have health insurance. I have disagreed with his tax 
policies and disagree vehemently with the policies enacted here, and I 
am going to continue to speak up when I find disagreement.
  But I also look for areas where we can work together, and it is my 
hope that tomorrow the President will articulate one of those: a plan 
to deal with America's crumbling infrastructure, especially in 
America's older cities. It has been over a year since the President was 
here and laid out his plan for a big investment plan and a strategy on 
infrastructure.
  Words are cheap. We need action. We need something specific. And I am 
hoping and willing to work with the President if he lays forward such a 
vision.
