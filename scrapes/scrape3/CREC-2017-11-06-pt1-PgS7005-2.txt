                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  O God, You are our God. Please draw near to all who are affected by 
the violence in Your house of worship in Sutherland Springs, TX. 
Comfort those who mourn, bring healing to the injured, and shower Your 
mercy upon us all.
  Lord, keep our lawmakers composed even in life's storms. May they 
acknowledge their need of Your power, Your wisdom, and Your might. May 
they run toward life's challenges and hardships, knowing that they are 
never alone. Satisfy their souls with good things, and transform the 
mundane into the meaningful. Lord, purify their hearts, creating within 
them a hunger and thirst for righteousness. Reveal to them Your plans 
for their well-being, providing them with a future and hope.
  We pray in Your loving Name. Amen.
