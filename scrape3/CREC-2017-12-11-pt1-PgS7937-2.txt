                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Loving God, sovereign of our Nation, keep our frailty before us that 
we might set our hearts on You. Today, let Your peace go with our 
lawmakers, guiding them in their work and protecting them from life's 
storms. Lord, remind them that those who trust You will not lack any 
good thing. Though our Senators face many challenges, rescue them from 
each difficulty. May they remember that they live this day only once 
and should therefore strive today to bless all the people they can in 
every way they can. Give them the wisdom to be receptive to Your 
guidance, always trusting You to direct their steps.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
