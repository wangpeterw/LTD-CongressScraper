                  WELCOMING REVEREND DOM ELIAS M. CARR

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. Suozzi) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, I am here to welcome Father Elias to the 
Chamber. He is from my hometown of the city of Glen Cove.
  Father Elias, as was mentioned, is a canon regular of St. Augustine 
from Klosterneuburg, Austria, and he and three of his colleagues from 
Klosterneuburg have been assigned to my parish, St. Rocco's, and our 
neighboring parish of St. Patrick's since 2011.
  He is joined here today by his parents as well as his brother, who is 
also a priest, Father Richard from Annandale, Virginia.

  I just wanted to say that we are so honored to have him here today. 
He has made such a dramatic difference in our community, along with his 
colleagues, Father Daniel, Father Ambrose, and Father Gabriel; and a 
great difference in my family's life as well.
  We are so grateful to you for your service to our community and to 
your faith, and to our faith, and for making such a difference in our 
lives.
