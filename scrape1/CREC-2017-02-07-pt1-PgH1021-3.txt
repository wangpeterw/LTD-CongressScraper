                       INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS

  (Mr. POLIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of our international 
institutions that allow us to get along with one another; the WTO, the 
United Nations, the IMF, the World Bank, NAFTA, CAFTA, all of our great 
international institutions that allow us to amicably resolve our 
differences.
  Let me tell you something, Mr. Speaker, with all the misbehavior and 
problems of the current occupant of the White House, what I am most 
worried about is this rise of nationalism. We have seen this play out 
before throughout our history.
  While no one is as proud to be as American as many of us who have the 
privilege to serve in this body, the world is more interconnected than 
ever before. And it is more important than ever before that Republicans 
and Democrats in this body show our commitment to resolving our 
legitimate disputes and differences amicably through the rule of 
international law and our international institutions, rather than 
resorting to violence and warfare.
  I call upon my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to renew our 
commitment to pursuing peaceful, diplomatic ways of resolving our 
international disputes through international legal bodies.
