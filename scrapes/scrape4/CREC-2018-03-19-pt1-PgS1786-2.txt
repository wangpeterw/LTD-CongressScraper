                   TRIBUTE TO VICTORIA HOENINGHAUSEN

 Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I would like to take the 
opportunity to express my appreciation to Tori for her hard work as an 
intern in my Washington, DC, office. I recognize her efforts and 
contributions to my office as well as to the State of Wyoming.
  Tori is a native of Yellowstone National Park. She is a graduate of 
the University of Wyoming, where she studied international studies and 
criminal justice. She has demonstrated a strong work ethic, which has 
made her an invaluable asset to our office. The quality of her work is 
reflected in her great efforts over the last several months.
  I want to thank Tori for the dedication she has shown while working 
for me and my staff. It was a pleasure to have her as part of our team. 
I know she will have continued success with all of her future 
endeavors. I wish her all my best on her next journey.
