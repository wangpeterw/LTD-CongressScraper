            DUTY, HONOR, SERVICE TO GOD, FAMILY, AND COUNTRY

  (Mr. STEWART asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. STEWART. Mr. Speaker, much has been said about the tumultuous 
times in which we live, and it is true, we do face enormous challenges. 
But I would like to remind the American people of the things that will 
get us through these times.
  My parents were part of the Greatest Generation. My father was a 
pilot in World War II, and I am honored to wear his Air Force wings. My 
mother was a mother of 10 amazing children, many of which are with me 
today. They are the best friends that I have ever had.
  Our parents taught us something that each of us has embroidered and 
now hangs on our individual family walls, and it is this: Our family's 
motto is duty, honor, service to God, family, and country.
  We are, as Abraham Lincoln said: ``The last best hope of Earth.'' 
That was true when he said it. It is still true today.
  We created the miracle of the Constitution; we survived the 
catastrophe of the Civil War; we defeated communism, totalitarianism, 
fascism; we have the strength to get through the challenges that we 
face today. But it will only be true if we are true to that principle: 
Duty, honor, service to God, family, and country.
