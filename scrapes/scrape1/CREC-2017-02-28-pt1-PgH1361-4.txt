                                 PRAYER

  Chaplain Harvey Klee, American Legion National Chaplain, Bluffton, 
Texas, offered the following prayer:
  Almighty God, we thank You when heroic leadership has been undertaken 
in this House during times of crises, for their labor well into the 
night, for efforts to seek compromise where compromise is warranted, 
and for creative solutions proposed and acted upon in the best 
interests of the American people.
  May unity prevail even when parties are in conflict. When progress is 
impeded and negotiations break down, grant them fresh ideas for 
discussion and ultimate resolution.
  May all Members of this House remain faithful to the oath of office 
they have taken as Representatives of ``We the people . . . '' and may 
political ideologies be tempered by intellectual honesty.
  Lord, bless this land we love so much and save us from our own self-
inflicted wounds.
  This we pray in the name of all that is holy.
  Amen.
