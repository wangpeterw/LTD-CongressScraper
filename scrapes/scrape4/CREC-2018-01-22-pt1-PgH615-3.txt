                                  DACA

  (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I said, at this podium, that the 
resolution to the Schumer shutdown is simple: Senate Democrats need to 
vote ``yes'' on the short-term funding bill, and the government 
reopens, paychecks get processed for our troops, and the Children's 
Health Insurance Program is up and running. It is that simple.
  Understand this: the Senate Democrats chose to shut down the 
government because they have more interest in creating a false deadline 
to address the DACA issues. The fact is the legislative process is 
already underway to address DACA.
  I'm cosponsoring the Securing America's Future Act which not only 
addresses DACA but actually takes measures to make sure we actually 
solve the problem in the long term, including securing our borders, 
which is a big part of addressing the heroin crisis we have in our 
country.
  Let's end the Schumer shutdown, reopen the government, and continue 
our work to address the critical issues facing our country.
