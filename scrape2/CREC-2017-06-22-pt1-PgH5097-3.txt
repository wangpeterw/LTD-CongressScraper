                 CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF STAN McETCHIN

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the passing and 
celebrate the life of a good friend to many, Mr. Stan McEtchin. Hailing 
from Vancouver, British Columbia, Stan passed away on June 9, after 92 
years of enriching the lives of those around him.
  For the past few decades, the small town of Paradise, California, has 
known Stan as a pillar of the community, whose sculpted metal artwork 
decorated shops and houses all across Butte County. But before his 
creative artwork made him a local celebrity, Stan served his country in 
World War II.
  In 1943, he volunteered for the First Special Service Force in the 
Canadian Army, an elite American and Canadian commando unit that 
preceded the modern Special Operations Forces we have today. In 2014, 
the man beloved for his artwork and for his charity was awarded a 
Congressional Gold Medal right here in Washington, D.C., for his unit's 
heroism in battle.
  I consider myself fortunate to have known him just a little bit, and 
our country fortunate to have gained such a good man from our northern 
neighbors.
  God bless his family and his memory.
