                          POLICY JUSTIFICATION

  Government of Kenya--Air Tractor Aircraft with Weapons and Related 
                                Support

       The Government of Kenya has requested a possible sale of up 
     to twelve (12) Air Tractor AT-802L and two (2) AT-504 trainer 
     aircraft, weapons package, technical support and program 
     management. The total estimated program cost is $418 million.
       This proposed sale contributes to the foreign policy and 
     national security of the United States by improving the 
     security of a strong regional partner who is a regional 
     security leader undertaking critical operations against al-
     Shabaab and troop contributor to the African Union Mission in 
     Somalia (AMISOM).
       The proposed sale provides a needed capability in the 
     ongoing efforts to counter al-Shabaab. The platform maximizes 
     the Kenyan Defense Force's Close Air Support (CAS) ability 
     because it is a short-field aircraft capable of using 
     precision munitions and cost effective logistics and 
     maintenance.
       The proposed sale supplements Kenya's aging F-5 aircraft as 
     it will be more fiscally efficient and able to be pre-
     positioned much closer to the conflict area than the F-5 
     fleet. The Kenyan Defense force is committed to modernizing 
     its air fleet and is capable of absorbing these aircraft. The 
     proposed sale of this equipment and support does not alter 
     the basic military balance in the region.
       The prime contractor will be L-3 Communications, Platform 
     Integration Division, Waco, Texas. There are no known offset 
     agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale.
       Implementation of this proposed sale requires the 
     assignment of at least five contractor representatives in 
     Kenya.
       There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness 
     as a result of this proposed sale.


                         Transmittal No. 16-79

     Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to 
         Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act

                           Annex Item No. vii

       (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:
       1. This sale involves the release of sensitive technology 
     to Kenya. The AT-802L weapons system is classified up to 
     Secret. The AT-802L aircraft uses the AT-802 airframe and 
     features avionics and other technologically sensitive 
     systems. The AT-802L contains an MX-15HDi electro-optical/
     infrared (EO/IR) full motion video (FMV) cameras with laser 
     designation; internal and external self-protection equipment; 
     a modified HGU-55/P helmet that incorporates a reticle-
     projected Heads-Up Display to cue weapons and aircraft 
     sensors to ground targets; and software computer programs.
       2. Sensitive and classified (up to SECRET) elements of the 
     proposed AT-802L include the hardware, accessories, 
     components, and associated software associated with the: MX-
     15HDi EO/IR FMV turret, Stores Management System (SMS), 
     Missile Warning System (MWS), HGU-55/P Helmet Mounted Cueing 
     System (HMCS), and air-to-ground weapons. Additional 
     sensitive areas include operating manuals and maintenance 
     technical orders containing performance information, 
     operating and test procedures, and other information related 
     to support operations and repair. The hardware, software, and 
     data identified are classified to protect vulnerabilities, 
     design and performance parameters, and other similar critical 
     information.
       3. The MX-15HDi is an EO/IR FMV camera that includes a 
     laser designator which creates the ability to designate 
     ground targets for use with laser guided weapons. The 
     commercially developed system software and hardware are 
     UNCLASSIFIED.
       4. The SMS provides basic flight path guidance to release 
     zone, mission recording and diagnostics, and continuous 
     stores status and inventory management. It is an internally 
     mounted suite. The commercially developed system software and 
     hardware are UNCLASSIFIED.
       5. The AN/AAR-47 is an electronic warfare system used to 
     protect against IR guided missile threats, laser-guided/
     laser-aided threats, and unguided munitions. The system, 
     hardware components and software are SECRET.
       6. The AN/ALE-47 system uses information from missile 
     warning sensors to determine the correct response to defeat 
     IR and other guided missiles. The AN/ALE-47 is SECRET.
       7. HMCS is a modified HGU-55/P helmet that incorporates a 
     reticle-projected Heads-Up Display to assist with cueing 
     weapons to ground targets. This system projects visual 
     targeting information, enabling the pilot to monitor this 
     information without interrupting his field of view through 
     the cockpit canopy. This provides improvement for close 
     combat targeting and engagement. Hardware is UNCLASSIFIED.
       8. The following munitions are part of the AT-802L 
     configuration:
       a. The Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS) is a 
     low cost semi-active laser guidance kit developed by BAE 
     Systems which is added to current unguided 70 mm rocket 
     motors and warheads similar to and including the HYDRA 70 
     rocket. It is a low collateral damage weapon that can 
     effectively strike both soft and lightly armored targets. 
     APKWS turns a standard unguided 2.75 inch (70 mm) rocket into 
     a precision laser-guided rocket, classification up to SECRET.
       b. The LAU-131 launcher is tube shaped, 59.8 inches in 
     length, and 10.125 inches in diameter. It weighs 65 pounds

     (GBU-58) are laser-guided ballistic bombs (LGBs) developed by 
     Raytheon and Lockheed Martin. The LGB is a maneuverable, 
     free-fall weapon that guides to a spot of laser energy 
     reflected off of the target. The LGB is delivered like a 
     normal general purpose (GP) warhead and the semi-active 
     guidance corrects for many of the normal errors inherent in 
     any delivery system. Laser designation for the weapon can be 
     provided by a variety of laser target markers or designators. 
     The LGB consists of a computer control group (CCG) that is 
     not warhead specific (MAU-169UB or MAU-209C/B) and a warhead 
     specific Air Foil Group (AFG), that attach to the nose and 
     tail of MK 81 and MK 82 or BLU-111 and BLU-110 General 
     Purpose (GP) bomb bodies. The overall weapon is CONFIDENTIAL.
       d. The FN HMP400 LCC is a self-contained airborne weapon 
     system that includes a Herstal .50 cal M3P machine gun and 
     250-round ammunition box. This system is UNCLASSIFIED.
       9. Kenya has expressed a willingness to protect United 
     States classified military information equivalent to US 
     Government standards. Kenya is firmly committed to its 
     relationship with the United States and to its promise to 
     protect classified information and prevent its transfer to a 
     third party. This sale is needed in furtherance of USG 
     foreign policy and national security interests by helping to 
     improve the security of a vital partner in the AFRICOM AOR.
       10. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain 
     knowledge of the specific hardware or software source code in 
     this proposed sale, the information could be used to develop 
     countermeasures which might reduce weapon system 
     effectiveness or be used in the development of systems with 
     similar or advance capabilities. The benefits to be derived 
     from this sale in the furtherance of the US foreign policy 
     and national security objectives, as outlined in the Policy 
     Justification, outweigh the potential damage that could 
     result if the sensitive technology were revealed to 
     unauthorized persons.
       11. All defense articles and services listed in this 
     transmittal have been authorized for release and export to 
     Kenya.

                          POLICY JUSTIFICATION

Government of Kuwait--Sustainment and Contractor Logistics Support for 
                       AH-64D Apache Helicopters

       The Government of Kuwait has requested the sale of support 
     equipment and services for its AH-64D Apache helicopters, to 
     include: Apache Maintainer unit support, Depot Level support, 
     training devices, helmets, simulators, generators, 
     transportation, wheeled vehicles and organization equipment, 
     spare and repair parts, support equipment, tools and test 
     equipment, technical data and publications, personnel 
     training and training equipment, United States Government and 
     contractor engineering, technical, and logistics support 
     services, and other related elements of logistics support. 
     The total overall estimated value is $400 million.
       The proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and 
     national security of the U.S by helping to improve the 
     security of a Major Non-NATO Ally that has been and continues 
     to be an important force for political stability and economic 
     progress in the Middle East region. Kuwait plays a large role 
     in U.S. efforts to advance stability in the Middle East, 
     providing basing, access, and transit for U.S. forces in the 
     region.
       Kuwait requires continued support for equipment already 
     procured to ensure national security interests and objectives 
     are met. The defense articles maintained are used solely by 
     the Ministry of Defense to protect the sovereign border and 
     to conduct operations and training to include joint exercises 
     with the U.S. military. Kuwait will be able to absorb this 
     additional equipment and support into its armed forces.
       The proposed sale of equipment and support will not alter 
     the basic military balance in the region.
       The U.S. companies potentially involved in the sale are 
     Boeing, Mesa, AZ; Longbow Limited, Orlando, FL/Owego, NY 
     (Joint Venture between Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman); 
     Lockheed Martin, Orlando, FL; and DynCorp International, Fort 
     Worth, TX. There are no known offset agreements for the sale.
       Implementation of this proposed sale will require the 
     assignment of four (4) U.S. Government representatives and 
     sixty-five (65) contractor representatives in country for up 
     to five year.
       There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness 
     as a result of this proposed sale.

       This proposed sale contributes to the foreign policy and 
     national security of the United States by improving the 
     security of a Major Non-NATO Ally that continues to be an 
     important force for political stability and economic progress 
     in the Middle East. Kuwait is a strategic partner in 
     maintaining stability in the region. This sale will increase 
     Kuwait's interoperability with the United States. It also 
     ensures a sustained air-to-air capability for Kuwait's F/A-18 
     aircraft.
       The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not 
     alter the basic military balance in the region.
       Implementation of the sale does not require the assignment 
     of any additional U.S. Government or contractor 
     representatives to Kuwait.
       The principal contractor will be Raytheon Corporation, 
     Tucson, Arizona. There are no known offset agreements 
     proposed in connection with this potential sale.

         Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act

                          Annex A Item No. vii

       (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:
       1. This sale will involve the release of sensitive 
     technology to the United Kingdom in the performance of 
     services to sustain eight (8) United Kingdom C-17 aircraft. 
     While much of the below equipment supporting the C-17 is not 
     new to the country, there will be replenishment spares of the 
     below sensitive technologies purchased to support the fleet.
       2. The Force 524D is a 24-channel SAASM based Global 
     Positioning System (GPS) receiver, with precise positioning 
     service (PPS) capability built upon Trimble's next generation 
     OPS technology. The Force 524D retains backward compatibility 
     with the proven Force 5GS, while adding new functionality to 
     interface with digital antenna electronics, to significantly 
     improve anti-jam (AJ) performance. The host platform can 
     select the radio frequency (RF) or digital antenna 
     electronics (DAE) interface. In the digital mode, the Force 
     524D is capable of controlling up to 16 independent beams. 
     The hardware and software associated with the 524D receiver 
     card is UNCLASSIFIED.
       3. The C-17 aircraft will be equipped with the GAS-1, which 
     is comprised of the Controlled Reception Pattern Antennas 
     (CRPA), with the associated wiring harness and the Antenna 
     Electronics (AE)-1, to provide AJ capability. The hardware is 
     UNCLASSIFIED.

     Identification Friend or Foe (IFF). The hardware is 
     UNCLASSIFIED and COMSEC controlled.
       5. Software, hardware, and other data/information, which is 
     classified or sensitive, is reviewed prior to release to 
     protect system vulnerabilities, design data, and performance 
     parameters. Some end-item hardware, software, and other data 
     identified above are classified at the CONFIDENTIAL and 
     SECRET level. Potential compromise of these systems is 
     controlled through management of the basic software programs, 
     of highly sensitive systems and software-controlled weapon 
     systems, on a case-by-case basis.
       6. The United Kingdom is both willing and able to protect 
     United States classified military information. The United 
     Kingdom's physical and document security standards are 
     equivalent to U.S. standards. The United Kingdom has 
     demonstrated its willingness and capability to protect 
     sensitive military technology and information released to its 
     military in the past. The United Kingdom is firmly committed 
     to its relationship with the United States and to its promise 
     to protect classified information and prevent its transfer to 
     a third party.
       7. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain 
     knowledge of the specific hardware or software source code in 
     this proposed sale, the information could be used to develop 
     countermeasures which might reduce weapon system 
     effectiveness or be used in the development of systems with 
     similar or advanced capabilities. The benefits to be derived 
     from this sale in the furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy 
     and national security objectives, as outlined in the Policy 
     Justification, outweigh the potential damage that could 
     result if the sensitive technology, were revealed to 
     unauthorized persons.
       8. All defense articles and services listed in this 
     transmittal are authorized for release and export to the 
     Government of the United Kingdom.
