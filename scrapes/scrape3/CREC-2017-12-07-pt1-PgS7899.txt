                               DREAM ACT

  Mr. SCHUMER. Finally, Mr. President, let me say a word about the 
Dream Act. Earlier this week, my friend, the senior Senator from 
Illinois, came to the floor to update the Senate on the progress he is 
making in his negotiations with Senate Republicans on an agreement that 
would provide a significant investment in border security in exchange 
for the Dream Act.
  As I have said in the past, Democrats support real border security. 
We will be happy to join with Republicans to pass legislation to secure 
our border in exchange for the Dream Act. Those talks continue to make 
good progress. I hope we can reach an agreement soon.
