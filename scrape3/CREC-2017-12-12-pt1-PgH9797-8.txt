                       RECOGNIZING GRAYDON CARTER

  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, today I recognize the career of Hall of Fame 
Magazine Editor Graydon Carter.
  Graydon Carter is one of the great journalists of our time. He 
retires today after 25 years as the editor at Vanity Fair. He cofounded 
and was editor of Spy magazine, as well as the New York Observer. At 
Vanity Fair, he gave a venue to writers like Michael Lewis; Dominick 
Dunne; and Christopher Hitchens, one of the great journalists of our 
time.
  Upon Christopher Hitchens' passing, Graydon said he was a wit, a 
charmer, and a troublemaker; and to those who knew him well, he was a 
gift from--dare I say it--God.
  From his beginnings at Spy magazine and through his days at the New 
York Observer and Vanity Fair, he pointed out the shortcomings of 
Donald Trump. He gave him the epithet: short-fingered vulgarian.
  For that and much more, Graydon Carter will be remembered as a great 
journalist, a great human being, a great raconteur, and a great friend.
