                                DREAMERS

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, there are less than 21 legislative 
days left this calendar year, and the House has yet to vote for a 
permanent solution to protect DREAMers from deportation.
  H.R. 3440, known as the Dream Act, introduced by Congresswoman 
Lucille Roybal-Allard and me, is an effort to put an end to the fear 
and the uncertainty that surrounds over 800,000 young immigrants living 
in our country.
  This bill will allow qualified DREAMers an opportunity to better plan 
for their future in the only country they truly know as home--the 
United States.
  After several years, they will be able to apply for conditional 
permanent residency, and eventually for citizenship. And during that 
time, they will continue to participate in their daily activities, such 
as contributing to our communities, helping our economy, and showcasing 
their talent and ingenuity.
  Mr. Speaker, let's do what is right for these young immigrants 
because they are already Americans in their hearts and minds. Let's 
bring the Dream Act for a vote so that these young professionals can 
make their American Dream a reality. The clock is ticking, Mr. Speaker.
