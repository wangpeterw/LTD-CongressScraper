  SHERIFF GRADY JUDD NAMED PRESIDENT OF THE MAJOR COUNTY SHERIFFS OF 
                                AMERICA

  (Mr. ROSS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in recognition of a man whose 
service to his community has resulted in greater safety, security, and 
justice in Polk County, Florida.
  Sheriff Grady Judd, a stalwart of law enforcement in the 15th 
District and a dear friend, has been sworn into the role of president 
of the Major County Sheriffs of America, a position to which he will 
bring his knowledge, his skill, and his integrity to advocate for safer 
communities across our great Nation.
  For centuries, the Anglo-American sheriff system has produced 
officers who secure the peace and prosperity of the land, and even two 
American Presidents, Grover Cleveland and Teddy Roosevelt, served in 
such a capacity.
  Sheriff Judd has long been an advocate for the rule of law, and we 
will all benefit as he rises to this position to fight to uphold the 
noble tradition of keeping the peace.
  My deepest congratulations to Sheriff Judd and his family, and to the 
Major County Sheriffs of America, who do such important work to keep us 
all safe.

                          ____________________
