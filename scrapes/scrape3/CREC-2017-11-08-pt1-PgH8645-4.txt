                         HONORING VETERANS DAY

  (Mr. PALAZZO asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize America's 
veterans.
  Saturday is Veterans Day, a time to recognize our bravest men and 
women who answered the call to defend our great Nation against our 
enemies. Words are not enough to say thank you for everything you have 
endured and sacrificed on America's behalf.
  As a fellow veteran, and on behalf of the good families of 
Mississippi's Fourth Congressional District, I want to convey my 
appreciation to you and your families.
  Many of us have seen the perils of war and conflict. Many have been 
injured in the line of duty, and many have paid the ultimate sacrifice 
before the altar of freedom.
  Because of this display of sacrifice, future generations may enjoy 
the blessings of what our country stands for: the right to life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I am proud to have had the 
opportunity to serve alongside such brave men and women.
  So, veterans, we are a free nation because of the bravery of you and 
your families. Happy Veterans Day, and God bless you.
