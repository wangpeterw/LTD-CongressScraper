                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Almighty God, great is Your faithfulness. We find strength in 
difficult times because our thoughts about Your mercy and providential 
care sustain us.
  Lord, guide our lawmakers to make You their sure foundation. From 
this foundation, may they gain strength for today and bright hope for 
tomorrow. Help them to base their hope on Your exceedingly great and 
precious promises, as You do for them more than they can ask or 
imagine. May they have such an inner sense of Your presence that they 
will desire to commune with You throughout this day.
  And, Lord, bless our incoming summer page class. May these young 
people increase intellectually, physically, socially, and spiritually.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
