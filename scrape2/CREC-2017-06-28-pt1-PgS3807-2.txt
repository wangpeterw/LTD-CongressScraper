                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Gracious God, Ruler of all nature, Your strong right hand continues 
to sustain us.
  Lord, remind our lawmakers of their accountability to You. Provide 
them with such a passion to please You that they will maintain a 
conscience void of offense toward You and humanity. In the flurry of 
legislative activities, may they not forget those on life's margins.
  Lord, guide our Senators to perform those actions that bring the 
greatest glory to Your Name. Remind them of that Golden Rule, which 
states: What you don't want done to you don't do to someone else. May 
integrity and honesty protect them as they put their hope in You.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
