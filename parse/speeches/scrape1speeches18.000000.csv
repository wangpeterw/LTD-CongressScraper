6476,topic-id,165,"Mr.Speaker, back in 2015, Congress passed one of the most significant education reform legislation in decades. Even more impressive than repealing No Child Left Behind, scaling back the role of the Secretary of Education and restoring authority back to the States and local school districts was the fact that this legislation was bipartisan, bicameral, and signed into law by President  But even so, this couldn't exempt our States and schools from the watchful eyes of President Obama's Department of Education unsurprisingly went over the line by expanding his authority, a role that Congress clearly did not allow for in the law.  That is why today I am delighted to see the House pass H.57 because we have to make the Department of Education follow the law as it was intended by The Every Student Succeeds Act was written to stop Federal micromanagement of our schools, and Congress is ensuring that that happens.

6524,topic-id,694,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the rule governing these pieces of legislation and, in particular, the underlying legislation, the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny, or REINS Act, H.26.  Mr.Speaker, during the first two terms that I have served in this Congress, the most common question posed to me by my constituents in central and eastern Kentucky is: What is the biggest surprise that you have confronted as a Member of Congress?  Regrettably, Mr.Speaker, the biggest surprise that I have discovered as a Member of Congress is that Congress is no longer in charge. Regrettably, unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats in the executive branch run the country.                              {time}  1315  Most of the laws that are enacted in this country at the Federal level come out of unelected bureaucrats in administrative agencies in the executive branch. Members of Congress, even though we are elected by the American people to be the lawmaking branch under Article I of the Constitution, we can't stop it. We can't stop these rules and regulations.  So I am proud to have consistently supported the REINS Act because it reasserts the powers of this body and this Congress under Article I of the Constitution, which provides: ``All legislative powers herein granted shall be invested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.''  What does this mean?  The most important word in Article I of the Constitution is that first substantive word, ``all,'' implying that none of the legislative powers should be in any other branch of the Federal Government, and it certainly shouldn't be exercised by the executive branch. We know this as the nondelegation doctrine, the principle that Congress may not and should not delegate its administrative power to administrative agencies.  The nondelegation doctrine forces a politically accountable Congress to make policy choices rather than leave this to unelected administrative officials. Yet what we have seen over the last several decades, and especially over the last 8 years, has been the rise of an unaccountable, out-of-control administrative state. Over time, legislative powers that are vested exclusively in Congress by the Constitution have been increasingly and unconstitutionally claimed, assumed, and exercised by the executive branch.  Now unaccountable, unelected bureaucrats decide how you work, what goods and services you can buy and sell, and what you can do with your own property, all without accountability at the ballot box. So this state of affairs is fundamentally in conflict with the foundational, constitutional principle that Congress alone possesses the Federal legislative power.  Look, this has enormous economic consequences. It is costly to our economy, and I don't have to go into that. The estimates are $1.8 trillion in costs to the American economy. But the bigger issue is that none of these rules from these agencies have been approved--let alone, even considered--by Congress, even though they have a profound impact on the economy. So the measure we are considering today would simply require those regulations with the greatest economic impact to be approved by both Houses of Congress prior to their implementation.  This has two positive outcomes. First, obviously, it has the effect of blocking costly rules. Secondly, and more importantly, it will no longer allow Members of Congress to delegate their constitutional responsibility to the executive branch.  I will conclude, I heard my friend, the gentleman from Massachusetts, make the argument that Congress is not even interested in these regulations and we are not capable of seriously reviewing these rules. This is about making sure that experts with specialized expertise in the executive branch review and promulgate these rules. But what are we doing here if[[Page H118]]that is true? We should turn out the lights, lock the door and leave, and give the keys of the government to the executive branch.  We had a Democratic administration over the last 8 years. We have a Republican administration coming. This is not about Republicans and This is not a partisan issue. This is about the integrity of the institution of Let's stand up for the Congress and pass the REINS  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (",CREC-2017-01-05-pt1-PgH113-2.txt,2238,"CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2017",2017.0,5.0,January

6467,topic-id,1337,"Mr.President, I would like to congratulate my colleague from South Dakota for his comments. I am hearing the same thing in Wyoming that he has been hearing about the ObamaCare health care law and the impact on people in his I am hearing the same thing. I heard it this past weekend in Wyoming talking to people about what impact ObamaCare has had on their lives.  It is very interesting because people all around the State of Wyoming are talking about the fact that their costs have gone up and choices have gone down. Many who had insurance that worked for them lost that insurance all related to a law passed in the House and the Senate and signed into law by President  Tonight, in Chicago, President Obama is going to give a farewell address. I am assuming he will talk about ObamaCare, and I am assuming he paints a very different picture than the American people have seen and are living with. The President is using scare tactics about what Republicans plan to do. No matter what President Obama wants, the American people have spoken. They have voted, and 8 out of 10 people say that what this costly and complicated health care law has done to them, they would like to see it either significantly changed or repealed and replaced. They know better than to believe what the Democrats are continuing to tell them because they have been living with it every day.  Seven years ago, Democrats made one false claim after another when they were trying to sell this law to the American people. Democrats said: If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. They said: If you liked your health care plan, you could keep your health care plan. That one was labeled the Lie of the Year a few years ago. They said premiums for the average family would go down by $2,500. None of it was true. Now Democrats are out telling more tales about All of these new stories are going to be just as false as the ones they told us all in the past. For one thing, Democrats have been saying that millions of Americans are going to lose their health insurance if we repeal the ObamaCare health care law.  In a letter just last week, Senators Schumer and Sanders said that Republicans are planning to take health care coverage away from more than 30 million It is not going to happen. The Democrats absolutely know it is not going to happen. It doesn't stop them from saying it.  The fact is, this should never have been about health insurance in the first place. As a doctor, I will tell you this should have been about health care and patients. Republicans are going to make sure that is where the focus is from now on. The number of people with good health insurance coverage under ObamaCare actually has been a lot less than what the Democrats are claiming. That is because lots of people who bought ObamaCare coverage only did it because the health care law forced them to give up the insurance they already had and liked and worked for them. I have heard many stories from people in Wyoming who had insurance. It worked for them. They chose it because it was best for them and their family, and they lost it because the President said it wasn't good enough for him. These are people who were hurt by the broken promises and by President Obama's well-earned award of Lie of the  With the health care law, most of the people who got insurance for the first time were actually forced into the broken system called Most of those people were actually eligible for Medicaid before the law was even signed, but for people who didn't have insurance before, a lot of them still can't afford care now because they may have insurance, but the deductibles are so high they can't afford to use it. Half of ObamaCare enrollees say they are skipping doctor visits in order to save money. If a family's health insurance doesn't cover the care they need, then the number of people covered is totally meaningless.  Democrats are out there saying that if we try to replace ObamaCare with a better solution, that it is just going to, in their words, cause chaos in the health insurance industry. Where have they been? There is chaos everywhere because of When you look at what Democrats did to America's health care system, what you see is chaos. Premiums are up 25 percent in 1 year. That is chaos. Deductibles are up by an average of $450 in a year. That is chaos. There is no functioning marketplace for ObamaCare in one-third of the country. That is chaos. When Americans look at this, what they see is already chaos, and ObamaCare caused it.  I want to mention one of the false claims the Democrats are making, and it has to do with That is because Medicaid was broken long before All the health care law did[[Page S186]]was add more people onto this broken program. One reason Medicaid is struggling is the same reason the rest of ObamaCare isn't working--because Medicaid tries to impose too many rules and regulations from It tries to make one size fit all.  There are different needs in every States know what those needs are, and they know much better than Washington about the people who live in those There are Republican Governors like Mike Pence of Indiana who understood this very important fact--and I am glad he is soon going to be Vice Governors like Mike Pence fought for waivers, waivers to make sure they could do what the people of their States needed. Every Governor should have that kind of freedom to look out for the best interests of the people in their home They shouldn't have to ask permission from some unaccountable, unelected Washington bureaucrat before making improvements to their own Medicaid Giving States the freedom to come up with better solutions is just one of the things Republicans are going to do to replace ObamaCare with real health care reform. States need and deserve to have that freedom, and people should be free to buy the health insurance that meets their needs, not what meets the needs of the President of the United  People shouldn't have to pay more for coverage that isn't a good value for them. That is why so many people aren't even signing up in the first place and would rather pay the penalty--a penalty that, in my mind, is still unconstitutional. Families should have more flexibility to save for their own medical care. That is a way to make sure they are not stuck with empty coverage they can't afford to use. People shouldn't be mandated to buy this overpriced, unusable insurance or face a penalty from the It is one of the most outrageous parts of the entire health care law. To me, it is the first thing that has to go on the chopping block.  Republicans are going to repeal damaging and destructive ideas like ObamaCare's many taxes, mandates, and penalties. Then we are going to walk through better solutions one-by-one, step-by-step. I hope some of the Democrats in Congress will join us.  The Democratic Senators must be heading home on weekends and listening to people who have been impacted the way I described the people of Wyoming believe they have been impacted by the health care law. They have to realize there are things we must do better and more freedoms that must be given to the American people.  The American people have suffered long enough with the chaos created by It took years for health insurance markets to get this bad, and it is going to take time to get things fixed.

Israel's security is important to me and the people I represent. The Jewish homeland is the only democracy in this broader region of continuing conflict. I abhor the terrorist acts. Israel's security merits our support, which is why the Obama administration, with Congress' approval, just awarded an unprecedented amount of military aid over the next 10 years.  But, unfortunately, Israel's future is being threatened by its own actions as well as by its adversaries. For years, reckless settlement expansion has been opposed by the United States and the rest of the world. They are confiscating Palestinian land in a way that is not just contrary to longstanding American policy, but is often illegal under Israeli law.  It looks like the incoming Trump administration is reconsidering 50 years of bipartisan policy, urged on by the extremist views of his proposed Ambassador whose position on settlement expansion is on the fringe of even Israeli politics.  11 sends the wrong signal to the incoming President, to Israeli politicians, and especially to the Israeli people.

6545,topic-id,723,"Mr.Speaker, we are seeing from coast to coast demonstrations, protests, with people speaking out against the outrageous, reckless, and cruel executive order promulgated by the administration on It is wrong, and it is immoral on so many levels. It is hard to know where to start.  I just left my office with the president of the Western States chiropractic college--the largest such institution in the country--Joe Brimhall has a number of students who are dual citizens who need to leave the United States to take their board-certified tests next week in He doesn't know what to tell them. Pursue their professional career and maybe not be able to come back to the United States and finish at the college? It is embarrassing that we can't give him guidance about this ill-thought-out and reckless executive order that wasn't planned and still is having the details worked out.  But perhaps the worst aspect of this blanket cancelation is as it affects Special Immigrant Visas for Iraqis who are waiting to come to the United Whatever you think about the Iraq war, the men and women in Iraq who volunteered to help our forces were essential. They were guides, they were interpreters, and they worked on the projects. We could not have done the job over there without them. In many cases, they blended into the units in which they served. I have had cases where our soldiers have described to me how these people literally saved their lives.  I have heard from veterans who care deeply and wonder about the signal that they are sending to people they regarded essentially as family. They wonder how this administration could have forgotten about them. The guard in my office in Portland, who is a veteran, was asking me what is going on. He recalled his story about an interpreter who was critical to him when he served in How could we have forgotten them?  I will tell you somebody who has not forgotten them are the Taliban and the ISIS terrorists. They regard these people as traitors. The terrorists have long memories, and want to make people pay for helping the United We have seen countless examples of these people being hunted down by terrorists. They have been assaulted, they have been kidnapped, they have had family members held for ransom, and they have been murdered.  That is why I have worked on a bipartisan basis for 10 years establishing the Special Immigrant Visa program with the late Senator Kennedy, with Senator John McCain, Senator Shaheen, my Republican colleague Adam Kinzinger, and Congressmen Stivers and Hunter who were veterans themselves and understood why this program was important.  There is a lot of talk about extreme vetting. Trust me--the applicants for these visas are extremely vetted, taking 2 and 3 years, sometimes longer, fighting the bureaucracy, trying to make sure that they can escape to safety. Many have been killed because the extreme vetting process took so long.[[Page H757]]To turn their lives upside down and put them at risk because there are people in the White House who don't understand or who don't care is appalling.  I applaud my colleagues in both parties who are speaking out and asking the administration to come to its senses on this blanket ban of Muslims from seven countries--seven countries, by the way, that have not been involved with terrorist acts. This is not going to make us any safer. Some have speculated that some of the countries that have been left out, like Saudi Arabia, where most of the 9/11 terrorists came from, were left out because the President has business interests there.  I don't know why these countries were selected, but the fact is it should end today. It should end not just because of the brave men and women under the Special Immigrant Visa program from Iraq whose lives are now at greater risk because of this reckless act. It is wrong because of the signals we are sending to foreign nationals whom we rely upon.

Mr.Speaker, there is no greater friend to the United States than Israel is a beacon of hope in a very dangerous part of the world. They are an important economic and military partner of the United States, and they play a critical role when it comes to fighting radical Islamic terrorism.  Given the importance of the U.S.-Israel relationship, I was deeply disappointed to see the United States recently passed a flawed anti-Israel resolution that will only make it more difficult to achieve peace in the Middle Even more disappointing was the fact that the United States just stood by and did nothing as it happened. Instead of vetoing the resolution, the United States Ambassador abstained from voting at all.  In other words, the United States turned its back and looked the other way as the U.passed a flawed resolution attacking This represents a[[Page H116]]dangerous break in a longstanding and bipartisan policy to protect our sole democratic ally in the region from one-sided resolutions at the U. Let's be clear, this resolution does absolutely nothing to make peace more likely in the region. Instead, it muddies the water and only further complicates what is already a very complex issue.  No solution to the ongoing problems with Israel and the Palestinian Authority is going to come from an international body like the United Nations telling them what to do. Any real solution must come through negotiations between the involved parties.  Honestly, given the many blunders of the Obama administration on the world stage, I guess this most recent action shouldn't be all that surprising. But this action is one of the most irresponsible acts ever by an outgoing It will be a dark stain on an already disastrous legacy.  By abstaining and allowing this resolution to pass, the Obama administration has upset decades of bipartisan policy as it relates to Israel and put a pathway to peace even further out of reach. Now is the time to be standing up for Israel, not turning away from them.  It is my hope and my belief that under President-elect Trump the United States will once again stand arm in arm with Israel, and this resolution is an important step in that direction.

Like the Obama administration, I am frustrated by the lack of progress in recent years toward achieving a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian crisis. However, I do not believe that the resolution passed by the Security Council contributes in any way to positively moving this process along.  Let's not mistake the fact that the Palestinian Government, which currently includes the terrorist faction Hamas, has done little to support peace negotiations. By refusing to publicly recognize Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, condoning terrorist activity and pursuing unilateral actions at international institutions in violation of the Oslo Accords, the Palestinians have continuously placed roadblocks to achieving peace.  Let me be clear, the ongoing settlement activity sanctioned by the Israeli Government is also counterproductive to the peace process. If the Israeli Government wants to remain a beacon of freedom and democracy in the Middle East, they must recommit themselves to achieving a peaceful two-state solution where a Jewish Israel exists peacefully with the Palestinian state.  With the events of recent years, I am extremely fearful that the two-state solution is, if not dead, in critical condition. There are those within both the Israeli and Palestinian Governments who are actively working to ensure its demise.

Before its passage, our Nation experienced several occasions when the President was unable to perform his powers and duties, with no constitutional provision for temporary transfer of these powers to the Vice The amendment was first relied upon following the resignations of Vice President Spiro Agnew and President Richard It also provided the basis for President Ronald Reagan to temporarily pass his duties to Vice President George Bush when President Reagan underwent surgery.  While we all hope not to have to use the 25th Amendment, having an established process that continues to guide administrations faced with unexpected events is essential for any functional democracy. Senator Bayh played a key leadership role in the Senate by drafting this constitutional amendment and ensuring all necessary steps were taken for its ratification in 1967.  Senator Bayh also drafted the 26th Amendment, which changed the voting age from 21 to 18. Its impetus was the passage of amendments to the Voting Rights Act in 1970 that set 18 as the minimum voting age for both Federal and State elections. When the Supreme Court ruled in Oregon v. Mitchell that the law applied only to Federal, not State elections, Congress adopted the 26th Just over 3 months later, on July 1, 1971, three-fourths of the States had ratified the amendment, making it the quickest amendment ever to be adopted.  In addition to these two constitutional amendments, Senator Bayh wrote the landmark title IX to the Higher Education Act, which mandates equal opportunities for women students and faculty. Senator Bayh was also an architect of the Juvenile Justice Act of 1974, which requires the separation of juvenile offenders from adult prison populations, and he played a vital role in the drafting and passage of the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights  Since leaving the Senate in 1980, Senator Bayh has committed himself to leadership in civic policy. He has served as chairman of the University of Virginia's Miller Center Commission on Presidential Disability and the 25th Amendment and as a member of the center's Commission on Federal Judicial He is also founding chairman of the National Institute Against Prejudice and Violence, a nonprofit, first-of-its-kind organization dedicated to studying prejudice and hate crimes in  Senator Bayh, as you and your wife, Kitty, enjoy your retirement, the contributions you have made to our country endure. The indelible mark you have made on the orderly transition of power and preservation of justice is still celebrated with pride today as we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 25th Recently, the American Bar Association honored you with a Presidential citation for exhibiting the highest standards of public service as a lawyer and for extraordinary leadership on issues of law and justice, including the 25th You are richly deserving of these accolades, as well as the gratitude of this Senate and the American people, for your lifetime of service.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-28-pt1-PgS2046.txt,1850,CONGRATULATING THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS,2017.0,28.0,February

6437,topic-id,434,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise today in support of H.549, the Transit Security Grant Program Flexibility With more than 10 billion riders using surface transportation annually and limited security screening, it should not be surprising to us that terrorists have an interest in targeting mass transit. We saw it in London, Madrid, Brussels, and when a terrorist left a backpack of IEDs at a transit station in Elizabeth, New Jersey, last fall.  Given the repeated calls from ISIS and other radical Islamic terrorist groups for lone wolves and sympathizers to plan smaller attacks where larger crowds gather, we must ensure that the first responders and transit agencies have the tools they need to secure our transit systems.  That is why, last Congress, I introduced the Transit Security Grant Program Flexibility This bill addresses concerns raised during a field hearing the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications held last year in Ranking Member Payne's district on preparedness for incidents impacting surface transportation. As chairman of that subcommittee, I introduced this legislation to ensure action follows our subcommittee's oversight, and that is why I reintroduced this commonsense legislation in the 115th  Witnesses at last year's field hearing testified about the importance of the transit security grant program, but found that the period of performance was a challenging timeframe to meet, especially for completing vital, large-scale capital security projects. These projects are vital to transit agencies to help enhance their security features systemwide and harden infrastructure.  H.549 addresses this challenge by codifying the period of performance for transit security grant program awards at 36 months for the majority of eligible projects and extending the period of performance for large-scale capital security projects to 55 months.  Additionally, transit security grant program awards can be used to provide personnel with effective security training. Unfortunately, recipients of these awards are not currently permitted to use transit security grant program funds to pay for backfilling personnel attending such training. In some cases, that extra cost at the transit agency has resulted in an inability to send staff for vital security training. My bill will permit transit security grant program funds to be used for this purpose, consistent with other Homeland Security grant programs.  The current threat environment is evolving and complex, which makes it even more imperative that the transit security grant program provide flexible solutions for grant recipients. I am proud to sponsor this bipartisan legislation, which passed the House by voice vote last year.  I urge all Members to join me in supporting H.549.  I reserve the balance of my time.

6515,topic-id,1873,"Mr.Speaker, this evening I rise to speak on behalf of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and I believe some of my colleagues will be joining me, to talk about the budget that has just been released by this  I would like to say, Mr.Speaker, that while it is being called a skinny budget, we call it the billionaire's budget. It is the same misguided, rambling, unfocused, bloated giveaway to rich and corporate interests that has been offered for years.  My belief is that a budget is a statement of our values. This budget ensures that the rich get richer at the cost of working people, the environment, and the future of our country.  Funding has been axed for nearly 20 agencies, from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the In addition to elimination of these important agencies, the billionaire's budget guts funding for several other important agencies.  You can see here by this chart from The Washington Post exactly what is happening: the Environmental Protection Agency chopped by 31 percent; the State Department cut by 29 percent; Agriculture cut by 21 percent, the Labor Department by 21 percent.[[Page H2140]]  And the cuts go on through every single agency of critical importance to the American people: Department of Health and Human Services, Commerce, Education, Housing and Urban Development at a time when we have a tremendous housing crisis in this country.  Transportation, from a President who said that he was going to invest in our infrastructure, yet here you see that the Transportation budget has a 13 percent cut.  Mr.Speaker, the reality is that the cost of security for the Trump Tower is $183 million a year. The budget for the National Endowment for the Arts is $148 million a year.  There are some other cuts that we could do if we were that concerned, but let's talk about housing. Housing access and affordability is squarely on the chopping block in this billionaire's budget.  With a $4.3 billion cut, HUD will lose its Community Development Block Grant program. Now, some people don't know exactly what the Community Development Block Grant program does; and, in fact, it sounded like Director Mulvaney didn't know that either when he was asked about a critical program that is funded through this Community Development Block Grant program, and that is funding for Meals on  There are communities across this country that fund their Meals on Wheels program, which is funding for meals for the elderly who cannot get to somewhere where they can get a meal, and so we take them a meal. That is Meals on Wheels, an incredibly bipartisan, beloved program. Unfortunately, that would go away because the CDBG program would be cut; and, therefore, the Meals on Wheels program would be cut.  These programs are an integral part of building up our communities, both through affordable housing as well as through some of these critical programs that go as wraparound services to affordable housing.  The city of Seattle, which I represent, is currently in a state of emergency due to its housing crisis. Right now, there are around 3,000 people experiencing homelessness in the city and nearly 10,000 in the surrounding areas--veterans, families, LGBTQ youth.  This is unacceptable. Access to stable housing is absolutely critical to making sure that members of our community are safe and able to access the services they need to get back on track and live full lives.  Let's talk about Health and Human The Department of Health and Human Services is facing an 18 percent cut to its funding, which could have devastating--and I am talking about life and death--consequences here, absolutely devastating impacts.  It would decrease the funding for the National Institutes of Health, for cancer and medical research, critical programs that help us to figure out how we save lives in this country and actually are part of the innovation that the United States offers. Gutting this funding would put us at a grave disadvantage, and it would put people's lives at risk.  Transportation, another critical area that this President promised that he was going to invest in. He was going to make sure we were bringing forward jobs, that we were investing in our infrastructure, our crumbling roads and bridges, making sure that we are investing in critical transit and transportation projects. But in this budget, the Transportation budget is facing a 13 percent cut. That is nearly half a billion dollars from the TIGER grant program, which has allowed our country to carry out critical infrastructure improvement projects not just in one kind of a city, not just in urban areas, but urban and rural areas alike.  The billionaire's budget would also cut funding to all new fully funded grant agreements, including some really important projects in cities across the country.  In Seattle, our critical streetcar project would be cut; and light rail expansion, which we have been working on for years, the State has invested in a bipartisan way--when I was in the State senate, we actually passed a $15 billion transportation infrastructure package because we knew that we had to deal with the transportation infrastructure needs of business, of our communities across the State and the influx of people into our                              {time}  1845  We agreed in a bipartisan way that this was something we needed to do. Part of that agreement included being able to fund the next phase of light-rail across our region.  Our Sound Transit CEO, Peter Rogoff, calls this budget a ``body blow.'' I couldn't agree with him more. We are looking at potentially a $7.7 billion cut to Sound  These are major transportation projects for our cities. They would create jobs, which is what this President said that he wanted to do, is create jobs. But by gutting these funds and gutting investment in transportation infrastructure, we will be stopping the very projects that are going to create those jobs and help our cities and rural areas make the necessary upgrades that they need to thrive.  Mr.Speaker, one of the worst areas that is hit in this budget is the environment. This billionaire's budget is an all-out assault on our environment and efforts to fund research and curb climate change.  President Trump has found ways to wreak havoc on our efforts to protect our planet by, in this budget, cutting climate research and protection funds to multiple departments. This isn't just the Environmental Protection Agency, but we are talking also about NASA space exploration and many other areas that ensure that we preserve this planet for the next generation.  I have got a 20-year-old, Mr.Speaker, and when I was running for Congress, he said to me: Mom, you have got to work on climate change. It is one of the most important issues facing my generation. You are the stewards of our lands. If you don't take care of this planet, then we won't have anything left and my children won't have anything left.  This is my 20-year-old son telling me this. Mr.Speaker, I promised him I would do everything I can for his generation and future generations to protect our planet.  Unfortunately, one of the biggest cuts in this budget is to the Environmental Protection This is a 32 percent cut to the Environmental Protection This decimates all of our work on climate change, all of the research that we need to do so we know how to protect our climate, all of the work on environmental justice programs, which is really essential when you think about who is taking the burden of climate change. It is our low-income communities, communities of color, and other vulnerable and marginalized communities.  I have always believed that we should rename the Environmental Protection Agency makes it sound like it is something off in the distance, like it is about something out there. But, in fact, what the Environmental Protection Agency does is monitor our water so that we have clean water to drink and use. It monitors our air so that we have clean air to breathe and we don't have asthma and other respiratory diseases that come with air that is so polluted that we can't even survive in it. It ensures that we are protecting human health.  We could rename the EPA the Agency for Clean Water, Clean Air, and Human Health, and I think that that would cover a lot of what the EPA does.  The EPA's cut is going to result in 3,200 lost jobs. That is 20 percent of the department. Research programs would be discontinued both domestically and around the world, and programs like the Clean Power Plan and numerous restoration projects, including a critical restoration project in the Puget Sound, the Puget Sound Restoration, would lose 93 percent of its funding. This is true of the Great Lakes region. There are places in Republican and Democratic districts across this country that are going to suffer and see environmental protection being rapidly undone.  President Trump has made it painfully clear that he and his administration are enemies not only of the environment, but of the science that tells us that yes, we must address climate change because it is real and it is manmade. Yet, we are fighting efforts to consistently undermine the research and the science that shows us exactly[[Page H2141]]where we are as a country and what we must do in order to protect our environment.  Let me talk about education for a second. With the appointment of Betsy DeVos to the Department of Education, President Trump has signaled that his administration has every intention of doing whatever they can to privatize our education system. The billionaire's budget takes the first steps in that process.  It increases charter school funding by $168 million and it adds $250 million to create a new, private school choice program. It cuts $3.7 billion in grants that go toward after-school programs, aid programs, and important teacher training.  This budget would decimate Head Head Start is a program that has been shown to be successful. When you invest early in kids' education and you make sure that you give them that early support, it definitely has an impact in diminishing and breaking that school-to-prison pipeline.  These are investments that save us money in the long run. Not only are they the most humane thing to do and the right thing to do, but they are actually cost-effective programs that stop us from having to spend millions of dollars down the line when people can't get a great public education.  We should be investing in our public education program and making sure that we are helping kids to go all the way from early learning to higher education. That is the foundation of a great country, when we are educating and investing in our students to have that kind of a great education.  Mr.Speaker, I see that my colleague from the Progressive Caucus is here. I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.Raskin), the wonderful Representative from that State, because I know he has got somewhere to go right after this. I invite him to come up here, and I thank him for his leadership on all issues constitutional and otherwise.

6517,topic-id,875,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Representative Raskin for his consistent brilliance and leadership. I so appreciate it. It has been a tremendous honor to serve with him here.  I want to talk about another area that we haven't covered yet, which is the State and development programs budget. This is essentially our efforts around diplomacy and development around the world. This would be incredibly hard hit. The prime target is the United Climate change initiatives at the United Nations would lose all of their funding. The government would cut back its regular contribution to the U.and pay no more than 25 percent of the cost of U.peacekeeping operations. The budget would hit all of the multilateral development banks, like the World Bank, which would be trimmed by $650 million over 3 years, and cultural programs like the East-West Center in  Today a number of Republican colleagues talked about how misguided this cut was, and it made me very hopeful, to be honest. Representatives Hal Rogers and Ted Yoho both agree that this cut is absolutely misguided.  Several retired three- and four-star generals wrote a letter to Congress expressing their deep concern over these serious budget cuts that are being made to the State Department because they know that diplomacy goes hand in hand with any kind of defense that has to be put out there. You have got to have the two together. Here is what they said: ``The State Department, USAID, Millennium Challenge Corporation, Peace Corps and other development agencies are critical to preventing conflict and reducing the need to put our men and women in uniform in harm's way.''  In 2013, General Mattis himself said that if more funding for development wasn't provided, he would have to buy more bullets. Development programs are inextricably linked with our national security, and this President should not be cutting these funds if he wants to bolster national security. If he wants to bolster national security, then we should be investing more of our dollars into diplomacy and development as two of the other legs of a three-legged stool. Unfortunately, he is going in the opposite direction.  Our aid and development efforts have to be well-rounded and holistic. I know this because I have worked in international development before all over the world. I have worked along the borders of Laos and Cambodia, in I have worked across south I have worked in Latin I know and I understand that our relationships and our ability to build[[Page H2143]]strong multilateral coalitions and to invest in the stability of countries as war is happening there is absolutely essential to preserving peace.  The generals wrote: ``We know from our service in uniform that many of the crises our nation faces do not have military solutions alone--from confronting violent extremist groups like ISIS in the Middle East and north Africa to preventing pandemics like . . .''  This 29 percent cut is absolutely unacceptable and will not keep us safe.  The billionaire's budget doesn't just cut funding for these programs, though. It also increases spending, and not for the benefit of our communities. This administration is calling for $3 billion to detain more immigrants, deport more people, and build a bigger border wall. The staggering increase to detain an unprecedented 45,700 men and women is unacceptable.  Mr.Speaker, 167 men and women have died in detention since October 2003. The organization that I used to work at put out a human rights abuses report about the detention center controlled by the GEO corporation, private detention center way back in 2005 or 2006. We looked at all of the human rights abuses that were happening not only in that detention center, but we did research on what was happening around the country.  Among the 35 death reviews in this recent report that came out that have been released through Freedom of Information Act requests, substandard medical care contributed to at least 15 deaths. And even when government investigations concluded that a facility violated government detention standards, the government fails to hold these private facilities accountable and make sure that changes are made to address deficiencies that lead to the loss of human life.  Instead of spending $3 billion on immigration enforcement and detention, here is what we could do with that money: We could create 45,000 new middle class jobs. We could build 184 new elementary schools. We could hire about 55,000 new kindergarten and elementary schoolteachers. We could provide close to 337,000 Head Start slots for young kids. We could pay for nearly 311,000 people to attend a 4-year college per year. We could help States protect and save up to 12,000 at-risk wildlife and plant species in the United States every year for the next 2.3 years. By the way, we could also provide nearly 2.1 million households with solar energy. We could weatherize over 460,000 homes nationwide, saving the average household about $283 a year. And we could provide 10 million lifesaving HIV/AIDS treatments.  Mr.Speaker, this budget is about profit over safety, privatization over public good. It is about war over peace and diplomacy. And it is about incarceration over rehabilitation. It is fundamentally about billionaires and lobbyists over the American people.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-16-pt1-PgH2139-3.txt,99999999999999,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 26, REGULATIONS FROM THE EXECUTIVE",2017.0,16.0,February
6424,topic-id,224,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to urge our new President to drain the swamp, to address his own myriad conflicts of interest. President Trump's financial disclosure stated he had a holding of at least $15,000 in Energy Transfer Partners, the lead developer on the Dakota Access We also know he has at least $100,000 invested in Phillips 66, which has a 25 percent stake in the same project. His spokesperson claims he has sold his stake, but how do we know? We still don't have his tax returns.  Additionally, news stories indicate he has a holding in TransCanada, the developer of the Keystone XL pipeline. With the White House's action to push these pipelines forward, I fear that today we have the first of many indications of impropriety and conflict of interest. Without disclosure of his tax returns, Mr.Trump's personal financial interests are a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma. They appear to compromise honorable governance with insider deals.

6491,topic-id,635,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, nearly 16 years after September 11th, our country continues to face the persistent threat of terrorism. From ISIS to al Qaeda, radical groups continue to target the United States and our way of life. Last year alone, we saw more than 131 plots by ISIS alone against the  As terrorists continue to evolve, this body must ensure that the security measures in place to protect the United States and its citizens adapt to meet these threats.  Faced with the most dangerous threat environment since 9/11, the Department of Homeland Security needs to continue to focus on its core mission of protecting Americans from these threats in an increasingly expeditious manner. I am proud that this body is working to continue to strengthen our national security by debating the bill before us today.  H.526, the Counterterrorism Advisory Board Act of 2017, will help integrate intelligence, operations, and policy decisions to ensure the Department of Homeland Security remains adaptable, while eliminating waste and duplication. This same bill was introduced last year and passed the House by overwhelming majority.  Mr.Speaker, with open investigations in all 50 States and more than 119 arrests, this body must continue to take action to protect our homeland. Further, these threats will likely expand as foreign fighters flee places like Raqqa and  Mr.Speaker, the world is witnessing the greatest convergence of radical Islamic threats in its history. More than 40,000 jihadists fighters, many of whom came from the West, have traveled to[[Page H782]]the battlefield in Syria and With this threat environment in mind, I have introduced H.526.  Initially established at the end of 2010, the Counterterrorism Advisory Board brings together the Department of Homeland Security's top echelon counterterrorism decisionmakers to quickly respond to threats.  While my colleagues and I were conducting the bipartisan Task Force on Combating Terrorists and Foreign Fighter Travel, we found that the Counterterrorism Advisory Board, or CTAB as it is referred to, had neither been codified nor had its charter kept pace with evolving terrorist threats.  That is why we need to pass this bill: to ensure that DHS is effectively integrating intelligence, operations, and policy to better compile and understand threat information to successfully fight terrorism.  This legislation formally establishes the CTAB in law and makes it the Department's central coordination body for counterterrorism activities.                              {time}  1500  The bill also updates the Board's charter to effectively respond to tomorrow's challenges and requires the Secretary to appoint a coordinator for counterterrorism to oversee the Board's activities.  Additionally, this legislation requires the CTAB to advise the Secretary of Homeland Security on the issuance of terrorism alerts, ensuring that top counterterrorism intelligence officials play a key role in developing these critical notices and providing them to the public.  Finally, this bill ensures continued congressional oversight by requiring DHS to report on the status and activities of the CTAB so that they can be certain it is meeting its mandate.  I thank Chairman McCaul from the Homeland Security Committee for appointing me to lead the bipartisan Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel last year. This task force produced 32 key findings and more than 50 recommendations, one of which serves as a basis of the legislation before us today.  I am proud to say we have now acted legislatively on more than half of the task force's findings, largely thanks to the hard work of the members of the task force and their willingness to work across the aisle in a bipartisan manner.  I also thank Mr.Thompson, my colleague in the minority, for working in a bipartisan manner on this and many other bills that we have before us today.  I will end by urging my colleagues to support this measure.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-01-31-pt1-PgH781.txt,2264,ADDITIONAL SPONSORS,2017.0,31.0,January

6448,topic-id,241,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in support of H.677, the CBRN Intelligence and Information Sharing Act of 2017.  Mr.Speaker, last Congress, the Committee on Homeland Security held several hearings to evaluate Federal, State, and local capabilities to prevent, identify, and respond to a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear attack, a CBRN threat.  Although the State and local stakeholders we heard from were generally aware of the evolving CBRN threat, there was a consistent message from everyone who testified--from public health professionals to emergency managers, to first responders--improved information sharing would make our communities safer.  H.677 would facilitate improved CBRN information sharing by directing DHS to analyze CBRN-related terrorist threats and share relevant threat information with Federal, State, and local stakeholders. These activities will both improve situational awareness at all levels of government and help DHS grant recipients better target their limited grant dollars to address this particular threat.  The CBRN Intelligence and Information Sharing Act passed the House overwhelmingly last Congress, and I urge my colleagues to support the measure once again.  Information sharing is at the core of our ability to prevent, thwart, and respond to threats posed by bad actors. H.677 would facilitate information sharing in the CBRN space where the threats are constantly evolving. This commonsense legislation costs next to nothing but will reap significant benefits.  I urge my colleagues to support H.677.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-01-31-pt1-PgH785.txt,2025,"CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2017",2017.0,31.0,January

Planned Parenthood provides a variety of preventative care, including contraception and cancer screening for millions of Americans and women in this country.  Instead of allowing Planned Parenthood to continue their important mission of providing women across the country with quality health care, Republicans have decided to jeopardize the health of millions of Americans because of a blatantly partisan witch hunt.

6422,topic-id,1346,"Mr.President, today I wish to honor the enduring legacy of a champion of education and equity in my home State of Vermont, David  For the last 16 years, Mr.David Wolk has served admirably as the president of Castleton David's retirement at the close of 2017 will leave a legacy of nearly 17 years of academic excellence, visionary leadership, and unmatched commitment to community. As the longest serving president in its history, David has led Castleton through an extraordinary transformation. David leaves Castleton as a vibrant, economic engine of the Green Mountain State and a trailblazer in inclusivity, entrepreneurship, and service learning.  Castleton students have often found a unique kinship with David, noting his frequency in the student dining halls and at student club events. As an avid fan of Castleton Spartan Athletics, David is proud of the accomplishments of the school's student-athletes. The university more than doubled its varsity sport offerings during David's tenure, enabling Vermont students to play Division III sports. The largest community investment was the development of the Spartan Arena, which is used by both the school and the community as an all-purpose community center and athletic space.  As a Rutland native, David has always felt a special connection to his hometown. As president, his focus on integrating Castleton and the surrounding community has built a lasting alliance that promises regional prosperity for years to come. Most recently, Castleton has partnered with the Rutland Economic Development Corporation to open the Castleton Downtown Office, a publicly accessible space for students and community members alike. A nexus of the downtown, this space now hosts the Center for Entrepreneurial Programs, Center for Schools, Center for Community Engagement, and the Castleton Polling David's passion for the arts has also inspired a coupling of the Castleton Downtown Art Gallery and the historic Paramount  As the needs of our students, families, and communities continue to evolve, David's legacy is his success in elevating education as a key solution to addressing our most pressing public challenges. As he transitions to his next venture, I wish David and his wife, Lyn, great success and hope they will find joy in visiting family and friends found throughout the world.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that a statement issued by Castleton University be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                      [From Castleton University]   President Wolk Announces 16th Year Will Be His Final at Castleton    Longest serving president in university history to step down in                                 December       Castleton University President Dave Wolk announced at a      campus assembly Wednesday that he will step down in December      after serving for 16 years as president. Wolk came to the      presidency in December of 2001 after intertwined careers in      education and government, and 2017 marks his 43rd year in      public service. Wolk is the longest serving president in      Castleton history by more than four years.       ``I have been blessed, more than I deserve, to have had so      many leadership opportunities over the last 43 years, and I      am especially grateful for the last 16 at Moving      on at the end of 2017 will indeed be emotionally challenging      because I absolutely love our students and staff, I am lucky      to be part of this exceptional community, and I bleed green,      full of Spartan I will be a Spartan always and      forever.''       Beginning in 2018, Wolk will begin a new startup venture,      Wolk Leadership Solutions, with his wife, The Wolks will      work with CEOs and Boards of Directors in business,      government, industry, schools, hospitals, universities and an      array of nonprofits to find solutions to leadership      challenges. The new entrepreneurial venture will specialize      in coaching leaders to achieve greater success, while      offering mediation and conflict resolution services.       ``Our goal will be to help leaders to be more successful.      We will help boards and leaders to find solutions to their      challenges, and to do so in a way that will be effective and      enduring over time through coaching and guiding change. I am      also hoping to do some teaching and writing, including      involvement in a Vermont leadership institute. Helping people      to be better at what they do has always been a passion.''       At his inauguration in the fall of 2002, Wolk addressed a      standing room only crowd[[Page S2043]]     and promised that together the Castleton community would take      action, and make history. He promised that together they      would attract high quality students, invest in their      education and in their experiences, improve their campus, and      support each other for the benefit of       During Wolk's tenure the university invested nearly $100      million in infrastructure improvements, expanded academic      offerings at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, and      expanded co-curricular activities, which has transformed what      was once considered a ``suitcase campus'' into a model for      vibrancy and engagement across the state and region.       ``Castleton has never been in better shape, thanks to      President Wolk's visionary and passionate leadership,'' said      VSC Chancellor Jeb ``People who visit the campus      for the first time in a while are amazed at the      transformation that has taken place during his tenure. It      will be impossible to replace Dave and we will miss him      greatly, but he will leave Castleton with a very strong      foundation for success into the future.''       Since 2001 Castleton has increased its enrollment by more      than 75 percent, more than doubled its athletic offerings,      built or renovated every building on campus, and expanded      into nearby Rutland to offer students better connections with      area businesses, schools, hospitals, and non-profits in an      effort to enhance the Castleton student experience. Recently,      the university has taken over operations of the Rutland      Economic Development Corporation, a partnership unlike any      other in the country, which has deepened the university's      commitment to being an economic and intellectual driver in      the community while creating strong outcomes for its      students.       In 2009 Wolk ushered in the Castleton Student Initiative, a      $25.7 million project which reinvigorated student life and      learning and changed the face of campus. The largest      investment in the history of Castleton, and the Vermont State      Colleges, it included improvements and additions to nearly      every aspect of student life including athletics, the campus      center, and the arts. The crown jewel of the project, Spartan      Stadium, is one of the finest multi-use facilities in New      England and has been central to the growth of Castleton's      athletic programs, as well as providing a venue to grow      Castleton's reach throughout the state and beyond.       Currently nearing the midpoint of the university's second      ten-year plan, the Castleton Plan, Wolk has most recently      overseen additions in graduate education, enrollment      increases, a greater presence in Rutland, and a focus on      increasing international recruitment. All of these changes      culminated in what proved to be one of the most historic days      in the institution's storied 230 year history when on July      23, 2015 the VSC Board of Trustees unanimously voted to      modernize the name to ``Castleton University.'' At the time,      Wolk said the name was both aspirational and inspirational,      as the community set forth to achieve the goals of the      Castleton       ``Dave's leadership, not just at Castleton but also among      the VSC Council of Presidents and Board of Trustees, will be      greatly missed,'' said VSC Board Chair Martha O'``He      leads with his heart, cares deeply about the state and its      students, and has positioned Castleton well for far reaching      success now and in the future which will benefit our state      for years to come. The board, and I personally, cannot thank      him enough for his private candor, public support, and      meaningful friendship.''       Wolk was born and grew up in He graduated from      Rutland High School and then Middlebury College with a degree      in political science. He earned a master's degree in      educational administration and planning at UVM and a      certificate of advanced graduate study at Harvard      During his professional career he has served as a school      principal, superintendent, Vermont's Commissioner of      Education, Vermont State Senator, and on more than 40 boards      and commissions, chairing several of them. He plans to      continue his life of public service in a variety of ways      going forward.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-28-pt1-PgS2042.txt,1383,NATIONAL AGRICULTURE DAY,2017.0,28.0,April

I met some of the most humble and compassionate people that I have ever known. I chose to serve alongside the IDF because our friends in Israel fight for the same values that we fight to protect in our country: human dignity, freedom, and liberty.  I can tell you from experience that we soldiers often label our uniforms with sentiments that are important to us. Hadar had his rifle belt embroidered[[Page H1135]]with the words ``strength and humility.'' He fought not out of hatred for his enemy but to protect his homeland and his family. He used the embroidery as a reminder that a soldier has the courage to use his weapon when needed, but even more importantly, has the humility to restrain from its use in the name of peace.  But on August 1, 2014, when Hadar was only 23 years old, he was killed by Hamas terrorists, just 2 hours after a ceasefire had been declared in the Operation Protective Edge war in Hamas terrorists maliciously dragged his body away from his home and into an underground tunnel. They stripped and left his clothing and have held his corpse ever since.

Those who have served and those families who have sacrificed beside them deserve our Nation's eternal gratitude. Since 1948, the Black Hills National Cemetery has been one way that we have shown that appreciation to them. The cemetery currently covers about 100 acres of land and is home to the Korean War Veterans Its peaceful landscape serves as the final resting place for hundreds of servicemembers and their family members.[[Page H987]]  Chief David Beautiful Bald Eagle is among the brave men and women buried here. Born in a tepee in 1919, Chief Bald Eagle served our country in World War II as a paratrooper and as one of the legendary Lakota code talkers.

He was a man who flew 400 combat missions during World War He earned numerous medals and returned to the U.S., where he eventually became wing commander of the Rapid City Air Force In 1953, that base was renamed in his honor.

On a brisk day this past December, Pennington County 4-H, the Sturgis Boy Scouts, the Veterans of Foreign Wars Auxiliary, and community members came together and placed over 1,000 wreaths on the graves of servicemembers who were laid to rest at this cemetery. They upheld the vow that those laid to rest should never be forgotten. Now we must do our part to uphold that very same vow.

At the hearing, transit operators repeatedly praised the transit security grant program, although they raised serious concerns about funding, which has decreased dramatically since its peak in 2009.

Well, let's just take this one tiny little example, then. Meals on Wheels actually serves 2.4 million Americans between the ages of 60 and 100. These are people who, for reasons of illness or physical infirmity or simply poverty, cannot go grocery shopping for themselves or prepare meals for themselves.  Why don't we take a moment to praise the people at Meals on Wheels who actually do something constructive and patriotic for their country. They bring food to older people who might otherwise go without.  You might say: Well, that is just kind of mushy-headed and soft-hearted. We are in the age of the budget ax. We need to destroy these domestic programs that are a terrible burden on the taxpayers.  Check out a 2013 review of studies on the issue of home-delivered meal programs like Meals on The study says that these programs ``significantly improve diet quality, increase nutrient intake, and reduce food insecurity and nutritional risk among participants. Other beneficial outcomes include increased socialization opportunities, improvement in dietary adherence, and higher quality of life.''  Well, maybe you don't care about any of those things. Maybe you just consider about the bottom line.  Consider this finding. These programs are aligned with the Federal cost-containment policy to rebalance long-term care away from nursing homes to home and community-based services by helping older adults maintain independence and remain in their homes and communities as their health and functioning decline.  You see, for Mr.Mulvaney and President Trump and the Cabinet of billionaires and CEOs and ethically challenged Russian-influenced corporate titans, they don't care about how the program is actually working right here in American communities.  They don't care about facts. We know they have contempt for facts, which is why they give us their alternative facts. They don't care about studies and books because we know the President is their leader and he doesn't read books.  They definitely don't care about the elderly people who can't make it to the grocery store or who can't afford nutritious meals on their own. These are the same people, after all, that they propose to throw to the curb on Medicaid, with their proposal released last week in the cloak of darkness to repeal the Affordable Care Act and gut Medicaid and replace it with a monstrosity of a program which even their own Members can't support. Under their plan, 14 million would lose their healthcare insurance. Millions of elderly people would lose their insurance.  Now, with this mean-spirited little proposal to take a relative crumb away from the community development block grant and from Meals on Wheels, they would deprive a lot of people even of a wholesome dinner delivered to their home.  Why do they want to slash all of these programs across the board: the EPA, the State Department, the Agriculture Department, the Labor Department, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Commerce Department, the Education Department, HUD, Transportation, Interior, and so on? Why?  Well, the President has announced he wants to take $54 billion out of that slice of the pie for nondefense discretionary spending, which accounts for only 16 percent of the overall budget, and put that $54 billion directly into the  Just to repeat, they want to take $54 billion out of the domestic budget, nondefense discretionary spending, and put it into the Pentagon for a military buildup.  But for what?  The world's second largest military power is We outspend them 10 to 1. We are a giant and they are a dwarf.  Vladimir Putin, in any event, is Donald Trump's best friend, his BFF, his bosom buddy. The Trump-Putin relationship may be the President's most successful long-term relationship, at least politically speaking.  All that money that goes to the Pentagon, why? What is it for? Is it possible that Mr.Bannon and Mr.Trump are thinking about a war drive?  The President has tweeted about World War III in a very cavalier and flippant way.  It is disturbing. Nobody really knows. But one thing we do know is that all of that money that goes over to the Pentagon, if history is any record, will be available for the beltway bandits, the inside players with political influence and the mega corporations to go and make a buck off of the American taxpayer.  We will strip it from the EPA, and we will strip it from the Department of State, and we will strip it from education and we will put it in the Pentagon, and that is where we know a lot of people are going to get rich.                              {time}  1900  They are going from Meals on Wheels to deals on wheels. That is the name of the game. No more Meals on It is all about deals on wheels. You have got to know the President, you have got to know the inside players in the[[Page H2142]]billionaire Cabinet, and then you can make some money.  Who are they going to sacrifice for this operation announced this week?  Well, it would take us all night to go through all of the domestic programs and projects that the American people depend on that are going to be sliced and diced because of this budget proposal, at least if it goes through.  But let's start with the National Institutes of Health, the The administration proposes to cut nearly $6 billion from the NIH--$5.8 billion they want to get rid of.  Now, what is the NIH, which happens to be in my congressional district in Rockville--and I am so proud of that--where we have got doctors and nurses and researchers and scientists who are working every day as part of the institutional world leader in biomedical research?  This is an entity that supports hundreds of thousands of jobs. These cuts would devastate the NIH and their ability to research lifesaving cures and treatments for diseases.  What kinds of diseases are being treated there?  I am not going to be able to go through all of them because there are hundreds of them that are being researched, where treatments are being developed, where patients are being seen, where progress is being made. Acute respiratory distress syndrome, Agent Orange and dioxin, aging, alcoholism, Alzheimer's disease, ALS, anorexia, anthrax, antimicrobial resistance, anxiety disorders, aphasia, arthritis, assistive technology, asthma, attention deficit disorder, autism, autoimmune disease. That is just the A's.  Let's keep going a little bit. Batten disease, biodefense, bioengineering, biotechnology, bipolar disorder, brain cancer, brain disorders, breast cancer, cancer, cannabinoid research, cardiovascular, cerebral palsy, cervical cancer, child abuse and neglect research, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, childhood leukemia, chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, climate change, climate-related exposures and conditions, colorectal cancer, and on and on. That is just the A's, the B's, and the C's.  They want to cut $6 billion from the NIH, which is working to cure, address, study, and manage the diseases and the sicknesses that our people are dealing with; and just cavalierly they say they want to slash it so they can pour all of this money over to the military side for a reason unknown.  When they came down with their executive orders, which have now been struck down by multiple Federal District Courts as unconstitutional, as a violation of the Establishment Clause, as a violation likely of due process and equal protection and so on, what they cited was 9/11 multiple times. They cited 9/11. The odd thing, though, was that the three source countries for the 9/11 hijackers--Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates--were left off their executive orders, even right up until today.  Why?  Some people say it is because Donald Trump has extensive business dealings with corporations and governments in those three countries. Nobody really knows. But they developed those orders, which the GOP proudly once called the Muslim ban, in response allegedly to 9/11. Even if you could blame an entire people for the acts of individual terrorists, they didn't do it. They turned to some other countries because that didn't interfere with the President's business interests.  So we have got this huge military buildup and we have got the siphoning away of tens of billions of dollars of the American people's hard-earned money away from medical research and diseases and environmental protection all into the For what reason, nobody knows, and they haven't told us.  What a dangerous moment this is in the life of the American What a perilous time this is for a nation built on the principle that that great Republican President Abraham Lincoln called government of the people, by the people, and for the people.  Their budget proposal is a job killer. It is going to kill hundreds of thousands of jobs. It devastates and ruins the search for cures, the progress we are making in diseases like cystic fibrosis and diabetes. Diseases that afflict hundreds of thousands, millions of our people, they are just going to pull the plug on that. They are ransacking our children's education. They are hollowing out the rural communities. They are making urban life far more dangerous. They are weakening our leadership overseas. And, of course, because they don't believe in climate change, they are undermining our ability to respond to the great peril that faces us as a people.  Just like the proposal to trash the Affordable Care Act cannot go through this body because there must be a majority of responsible Members of this body who will not accept that terrible proposal that will throw 24 million of our people off their insurance, this body also cannot accept this terrible budget. It must have arrived here  If a foreign government, a rival to America, an enemy of America, had come up with this budget, we would regard it as an act of aggression against the American people. You could view it as a declaration of war against the prosperity, the health, and the welfare of our own people. But, alas, it didn't come from abroad. At least it was addressed that it came from the White It appears to have come from the administration, yet it threatens our way of life.  I would urge all of my colleagues to very carefully study this budget proposal over the next week or two and make clear that these are not the priorities of the American people, make clear that these are not the values of the American people, and this is not the future of the American people. We must continue to make progress. That means we must reject the Trump budget.

I would like to thank President Trump for honoring the tradition of dedicating February as American Heart Month so that we may continue our fight against heart disease and heart defects as a nation.  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United Every year, one in four deaths is caused by heart disease, and approximately 40,000 babies are born in the U.with a congenital heart defect, including myself.  The good news is that heart disease can often be detected earlier and even prevented when we are proactive, make healthy choices, manage our health conditions, and keep up with our annual physicals.  Communities, health professionals, and families can work together to create opportunities for people to make healthier life choices and to lessen the stigma and fear of simply going to the doctor.  As this is American Heart Month, I encourage all Americans to use this month to raise awareness about heart disease and heart defects, and how we can prevent, treat, and cope with them, both at home and throughout our communities.  Through the support of my family and friends, the guidance of my doctors, and the grace of God, I am blessed to be standing here to support those across our Nation who are affected in some way by heart disease and heart defects.

I rise today to support this rule and to express my strong disapproval of President Obama and his administration's refusal to veto the anti-Israel resolution adopted by the United Nations Security Council on December 23, 2016.  Since its establishment, Israel has worked tirelessly to forge peace with its neighbors. They have sought neither violence nor conflict. In fact, the territories discussed in the misguided U.resolution were areas Israel gained in self-defense during the 1967 Six-Day These areas include the Old City, with the Temple Mount and Western Wall, areas that, thousands of years ago, were the origin of the Israeli culture, heritage, and religion.  Israel did not seek to take this land. Rather, when threatened by their Arab neighbors in 1967, they were forced to act in self-defense and repel these attacks. Since that time, Israel has successfully reached peaceful agreements with many of the Arab countries who, at that time, sought to wipe them off the map.  Israel is the only thriving democracy in the Middle East who practices and protects human rights regardless of ethnicity, gender, religion, or citizenship. Additionally, the State of Israel has been committed to implementing initiatives to promote economic growth in the region, including creating opportunities for Palestinians and others. Israel is a shining example of taking care of those who are around them, even as they face constant threat of violence and terrorist attacks.  I have been appalled over what has taken place under the direction of President Obama and Secretary Kerry and others within the administration. In response, I also introduced a resolution condemning these intolerable actions. By failing to direct the United States to veto the one-sided, anti-Israel U.Security Council resolution, the President turned his back on Israel and, as a result, turned his back on  The anti-Israel resolution adopted by the U.Security Council threatens peace and stability in the Middle It will most likely incentivize further violence and radical boycotts.

That is why I have come to the floor to support Chairman Royce's bipartisan resolution.  As Republicans and Democrats alike have expressed their contempt for the President's lack of action, I look forward to working with my colleagues and President-elect Trump in correcting President Obama's anti-Israeli tactics as we work to form a stronger bond with Israel and as we work to promote peace in the Middle  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr.Welch).

I rise in support of the work that the Rules Committee did for the right reason and I will yield the right results.  The American people spoke on November 8, and they asked for change, a change from business as usual. Mr.Speaker, that does mean you can look at geopolitical facts and draw a conclusion as opposed to geopolitical facts and ignore things that happen in the world, and that is exactly what we are doing here today.  The American people no longer want unelected bureaucrats promulgating rules. They no longer want Washington to be so important in their lives. They want and need to be able to have an opportunity to make their own decisions and to work well within the law. They have spoken; and they want what I believe the Republican House, the Republican Senate, and a Republican President will bring to the country. It is called accountability.  The REINS Act, sponsored by Mr.Collins today, addresses many of the issues that I just discussed. The legislation requires that a joint resolution must be approved and must be passed by both Chambers of Congress and signed by the President before any major new rule or regulation is promulgated by the executive branch before it can take place. These are rules written by the Congress, rules then associated and determined by the executive, but with the intent of Congress to make sure that the American people are not further harmed.  Now, Mr.Speaker, we have just heard an opportunity to discuss what was--this discussion that we are having about Israel and the administration. The bottom line is that the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Representative Ed Royce, came before the committee yesterday and said he really did not take issue with what they were doing. He would not support it because it did not address the problem that occurred when the Obama administration, for political purposes, hung the people of Israel and the State of Israel out for the world to condemn and take[[Page H117]]advantage of. It bypassed years and years of American foreign policy. It stunned not only Members of Congress, but it also stunned people who recognize that Israel is in a fight for their life.  Mr.Speaker, we did not, based upon the determination of the Rules Committee, make in order the bill that they had asked for. They can bring it to the floor today, and we are not going to make it available because it does not even discuss the basic facts. That is, the President of the United States unilaterally allowed the State of Israel, who is a dear friend of the United States, to be hung out in the political and the economic world and the world of foreign affairs to be tarnished and taken advantage of.  Mr.Speaker, we are here to say that we were appalled by what our government did and we are going to stand up and call it for what it is. America should always be a trusted friend to Israel, and we are doing exactly that here today.  Mr.Speaker, I predict an overwhelming vote that will take place today to enunciate what we believe is correct and also what was wrong.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  The distinguished chairman of the Rules Committee said that the American people don't want business as usual. Yet, here we are on this opening week and what we see is business as usual, more Putin-like, closed rules coming to the floor. The 113th and the 114th Congresses were the two most closed Congresses in the history of the United Here we are beginning the new session with, again, this closed process.  The Speaker, on opening day, made a promise to uphold the rights of the minority.  Well, you know what?  That means that the minority ought to be able to be heard on the House floor, that we ought to be able to bring amendments and substitutes to the floor. Yet, we get rejected time and time again.

Andersen wrote: ``He cared nothing about reviewing his soldiers, going to the theater, or taking a ride in his carriage except to show off his new clothes.''  Sound familiar--a leader so vain and insecure that those around him are afraid to challenge him? a man who thinks he is so smart that he can ignore intelligence briefings and who thinks he is so powerful that he can attack an entire religion without respecting the Constitution, consulting Congress, or even his own Cabinet?  The White House claims its ban on Muslims entering our country is about ``keeping America safe.'' Don't be fooled. It is about keeping America scared. I am not naive. There is good and evil in this world. My argument is that the administration has the two sides confused.  On Saturday, a 5-year-old Maryland boy was held for hours at the Washington Dulles International Airport while his frantic Iranian-born mother waited outside. Meanwhile, at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, alt-right provocateur Steve Bannon reassured the President that their extreme vetting was protecting us from evil.  Okay, Mr.Let's talk extreme vetting.

In Chicago, Sahar Algonaimi traveled from Syria to care for her dying mother. Despite having a valid visa, she was put back on a plane and sent home.

Since Friday, hundreds have been detained and thousands of legal residents and visa holders are in limbo overseas. ISIS is rejoicing, and American troops and travelers are in danger.  So how does the White House describe the results? `` . . . a massive success story . . . on every single level.'' If this is the Trump administration's idea of success, God help us all when they fail.  At the end of his famous story, Hans Christian Andersen's foolish emperor parades naked down the street while those around him marvel at his magnificent clothes. Andersen wrote:  ``No costume the Emperor had worn before was ever such a complete success.''  Then a child cried out: ``But he hasn't got anything on.''  We all know how the story ends.

Today I stand before you again, incredulous, angry, and sad, to say that absolutely nothing has changed.  This weekend, news broke that the Department of Defense is investigating scores of enlisted marines for compiling thousands of naked photos of other marines--servicewomen--often surreptitiously, and distributing them through Facebook and Google The site in question is called ``Marines United,'' claiming a membership of over 30,000 people.  The photos are being tightly held due to the ongoing investigation, but all indications are they are just as repulsive as what we saw 4 years ago.                              {time}  1015  The report contains samples of the comments posted about female marines, which are too obscene to read on the House floor. Online commentators also reportedly called for the rape of some of the marines portrayed in the photos, which is terrifying, given many of the women are identified by name and base.[[Page H1599]]  This is not about sex or fun or boys will be boys. This is about marines deliberately trying to degrade, humiliate, and threaten fellow marines. They encouraged stalking, distributed stolen intimate photos, and reduced their comrades to a collection of body parts.  Well, I am here to say that women marines will not be treated like sides of beef. They are warriors and should be treated as such.  As one female marine who recently completed the once male-only infantry training said: ``Right now I'm supposed to be able to trust every male marine. And with some of the stuff I see them saying about women, that's just not happening.''  This cultural rot, which has clearly regressed even further since 2013, harms our troops and our readiness. It is abundantly clear that this is not a few bad marines; rather, it is another example of a culture of rot. It is a blight that infects not just the ranks of the enlisted, but also the officer corps.  Military leadership has utterly failed in their responsibility to protect their troops, punish those involved, and uphold the professed values of the That is why the survivors of this latest atrocity did not have the confidence to notify their superiors, for fear of retribution. It took a marine veteran and blogger to blow the whistle, and for that, he has been threatened with death and his wife has been threatened with rape.  Back in 2013, then-Commandant General Amos wrote to me saying, ``We share your indignation,'' regarding deplorable images on social media that denigrate women in the United States Marine They were words--just words. I fear that military leadership will say anything to placate Congress and an outraged public, but then do nothing.  I recently had the opportunity to meet with Secretary of Defense James I found him to be engaging, thoughtful, and committed to our troops. Secretary Mattis is also a retired marine.  Secretary Mattis, I hope that you are deeply disturbed by what we are seeing within the I hope that you are listening to servicewomen like the one whose private photos were posted in the 2013 Facebook group.  One left the service in 2015, and says that just knowing her pictures are still out there has silenced her. She said: ``I wanted to be a positive influence on the community. And this diminished me. It took away everything.''  Secretary Mattis, this must change now. I call on you to hold your leadership accountable for these failures; to establish a culture of dramatic change. That means heads should roll.  Talk is cheap. Action is what is needed for the integrity of the military. Survivors must be supported.

You are going to repeal and take away the health care that I have and the patient protections that I have, and we don't even know if it will be better.  Why in the world would that be done if the new system wasn't going to be better than the old system?  Right now we don't see anything.

Unravelling and creating chaos in the health care system--no. It makes absolutely no sense, and we know that it is just going to make America sick again.  I want to share a couple of stories. First, we hear from Mary of Dundee, who owns a small business and has a 20-year-old daughter with a preexisting condition. For her, coverage--but, also, what we call the Patients' Bill of Rights--is absolutely critical. That is part of the Affordable Care Act that affects everybody with insurance. Seventy-five percent of Americans get their insurance through their employer. In the past, they could get dropped if they got sick, if they had diabetes or had a child with juvenile diabetes or had a heart condition or high blood pressure. Women who were of childbearing years could be viewed as having a preexisting condition. In the past, insurance companies had total control to decide who got coverage, when they got dropped, what would happen when you got sick and needed medical care. That changed with a Patients' Bill of Rights in the Affordable Care There are a whole range of protections to make sure the insurance you pay for every month actually provides the medical care when you need it for you and your family.  Let's start with Mary's story. She wanted to express her concern about repealing the Affordable Care Act, and I appreciate very much the fact that she shared her story with me. She says:       My family and I have purchased our coverage through the      [ACA] marketplace for 2015, 2016, and 2017. This opportunity      has allowed us to become self-employed. . . .  They could open their own business. They weren't tied to their job because of the need of health insurance. They now have opened their own small business in Dundee,       Prior to the ACA, I was working to provide coverage--  How many times have we heard that? I have heard that even in my own extended family--     then I lost my full time status and as a part-time employee,      the hours I worked barely covered my portion of my employer      provided healthcare.       By enrolling for coverage through the marketplace, I was      able to pick the coverage needed for our family at an      affordable price . . . not knowing what the future held      becoming self employed. We have three daughters. Our oldest      has life threatening allergies and asthma. I did not need to      worry that we would be denied coverage due to preexisting      conditions.       As Congress proceeds to dismantle the ACA, I am concerned      for my oldest daughter who is in her sophomore year at the      University of Michigan-She is 20 years old. . . .      Will she continue to have coverage through our insurance      until she is 26 as the ACA provides? If not, what kind of      coverage will she be able to afford due to her preexisting      conditions? Why put more obstacles in the way of our young      adults?  That is a really good question, It makes no sense to do that.  She goes on to say:       The ACA, we're sure, has faults . . . and like everything,      could be improved, but to scrap it and not use it at least as      a ``seed'' to grow and improve is beyond my understanding. To      suggest that there is nothing to keep is absurd and 20-30      million Americans enrolled . . . agree with us.  I agree with you as well, Thank you for sharing your story.  The coverage in the Affordable Care Act and the strengthening of Medicare and Medicaid are critical, as are the patient protections--the Patient Bill of Rights that affects people who buy insurance now, who finally got control[[Page S187]]back from insurance companies that made every single decision. Being able to know that, if, in fact, you get sick or your child has a serious health condition, they won't be denied care for the rest of their lives, and also being able to have them on your insurance as they start off in life--there are so many protections. The caps on treatments and the number of treatments and services provided have been eliminated. The Patients' Bill of Rights is absolutely critical.  I want to take just a moment to speak about another piece of this, which relates to the Patients' Bill of Rights as it relates to women. In the past, the majority of plans--about 70 percent of the insurance plans in the private sector that a woman might try to choose and purchase--wouldn't cover basic maternity care. I couldn't believe it when I first heard that. Wait a minute. It wouldn't cover basic maternity care? Now every plan has to cover basic maternity care. It makes sense. No longer is just being a woman a preexisting condition. That is part of the Patients' Bill of  The capacity to now get preventive care, a mammogram, cancer screenings, and other types of preventive care is done without a copay. So we want people to go and get that checkup and, if there is a problem, to be able to tackle it early. That is most important because it is better for the person, but it also means there will be less cost to the health care system if you can catch something early. So the Patients' Bill of Rights is really critical to that.  There is something else that is also in here that is appalling to me and goes directly to the question of women's health care, and that is the fact that this bill repeals Planned Parenthood services and, basically, guts health care for women across Michigan and women across the country. For 75 percent of the women who use a Planned Parenthood clinic in Michigan, their visit will be the only health care they get all year.  We have rural counties in northern Michigan where the only health care clinics doing preventive care--cancer screenings, basic services, OB/GYN visits--are the Planned Parenthood clinics. So many women across Michigan will see their access to health care denied if this passes and Planned Parenthood loses its funding. There were 71,000 patients, the majority of them women, in Michigan in 2014, who received care--breast exams, Pap smears, prenatal visits. Again, tying this all together, we want to cover maternity care, but we also want healthy moms and healthy babies, and that means prenatal care. We have communities in these small towns, as well as in the big cities. But it affects small towns and rural communities around Michigan, where women are going to be denied services, and it is the only clinic that is there.  I want to share a story from Laurie in Jonesville about the Affordable Care Act and her particular situation. She said:       I have had type I diabetes for 54 years and when I needed      to retire early at the age of 62 because of complications      related to diabetes, I looked at the ACA for health      insurance. . . . I couldn't afford       I was able to buy health insurance at what I consider an      affordable price with a small copay for my medications, the      most expensive one being insulin at a retail price of $296 a      month. As you know, my preexisting conditions of type I      diabetes, heart disease and a visual impairment, both      complications of diabetes, would have been uninsurable      without the I would have been uninsurable.  That is without the Patients' Bill of Rights, which says she has a right to be able to purchase health insurance.       In June of 2016 I was diagnosed with breast cancer, luckily      diagnosed at Stage 1 in a routine mammogram. Without the ACA      I wouldn't have been able to afford the mammogram or the      subsequent treatment without depleting our life savings. I      quickly reached my maximum out of pocket cost and while some      people would complain about having to pay that, not me! My      total bill so far is over $150,000. . . .  That is for her cancer treatment.  There is the combination here of repealing Planned Parenthood funding for health clinics that allow someone like Laurie to go in and get a mammogram rather than waiting until she has a level of breast cancer that cannot be effectively treated or might otherwise cause loss of life. She was able to catch this early because she was able to get a screening--a mammogram--the kind of treatment that women in small towns all over Michigan have the capacity to do now because of the reasonable copays for care and partly because there is no copay for that mammogram but also because they have a clinic available in their community where they can get the care. All of this fits together--the access to preventive care for women, the health care clinics that are available around Michigan and around the country, and the Patients' Bill of Rights, which says you have a right to care. This is not just about the insurance company basing every decision on the fact that they want to make more money rather than cover you. You have a right to make sure that when you get sick, you don't get dropped, and, if you have breast cancer or diabetes, you have a right to have access to affordable health care.  So I would hope that our colleagues would join together, stop this craziness of trying to repeal health reform and protections for every single American, and, instead, sit down together and look at how we can make it better.  Our Republican colleagues will find willing partners in making the system more affordable and better, but we will continue to be the strongest possible opponents of ripping the system apart and creating chaos for American families.

6465,topic-id,996,"Mr.President, last week the Senate began consideration of the ObamaCare repeal resolution, which is the first step in the process of repealing the law. It is time for repeal.  Seven years ago, ObamaCare was sold to the American people with a lot of promises. The law was going to reduce premiums for families. It was going to fix problems with our health care system without hurting anyone who was happy with their health coverage. If you like your health plan, you will be able to keep it, people all across this country were told over and over again. If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor--also a promise and claim that was made over and over again. As everyone knows, every one of these promises was broken. Premiums for families have continued to rise. Millions of Americans lost health care plans that they liked. Americans regularly discovered that they couldn't keep their doctors and that choice of replacement was often limited.  These broken promises were just the tip of the iceberg. The law hasn't just failed to live up to its promises, it is actively collapsing, and the status quo is unsustainable. Premiums on the exchanges are soaring. Deductibles regularly run into the thousands of dollars. For 2017, the average deductible for a bronze-level ObamaCare plan is rising from $5,731 to $6,092. With deductibles like that, it is no wonder that some Americans can't afford to actually use their ObamaCare insurance.  I receive a lot of mail from constituents in my State struggling to pay for their health care. One constituent contacted me to say: ``My ObamaCare premium went up from $1,080 per month to $1,775 per month,'' a 64-percent increase, $21,300 a year for health insurance. Let me just repeat that, a 64-percent increase in premiums, $21,300 a year for health insurance. That is like paying another mortgage. That is a lot more than many people pay for their mortgage, and of course that is before any deductibles or other out-of-pocket costs are considered.  Another constituent wrote to tell me, ``Today I received a new premium notice from my ObamaCare insurance. My policy rate for myself, my wife and my teenage son has increased by 357 percent.''  The problems on the exchanges aren't limited to soaring costs, unfortunately. Insurers are pulling out of the exchanges right and left. Health care choices are rapidly dwindling. Narrow provider networks are the order of the day. One-third of American counties have just one choice of health insurer on their exchange.  This is not the health care reform the American people were looking for.[[Page S185]]So it is no surprise that a recent Gallup poll found that 80 percent of Americans want major changes to ObamaCare or want the law entirely repealed and replaced or that 74 percent of American voters ranked health care as a very important voting issue for them in the 2016 elections. ObamaCare has not fixed our Nation's health care problems. It has made them worse. The American people deserve better.  Last week, the Senate started considering the ObamaCare repeal resolution, and we are continuing that process this week. This resolution will provide us with the tools we need to repeal the law, and then committees will get to work on the actual repeal bills. Then we will work step-by-step to replace ObamaCare with real health care reform that focuses on personalized, patient-centered care.  One massive problem with ObamaCare is the fact that it puts Washington in charge of health care decisions that should be made at a much lower level. The ObamaCare reform the Republicans pass will focus on fixing this. We are going to move control from Washington and give it back to States and the individuals. Health care issues don't have one size-fits-all solutions. It is time to stop acting like they do.  States should have the power to innovate and embrace health care solutions that work for the individuals and the employers of their Individuals should be able to make health care decisions in consultation with their doctors, not with Washington, Another thing we are going to focus on is breaking down the ObamaCare barriers that have artificially restricted choice.  As I said earlier, ObamaCare has defaulted to a one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to health care, and that means that many Americans have found themselves paying for health care they don't need or want. We need much more flexibility in insurance plans. A thriving health care system would offer a wide variety of choices that would allow Americans to pick a plan tailored to their needs, that would be a competitive system that gives people in this country more choices, and inevitably what happens in those circumstances, that pushes the cost down.  We also need to give Americans the tools to better manage their health care and control costs. Of course, any reform plan has to make sure small businesses have the tools they need to provide the employees with affordable health coverage. ObamaCare has placed huge burdens on small businesses that have made it difficult for them to thrive and even to survive. It is time to lift these burdens and free up these businesses to grow and create jobs.  Our health care system wasn't perfect before We all acknowledge that, but ObamaCare was not the answer. Instead of fixing the problems in our health care system, it just made things worse. Republicans are ready to implement the kind of health care reform the American people are looking for: more affordable, more personal, more flexible health care coverage that meets their needs and is less bureaucratic.  The American people are ready for health care reform that actually works, and that is exactly what Republicans are going to give them starting right now.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

6528,topic-id,350,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I want to say to Mr.Ross, my friend, I agree with just about every single thing you say about the great State of Israel, but I disagree with you about this resolution. Let me explain why.  Israel is a Jewish democratic state. It has been our strong ally. We have supported it through thick and thin, most recently with a $38 billion appropriation for their security over the next 10 years. I supported that. But this question that we face fundamentally comes down to whether we are going to support a two-state solution or move toward a one-state solution.  The bottom line here is that settlement activity, every settlement that is made--600,000 settlers living in the West Bank and Jerusalem--makes it ever-more difficult to achieve that two-state solution.  President Obama, in his abstention on that veto, was acknowledging what has been the policy of this country. Ronald Reagan was opposed to settlements. You know, you get a family that settles anywhere, but in the West Bank, they put down roots. They are good people. They have a belief that the West Bank belongs Biblically to That is their view. Many politicians, including Netanyahu, appear to be embracing that. That is not the international position. It is not the unified position in Many folks in Israel think the settlements are a threat to the possibility of achieving the secure borders and the security of Israel and the maintenance of it as a democratic Jewish state.  Mr.Speaker, there is another issue. With 600,000 settlers, with 4.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank and also living in the State of Israel and 6.5 million Jewish members of the State of Israel, the demographics, long term, are going to reach a tipping point where there could be more Arab voters than there are Jewish voters, and then the State of Israel will have to make the decision Jewish or democratic. I want the State of Israel to continue to be that Jewish and democratic state that it is, and that is why I oppose this resolution.
