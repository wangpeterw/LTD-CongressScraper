                      STEPHANIE CHANEY AND THE ACA

  (Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, well, here we are, on 
International Women's Day, 7 years from when we started the Affordable 
Care Act, 60 votes to repeal behind us, and yet only this week we have 
had the big reveal of what the plan will be for replacement. What are 
we seeing? We don't have any cost information, but we know we are going 
to protect wealthy insurance executives, and we know that an estimated 
15 to 20 million Americans will have their health insurance ripped away 
from them.
  Let me introduce you to one who is concerned about her ongoing 
coverage. Her name is Stephanie Chaney, and she is from my district in 
Framingham, Massachusetts. She is a recent grad student at Lesley 
University, where she studied to be a clinical counselor and dance 
therapist. She was diagnosed with a rare and extremely painful joint 
disease, and because of the ACA, she got the treatment she needed.
  Because she was a student and not employed, the healthcare law and 
the changes we make are going to have a direct impact on her life. She 
worries that if she cannot find another affordable plan, she will have 
to start over again. Let's think of her and do the right thing by 
Americans with their health care.
