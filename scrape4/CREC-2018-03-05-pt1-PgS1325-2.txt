                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Almighty God, the sovereign Lord of nations, empower our lawmakers to 
be as faithful to others as You have been to them. May they be willing 
to show patience in dealing with the shortcomings of others in the same 
way that You have shown them mercy and long-suffering. Lord, help them 
to seek to respect the beliefs and ideas of others, being tolerant even 
to those with whom they may disagree. Give them the wisdom to refuse to 
do to others what they would not want done to themselves.
  Lord, we commit this day to You, totally desiring to work for Your 
glory.
  We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen.
