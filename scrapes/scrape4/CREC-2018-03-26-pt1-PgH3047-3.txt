                                 PRAYER

  Reverend John Vidal, St. Luke's Catholic Church, Washington, D.C., 
offered the following prayer:
  O God, the fountain of wisdom, whose will is good and gracious and 
whose law is truth, we beseech Thee so to guide and bless our 
Representatives in Congress here assembled, that they may enact such 
laws as shall please Thee to the glory of Thy name and the welfare of 
this people. Through Jesus Christ our Lord I pray.
  Amen.
