                      WE MUST FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE

  (Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, in 2017 alone, there 
were 16 extreme weather and climate events that devastated the United 
States and its territories, including Hurricane Harvey, which ravaged 
my great State of Texas and brought Houston's third 500-year flood in 3 
years. Since 2006, the contiguous U.S. has experienced five of the 
warmest years on record. Year after year, new temperature and weather 
severity records are broken.
  As researchers attempt to answer why this is occurring, it has become 
clear that there is a link between the severity of these events and 
human-caused climate change. Last year, in a study published by Nature 
magazine, scientists concluded that the frequency of extreme weather 
events in the Northern Hemisphere were amplified by anthropogenic 
climate change.
  It is time to face the fact that climate change is real and admit 
that we are directly contributing to it. We must continue to find 
innovative ways to address this challenge before it is too late.
  I will continue to speak out in support of all research that furthers 
our understanding of our planet's climate and helps identify ways of 
reducing the harmful impacts on it.
