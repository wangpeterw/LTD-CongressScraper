           WE NEED FAIR AND STRONG HURRICANE RELIEF PACKAGES

  (Ms. MOORE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to highlight the continuing urgency of 
providing relief and recovery aid for Puerto Rico and the Virgin 
Islands, which were devastated by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. While U.S. 
efforts have ramped up after a failed initial response, we can and must 
do more.
  In Puerto Rico, some 70 shelters remain open, access to safe drinking 
water is a problem, and there are dozens of waterborne disease deaths. 
Nearly a third of hospitals are still running off generators, bridges 
remain destroyed, and many roads remain impassable. Nearly 60 percent 
of the island is without power.
  The news is not better for the Virgin Islands, where many still lack 
access to cell service, power, and clean water. Officials estimate $5.5 
billion is needed for the most essential needs there.
  Mr. Speaker, there are less than 20 legislative days left on the 
House calendar. How can we be prioritizing tax cuts for the wealthy? 
Let's put together fair and strong hurricane relief packages for 
communities ravaged by these hurricanes, including those in Puerto Rico 
and the Virgin Islands.
